KNICKS' MAGIC ONCE AGAIN DEFEATS PACERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Larry Johnson was loitering on the perimeter, all
alone again. And as soon as Latrell Sprewell discovered him,
Johnson fielded the pass and unleashed a spinning 3-pointer that
stirred up echoes for the Pacers in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre was unfolding all over again. As Johnson's shot
neared the rim, Patrick Ewing inexplicably appeared to tap the ball
in as it fell into the net. But no official waved it off; there was
only the sight of the blood rushing from the face of Pacers Coach
Larry Bird one more time at Madison Square Garden on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a rewind of the Eastern Conference finals last
spring when Johnson devastated the Pacers with a 3-point shot that
was turned into a 4-point four-leaf clover on an official's
questionable call. Now this? Now a no-call?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Patrick touched it, but then he said he did,''
said Johnson, whose aim looked good with 21.7 seconds left on a
play that gave the Knicks a 2-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was coy, saying he ``couldn't remember'' what happened on
Johnson's shot and just rejoiced in the jumper he could recall.
After Reggie Miller tied the score with two free throws, Ewing took
the chance to puncture the spirits of the Pacers all over again.
</P>
<P>
   On a play that was designed for Allan Houston, Ewing ended up
with the ball in his hands with 5 seconds on the clock. He grabbed
the ball with two hands, felt Dale Davis on his back and then spun
toward the baseline for a fade-away jumper. From 11 feet, from the
fingertips of the 37-year-old, from memory, he put down the
game-winning shot with 2 seconds left to give the Knicks an 83-81
jab at the Pacers. Instead of embarrassment for Ewing, there was
elation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a good spot on the floor,'' said Ewing, who finished
with 20 points. ``I was able to hit my patented shot.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one last attempt by the Pacers. But just 24 hours
after Tim Hardaway blindly heaved up a game-winner at the buzzer in
Miami, Miller's fling from the top of the key to win the game fell
off the back of the rim. This time, the Knicks held off a rival
bent on putting a dent in their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game about your mentality,'' Houston said. ``It's
about how you respond. We found a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers couldn't believe they lost. After the game, the
official Joe Crawford watched the replay of Johnson's shot and
acknowledged that the crew should have called offensive
goal-tending call on Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing right there and had a better view,'' Bird said.
``It has happened to us before. You have to accept it and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will take it. They won despite the Pacers'
aggressiveness. Indiana went to the free-throw line 24 times while
the Knicks went 7 times. The Knicks did hold the Pacers to 38
percent shooting from the field and received a 20-point boost from
Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   The victory did not do much to help the Knicks in the Eastern
Conference standing. Although the Heat lost on Monday night, the
Knicks are two games behind Miami for the second seeding with five
games remaining. Miami also holds the tie breaker if the two end
with identical records.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy had his concerns about how his team would
respond on Monday night after losing on Hardaway's heave Sunday in
Miami. The team flew back into New York around 1 a.m. on Monday,
knowing that its chance of catching the second-seeded Heat was
fading. Not only did the Knicks leave Miami trailing the Heat by
three games, but they had lost any tie breaker by dropping the
season series, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that ball going in Sunday night, it made those two teams
virtually uncatchable unless Indiana and Miami fall flat on their
face,'' Van Gundy said before Monday night's game. ``But that
should do nothing to deter us from our long-term goal. The excuses
are there if we want to give in to them. This is when mental
toughness is tested. We can list the excuses: hangover after last
night, playing our fourth game in five nights, and Miami and
Indiana are uncatchable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did not look uninterested. Their usual 1,000-watt
jolt, Sprewell, got the Knicks going in the right direction when he
took a Mark Jackson turnover down the court for a dramatic
two-handed dunk in the opening two minutes of the game. Sprewell
then came up with another steal and drive to the basket on his way
to 10 first-quarter points.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he baited Jalen Rose, the Pacers' most versatile
weapon, into three quick fouls in a 22-second span near the
four-minute mark of the first quarter. At that point, the Pacers
were slipping into the abyss, down by 20-12. But the familiar
military cut of Chris Mullin appeared and began to frustrate
Sprewell with his perimeter offense.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, along with Travis Best, started an 11-3 run that
resulted in the Pacers' taking over the lead, 35-34, with 5:44 left
in the second quarter. Suddenly, the Knicks were not getting back
in transition, Houston was in a 2-for-8 start from the field, they
were getting beaten to the boards and they turned the ball over
twice in a 30-second span.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, Van Gundy sent Ewing back into the game after a
five-minute break to restore some size and order. Sprewell also
returned after a quick rest, and the Knicks were back on their way.
An 8-3 run that helped give the Knicks a 44-40 lead at the half.

RANGERS' ENIGMA IS MENTAL WITH YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates is direct, blunt and honest.
</P>
<P>
   He offers no excuses or long-winded explanations. He doesn't
sugarcoat anything. The Rangers' main problem against the New York
Yankees, Oates said, is mental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things, but first of all, you have to
believe you can win,'' Oates said. ``I don't think we're dealing
with anything physical. I think we have enough talent to be on the
same field with them. Certainly, they have a great ballclub and
play very well. But I think what we're dealing with here is more
mental than physical.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers are dealing with is complete domination by the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   They are 19-38 against New York since the start of the 1996
season, including a 1-9 record in three division playoff series
losses, the last two in which they've scored a total of two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' mission is to either change that or consign
themselves to being perennial doormats to the best team in
baseball. Since owner Tom Hicks has made it clear he has no
interest in such a distinction, this could be as good a time as any
to get it turned around. The Rangers are scheduled to play the
Yankees tomorrow in New York's home opener, postponed from today
because of a forecast calling for rain and cold. It will be the
first meeting between the teams since last year's divisional
playoff sweep by New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting,'' shortstop Royce Clayton said.
``It's not us against them or anything like that. It's just a good
test for this team, a series against the best team in the world.
I'd like to see how we stack up against them.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been good lately, in the regular season or the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have been swept in three consecutive games by the
Yankees in the division playoffs in each of the past two seasons.
The Rangers' flop last year was enough to convince Hicks and
general manager Doug Melvin it was time to change things. Melvin
started the makeover by trading two-time Most Valuable Player Juan
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers outfielder Chad Curtis was with the Yankees both years
and admitted his old teammates were a little surprised how
thoroughly the Rangers were dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into the series both years with a lot of respect for
what the Rangers had done, but also confident based on what we had
done,'' Curtis said. ``But once they were down 2-0, you could look
across the field and see they weren't sure they knew what they had
run into.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Rangers had run into superior pitching. The
Rangers hit .152 last year in the playoffs and .140 the year
before, mind-boggling numbers considering how good their offense
was during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But second baseman Luis Alicea said the Rangers had the wrong
approach offensively and must change to beat the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play the little man's game,'' Alicea said. ``We
can't be trying to hit home runs. Get guys over, take a walk,
instead of swinging at pitches out of the strike zone, which is
what we've been doing. They're not going to give Raffy \RPalmeiro\S
or Pudge \RRodriguez\S anything good to hit, so take the walk and
let the other guy do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the Yankees do. Watch them. They battle and battle
every at-bat, take what the pitcher is giving them. They don't try
to hit home runs. If they do, it's because they're strong and
they're good hitters. But hitter after hitter, they just battle. We
can do the exact same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rusty Greer, ``The offense just hasn't done what it's
capable of in the past two playoffs. Other than that, we've played
pretty well. The pitching has been good, and the defense has been
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get frustrated when you lose to a particular team. We have
great respect for what they've accomplished and what they continue
to accomplish. But the way we have to look at it is that any team
we play is more than beatable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are hardly the only team that has trouble with the
Yankees. Over the past four years the Yankees have averaged 100
victories a season and are 35-10 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure every team is asking the same question: Can we beat
the Yankees?'' Palmeiro said. ``Right now, they're the team ahead
of the pack. Eventually some team will beat them. Hopefully it will
be us, or it will another team and we'll beat that team.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some hope this season. The Yankees' starting rotation,
especially David Cone and Roger Clemens, is a little older and less
effective. There is also the hope that the loss of Curtis, Chili
Davis, Tim Raines, Joe Girardi and Darryl Strawberry will take
something away from the fabulous depth the Yankees have enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers also know they could win both games at Yankee
Stadium this week and still have it mean nothing in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have won the World Series three of the last four
years,'' Curtis said. ``They know what games are important and what
series is big. If they got swept by a team during the regular
season, come the end of the year and the playoffs, I don't think it
would mean that much.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least it would be a start. nn

ALABAMA'S SAMUELS CONFIDENT HE'S THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 PREVIEW-OFFENSIVE LINE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NFL scouts are unanimous in ranking Alabama's Chris Samuels as
the prize offensive lineman in Saturday's draft. But if there still
is any doubt, ask Samuels his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare when you get a good left tackle, and I'm very
good,'' said Samuels, who can't recall the last time he allowed a
sack.
</P>
<P>
   Samuels, a 6-foot-5, 322-pounder, has an ego to match his build.
That's one reason the Washington Redskins, who have the second and
third choices, have fallen in love with him.
</P>
<P>
   They also like the way he plays the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``On game day, the intensity level I carry is so high,'' Samuels
said. ``I want to rip somebody's head off. When I get out on the
field, I'm motivated to dominate a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question about Samuels is the health of his right knee,
which was injured in the season opener when Alabama running back
Shaun Alexander fell on him. Samuels had arthroscopic knee surgery
late last season, forcing him to miss the Orange Bowl after 42
consecutive starts for the Crimson Tide. He also sat out the Senior
Bowl and the NFL combine workouts, but he since has run a 5.12 in
the 40-yard dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the combine, everyone felt it was routine,'' Redskins coach
Norv Turner said. ``The way he was moving, you sure couldn't tell
he had a bad knee.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuels was a receiver in the eighth grade and a backup
quarterback as a high school freshman. Then, he had a growth spurt.
He weighed 240 as a sophomore and 260 as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I kept my quick feet,'' said Samuels, who wears a size 15
shoe. ``I would run with the linebackers \Rat Alabama\S a lot of
times, and I beat a lot of the linebackers in the footwork drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could have played a lot of positions _ tight end,
defensive end. I know I can play tight end. There's no doubt about
it. They could have put me at fullback. I could have done it all.''

IS A FLIP OF THE SWITCH ENOUGH FOR THE STARS?
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Due to zero options, the Stars have to say what
they do say. And Mike Modano says it best, with his prediction of
``now we flip the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   He means, of course, that emotional/energy switch. It goes from
``off'' to ``on.'' And with this, the defending Stanley Cup champs
will suddenly reinvent themselves, fueled once again by the playoff
passion of 12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the common and constant theme yesterday at the Stars'
Valley Ranch bunker, with coach Ken Hitchcock, while very
optimistic, noting that ``a big gray area'' will exist when the
postseason is launched tomorrow night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock is wondering what kind of ``gear'' the Stars will come
with in the first-round opener against Edmonton's them-again
Oilers. ``Why do we even have the regular season?'' asked Modano.
``Why don't we take off those seven months, then show up in April
and play Edmonton?''
</P>
<P>
   It is the third time in four years the Stars have opened the
playoffs against the Oilers, and the fourth consecutive year
they've met in the postseason. But this first-round encounter is
not necessarily about the opposition _ until late Sunday night it
was sure to be San Jose. Instead, the focus will center on a local
search for something lost. Something that was so prevalent with the
Stars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I noticed it today,'' said Brett Hull after yesterday's
optional practice. ``It's felt different on the ice. The enthusiasm
and the electricity was there. This comes with the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it really work this way in pro sports? Can a team go
winless in the last eight days of the regular season (two ties in
five games), and then immediately locate the ``on'' switch? In
general, the answer is no. But while the Stars have to publicly say
otherwise, do they really believe that stuff?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe it,'' said Modano, ``more so now than ever,
because we have been there, we have won \Rthe Stanley Cup\S and we
have a first-hand knowledge of all the different circumstances that
come into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything we've gone through this season with injuries,
to still end up with 100 points and in first place, I think we
surprised ourselves in doing this well. But we know what we're
playing for. It wasn't about the last week. It's about right now. I
believe we will flip that switch now that the playoffs are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the regular season, getting a playoff read on the Stars
is murky at best. The off-season was very short, so much so the
Stars came back in October and went through several months of
appearing disinterested and fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-driving Hitch seemed dismayed, but a clearing-of-the-air
locker room session between the second and third periods in Atlanta
in late November jumped started the club. For awhile, the Stars
seemed back on track, but ...
</P>
<P>
   The injuries to key people kept coming, and coming, and,
frankly, that's what ``the big gray area'' is all about for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The glass is half-full if you believe, based on the severe
nature of the injuries, that the ``real'' Stars will finally
surface in the playoffs, even with a still-ailing Sergei Zubov
questionable for the Edmonton series. The glass if half-empty if
you believe championships in pro sports are normally won by teams
that have few regular-season distractions, including injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the X-factor is what happened over the final eight days of
the regular season _ playoff momentum did build in those five
games, except in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Which prompted an old NHL hand like Kirk Muller to hark back to
the Stanley Cup championship club he played on in Montreal. ``In
1993, we lost eight of the final 10 regular-season games,'' said
Muller. ``Having been though that, which was worse than this, I've
got no concern, because so much depends on the makeup of your team.
With the veterans here, everyone knows how to prepare for what's
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a Hull, who gave a confused look yesterday when the
subject of lost momentum kept coming up. ``It's irrelevant,'' he
said. ``Building momentum starts right now. Now is when we've got
to start putting together wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton has served as a postseason momentum builder for the
Stars. Since the Oilers shocking first-round upset three years ago,
the Stars have won eight of nine from Edmonton in the playoffs. But
it hasn't been dominance by any means. The norm is very physical,
punishing one-goal victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we won games because we flat outplayed teams,''
said Hitchcock. ``This year we've won at times because we've
outmanuevered teams. Starting right now, we've got to rediscover
last year's gear.''
</P>
<P>
   And also discover that ``switch,'' then flip it. If, of course,
there actually is one. nn

STARS HAVE LEHTINEN BACK, BUT CAN HE BE EFFECTIVE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars didn't know how much they missed Jere
Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   Until he came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things that you forget about, that he does so well,
they come back,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``He makes
everybody around him better.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the Lehtinen who creates the space allowing Brett Hull
to poke in the Stanley Cup-winning goal. This is the Lehtinen who
hangs back so Joe Nieuwendyk can cheat in for one more shot, and
win the Conn Smythe trophy. This is the tireless Lehtinen who is so
boundless, he pulls his linemates along with him as he moves up and
down the ice in a seven-game series against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But is this the Lehtinen who is back after missing 65 of the
Stars 82 regular-season games?
</P>
<P>
   That answer might just go a long way in answering another: Can
they repeat?
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough for Lehtinen to just be playing. He has to be
the player who kills penalties, who prevents odd-man rushes and
neutralizes an opponents' best offensive threat.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he has to be himself.
</P>
<P>
   If he is, he could be the key to the Stars repeating as Stanley
Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't expect too much,'' said Lehtinen, who played Sunday for
the first time since re-injuring his right ankle Jan. 19. ``It's
been like three months since I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was 81 days.
</P>
<P>
   But, who's counting? Well, the Stars for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a comfortable feeling when Lehtinen is on the ice for
us,'' Hitchcock said. ``He makes everybody around him better.''
</P>
<P>
   Who else was counting? Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough and frustrating,'' he said. ``It's been a long
season even though I haven't played. It's not normal yet, but it
will be there in a little while. The main thing is that it's strong
enough it's not going \Rto break\S again. The more I play, the
better I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time this season he's testing that theory.
The first time he came back after missing 30 games and returned
Dec. 29. The ankle wasn't ready. He played in eight games before a
second operation was required, this one to set pins in the bone to
stabilize the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   He missed 35 more games before playing in the regular-season
final against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first period I was a little nervous to go in there,''
Lehtinen said. ``I was thinking, `What's going to happen?', but
during the game it was more normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial reports from Lehitnen read as follows: 13 minutes
and 41 seconds, 18 shifts, four shots, two hits, one block, a
plus-one rank against the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same as it was before, so that's good,'' he said
with a smile and a shrug. ``It's been so long, and I don't want to
hurt it again. We have to take it a little easier than the first
time. We want to make sure it's strong enough to play.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lehtinen's mind, the question of the ankle's stability is
answered: It's going to hold. After all the time he spent
rehabbing, it better be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets that one game in and everybody is like, `wow,'''
defenseman Brad Lukowich said. ``He raised the confidence of the
team. A lot of the guys work around him and what he does on the
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how quickly will he regain his back-to-back
Selke-winning form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy injury for hockey. He will probably start off
a little slow and work his way back,'' said winger Kirk Muller, who
suffered a similar injury when a puck bounced off his ankle when he
was playing for Florida. ``Mine didn't break, but it took about a
year to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is trying to keep it up strength wise. I would
play for a couple of periods, and it would get weak and tired.
Hopefully, it can stay strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen was still suffering from some soreness and did not
attend yesterday's optional skate. But, with the playoffs beginning
tomorrow night, stealing time for extra rest might be harder than
returning from the injury itself.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Hitchcock trying to get a feel for how effective
Lehtinen can be while juggling lines to put him on. Does he play
with Brett Hull and Joe Nieuwendyk? Does he play with the checking
line of Guy Carbonneau and Mike Keane?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll upgrade him again and see how he feels, see how many
minutes we can get out of him,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think a lot of
his game will be based on how many minutes we think he can play.
For us to be effective, Lehtinen has to get further up the line.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the details. A Jere Lehtinen at 70 or 80 percent is
better than most defenders at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A two-time Selke winner? You want him in your lineup,''
Nieuwendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   He's in. This time, Lehtinen hopes, for good.

ZUBOV'S CONDITION STILL UNCERTAIN

 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov said yesterday
that his slightly torn MCL feels ``not bad,'' but he didn't know
when he'd be able to return to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Zubov said. ``As soon as I can play, I'll be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said yesterday he doesn't expect Zubov
back for either Game 1 or 2 of their first-round playoff series
against Edmonton but is hopeful that Zubov could be ready in time
for Game 3 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov will be evaluated today to see if there's any progress. He
tore the right medial collateral ligament in his right knee March
29 against Florida and was expected to miss 2-4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been feeling really strong and was really excited to get
\Rthe playoffs\S going,'' Zubov said. ``It's been very
frustrating.'' MOMENTUM OVERRATED?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 0-3-2-1 in their past five games, matching their
longest winless streak of the season. For a team out to repeat as
Stanley Cup champions, the Stars don't put little stock in how they
finished the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's irrelevant,'' Brett Hull said. ``We didn't play
that well last year going in. A couple of bad games at the end of
the season isn't going to stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were 3-2 in their last five regular-season games last
season, losing their final two. Even Ken Hitchcock seems a bit
sympathetic about the team's lack of motivation down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we clinched the Pacific, our physical play dropped
off,'' Hitchcock said. ``You would like to be playing better. I
would like to see our impact players have better performances. But,
there is no point in fighting that fight.'' nn

FOR COWBOYS, SECOND IS OFTEN FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ To most Americans, there's a stigma attached to
being second, especially in the world of sports, where being second
often is synonymous with being a loser.
</P>
<P>
   To Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, a second-round pick, the team's
only selection over the first three rounds of this weekend's NFL
draft, is synonymous with getting a player who can immediately help
the Cowboys win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get a starter,'' Jones said yesterday as the Cowboys
continued their evaluation meetings. ``I expect nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys don't have a selection until the second round, 49th
overall, because they traded their first-round picks in 2000 and
2001 to Seattle for big-play wide receiver Joey Galloway. Moreover,
the Cowboys don't have a third-round pick this year because they
traded that to Seattle a year ago for wide receiver James McKnight,
who spent all last season on injured reserve after major knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to death with Galloway and McKnight,'' Jones
said. ``As for our second-round pick, I'm hoping that Larry Allen
will be there for us again. That would be a player who we have
slotted to go in the first round ... who falls to us in the second
round. That's what we're really hoping for.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the draft is such an inexact science, there are examples
of ``first-round'' values in the second round of almost every NFL
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 46th selection overall from Sonoma State, was such a pick
for the Cowboys in 1994. He has gone to the Pro Bowl, as well as
made All-Pro, each of his past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the least action \Rfive picks over seven
rounds\S we've had in any draft since I've owned the Cowboys,''
Jones said. ``In that sense, it's going to be a little strange for
us ... but we're going to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys used the 49th pick in 1996 to take Georgia
linebacker Randall Godfrey, who became a three-year starter and the
team's leading tackle in the middle last season, before signing
with the Tennessee Titans as a unrestricted free agent. Godfrey was
lured away by a five-year, $25-million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second round has been good to us,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys used their past two drafts to land offensive linemen
with second-round picks: Flozell Adams, a starter now at left
tackle, and Solomon Page, who will compete this summer for a
starting job at right guard. Adams was the 38th pick overall in the
'98 draft; Page, 55th overall in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Darren Woodson, a five-time Pro Bowler, was a
second-round pick in '92 (37th overall); but wide receiver Jimmy
Smith (36th overall), whom the Cowboys picked in '92 but let get
away when Smith broke his leg as a rookie and underwent an
appendectomy as a second-year player, might have been a bigger
second-round steal. Now with Jacksonville, Smith led the NFL with
116 catches last season.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the Cowboys' Ring of Honor, safety Mel Renfro was
a second-round pick in 1964. Because there were only 14 teams in
the NFL then, Renfro was the 18th selection overall _ the highest
pick spent by the Cowboys on a defensive back until Kevin Smith
(first round, 17th overall) 28 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also have done well when they've traded away their
second-round pick, as they did in 1963 to Chicago to acquire
linebacker Chuck Howley, another Ring of Honor member, and in 1997
in a trade with Detroit to drop down into the third round to take
linebacker Dexter Coakley, now a Pro Bowler, plus get an extra pick
in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everything has worked out perfectly for the
Cowboys among their second-round picks. In 1995, a blocking tight
end named Kendall Watkins (59th overall) blew out his knee in a
preseason game during his second season and was never a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, fullback Daryl Johnston (39th overall in '89) and
linebacker Ken Norton, Jr., (41st overall in '88) were part of the
Cowboys' Super Bowl landscape during the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The message is clear: If you're holding a second-round pick in
the NFL, be patient and stick to your guns. Remember that in 1991,
Dan McGwire and Todd Marinovich were first-round selections, 16th
and 24th overall, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre was taken in the same draft by Atlanta in the second
round, 33rd overall.
PAST 49s
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the past 10 players selected 49th overall in the
NFL draft are still in the league, and only two of them are
starters. Here is the rundown: Year Name Position Drafted by
Comment 1999 Joe Montgomery RB Giants Led Giants in rushing (348)
as rookie backup. 1998 Kenny Mixon DE Miami Lost starting job with
Dolphins in '99. 1997 Torrian Gray DB Minnesota Used by Vikes
strictly in nickel packages. 1996 Randall Godfrey LB Dallas Signed
$25 million deal with Tennessee Titans. 1995 Barret Robbins C L.A.
Raiders Ex-TCU Horned Frog now a Raiders starter. 1994 Toby Wright
DB L.A. Rams Out of the league. 1993 Roosevelt Potts RB Colts Last
carry was in '98, cut by Dolphins in '99. 1992 Troy Auzenne OT
Chicago Out of the league. 1991 Chris Zorich DT Chicago Out of the
league 1990 Pat Terrell DB Philadelphia Out of the league.
WHOM WILL THE COWBOYS TAKE?

MANY FACTORS INVOLVED IN HORSE RACING SCHEDULING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ When the thoroughbred season starts
Thursday at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie, Larry Craft is in
charge of the racing schedule. His title is director of racing, and
he formulates the races that determine which horses compete against
each other every day at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved with the schedule-making of other sports have the
same goal as Craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we come up with our home football schedule, we try to
create a balance where it's competitive for our team and enjoyable
for our season-ticket holders,'' said Jack Hesselbrock, associate
athletic director for internal operations at TCU. ``We try to have
a marquee non-conference home game every year. We had Oklahoma two
years ago and Arizona last year. In future years we'll have
Northwestern and Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   If full fields of horses are any judge, Lone Star's races have
been competitive. According to Lexington, Ky.-based Equibase, Inc.,
the official statistics keeper for horse racing, Lone Star led the
nation in field size the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been some marquee events. When former Kentucky
Derby winner Real Quiet raced at Lone Star last year, attendance
hit 21,000. The average attendance last year was 9,370.
</P>
<P>
   Craft writes the conditions _ the parameters of competition _
for all of Lone Star's races. There will be close to 400 by
season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to satisfy three constituents,'' Texas Thoroughbred
Association executive director Dave Hooper said. ``No. 1, he's got
to put on a good show for the public. No. 2, he's responsible to
management at the track, which is looking for full fields and
maximized handle \Rbetting\S. And third is the horsemen \Strainers
and owners\S. He's got to put on the type of race that fits the
stock stabled at his track.''
</P>
<P>
   Craft has been writing races since 1977 when he became racing
secretary at what is now Philadelphia Park. He later held the
position at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., before coming to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 1,400 horses stabled at Lone Star. To keep
track of their racing status, Craft writes information about horses
into grids on a sheet about two feet square in size. That two-foot
square sheet folds out like an accordion to about five feet long.
And there are at least two other accordion-like grid sheets
depending on the age of the horses Craft is tracking.
</P>
<P>
   Other than stakes races, there's no set schedule that dictates
the day-to-day racing for the entire season at Lone Star. Instead,
Craft develops the information off the grids into a condition book
that's written and rewritten at least five times throughout the
73-date season. One condition book has the schedule for about 15
days of racing.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Craft said he hopes he can write the book in such a way
to please everyone. The condition book is circulated in the barn
area, and the trainers find the events that suit their horses'
ability and enter them 48 hours prior to the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``All horses on the grounds, or most horses, will have a race in
which they can run in that book,'' Craft said. ``You try to put all
the horses you have into groups. You're writing races for groups of
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups are dictated by the age of the horse, class levels of
competition, the distances horses are judged best suited to run,
gender and surface (dirt track or the turf course).
</P>
<P>
   In terms of age, 2-year-olds always race against 2-year-olds.
For about half of the year, 3-year-olds race against other
3-year-olds. As the season progresses, 3-year-olds will race
against older horses. Males almost always race against males, and
females almost always against females.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing can be compared to football again when it comes to
class levels of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL grew unhappy with its scheduling system of rotating
opponents each year after the 1977 season because, according to the
NFL's ``Record &AMP; Fact Book,'' the formula ``often resulted in
competitive imbalances.''
</P>
<P>
   So the league changed to a formula that determined the schedule
according to the final regular-season standings from the previous
season. Teams that finish first in their division must play the
other first-place teams within their own conference from the
previous season. Likewise, a last-place team gets the other two
last-place teams within the conference.
</P>
<P>
   It's produced longshot Super Bowl contestants the past two
seasons, including champion St. Louis this year. The Rams went from
worst to first in the NFC West en route to the title.
</P>
<P>
   In horse racing, horses who have never won compete in maiden
races. Once they win, they can advance up the competition ladder to
allowance races. If those events prove too tough for the horse, a
trainer can enter into claiming races. Stakes races are the highest
levels of competition at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming races usually aren't as tough as allowance races, but
there is a trade-off. To get into the easier race, a trainer and
owner risk losing the horse through the claiming process. That's
when another owner purchases the horse out of the race for a set
price. It's horse racing's equivalent of the waiver wire in other
sports.
</P>
<P>
   As in other sports, not everyone is pleased with the schedule.
Craft admits that he hears it from trainers when they don't get the
race to fit their horse. They're often looking for the easiest
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a racing secretary's job is to make it as competitive as
possible,'' Hooper said. ``They've always got people coming in and
complaining or making a request. Not everyone is going to be
comfortable in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of blaming the schedulemaker extends to horse racing.

HISTORIAN DETAILS UGLY CHAPTER OF RACISM AND INNOCENT YOUNG
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY MOIVING IN THE ``E'' AND ``L'' CATEGORIES.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades before political scandals cast a shadow over Arizona at
the end of the 20th century, a series of events in Clifton-Morenci
wrote an ugly chapter of state's history at the beginning of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chapter full of racism, anti-Catholic bigotry and
orphans dickered over like dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1980s and 1990s saw a governor deposed, a governor
indicted and stat legislators drawing up plans to secede from the
Union, no less shameful was the nasty tug of war that ensued over
40 homeless children sent west from New York in hopes of finding
new families.
</P>
<P>
   To officials of the New York Foundling Hospital, their plan
seemed simple: Place orphans with good Catholic families in the
wide-open spaces of the Arizon territory.
</P>
<P>
   How naive.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice and politics proved insurmountable barriers between
the fair-skinned Irish foundlings and their would-be foster
parents, all of whom happened to be Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the territory's quest for statehood was
driving citizens to prove their American patriotism and resist
efforts to form one large state with the territory of New Mexico,
which had a higher percentage of Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors converged in an episode that still causes
pain in the adjoining mining communities of Clifton and Morenci in
southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   University of Wisconsin historian Linda Gordon has chronicled
these events in a her book, ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction''
(Harvard University Press, 1999), a work rich in detail about the
town and the scandal that pitted Anglo residents against their
Mexican-American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Principal players were two nuns and a placement officer from the
New York orphanage, representatives of the local Catholic diocese,
Mexican families eage to adopt the orphans, White residents of
Clifton and Morenci bent on halting the adoptions and officials of
the Phelps Dodge Corp., whose economic caste system helped to
reinforce the notion that Mexican workers were inferior to Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   The story in ``Orphan Abduction'' is played out against the
backdrop of racial bia often tolerated in turn-of-the-century
America. Race meant not only Black and White, but also Irish,
German, Italian, Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we call such divisions ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon opens her story on a night in October 1904 as a posse
arrives at the home of Margarita Chacon to demand the return of two
fair-haired orphans recently placed with Senora Chacon and her
husband, Cornelio.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, the Chacons would be only one of
many couples forced to surrender children promised to them by the
New York orphanage and their own parish priest, Constant Mandin.
</P>
<P>
   Father Mandin saw his Mexican parishioners as good Catholics
willing to take in foundlings. Anglos saw them as brown-skinned
kidnappers unfit to raise White children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AN EASTERN SOLUTION  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children had come west on one of the celebrated orphan
trains operating in Eastern cities concerned with a growing
population of homeless children and street urchins.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, some children found loving new families. Some
found themselves valued only as unpaid farm labor.
</P>
<P>
   In Clifton-Morenci, a handful found homes, and a few were given
away as ``gifts,'' but the social climate prevented a generally
positive outcome. Most of the New York orphans reboarded their
train and were sent back for re-distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by a strike and a devastating flood in 1905 _ events
coincidenta lly repeated in 1983 _ the residents of Clifton-Morenci
were left with wounds slow to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose academic specialty is women, families and labor
issues, discovered the orphan saga while reading histories of labor
disputes, in which the actions of Phelps Dodge are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there were kids in this piqued my interest,''
Gordon said while vacationing in Portland., Ore., and on leave from
UW to teach at New York University. ``I came to understand the
story more and more as I went along ... I thought it was an amazing
story.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was intrigued by the racial aspect of a story that
involved not Blacks and Whites but ``Anglos,'' as she calls them in
the book, and ``Mexicans,'' as Mexican-Americans were known at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began her research in 1994 and finished the book in 1998.
She made three trips to Clifton-Morenci during that time to
interview elderly residents and glean a sense of what the
communities were like 90 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Not all residents welcomed her inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Festering wounds had reopened during the strike of 1983, when
the communities once again split along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The strike destroyed once-thriving Clifton, Gordon said. Phelps
Dodge fired its protesters and replaced them with strike-breakers.
The town's young people moved away. Senior workers retired. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ANGRY COMMUNITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when Gordon arrived with pen in hand, some
residents refused to be interviewed. Even when she explained that
her interest was the 1905 orphan incident, conversations invariably
returned to the 1983 strike and the pain it had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some people opened up. One of Gordon's best sources was
the venerable Al Fernandez, a former mayor of Clifton and renowned
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to talk and had great stories,'' Gordon said of the
man who died in December at age 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, Catholic Church officials, eager to expose what they
believed had been an episode of anti-Catholic bigotry, made church
archives readily available.
</P>
<P>
   And in Phoenix, Gordon found a historian's pot of gold: complete
transcripts from a state Supreme Court trial whose verdict had
upheld taking the orphans from their Mexican foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, even the attorneys for the Foundling Hospital
had ``concede'' that Mexican homes were inferior to those of Anglos
and probably unsuitable for White children.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexicans had been called as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Gordon pieced together the strange story. When the
train from New York pulled into the Clifton station on the evening
of Oct. 1, 1904, and unloaded its cargo of 40 weary children, Anglo
residents took notice.
</P>
<P>
   Where had these children come from, and where were they going?
</P>
<P>
   To their dismay, they discovered that the youngsters were
heading for their new homes. Mexican homes.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated both by prejudice and a sincere sense of concern for
motherless children, a group of Anglos, mostly women, began to
protest the placeme nt of the orphans. They and their husbands,
many armed with rifles, threatened Father Mandin, the sisters, the
placement officer, the bishop from Tucson and Mexican parents who
had the audacity to take the children into their homes and hearts.
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HUMAN MERCHANDISE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anglos demanded that they be given the ``babies''as they fought
over the human merchandise like bargains at a rummage sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me,'' Gordon said of that chapter in her
research.
</P>
<P>
   With courts as high as the U.S. Supreme Court siding with the
vigilantes, the nuns eventually were forced to back down. One rainy
night, the Mexican families were ordered to turn over the children
to waiting Anglos. Fifteen of the orphans went to Anglo homes in
Clifton and Morenci. One child was sent to a Los Angeles family as
a ``gift'' from one of the law-enforcement officers. The rest were
returned to New York and found homes in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexican family was allowed to keep a child.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said she believes that Phelps Dodge helped foster the
prejudice that divided Mexicans from Anglos. Looking at blueprints
of company housing, she found that ``Americans'' had been assigned
homes with running water and flushing toilets, while the Mexicans'
accommodations were more primitive. The copper company rationalized
the disparity, she said, by asserting that Mexicans were used to
such conditions and aspired to nothing more. In truth, Mexicans
were upwardly mobile and sought parity with their Anglo neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Subjugating the Mexicans became a self-fulfilling prophecy as
poverty equated with inferiority and, in the case of the orphans,
immorality. Anglos hurled slurs at the foster parents, accusing
them of keeping dirty homes (untrue), being prostitutes (untrue)
and being prone to drink (Anglos ran the saloons).
</P>
<P>
   Although bigotry against minority laborers reared its head in
other pa rts of the country - Chinese workers often were vilified
on the West Coast - ``it became more deeply entrenched'' in
Clifton-Morenci, Gordon said.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MISGUIDED INTENTIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is not entirely unsympathetic to the Anglo women who took
back the orphans. Given the tenor of the times, they truly believed
that Anglo children belonged in Anglo homes and needed to be
``rescued '' from the clutches of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't always know their own motives,'' Gordon
speculates.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the officials of the New York Foundling Hospital
might not have fully understood the racial implications of their
proposal or exactly what the term ``Mexican'' meant. They knew the
Southwesterners as ``Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Gordon fault the nuns who buckled at the threat of
a well -aimed Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect them to be heroes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction'' could be used in
high school and university history courses, its target audience is
a broad one, Gordon said. Anyone interested in history or in the
``true crime'' genre will find it absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said her book, already in its second printing, has
received good reviews from critics, and she finds that rewarding,
but she added that her favo rite reviews have come from former
residents of Clifton-Morenci.
</P>
<P>
   In their letters, she said, they tell her, ``You got it just
right.'' &QL;

HISTORIAN DETAILS UGLY CHAPTER OF RACISM AND INNOCENT YOUNG
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY MOIVING IN THE ``E'' AND ``L'' CATEGORIES.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades before political scandals cast a shadow over Arizona at
the end of the 20th century, a series of events in Clifton-Morenci
wrote an ugly chapter of state's history at the beginning of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chapter full of racism, anti-Catholic bigotry and
orphans dickered over like dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1980s and 1990s saw a governor deposed, a governor
indicted and stat legislators drawing up plans to secede from the
Union, no less shameful was the nasty tug of war that ensued over
40 homeless children sent west from New York in hopes of finding
new families.
</P>
<P>
   To officials of the New York Foundling Hospital, their plan
seemed simple: Place orphans with good Catholic families in the
wide-open spaces of the Arizon territory.
</P>
<P>
   How naive.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice and politics proved insurmountable barriers between
the fair-skinned Irish foundlings and their would-be foster
parents, all of whom happened to be Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the territory's quest for statehood was
driving citizens to prove their American patriotism and resist
efforts to form one large state with the territory of New Mexico,
which had a higher percentage of Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors converged in an episode that still causes
pain in the adjoining mining communities of Clifton and Morenci in
southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   University of Wisconsin historian Linda Gordon has chronicled
these events in a her book, ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction''
(Harvard University Press, 1999), a work rich in detail about the
town and the scandal that pitted Anglo residents against their
Mexican-American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Principal players were two nuns and a placement officer from the
New York orphanage, representatives of the local Catholic diocese,
Mexican families eage to adopt the orphans, White residents of
Clifton and Morenci bent on halting the adoptions and officials of
the Phelps Dodge Corp., whose economic caste system helped to
reinforce the notion that Mexican workers were inferior to Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   The story in ``Orphan Abduction'' is played out against the
backdrop of racial bia often tolerated in turn-of-the-century
America. Race meant not only Black and White, but also Irish,
German, Italian, Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we call such divisions ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon opens her story on a night in October 1904 as a posse
arrives at the home of Margarita Chacon to demand the return of two
fair-haired orphans recently placed with Senora Chacon and her
husband, Cornelio.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, the Chacons would be only one of
many couples forced to surrender children promised to them by the
New York orphanage and their own parish priest, Constant Mandin.
</P>
<P>
   Father Mandin saw his Mexican parishioners as good Catholics
willing to take in foundlings. Anglos saw them as brown-skinned
kidnappers unfit to raise White children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AN EASTERN SOLUTION  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children had come west on one of the celebrated orphan
trains operating in Eastern cities concerned with a growing
population of homeless children and street urchins.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, some children found loving new families. Some
found themselves valued only as unpaid farm labor.
</P>
<P>
   In Clifton-Morenci, a handful found homes, and a few were given
away as ``gifts,'' but the social climate prevented a generally
positive outcome. Most of the New York orphans reboarded their
train and were sent back for re-distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by a strike and a devastating flood in 1905 _ events
coincidenta lly repeated in 1983 _ the residents of Clifton-Morenci
were left with wounds slow to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose academic specialty is women, families and labor
issues, discovered the orphan saga while reading histories of labor
disputes, in which the actions of Phelps Dodge are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there were kids in this piqued my interest,''
Gordon said while vacationing in Portland., Ore., and on leave from
UW to teach at New York University. ``I came to understand the
story more and more as I went along ... I thought it was an amazing
story.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was intrigued by the racial aspect of a story that
involved not Blacks and Whites but ``Anglos,'' as she calls them in
the book, and ``Mexicans,'' as Mexican-Americans were known at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began her research in 1994 and finished the book in 1998.
She made three trips to Clifton-Morenci during that time to
interview elderly residents and glean a sense of what the
communities were like 90 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Not all residents welcomed her inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Festering wounds had reopened during the strike of 1983, when
the communities once again split along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The strike destroyed once-thriving Clifton, Gordon said. Phelps
Dodge fired its protesters and replaced them with strike-breakers.
The town's young people moved away. Senior workers retired. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ANGRY COMMUNITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when Gordon arrived with pen in hand, some
residents refused to be interviewed. Even when she explained that
her interest was the 1905 orphan incident, conversations invariably
returned to the 1983 strike and the pain it had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some people opened up. One of Gordon's best sources was
the venerable Al Fernandez, a former mayor of Clifton and renowned
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to talk and had great stories,'' Gordon said of the
man who died in December at age 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, Catholic Church officials, eager to expose what they
believed had been an episode of anti-Catholic bigotry, made church
archives readily available.
</P>
<P>
   And in Phoenix, Gordon found a historian's pot of gold: complete
transcripts from a state Supreme Court trial whose verdict had
upheld taking the orphans from their Mexican foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, even the attorneys for the Foundling Hospital
had ``concede'' that Mexican homes were inferior to those of Anglos
and probably unsuitable for White children.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexicans had been called as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Gordon pieced together the strange story. When the
train from New York pulled into the Clifton station on the evening
of Oct. 1, 1904, and unloaded its cargo of 40 weary children, Anglo
residents took notice.
</P>
<P>
   Where had these children come from, and where were they going?
</P>
<P>
   To their dismay, they discovered that the youngsters were
heading for their new homes. Mexican homes.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated both by prejudice and a sincere sense of concern for
motherless children, a group of Anglos, mostly women, began to
protest the placeme nt of the orphans. They and their husbands,
many armed with rifles, threatened Father Mandin, the sisters, the
placement officer, the bishop from Tucson and Mexican parents who
had the audacity to take the children into their homes and hearts.
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HUMAN MERCHANDISE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anglos demanded that they be given the ``babies''as they fought
over the human merchandise like bargains at a rummage sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me,'' Gordon said of that chapter in her
research.
</P>
<P>
   With courts as high as the U.S. Supreme Court siding with the
vigilantes, the nuns eventually were forced to back down. One rainy
night, the Mexican families were ordered to turn over the children
to waiting Anglos. Fifteen of the orphans went to Anglo homes in
Clifton and Morenci. One child was sent to a Los Angeles family as
a ``gift'' from one of the law-enforcement officers. The rest were
returned to New York and found homes in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexican family was allowed to keep a child.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said she believes that Phelps Dodge helped foster the
prejudice that divided Mexicans from Anglos. Looking at blueprints
of company housing, she found that ``Americans'' had been assigned
homes with running water and flushing toilets, while the Mexicans'
accommodations were more primitive. The copper company rationalized
the disparity, she said, by asserting that Mexicans were used to
such conditions and aspired to nothing more. In truth, Mexicans
were upwardly mobile and sought parity with their Anglo neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Subjugating the Mexicans became a self-fulfilling prophecy as
poverty equated with inferiority and, in the case of the orphans,
immorality. Anglos hurled slurs at the foster parents, accusing
them of keeping dirty homes (untrue), being prostitutes (untrue)
and being prone to drink (Anglos ran the saloons).
</P>
<P>
   Although bigotry against minority laborers reared its head in
other pa rts of the country - Chinese workers often were vilified
on the West Coast - ``it became more deeply entrenched'' in
Clifton-Morenci, Gordon said.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MISGUIDED INTENTIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is not entirely unsympathetic to the Anglo women who took
back the orphans. Given the tenor of the times, they truly believed
that Anglo children belonged in Anglo homes and needed to be
``rescued '' from the clutches of foreigners.

DISPUTE BREWS ON SUNSET STRIP AS BEER AD RISES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ West Hollywood, this beer's for you.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to remove a landmark, 100-foot-high Marlboro Man
billboard on the Sunset Strip last year, the Philip Morris Co.
plans to erect a new ad that some say is just as politically
incorrect: a 95-foot tall, three-dimensional Miller beer bottle,
complete with a cap that pops and spouts steam.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has ignited a bitter debate over land use policy,
alcohol abuse and whether the cigarette maker is toasting West
Hollywood or striking back at tobacco opponents who brought down
the Marlboro Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, this is a satirical thrust at the anti-smoking
people,'' said UCLA art history professor Al Boime, who has studied
outdoor art and advertising in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to imagine a huge bottle like that _ it's insulting and I
think undignified even in the Sunset area.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agree, including West Hollywood officials and
anti-drunk-driving advocates who oppose replacing one
vice-glorifying billboard with another. They argue that outdoor
alcohol ads tend to lure underage drinkers _ just as tobacco
billboards allegedly lured young smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing when there's such a serious problem with
alcoholism in America _ and driving under the influence and binge
drinking on college and high school campuses,'' said Tina Pasco,
director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Los Angeles. ``There's a
real lack, I feel, of moral responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Miller Brewing, a Philip Morris subsidiary, said
they do not market to underage drinkers and they encourage the use
of designated drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miller is committed to marketing its products responsibly to
adult consumers, 21 and over,'' said Miller spokesman Ron Acosta.
</P>
<P>
   He said the bottle will likely display the company's ``Think
When You Drink'' slogan. The company is also running at least two
television ads that support the use of designated drivers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the old Marlboro Man site is a prime spot for
advertising and that the beer ad is not meant as a negative message
to West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the premier locations in the country,'' Acosta
said. ``It's a high-visibility location. West Hollywood is a place
where a lot of tourists and consumers go for enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years, the rugged Marlboro cowboy stood guard over Sunset
Boulevard, king of the Strip's billboard jungle and a cultural icon
of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than just an advertisement for cigarettes; it was a
nostalgic symbol of the wild, untamed West, said Ken Breisch,
director of the Historic Preservation Program at the University of
Southern California's architecture school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of image that Marlboro wanted to create of the West
is perhaps what made people associate it with Los Angeles,''
Breisch said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco industry's $206 billion litigation settlement
with 46 states forced Philip Morris to take the Marlboro billboard
down in April 1999. Under the settlement, the state Department of
Health Services was allowed for a limited time to put up a figure
some nicknamed ``Impotent Man'' _ basically a parody of the macho
cowboy with a limp cigarette illustrating a danger of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Now the state's time has expired, and Philip Morris has use of
the site back.
</P>
<P>
   West Hollywood City Councilman Paul Koretz is upset but feels he
can't oppose this sign unless the city passes a wholesale ban on
alcohol billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly happy that the Marlboro Man was replaced
by a beer icon,'' Koretz said. ``But I also feel, since we don't
have any kind of law against it, that we don't have any
justification under the First Amendment to pick that particular one
and say we don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The design submitted to the city indicates the bottle itself
will be about 60 feet tall and 16 feet wide, on a 35-foot stand,
according to Lisa Heep, West Hollywood's planning manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cap will move up and down and liquid is going to bubble
out of the top,'' Heep said.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta would not confirm the sign's details because the company
is still finalizing the design, so the final product could end up
being different.
</P>
<P>
   Boime believes the sign is Marlboro's revenge _ and a way to
reassert its corporate manhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the anti-smoking symbol of the Impotent Man, we now
replace it with this huge phallic symbol of the beer bottle,''
Boime said.
</P>
<P>
   West Hollywood regulations, which encourage creative billboards
on the Sunset Strip, allow the city planning staff to approve them
without public input.
</P>
<P>
   West Hollywood Planning Commissioner John Altschul is appealing
the staff's decision in this case, saying that while he doesn't
object to the content, it deserves a public hearing. In response,
Miller has challenged his right to file an appeal, an issue that
will be heard by the City Council on Monday, according to Heep.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Koretz tried to get the West Hollywood City Council to
pass a ban on alcohol and tobacco billboards on the Strip. He said
he succeeded on the tobacco issue, passing an ordinance that forced
the Marlboro Man to come down only a few weeks before the national
settlement had the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there was too much resistance at the time from other council
members and the business community to pass an alcohol ad ban,
Koretz said, and he doubts such an attempt would be successful now.

MPAA EYES CHINA MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Carrying Hollywood's hopes to tap into the huge
market in China, the head of the Motion Picture Association of
America said he will urge the Senate on Tuesday to pass a sweeping
trade pact to build theaters and screen 50 films a year there.
</P>
<P>
   MPAA President Jack Valenti said passage of permanent normal
trade relations (PNTR) could quintuple the number of American films
shown to China's 1.2 billion people, cut tariffs and foster joint
development of theaters and distribution ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tremendous opportunities in China,'' said Valenti, who
has been Hollywood's point man in Washington since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be the losers if we exclude China from full trading
status and let other countries take advantage of those
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing pent-up demand for movie theaters in China, Valenti said
there is now only one screen per 122,000 people, compared with one
for every 8,600 people in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The MPAA's member companies are The Walt Disney Co., Sony
Pictures Entertainment, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures,
Twentieth Century Fox Film, Universal Studios and Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti will make his pitch Tuesday before the Senate Commerce
Committee, chaired by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The pact has wide
bipartisan support in the Senate, but faces an uncertain future in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to affecting the movie industry, the measure would
give China the same low-tariff access to U.S. markets enjoyed by
nearly all other U.S. trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents include organized labor and human rights activists who
want the United States to continue to review China's trade status
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an irrevocable step,'' said Thea Lee, assistant
director of public policy for the AFL-CIO in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we give China PNTR, we can't turn around and change our
mind or take action if China violates agreements or workers'
rights. We need to withhold PNTR and keep the current system. It
gives us more flexibility and leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valenti said China's vast potential for growth and profits
presents tremendous financial opportunity for Hollywood, which
depends on foreign operations for 48 percent of its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, movie makers and studios received only $20 million
from operations in China, he said. By comparison, the U.S. box
office took in a record $7.5 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's tentative China deals include an increase in the
annual quota on foreign films from 10 to 50 over three years.
China's quota has been frozen at 10 since 1995, a year after ``The
Fugitive'' became the first U.S. movie legally shown in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. film producers have averaged eight films per year under the
quota.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have also tentatively agreed to permit foreign
investment and profit sharing in joint video distribution ventures
and to lift their ban on cinema ownership. American and other
foreign firms would be allowed to own up to 49 percent of companies
that build, own or operate movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Also, China would lower tariffs on films from 9 percent to 5
percent and the tariff on home videos from 15 percent to 10
percent. It would also agree to step up its crackdown on video
piracy and other copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   China has agreed to the pact, which was announced in November by
U.S. trade envoys, contingent on congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The House has scheduled a May 22 vote on the measure, which is
backed by the Clinton administration and business interests. The
Senate has not yet scheduled its vote.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few Southland House and Senate members have announced
their stands on the China trade issue.
</P>
<P>
   Solid supporters of giving PNTR to China include Sen. Dianne
Feinstein and Rep. David Dreier, R-Covina. Reps. Howard P. ``Buck''
McKeon, R-Santa Clarita; James Rogan, R-Pasadena; and Jerry Lewis,
R-Redlands; have said they are leaning toward a yes vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Baca, D-Rialto, has weighed in with a no vote, arguing
that PNTR will hurt American workers by exporting more jobs
overseas. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, is also opposed to
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Undecided lawmakers include Sen. Barbara Boxer, and Reps. Grace
Napolitano, D-Montebello; and Stephen Horn, R-Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti, who has made four trips to China in the past two years
to work on copyright issues, said Chinese officials ``fulfilled all
the pledges they made'' to fight piracy, including the permanent
shutdown of 79 pirate video plants since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's Lee is less enthusiastic about China's record and
argues that granting PNTR will send the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be saying that all of past flouting of the rules was
acceptable, that all the repression of trade unions and workers'
rights and the piracy was OK,'' she said.

<P>
   Valenti will make his pitch Tuesday before the Senate Commerce
Committee, chaired by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The pact has wide
bipartisan support in the Senate, but faces an uncertain future in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to affecting the movie industry, the measure would
give China the same low-tariff access to U.S. markets enjoyed by
nearly all other U.S. trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents include organized labor and human rights activists who
want the United States to continue to review China's trade status
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an irrevocable step,'' said Thea Lee, assistant
director of public policy for the AFL-CIO in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we give China PNTR, we can't turn around and change our
mind or take action if China violates agreements or workers'
rights. We need to withhold PNTR and keep the current system. It
gives us more flexibility and leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valenti said China's vast potential for growth and profits
presents tremendous financial opportunity for Hollywood, which
depends on foreign operations for 48 percent of its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, movie makers and studios received only $20 million
from operations in China, he said. By comparison, the U.S. box
office took in a record $7.5 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's tentative China deals include an increase in the
annual quota on foreign films from 10 to 50 over three years.
China's quota has been frozen at 10 since 1995, a year after ``The
Fugitive'' became the first U.S. movie legally shown in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. film producers have averaged eight films per year under the
quota.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have also tentatively agreed to permit foreign
investment and profit sharing in joint video distribution ventures
and to lift their ban on cinema ownership. American and other
foreign firms would be allowed to own up to 49 percent of companies
that build, own or operate movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Also, China would lower tariffs on films from 9 percent to 5
percent and the tariff on home videos from 15 percent to 10
percent. It would also agree to step up its crackdown on video
piracy and other copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   China has agreed to the pact, which was announced in November by
U.S. trade envoys, contingent on congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The House has scheduled a May 22 vote on the measure, which is
backed by the Clinton administration and business interests. The
Senate has not yet scheduled its vote.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few Southland House and Senate members have announced
their stands on the China trade issue.
</P>
<P>
   Solid supporters of giving PNTR to China include Sen. Dianne
Feinstein and Rep. David Dreier, R-Covina. Reps. Howard P. ``Buck''
McKeon, R-Santa Clarita; James Rogan, R-Pasadena; and Jerry Lewis,
R-Redlands; have said they are leaning toward a yes vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Baca, D-Rialto, has weighed in with a no vote, arguing
that PNTR will hurt American workers by exporting more jobs
overseas. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, is also opposed to
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Undecided lawmakers include Sen. Barbara Boxer, and Reps. Grace
Napolitano, D-Montebello; and Stephen Horn, R-Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti, who has made four trips to China in the past two years
to work on copyright issues, said Chinese officials ``fulfilled all
the pledges they made'' to fight piracy, including the permanent
shutdown of 79 pirate video plants since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's Lee is less enthusiastic about China's record and
argues that granting PNTR will send the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be saying that all of past flouting of the rules was
acceptable, that all the repression of trade unions and workers'
rights and the piracy was OK,'' she said.

<P>
   EUROPE-SHOCK-TV (Hilversum, the Netherlands) _ Oprah Winfrey
dropped out of shock television long ago. Maury Povich migrated
from audience shoutfests to the million-dollar-quiz biz. Even Fox
TV was shaken enough by the fallout from ``Who Wants to Marry a
Millionaire?'' to quash a plan to crash a jet into the desert for
prime time entertainment. But the European producer John de Mol is
serenely undeterred. Witness his latest brainstorm, ``Chains of
Love,'' a post-millenial evolution of ``The Dating Game'' in which
contestants compete for a date while chained together for up to
five days in handcuffs and ankle irons. By Edmund L. Andrews.

   ZIMBABWE-LAND (Chegutu, Zimbabwe) _ About 4,500 white farmers
own more than half of Zimbabwe's fertile farms, including more than
2 million acres of fallow land that Western donors agree could be
better used by peasant farmers. But despite repeated threats over
the past 20 years, the government has never seized any property
without paying for it, land experts and commercial farmers say. By
Rachel Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-NEIGHBORHOODS (Shenyang, China) _ For urban Chinese who
are middle-aged and beyond, the old ``neighborhood committees''
that watched over every household are among the more obnoxious
memories of the early decades of Communist rule. Staffed, as lore
has it, by one's nosiest neighbors, the committees were empowered
to scrutinize every visitor, report every antisocial activity and
even monitor pregnancies. On the more positive side, they also
sorted out neighborly disputes, watched out for burglars or fallen
power lines, and sometimes even ran convenient food shops. Over the
last 20 years, with the decline of Marxist fervor and the emergence
of a more diverse society, the committees waned but they never
quite disappeared. Now, with experiments here and 19 other cities,
the government is trying to reinvent this venerable institution,
replacing the legendary ``seven grannies with eight teeth between
them'' with more professional, somewhat younger staffs that can
link up citizens up with vital social services. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   IMF-SECURITY (Washington) _ A law enforcement armada from a
half-dozen city and federal agencies is preparing for mass rallies
here this week as organizers try to extend the protest against
global economics that plunged Seattle into violent street
confrontations in November. City officials are emphasizing the
city's openness to peaceful protest while also preparing for the
civil disobedience that some demonstrators have threatened as they
vow to disrupt meetings of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund. By Francis X. Clines.

<P>
   RAMPAGE-KILLERS-III (Salt Lake City) _ Of the 100 episodes of
rampage killings examined for this series by The New York Times,
none better illustrates than the case of Lisa Duy just how
difficult it can be to enforce a key provision of the nation's
fundamental gun control law. That provision prohibits people who
have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions from
buying a handgun. But laws in most states guard the privacy of the
mentally ill, so gun background checks typically fail to turn up
mental health histories. By Fox Butterfield.

<P>
   NY-LOBBY (Albany, N.Y.) _ In flush times, the Legislature has
become a leaner place, and partisan politics is only partly to
blame. Stung by embarrassing revelations that Philip Morris treated
scores of lawmakers last year, and then underreported the expense,
the Republican-controlled Senate adopted a voluntary ban on free
meals with lobbyists and gifts over $25. The Democratic-led
assembly refused to go along, although 10 of its members have
individually pledged to abide by the ban. Now the shrinking
waistlines are just one indication that a deeply entrenched
lobbying culture has begun to change. By Winnie Hu.

   DISABLED-STUDENTS (Undated) _ Mark Breimhorst cannot take tests
the way other students do: He has no hands. So when he was applying
to business schools in 1998, Breimhorst received permission from
the Educational Testing Service to take the Graduate Management
Admissions Test on a computer with a trackball, and was given 25
percent more time to accommodate his disability. Under the
longstanding policy of the testing service, his results were mailed
out with the notation, ``Scores Obtained Under Special
Conditions.'' Breimhorst, a 29-year-old graduate of Stanford
University, was not admitted to business school. Now, in a federal
lawsuit that could affect hundreds of thousands of students with
disabilities, he is challenging the way the testing service flags
the scores of students who use accommodations to take the exams.
The lawsuit asserts that such flagging is a kind of scarlet letter.

   TEXAS-BUSH-HEALTH (Undated) _ Texas has had one of the nation's
worst public health records for decades. More than a quarter of its
citizens have no health insurance. The state ranks near the top in
the nation in rates of AIDS, diabetes, tuberculosis and teen-age
pregnancy, and near the bottom in immunizations, mammograms and
access to physicians. But since George W. Bush became governor in
1995, he has not made health a priority, his aides acknowledge. He
has never made a speech on the subject, his press office says. But
with health care near the top of the election agenda, Bush _
starting on Tuesday with a speech in Cleveland _ will begin
discussing insurance and other health issues. By Adam Clymer.

   MARINE-PLANE-CRASH _ The V-22 Osprey is a classic case of a
military program that wouldn't be stopped. The crash of an Osprey
on Saturday night in Arizona, which killed 19 Marines, came after
years of arguments inside the Pentagon against building it, and
years of dogged efforts by Congress to protect the $37 billion
program. By Tim Weiner.

<P>
   MAGAZINES-ADS (Undated) _ The magazines that are doing well have
never had it so good. Magazines like In Style, Vogue, Vanity Fair
and W are so packed with advertisements that they blowing past
their records for size, heft and length. They are part of a growing
breed: the obese magazine, publications so fat that if they were
people, they ought to be in a high school auditorium sweating to
the oldies with Richard Simmons. By Alex Kuczynski.

   STANLEY-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The Stanley Works may tell
investors about the need to be patient, but the company's chief
executive appears to have failed to heed the same advice. Three
years after John M. Trani, a rising star at General Electric, took
over as chief executive of Stanley Works, investors are still
looking for some of the GE management magic. For his efforts,
though, Trani pulled a sizable pay increase out of his company last
year. Trani, who had an impressive performance at GE's medical
systems division, was greeted with much enthusiasm when he took
over Stanley at the end of 1996. But the much-anticipated revival
has yet to take place. By Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   IRIDIUM (Chicago) _ In the coming months, Iridium LLC, the
bankrupt global satellite telephone company, will begin sending 88
giant satellites spiraling toward Earth, where they will burn up in
a fitting and fiery end to one of the colossal corporate failures
in recent memory. After spending more than $5 billion on a system
that promised to communicate ``with anyone, anytime, virtually
anywhere in the world,'' Iridium could muster only about 55,000
subscribers, not enough even to pay interest on its start-up costs.

   HIGHTECH-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ As 3Com makes plans to become a
much smaller networking solutions company, shedding several
slower-growing operations, executives have decided to change
agencies. The San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, which has
handled the 3Com account since the company consolidated agencies in
October 1997, is losing the assignment, effective on July 1, to the
New York office of Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners. FCB San Francisco will
continue as the agency for the Palm computing unit, which is being
spun out of 3Com. The 3Com shift is indicative of the ferment among
high-technology marketers as competition intensifies in that
fast-moving, free-spending category. By Stuart Elliott.

<P>
   ROME-EXHIBIT (Philadelphia) _ Imagine a city where Jacques-Louis
David insisted on working to execute a momentous commission from
the French king; where a 21-year-old aspiring artist from
Philadelphia named Benjamin West was taken to meet the pope; where
Fragonard, Piranesi, Anton Raphael Mengs, Antonio Canova, Angelika
Kauffmann and Jean-Antoine Houdon all lived, dined, traded ideas
and drank coffee together. That was Rome in the 18th century. With
those artists and others of many nationalities studying, working,
competing and cross-pollinating, cosmopolitan Rome _ not Paris _
was the cultural capital of Europe. That, at least, is the thesis
of ``The Splendor of 18th-Century Rome,'' a blockbuster exhibition
on view through May 28 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. By Judith
Dobrzynski.

   SCI-FRUIT-FLY (Undated) _ The Drosophila fruit fly, whose genome

because it is one of the principal model organisms studied by
biologists as a means of understanding the general design of life.
Because of the unity of evolution, the fly's genes and those of
people overlap considerably. Their advocates, who call themselves
fly people, are easily provoked into confessing that they think of
people as large flies that lack wings. By Nichols Wade.

   SCI-GALAXY-CANNIBALISM (Undated) _ Astronomers have long
suspected that a dark secret about Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way.
They have even seen other galaxies engaging in the macabre behavior
at the core of this secret. But without irrefutable proof,
astronomers refused to admit that it might be commonplace closer to
home. Now, sadly, they have that proof. The Milky Way is a chronic
cannibal. It consumes other galaxies and makes their stars its own.

fortunes of these engaging creatures in a perpetually endangered
jungle. Now, a collaboration of several American and Rwandan
institutions is taking that program to the edge of high technology,

   SCI-BROCKOVITCH-SCIENCE (Undated) _ Reflections column. Many
scientists are offended by the movie ``Erin Brockovitch.'' The
problem, they say, is not that they cannot enjoy a good yarn in
which virtue triumphs over evil and the little guys win. It is a
more subtle: while it is easy to see that the sex and even the
violence in movies are fantasies, it is hard for any but scientists
to discern when science in movies crosses the line from verity to
hyperbole and indoctrination. The end result, some say, is to help
perpetuate misconceptions about scientific evidence and about the

HEALTH NET SUED BY DOCTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Health Source Medical Group Inc. on Monday sued
Health Net, one of California's largest health maintenance
organizations, claiming the firm forced physicians to accept low
rates in exchange for their services.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, charges that
Woodland Hills-based Health Net committed a series of fraudulent
and unfair business practices that presented a threat to the
public, doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   Health Net is a subsidiary of Foundation Health Systems Inc. and
serves about 2.2 million members in California.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David M. Frisch, president of Health Source, said the suit
alleges that Health Net fraudulently induces health care providers
to deliver services without contracts that comply with regulatory
requirements in California.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction precluding Health Net
from engaging in the same or similar misconduct toward any health
care providers, restitution to individual doctors and at least $3
million in damages for harm caused Health Source.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't comment on the specifics because we haven't been
served with the suit,'' said Health Net spokeswoman Lisa Kalustian.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, ensuring the health and well being of our members is
always a foremost priority for us,'' Kalustian said. ``It's
regrettable that Health Source has chosen to try and resolve their
difficulties through the court system, rather than discuss them
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn E. Solomon, an attorney with Hooper, Lundy and Bookman in
Los Angeles, which represents Health Source, said he couldn't
comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts don't see much hope for Health Source's case in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't receive adequate capitation rates, don't do
business with the health maintenance organization,'' said Todd
Richter, an analyst with Bank of America Securities in New York.
``Nobody is forcing them to take that business.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit also alleges that Health Net induced doctors to provide
services to its members at below cost by falsely promising to enter
into an agreement that would make up the below-cost payments
retroactively.
</P>
<P>
   The health care giant is also accused of setting reimbursement
rates at levels that do not adequately compensate physicians for
services provided to Health Net members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inadequate payment rates threaten not only the viability and
continued existence of IPAs, medical groups and health care
providers, they also ultimately will disrupt patient care and
destroy physician-patient relationships,'' said Frisch in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Frisch said the lawsuit alleges Health Net sets pharmacy budgets
at levels that don't adequately reimburse doctors for services
provided and that the HMO withholds access to necessary records so
as to perpetuate their underpayment for services.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs are going to have to reimburse health care providers at
level that will cover the costs of the services being provided or
the public eventually will be left with no adequate sources of
health care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Los Angeles, Health Source is an independent physician
association comprising approximately 300 doctors.

ANGELS' SCHOENEWEIS WINS BUT DISARCINA ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Scott Schoeneweis was the last pitcher to be
named to the Angels' starting rotation, but he was the club's first
to throw a shutout in nearly two years, blanking the Toronto Blue
Jays on three hits in the Anaheim Angels' 6-0 victory Monday night
before 14,338 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout was the third in the major leagues this season, the
second in the American League. The others were thrown by Arizona's
Randy Johnson and Toronto's David Wells. It was the first
complete-game shutout by an Angels pitcher since Chuck Finley shut
out Tampa Bay on April 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Angels was tempered a bit by the
announcement after the game that shortstop Gary DiSarcina was
placed on the 15-day disabled list with a bruised left thumb.
DiSarcina suffered the injury Saturday trying to field a smash by
Boston's Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did all kinds of tests,'' manager Mike Scioscia said.
``It was negative, but you could see some hot spots so you know
it's going to take some time. Knowing DiSarcina, he was going to do
some things to try to manipulate it and end up retarding his
progress. It's tough to get a guy like DiSarcina on the DL; it's
like trying get a bull in a catbox.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels called up infielder Keith Johnson to replace
DiSarcina on the roster, but Benji Gil will be the shortstop until
DiSarcina can return on April 24. The Angels made another roster
move, optioning pitcher Mike Fyhrie to Triple-A Edmonton to make
room for Ramon Ortiz, who will start tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got only seven hits in Monday's game, but that was
enough. Garret Anderson drove in three runs with a double and
sacrifice fly, and Troy Glaus drove in the other three with his
second home run of the season. And it was more than enough for
Schoeneweis, who also won his first start of the season vs. the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis (2-0) did exactly what Scioscia expected him to do
after picking him over the veteran Kent Mercker for the final
rotation spot -- throw his hard sinker, mix in his fastball and
changeup, and get groundballs. Of the 27 outs, 19 came came on
grounders, and four others on strikeouts. The only hits he allowed
were Marty Cordova's fifth-inning single, Homer Bush's sixth-inning
double and Alex Gonzalez's eight-inning infield single.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something he has to bottle, bottle his approach,''
Scioscia said of Schoeneweis, who was making only his second career
major league start. ``He didn't get rattled out there. He showed me
he stayed with his game plan no matter the situation. That's a mark
of a guy developing as a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Blue Jays came to scoring was a result of
Schoeneweis' first walk of the season. Bush walked to lead off the
fourth, took second on a wild pitch and stole third. With one out,
Bush tried to score from third on a comebacker by Carlos Delgado.
Schoeneweis knocked the ball down, retrieved it and threw Bush out
at the plate. It took a good play by catcher Bengie Molina, who
caught Schoeneweis' low throw and made a swiping tag all in the
same motion.
</P>
<P>
   In Schoeneweis final two spring starts in Arizona, he gave up a
total of 16 runs. But he got the nod over Mercker, despite the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a testament to the confidence they have in me, which I
appreciate,'' Schoeneweis said. ``They want me to keep the ball
down and that's what I've been doing. Keep the ball down and things
will work out. And tonight, the ball was hit to guys ... finally.''

   ``You could see the execution of his pitches in the spring,''
Scioscia said. ``You know Arizona. It's tough to say this or that
about the numbers. He had good stuff.''

ANIMAL LOVERS BACK REFUGE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a state order to close the Wildlife
Waystation, hundreds of callers offered donations and help Monday
to defend it against allegations that it is harming the
environment, workers at the exotic-animals sanctuary said.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of support for the internationally renowned
animal-rescue center came while state Department of Fish and Game
officials met with prosecutors for two hours to discuss whether to
file criminal charges that clean-water laws were violated.
</P>
<P>
   No consensus was reached. Prosecutors were shown excerpts of a
videotape that state officials say show violations seen by
inspectors two weeks ago, said District Attorney's Office
spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the videotape shows animal waste washing
into Waystation streams that dump into the Tujunga Wash _ something
that poses a serious health and safety risk to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their chief concern is for the health of the animals and the
public and the 130 people who live on the premises,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney John Paul Bernardi, head of the
division handling environmental and occupational-safety cases,
plans to meet with the Waystation's lawyer to discuss the tape and
the state order.
</P>
<P>
   The center's founder and director, Martine Colette, said the
Waystation has done nothing wrong, but will work with officials to
correct any problems and continue operating the sanctuary for 1,200
exotic animals.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Game Department officials ordered the Waystation to
stop giving public tours, reduce its animal population and stop
taking in more animals. Colette said she was overwhelmed by public
support after the order was issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outpouring of help and love from the community always
makes you feel wonderful. But I still know the gates are closed,
and dozens of baby animals who need help could die because I can't
help them,'' Colette said.
</P>
<P>
   Most calls Monday came from animal lovers and Waystation members
who want to donate money to help, she said. Several environmental
attorneys offered free legal services, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state order came after an inspection of all of the cages and
pens that hold the 1,200 lions, tigers, monkeys, owls and other
exotic animals rescued from sites including research laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Waystation workers pick up and dispose of solid waste, but
remnants of excrement and urine are washed out of the cages and
into Little Tujunga stream, state officials said. That pollutes
water and is a violation of the clean-water law, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Colette said workers do not intentionally wash any waste into
the stream, but some might drain there.
</P>
<P>
   Mervin Hee, Fish and Game's regional patrol chief, could not be
reached after Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Colette said the closure order could have been avoided and the
Waystation's ``good name spared'' if Fish and Game officials had
told her years ago to alter the way the Waystation cleans its
cages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing business in this manner for 25 years. We live
at the bottom of a valley,'' she said. She said she would work with
Fish and Game officials to adopt an alternate plan for removing
animal waste.
</P>
<P>
   Colette denied allegations by state officials that the
Waystation has a chimpanzee with hepatitis B. As proof, she
presented a certificate from October 1995 that indicates Boee the
chimp is a carrier of hepatitis C but ``he is not a danger to
public health.'' The document says Boee's type of hepatitis is not
excreted in feces or urine, is not airborne and is transmitted only
by blood-to-blood contact.
</P>
<P>
   The Waystation has been rescuing sick or wayward animals since
it opened in 1976 in the hills of the Angeles National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Game officials have been pressuring the Waystation to
improve cages, some of which are crowded or do not have roofs. But
that has been difficult, Colette said, because the center's annual
budget of $2.5 million is derived exclusively from private
donations and tour fees.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-day inspection two weeks ago, state officials
said they found one-third of the cages adequate, one-third cramped
and one-third in need of drastic change.
</P>
<P>
   Former Waystation employee Fred Perry said Monday that spraying
the animals' pens is called ``blasting the cages.'' Runoff dumps
into the creek, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said the practice has been going on at the Waystation
compound for at least the three years he lived there.

IT'S THE BEAUTY BY THE BAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They officially open Pacific Bell Park today,
and know this right off: There will be no swimming dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area types will be able to contain their disappointment,
what with the rest of their downtown gem being almost more than
they dared imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly after four different ballot initiatives aimed at
building a publicly financed ballpark were all shot down.
</P>
<P>
   So the team that tried to move to Tampa, that tried to build
stadiums in Santa Clara and San Jose, now gets the latest retro
ballpark, and it was worth all the disappointments and all the
waiting. Maybe not all the cold nights at Candlestick, but The City
is plainly all aflutter over its $319-million, waterfront beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really thrilled,'' said San Francisco Giants executive
vice president Larry Baer. ``We like to think it's Wrigley Field
meets Camden Yards. The tradition and intimacy of Wrigley, and the
modern architectural techniques of Camden Yards. That's our handle
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken us two decades to try and get a ballpark built.
It's been kind of a crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   Only this one should have employed the Navy. If Pac Bell Park
had anymore of a water theme, it would be docked in Long Beach next
to the old Spruce Goose dome.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,800-seat ballpark is built right to the edge of San
Francisco Bay in the China Basin district. Balls hit over the
right-field wall will actually land in a small channel that
connects to the bay. Since it's a six-foot drop from the concourse
outside the stadium to the water, and with no ladder nor ramp,
there has been a natural concern for the overzealous diving in for
a Barry Bonds home run, only to have to be fished out of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy this, the Giants are talking of bringing in some dogs,
specially trained to retrieve any balls landing in what has been
nicely renamed McCovey Cove. Alas, for today's 1 p.m. opener
against the Dodgers, the bay has yet to go to the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're still in negotiations with the dogs,'' Giants
spokesman Jim Moorehead said. ``No, my understanding is they're
still in training.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of an extended spring training for water fetch.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark was originally scheduled to face downtown. But wind
tests convinced the Giants to aim their diamond away from the city,
though there will still be plenty of wind whipping through the
stadium. This is, after all, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium design now looks familiar to those who have seen new
stadiums spring up in Denver, Cleveland and elsewhere. There is the
brick exterior and walls, the forest green seats and railing, the
luxury suites, the similar light stands. All very tasteful, but no
longer unique.
</P>
<P>
   But what truly sets this ballpark apart is the backdrop, which
from almost any location or level, borders on the spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   The field level gets you extremely close to the action but
offers limited views. The vistas are everywhere else, though. From
the third-base line, there's a view of the bay and the Oakland
hills. From first base, the Bay Bridge and Oakland skyline. From
the upper deck, it's the waterfront and the downtown skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's built right on the edge of the water the way no other
ballpark has ever been built,'' Baer said. ``San Francisco is a
city of views and it's only fitting that its team play in a
ballpark filled with views.
</P>
<P>
   ``The architects compared its water setting to the Sidney Opera
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so picturesque, but certainly unique, is the kids section
behind left field.
</P>
<P>
   There, larger than commercial life, is a tilted 80-foot
Coca-Cola bottle. Inside the structure are four slides. To its
right is a three-fingered replica of a 1927 glove. Dubbed the
world's largest baseball mitt, it was designed in Berkeley, built
in Oakland and carried across the bay on a barge. It's 518 feet
from home plate. There is also a 50-by-50-foot diamond that
duplicates Pac Bell Park, designed for those under age 7.
</P>
<P>
   The field itself has its own unique design. It's only 307 feet
down the right-field line, but then there is a 25-foot wall. The
corner disappears from view from those along the first-base side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see some calls that umpires are going to miss already,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern to Johnson is the multiple surfaces balls can
bounce off in right and the open bullpen just beyond the
right-field line. The bullpen mound is tucked between the field and
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think that's an accident waiting to happen,''
Johnson said. ``It may be closer for the fans, but I don't like it.
I don't like humps or jagged things in ballparks. In right, it
could take any kind of bounce off of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Right field has open archways where fans can watch the game
behind rubber coated fences for free. There is padding along the
bottom of the fence, built beneath brick walls.
</P>
<P>
   Balls will be taking some unexpected bounces.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corner in right-center 421 feet from home plate that
has a yellow line going up the 25-foot wall. Hit one off the wall
to the right of the line, and it's in play. Hit one a couple inches
to the left, and it's a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Above the left-center bleachers is the giant scoreboard,
complete with clock.
</P>
<P>
   All and all, a comfortable, attractive and distinctive stadium
built solely for baseball. Something San Francisco has never had
and is completely embracing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beautiful,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has responded. Baer said they reached their 33,000
season-ticket mark, and have already sold out 77 of their 81 home
games.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay for the ballpark (note to would-be NFL owners in Los
Angeles: It was a privately financed ballpark), the Giants sold
16,000 private-seat licenses to raise $70 million and another $75
million in sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing is a place to park. Pac Bell Park
requires the use of public transportation, since it has only 5,000
parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the city is forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a dream come true,'' Baer said. ``People say San
Francisco isn't a good baseball town. Really, it can be a great
baseball town with a good facility.''

LAKERS WIN WITHOUT SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It takes a lot of mortals to make up for the loss
of one superstar. Fortunately for the Los Angeles Lakers, Superman
has Superfriends.
</P>
<P>
   With Shaquille O'Neal on the bench for a second straight game,
the Lakers turned to the superhero-by-committee strategy Monday
night and pulled out a dramatic 106-103 overtime victory over the
Seattle SuperSonics before 18,997 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice hit a buzzer-beating 23-footer between Gary Payton and
Jelani McCoy at the end of regulation to tie the score at 94 and
force the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, the Lakers (65-13) got clutch shooting from Kobe
Bryant, a huge 3-pointer from Rick Fox and a game-sealing dunk from
A.C. Green to pull out the victory and take the season series
against the Sonics, their possible first-round playoff opponent,
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, what a game,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``Glen hitting a
shot, big one in the corner, finally getting the offense rolling a
little bit in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   That again proved difficult without the presence of O'Neal,
resting a sprained left ankle for a second straight game. But
Bryant overcame a horrible start to finish with a game-high 33
points on 13-of-28 shooting, and Rice added 28 points on 7-of-18
shooting to prove they can indeed win without their MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, they were 0-2 without O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, they did it with a huge contribution from the
recently slumping Rice. The Lakers had blown a 13-point lead to
open the fourth quarter and were down 94-92 with 1.4 seconds left.
Rice took the inbounds pass in the corner and hit from 23 feet with
time expiring, and the arena erupted as Rice was hugged by a scrum
of fans at courtside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going in,'' Rice said. ``It had the arch and
everything, the follow-through. Everything was perfect. It's sweet,
and those are the things you cherish, cherish for a lifetime
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice finished 7 for 18 from the field after a slow start and
added nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a little lift for me,'' he said. ``I like to
try and do anything I can to get this team a win. And the guys
really were looking for me. They realized I had it going a little
bit. I just thank God I was able to hit the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shammond Williams led the Sonics with 28 points off the bench,
and put a brief scare into the Lakers. He hit a 3-pointer in the
final 10 seconds of overtime to slice the lead to 104-103, but the
Lakers quickly sealed the game when Rick Fox zipped the inbounds
pass to Green, who caught the ball behind the defense and hit a
breakaway slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have already sealed the best record in the NBA, but
with four games left, they're trying to find their way without
O'Neal. They were routed by the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to step up and play like they believe in
themselves tonight, and they felt good about themselves,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these teams are on a collision course to meet again
in two weeks, in the first round of the playoffs. The Sonics
dropped to 1 games behind the Sacramento Kings in the battle for
the seventh and eighth seeds in the West
</P>
<P>
   otherwise known as the battle to avoid the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have had some success against the Lakers this season,
but in choosing an opponent for the playoffs, Jackson noted that
since Sacramento ``has been befuddling the Lakers, Seattle seems to
be a better team for us right off the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look that way for most of Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot 28.3 percent in the first half but managed to
find a flow in the third quarter when Bryant snapped out of a
shooting funk to hit 7 of 9 shots, for 16 points. That led the
Lakers to a 34-point quarter, and 59.1 percent shooting - their
best period of the night - as they opened a 73-60 lead to head into
the fourth.

SONICS FALL TO SHAQ-LESS LAKERS IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Sonics looked for and badly needed a gap, some
type of breakthrough from a funk ill-suited at this point in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   So call it impeccable timing that they found the Los Angeles
Lakers Monday night with an opening at Staples Center made extra
wide by the absence a 7-foot-1, 330-pound man.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal lounged in street clothes Monday
because of a sprained left ankle. And the Sonics sat in ideal
position to upend the NBA's best team as well kindle a consistent
pulse before the playoffs begin in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how opportunistic the Sonics with strong
performances from two unusual suspects, they succumbed to the
Lakers in a 106-103 overtime loss.
</P>
<P>
   A check of their cadence after the emotional defeat revealed the
Sonics were a bit limp after a third consecutive defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call Dr. Joyce Brothers,'' center Horace Grant said. ``The
psyche of this team is not good right now. I don't know ... the
(remedy) is to get a win. If the outcome was different, it would
have given us a big lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the eighth-seeded Sonics fell 1{ games behind the idle
Sacramento Kings for seventh place in the Western Conference
playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Sonics, they have been more than a
respectable team on the road. Following a home game Wednesday
against Minnesota, the Sonics play at Dallas Friday and at Houston
Sunday. Then, the Sonics travel to Sacramento for what could be the
most pivotal game this season.
</P>
<P>
   They easily could have turned their mood around Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point, though, happened with about a minute left in
the extra period. With the Sonics trailing 102-100, Lazaro
Borrell's game-tying basket was erased when Ruben Patterson was
called for an offensive foul.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics fell behind 104-100 on a pair of Glen Rice free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen Rice flopped,'' Patterson said. ``It was a bad call.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Sonics went down gunning.
</P>
<P>
   Shammond Williams' 3-pointer gave them life with 10.4 seconds
left. But Lakers forward A.C. Green beat the Sonics down court for
an uncontested dunk. Seattle then ran its final play with 4.7
seconds remaining in the game, but Vernon Maxwell's buzzer-beating
shot fell short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty drained,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said. ``Our
team is drained by (the loss). But that's the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice forced the extra period when his 18-footer fell as time
expired in regulation. Rice caught the ball on the baseline with
1.4 seconds left and launched the game-tying basket over Jelani
McCoy and Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers began that possession with half the 24-second shot
clock. Their final play was rushed because Williams tipped away an
entry pass to Brian Shaw. The ball bounced out of bounds, setting
up Rice's heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' defensive gem was another example of his proven
reliability whenever he's afforded significant playing time. He
finished with a team-high 28 points, which included several clutch
baskets in crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 NBA sophomore made a pair of free throws that broke
a 92-92 tie with 12.1 seconds left in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal called what the Sonics are experiencing ``buzzard's
luck.'' Despite that, the sparsely-used Borrell and Williams
provided a couple of positive notes. Borrell made a rare appearance
and immediately made himself a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed 73-60 at the start of the fourth quarter when
Williams and Borrell ignited a run. Borrell scored eight points
during a 13-2 run that got the Sonics within 75-73 with 7:28 left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made a couple of 3-pointers during that stretch _ one
where the Sonics stunned the Lakers without the help of their
starters. The Sonics outscored the Lakers 34-21 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the starters struggled, Gary Payton finished with 22
points and 12 rebounds. Payton's work on the boards was indicative
of how weak the Sonics' front line was against a Shaq-less Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker fouled out with 3:27 left in the extra period after
again struggling through a lethargic performance. Baker had nine
rebounds but just three points and made only one of eight field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Los Angeles was without its biggest starter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal missed a second game in a row after sitting out a loss
Sunday to the San Antonio Spurs. He was considered a game-time
decision against the Sonics. But O'Neal never appeared before his
locker before the game. Instead, he laid on a table in the
trainer's room before joining teammates on the court, wearing sky
blue slacks and a matching checkered shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' offense looked dormant without O'Neal taking high
percentage shots in the paint and drawing double teams. A virtually
lock for the MVP award this season, O'Neal's absence allowed the
Sonics to defend the Lakers straight up.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles became a jump-shooting team, and the Sonics did not
allow good looks at the basket. Kobe Bryant had the toughest time
for the Lakers. He missed 10 of his first 12 shots, and the Lakers
shot 28 percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics didn't shoot much better. Payton got off to a
3-for-11 start, and his teammates came out just as flat. Still, the
Sonics clung to a 40-39 lead at halftime after shooting 34 percent.

SHAQ GETS MINI-VACATION BECAUSE OF INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A precautionary move to avoid aggravating
Shaquille O'Neal's sore left ankle has turned into a week-long
break for the Los Angeles Lakers' big man.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, O'Neal missed his second straight game with the mild
sprain, and with the Lakers not playing again until Friday night,
he'll have taken off a full eight days between games.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson is confident O'Neal will be back at full
strength by the time the Sacramento Kings arrive. O'Neal hasn't
played or practiced since spraining his ankle at Golden State last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But a gift from the scheduling gods has allowed O'Neal to take
the mini-vacation and only miss two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny how that works out, isn't it?'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal previously nursing a sore hamstring, Jackson said
the Lakers had earlier scoped out this week as a possible time to
rest the MVP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seattle game obviously was one that looked like it would
be perfecto, because that would give him from Saturday to Friday
(off),'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal could play if needed, but Jackson bristled at the
suggestion that the time off was in part a reward for a long season
of 40-minute games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a reward? I don't consider that a reward, no,''
Jackson said. ``I don't consider that a reward at all. I think it
behooves a player to play 82 (games). You get paid to play 82, you
play 82, and that's the philosophy I have. And when I played,
that's the way I wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal hasn't spoken to reporters since last Wednesday, and he
declined again before Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Through a team spokesman, O'Neal later said he hoped to play
Friday and commented, ``(Trainer) Gary Vitti's doing a great job.
The ankle's making progress, and it feels better.''
</P>
<P>
   Playoff time: If the NHL's Kings - the Lakers' roommate and
landlord - extend their own first-round playoff series to six
games, they will play at home Sunday, April 23. That means the
Lakers probably will be forced to open their first-round series on
Saturday, giving them one less day to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sunday is obviously better,'' Jackson said, noting the
Lakers close out the regular season with back-to-back games in
Dallas and San Antonio on April 18 and 19. ``If we travel back a
late night after a ballgame, that's a long-flight situation....
You'd certainly like to have a day off before you start practicing.
If you only have one day to prepare for a team, that's not a whole
lot of time or fun. We'd like to have a couple days to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Derek Fisher is playing despite a bone spur in his
left ankle. Robert Horry continues to nurse a pair of sore knees.

SMOLINSKI EYES QUICK RECOVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Bryan Smolinski, the second-line center who
suffered an apparent season-ending knee injury nine days ago,
skated Monday and hopes to join the Los Angeles Kings for their
first-round playoff series against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings open Thursday against the Red Wings at Joe Louis
Arena. Smolinski, who tore the medial collateral ligament in his
right knee in a collision with Phoenix's Travis Green, will be
fitted for a brace, but coach Andy Murray isn't certain he will see
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a very serious injury,'' Murray said. ``There is a
very good chance he won't play. But he skated today and we'll see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, tied for fourth on the club with 58 points, was given
a four-to-six week recovery time after an MRI revealed the torn
MCL, the ligament that stabilizes the sides of the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Since Smolinski was injured during the final week of the regular
season, he wasn't expected to return in time for the playoffs. The
Kings also are without winger Nelson Emerson, who has a fractured
left index finger that will be in a splint for another week.
</P>
<P>
   Team doctors ruled out surgery for Smolinski but didn't expect
him back until training camp. But head trainer Pete Demers noticed
the knee did not swell up overnight after the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a first sign the situation might be a little
better,'' he said. ``They don't do surgery on the MCL much anymore.
It seems to heal well on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy returns: Right wing Ziggy Palffy, who has missed almost a
month with a sprained right shoulder, continued to work out Monday
and says he will be ready to go Thursday night against the Red
Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much stronger and the extra five days off will help even
more,'' said Palffy, who was the Kings' leading scorer at the time
of the March 15 injury. ``This is my first playoff and I am very
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Defenseman Jaroslav Modry, who played well
during scratches to Aki Berg and injuries to Rob Blake, probably
won't play during the Detroit series. Teams go with three defensive
units. For the Kings, Blake and Mattias Norstrom are the top two.
The other groups are Garry Galley/Sean O'Donnell and Berg and Jere
Karalahti.... The Kings had a team dinner Monday night and were
scheduled to leave for Detroit at 11 this morning.

VETERAN NUNN BACK IN ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The plan - at least the original one -
called for Morris Nunn to sit back on a comfortable couch with his
feet up and a cold drink in his hand while the 2000 CART FedEx
Championship Series was unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven years in racing - as a driver, team owner and the
last eight as the engineer for CART champions Jimmy Vasser, Alex
Zanardi and Juan Montoya at Target/Chip Ganassi Racing - was
enough. He first informed Ganassi of his retirement plans in August
at the CART event in Lexington, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It was time, the 61-year-old Nunn reasoned, to take it easy.
However, he never found his way to the easy chair.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when the CART season began at the Homestead-Miami
Speedway on March 26, Nunn was in the pits as a team owner watching
promising young Brazilian Tony Kanaan pilot the Hollywood/Reynard
Mercedes for the newly formed Mo Nunn Racing team.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we won the championship with (Montoya) I was done,''
said Nunn, a native of Walsall, England. ``I had my own Formula 1
team in Europe and said I would never do it again unless the
situation was financially sound. Mercedes hasn't been getting very
good results (the last two years), so it was kind of a new
challenge. Suddenly I got motivated because I love a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been many racing challenges that Nunn hasn't met.
After 10 years in Formula 1, Nunn joined the Indy Cars in 1984 and
engineered Emerson Fittipaldi's CART championship and Indianapolis
500 victory in 1989 with Patrick Racing. He joined Ganassi Racing
in 1992 and became one of CART's most respected individuals after
engineering the past champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good leader and a great guy,'' Vasser said. ``There's
no doubt in my mind he will build a winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn's first task after forming the team with partners Rod
Campbell and Bruce McCaw was to find a driver. Nunn thought his
first driver would be Helio Castro-Neves, but the young Brazilian
opted to sign with Marlboro Team Penske. Valencia's Bryan Herta,
who left Team Rahal, was a strong possibility at one point and
Kanaan became a candidate after opting to leave Forsythe
Championship Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a better opportunity for me,'' said the
25-year-old Kanaan, who wasn't hired until February and had limited
testing opportunities. ``He is the engineer every driver in the
paddock wants. Call me a freshman at the University of Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kanaan calls himself a freshman, he has shown proven
ability over the past two years to compete with the top drivers. He
was on the pole in last year's Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach,
started second at Laguna Seca and won the Michigan 500 by holding
off Montoya after race leader Max Papis ran out of fuel two turns
from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is a racer,'' Nunn said. ``He's 1,000-percent
concentrated on getting to the front and winning races. I don't
think he had the equipment to be consistently up front in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   No CART team has won its first event, but Kanaan and Mo Nunn
Racing threatened to do that in the season-opening Grand Prix of
Miami on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan ran with the leaders much of the day in Miami and was in
front during laps 105-108. However, a pair of pit mistakes kept him
from climbing on the podium, and he had to settle for a respectable
10th place.
</P>
<P>
   What Nunn and Kanaan are sure about, however, is a shared
optimism about what will happen during this weekend's Toyota Grand
Prix of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, we have last year's pole-setter and the
engineer who won the race,'' Kanaan said. ``What better combination
could there be?''

INJURIES TEST STARS' RESOLVE TO REPEAT AS CHAMPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here come your defending Stanley Cup champions,
make of them what you will. And people are trying, really trying,
to figure out just what to make of them.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly as the playoffs open, no one is about to take the
Dallas Stars lightly. They have all that talent, all that
chemistry, all that experience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's just a tad difficult to proclaim them everyone's fave
to hold aloft another Cup, given their somewhat unique regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a season that saw them stumble out with a major
championship hangover, only to see injuries reduce them to
something decidedly mortal.
</P>
<P>
   Try last place in the Pacific Division on Nov. 28, holding onto
a 9-11-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really concerned whether the group was enjoying the
challenge that was ahead of them,'' said Stars coach Ken Hitchcock.
``I was thinking at times the group felt the challenge might be a
little too big. That once they reached the top of the mountain,
maybe the climb back up wasn't something they wanted to do again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars slowly began to get back to playing their kind of
hockey, though bodies still kept pulling up lame seemingly by the
day. But after that Nov. 28 low, the Stars put together the
second-best record in the league. They went 34-15-5 over their next
54 games and won the division.
</P>
<P>
   Then they ended the season 0-3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, they play when it counts. All year long with the Stars,
there has been a feeling that when it came time to get serious
(read: playoffs), they would be there. Take away the bookends to
their season - and goalie Ed Belfour's friends in hotel security -
and it's still been a marvelous season. And the Stars, too, believe
they will step up come the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hunger will be back,'' said center Mike Modano. ``That
thought of last season will be back in our minds, and wanting to go
through that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Said center Guy Carbonneau: ``I think if you asked the players
around the league, they know what we were missing and what kind of
game we were still playing. I'm sure everybody knows we're going to
be one of the teams to beat in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau knows something about a Stanley Cup champion
struggling to find the fire early the next season. Carbonneau - at
40 the oldest player in the NHL - won Stanley Cups as a member of
the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   And there, too, it would be hard for the defending champions to
have their game in top form to start the following season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the same thing,'' he said. ``Only I've never seen that
many injuries in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries almost made it easy to disregard their dismal start.
During their championship season last year, the Stars lost only 181
man-games due to injury. This year, they lost 391.
</P>
<P>
   Jere Lehtinen, who's won the Selke Trophy as the NHL's best
defensive forward the past two seasons, missed most of the season
with a fractured ankle. He only returned from his second stint on
the injured list in Sunday's regular-season finale against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher, their defensive player of the year last season,
top scorer Brett Hull, Joe Nieuwendyk, Grant Marshall - all
significant players - and scores of others were lost for chunks of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that those able bodied were exactly fired up about starting
a new campaign. Less than three months after defeating Buffalo for
the Stanley Cup, they were back in training camp. A scrappy team
struggled to find its emotional base.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit of a hangover,'' Modano said. ``You just don't
have that enthusiasm, that energy, that motivation to get up for
every game in October, November, December. It was tough. And that
first couple of months, everyone was out to get us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody was a little concerned. It could have been a
situation where we just packed it in, and really kind of written
the season off. But somewhere along the line we just kind of pecked
away at our game, pecked away at the standings, and found games to
get points where we shouldn't have been getting points.''
</P>
<P>
   A win here, a healthy body there, an opponent no longer peaked
to defeat the champions, and the Stars began to remember how they
had won the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've gone around the league once, then you can really
start focusing on your season,'' Carbonneau said. ``Because
everywhere you go, it's new to them. They want to congratulate you,
tell you how good you are. Sometimes it goes to your head and you
forget to work. It's difficult to figure out it's that hard to win
games.''
</P>
<P>
   By midseason they were again one of the league's top teams. This
is still the team of Modano, Hull and Belfour. Nobody was really
buying into that curious start.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a bit of a rocky start for the year with injuries,
but it's also tough when you come off winning the Cup,'' said Ducks
coach Craig Hartsburg. ``It's a pretty short summer to get your
focus back on the next season. Then every team wants to beat you
when you come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're back on track, playing a great defensive game.
They'll be a tough team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs have a way of awakening any dormant emotions, not
that their final 43-29-10 regular-season record is anything to get
sheepish over.
</P>
<P>
   Still, things start to get serious for the Stars on Wednesday
when they host Edmonton in their playoff opener. Ultimately, Dallas
will be judged not by any early struggle with intensity or health,
but by what it does in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what we did last year, it doesn't matter
what we did earlier in the year,'' said defenseman Darryl Sydor.
``We've had a lot of adversity and faced it well, but we still want
to do more.''

DUCKS' OLAUSSON RETIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Sunday's 4-3 loss to the Los Angeles Kings
wasn't only the final game of the 1999-2000 season for Fredrik
Olausson, it was the final game of his Anaheim Mighty Ducks and NHL
career.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year old Swedish defenseman said he wants to spend more
time with his wife and three daughters and plans to introduce his
girls to Europe. Oluasson has offers to play in Europe where teams
play only twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   The understated Olausson surprised many with his decision, which
he announced to a selected few players after Sunday's game. Paul
Kariya didn't find out until Monday and Oleg Tverdovsky didn't know
for sure until told by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty big loss,'' said Tverdovsky, who thought
Olausson was either tired or kidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed playing with him, especially on the power play.''
</P>
<P>
   The power play was Olausson's bread and butter the past two
seasons, when he combined for 31 goals and 90 points for the Ducks
after being signed as free agent in August, 1998. Anaheim had the
league's No. 1 power play unit last season, and after an
embarrassingly slow start this season Anaheim featured the best
power play from Feb. 1 through the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to his offensive skills and big slap shot,
Olausson's quiet leadership will be missed, especially by the
team's young defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a guy you love to have on your club,'' said general
manager Pierre Gauthier. ``We will miss him as much as a person as
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He only says something when it was real important,'' said
Tverdovsky, who teamed with Olausson on the points the second half
of the season. ``He is quiet, but he shows it (emotion) when you
needed it the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg called Olausson the team's emotional leader down the
stretch, and the defenseman admitted he was hoping to get one last
playoff run. But he also said now is the time to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with my decision,'' he said. ``You never know
how much you are going to miss it six months ... a year from now,
but I've had a great time over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year veteran played with Winnipeg, Edmonton, Anaheim and
Pittsburgh before returning for a second stint with the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Olausson was playing for Winnipeg when Teemu Selanne burst upon
the NHL scene with the Jets in 1992 and the winger said his
teammate's decision caught him offguard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising because he can still play,'' said Selanne, who
Olausson said had already tried to talk him out of his plans.
``It's a shame, what a great guy he is. It's a sad thing. What a
great career he's had and what great memories we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ___In the past week Kariya has taken himself to task for his
performance on the ice as well as his leadership skills. But Monday
it was revealed that the Ducks' captain suffered a broken foot, not
a bruise, when he blocked a shot on Feb. 16 versus Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke his foot again and never told anybody and played
through it,'' said Hartsburg, who admitted the Ducks covered up the
injury. ``He's going to do anything he can to help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who also broke his foot in the playoffs last season, was
perhaps the NHL's hottest player when he was injured. He scored
five points the night he was hurt and had 20 goals and 34 points in
21 games before sitting out seven games, Feb. 21-March 8.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Kariya struggled when he came back, recording
only three assists in his first five games. However, he got
stronger as the season came to an end, scoring seven goals and 14
points in the last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   __Selanne admitted that his back was sore much of the season,
but refused to use that as a reason for his decline in production.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are absolutely no excuses, everybody has injuries,''
said Selanne, who scored 33 goals and 85 points and finished fifth
in the NHL in scoring this season after scoring 47 goals and 107
points in 1998-99. ``I don't even want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, who said his back will require some rehab in the
offseason, will be busy in the next few months. Selanne and his
wife, Sirpa, are expecting their third child in five weeks.

KINGS MAY HAVE THEIR INSPIRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The talk in the Los Angeles Kings dressing room
Monday was about Bryan Smolinski, but it was hard not to think
about Kirk Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   There are the Michigan State roots, thinning hair and razor
stubble. There is a gimpy knee. And no L.A. team since Gibson's
Dodgers in 1988 has been as big a postseason underdog as this
year's Kings against the mighty Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   But just seven days after an MRI revealed a torn medial
collateral ligament that all but ended his season, Smolinski skated
Monday for Kings coaches and medical personnel. He will be fitted
for a brace and is hoping to play Thursday when the Kings open
their best-of-seven series at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``I don't really
know if he will be able to play, but we just figured there was no
way. This is a guy who has no quit. The power of the playoffs is
something.''
</P>
<P>
   You might remember, the Dodgers had dropped 10 of 11 to the New
York Mets during the 1988 season but won a seven-game playoff.
Gibson was injured in that series and batted just once in the World
Series against heavily favored Oakland. His home run off Dennis
Eckersley is legendary, and the improbable Dodgers won the title in
five games.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of whimsy aside, the Kings' task is daunting. A healthy
Smolinski would not have swung the momentum the Kings' way.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings finished the season with a 48-23-10 record, which
was second best to St. Louis in the Central Division. It also was
the second-best mark in the NHL. Their 108 points marks the fifth
time in the last seven full seasons that they have reached 100.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those years they won the Stanley Cup, giving coach Scotty
Bowman eight in his illustrious career.
</P>
<P>
   By beating the Mighty Ducks in Sunday's regular-season finale,
the Kings reached 94 points, the fourth-best season in club
history. In two of those three seasons, they went out in the first
round and lost in the second round in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that never caved in all season, even when it
would have been easy to,'' said Kings winger Ziggy Palffy, who has
missed almost a month with a sprained right shoulder. ``With all
the injuries it would have been easy to say, not this year. But
there is something about this team that is special.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 14 points that separated the two this season and all
the tradition over the years, the Kings went 2-2-1 against the Red
Wings this year. Murray, who has raised the bar for his team by
stressing accountability, idolized Bowman growing up outside
Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bowman, who has been known to intimidate referees, got
a late call that impacted the outcome of their Dec. 10 matchup, the
feisty Murray stormed into the officials dressing room to dispute
the call.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings won the next two meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a position-by-position look at the Red Wings/Kings
series:
</P>
<P>
   CENTER
</P>
<P>
   KINGS: The loss of Bryan Smolinski with a knee injury also
crippled the Kings' depth at the position. Enforcer Ian Laperriere
has moved into Smolinski's spot on the second line. Bob Corkum, a
valuable faceoff man, takes over on the third. Jozef Stumpel,
sidelined much of the first half with injuries, has been
outstanding in the final month, especially with winger Glen Murray.
With Palffy back, Murray heads to the second line.
</P>
<P>
   RED WINGS: Steve Yzerman might be the best two-way player in the
game. He also has 61 playoff goals. He has been bothered by a
sprained right knee, which slowed him at the end of the season.
Second-line center Igor Lirionov had just nine goals, but his 38
assists stabilize a unit that was shaken by injuries all season.
Sergei Fedorov missed 15 games with injuries, but still finished
with 27 goals. Had four game winners in '97 playoffs. ADVANTAGE:
Red Wings
</P>
<P>
   LEFT WING
</P>
<P>
   KINGS: Luc Robitaille led the Kings in goals (36) and points
(74) even though he missed a month with a broken left foot. Kings
leader in playoff games (114) and goals (47). Doesn't need much ice
to create offense, which is critical in playoffs. Because of
Palffy's injury, spent much time on the second line. The same is
true for Craig Johnson, the team's fastest skater, and Jason
Blake. &QL; 
RED WINGS: Brendan Shanahan led the club with 40 goals. The pending
unrestricted free agent was rewarded with a four-year, $26 million
contract that should serve as a morale boost. Vyacheslav Kozlov
missed 11 games with injuries and his 18 goals are the
second-lowest total of his career. Tomas Holmstrom plays with
Fedorov on the third line, which is a scoring unit for Detroit.
Kirk Maltby adds grit. ADVANTAGE: Red Wings
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT WING
</P>
<P>
   KINGS: Ziggy Palffy is a bona fide sniper, but his sprained
right shoulder has not been tested in game conditions. Red Wings
got physical with Palffy during the regular season and that won't
change. Glen Murray matched a career-high with 29 goals, including
the game-winner Sunday in OT. Played extremely well with Stumpel
with Palffy out and the two will work together. Kelly Buchberger
added grit and the occasional goal after coming over from Atlanta.
Nelson Emerson, another part of the deal, is out and will be
missed.
</P>
<P>
   RED WINGS: Pat Verbeek is a 500-goal scorer who was brought in
during the regular season and worked well with Yzerman. This is the
fifth team he has helped take to the playoffs. Darren McCarty
played just 25 games this year due to a persistent groin injury.
Doug Brown played just 50 games and gritty fourth-liner Martin
Lapointe could be moved up to play with Lirionov. ADVANTAGE: Kings
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   KINGS: Captain Rob Blake was a Norris Trophy candidate until
Chris Pronger blew away the field. Blake and Mattias Norstrom
formed an impressive tandem, but the Kings might try Blake with
other defensemen and put Norstrom with rookie Jere Karalahti. Garry
Galley and Sean O'Donnell will remain intact. Aki Berg is the other
defenseman, but the Kings would like to reward Jaraslov Modry for a
strong finish.
</P>
<P>
   RED WINGS: Many think Nicklas Lidstrom passed both Blake and
Pronger as the league's top defenseman. He led the team in assists
(53) and led all NHL defenseman with 73 points, 11 more than
Pronger. But Detroit is holding its breath to see if Chris Chelios
will be ready for the first round. Chelios, second to Pronger with
a plus-48, was injured during the final week of the regular season.
Steve Duchesne rebounded from last year's disaster with the Kings
for 41 points. ADVANTAGE: Red Wings
</P>
<P>
   GOALTENDING
</P>
<P>
   KINGS: The team waited all season for Stephane Fiset and Jamie
Storr to get healthy and be effective at the same time. Now they
have it. Fiset will be the playoff starter. After returning from a
groin injury, he went 5-0-1 and the Kings lost just once in their
last 10 games. Fiset played on Colorado's Stanley Cup winner in
1996, but played only one minute behind Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   RED WINGS: Chris Osgood has been inconsistent this season with a
2.39 goals-against average, although a 30-14-8 record doesn't sound
too bad. Neither do his six shutouts. But he became a Bowman
whipping boy late, probably as a ploy to prove no one is safe.
Don't expected to see Ken Wregget in this series. Slumping or not,
Osgood, with 53 playoff appearances, gets the nod over Fiset.
ADVANTAGE: Red Wings
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   KINGS: Played well on the power play, but never recovered after
injuries to Robitaille and Palffy. Blake was moved back to point on
the power play this season, but his shot lacked consistency in the
second half. Galley and Karalahti picked up some of the slack.
Kings also allowed 12 short-handed goals, second worst in the NHL.
Penalty killing was the third-lowest overall (80 percent), but was
much better on the road.
</P>
<P>
   RED WINGS: Finished third overall with a 19.6 conversion ratio.
Yzerman had 15 goals with the man advantage and Shanahan added 13.
Lidstrom and Fedorov each had four short-handed goals. Red Wings
were fifth in penalty killing (88.5). ADVANTAGE: Red Wings
</P>
<P>
   COACHING
</P>
<P>
   KINGS: Andy Murray is the reason the Kings are the fifth seed in
the West. He took over for fired Larry Robinson this season and
kept the team moving forward when it was buckled by injuries.
Stressed accountability and got it.
</P>
<P>
   RED WINGS: Bowman's eight Stanley Cup rings says it all. He won
five straight with Montreal, but also one with Pittsburgh and two
with Detroit. He is gruff, but also a master motivator who is not
afraid to use negative reinforcement. He also can alter the outcome
of games by fixing his menacing glare on officials. ADVANTAGE: Red
Wings

SLUMPS NOT YET A CONCERN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels hitting coach Mickey Hatcher is
faced with his first minicrisis - the early slumps of Mo Vaughn,
Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson. Going into Monday's series opener
against the Blue Jays, Vaughn was hitting .217, Salmon .136 and
Anderson .200. They had just one extra-base hit each.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, however, says that's no reason to make any drastic
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing with them is the same thing if they were
hot,'' Hatcher said. ``The same program, the same routine. We'll
talk about their swings, watch video ... you don't want them
thinking about their mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Mo's working on a few things. He thinks his
timing's off, so we're doing some drills. Garret's hit some balls
hard, just right at people. Salmon's struggling, but he's working
hard. And he's getting pitched well, nobody's made any mistakes
with him. It's not a time to make major changes or panic. Just
stick with the program and see where it takes them.''
</P>
<P>
   All three say they normally don't start fast, then start to hit
a few weeks into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about it too much,'' Vaughn said. ``We've faced
some tough pitchers, so you just keep taking your trips (to the
plate). It's going to click. Usually it takes me a couple weeks to
where I'm unloading.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon noted that the past two years, he's started fast and
ended up getting injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is a sign that I'll be in the lineup all year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon has been busy looking at videotape of himself hitting,
some from two or three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the tapes if for nothing else just to reinforce
that I can hit the ball,'' he said. ``I'm not breaking anything
down. I'm not studying my mechanics. It's just something that when
you're not hitting the ball, it's nice to see yourself getting some
hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz a go: Ramon Ortiz will make his first start of 2000
tonight, a big deal for the club considering the scare he gave them
during spring training. On March 13, just before his scheduled
start against the Cubs in Mesa, Ariz., Ortiz felt tightness in his
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he was diagnosed with a small tear of the labrum
(tissue) in his right shoulder. The Angels took a cautious
approach, but he has passed every test and is ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy, my arm's feeling good,'' Ortiz said. ``This year my
arm's stronger than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's excited,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ''This guy's a
joy. There's only been one day I haven't seen him smile and that
was the day he was supposed to pitch against the Cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Belcher?: Tim Belcher threw between 45 and 50 pitches
in a simulated game Monday afternoon, but he wasn't as happy as
after his last workout. Belcher waved off reporters who approached
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim wasn't as sharp as he was the other day,'' Scioscia said.
``That happens in rehab. He'll be fine. He wasn't as good as far as
command or crispness of his breaking stuff. But it's not a setback.
Tim at times sets a huge ceiling for himself, as far as what it
should be. His expectations are far greater than what we're looking
for at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said it remains possible that Belcher will begin a
rehab assignment sometime next week.

STRUGGLING RAMON GETS THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There were many times last year when Ramon Martinez
turned to his wife, Doris, and with anguish in his voice asked if
she thought the time had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I give up?'' he would say.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Martinez knew the depths of the pain her husband felt in
his damaged right shoulder. And the frustration of not even being
able to pick up his children, 5-year-old Doranni or 3-year-old
Kisha, even as they clung to him, waiting to be lifted so they
could cover his face with kisses. She listened, and she encouraged
him to endure.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed to his new teammate, Bret Saberhagen, who knew the
agony of having a shoulder cut open and put back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him many times, `Did you feel this bad?' '' Martinez
said. ``I was shocked. I felt like I didn't want to pitch anymore.
Even grabbing a baseball hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `No, no, keep working, you'll be fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez went to his brother, Pedro, who knew how much he loved
the game, and how much pride he took in being one of the best, and
how much it worried him that he would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through hell,'' he told his younger brother.
``There's so much pain. I'm working so hard and I'm not seeing any
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, who lionized his older brother, wished he could
take the pain away. But all he could do was try to lift his brother
wih his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it,'' he said. ``I believe in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Through those long lonely months last summer, as Ramon Martinez
was working his way back to the big leagues by going back to the
lowest rungs of the minor leagues, he leaned on his wife, his new
friend, and his brother. And watching Pedro's brilliance from afar
carried him through his lowest moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about last year,'' he said, ``was watching
Pedro pitch. I felt I was in it. I was excited. It motivated me.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that he made it back in September, pitched
gallantly in the playoffs in October, and now is poised to pitch
the Red Sox' home opener against the Minnesota Twins. He is not
Pedro. He is not the Ramon he once was, the pitcher who struck out
18 Atlanta Braves one night in 1990 or the one who spun a no-hitter
against the Florida Marlins in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But neither should he be judged, he said, on his first start
last week in Seattle, when he gave up seven runs and recorded just
four outs _ the shortest start of his career in which he was not
injured or tuning up for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in baseball know what I am capable of doing,'' he
said Sunday morning in Anaheim, before his brother stopped a
four-game Sox losing streak with a 5-2 win over the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some of the fans, they still want to know more about me. I
feel that I don't have anything to prove, but I have to show them
more than my last start, which is the worst game I've had in a
while. I feel bad. I'm so competitive. I get so frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened. It can happen to anybody. But I'm 100 percent
sure that in October, when the season ends, I'll have good
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been three years since Ramon Martinez first tore the
rotator cuff in his right shoulder. He delayed having surgery for
as long as he could, but when he tore it even more the following
spring, he had the operation. That was June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He will be the first to tell you that he is not the same pitcher
who once relied on a fastball that consistently was 93-94 miles per
hour. He's in the 86-88 m.p.h. range now, occasionally touches 90,
and hopes that as his shoulder grows stronger, he'll add another
mile or two. He still has his changeup, one that Pedro says is even
better than his own, and as long as he keeps his pitches down,
Ramon said, he can be effective.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen in Seattle, His pitches were all over the
place. He walked five, and Jay Buhner hit a high changeup into the
next area code. At the time, Martinez refused to blame the weather,
but he said Sunday that, of course, it's harder to get loose in
cool weather once you've had surgery. And there were days in spring
training when he felt soreness in his shoulder. ``But that's only
because we were doing so much throwing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After watching video of his outing and huddling with pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan, Martinez is confident his problems are
correctable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top half of my body, I was rushing a little,'' he said.
``My left shoulder was kind of flying open, mostly in the stretch.
We worked on it (Saturday) it was fine. I have a better idea about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be games I struggle a little bit, but also
some real good games. As long as I'm healthy, I'm sure I will help
this team a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon the Elder said he hoped that Sunday's win by Pedro the
Younger would start a streak. He also knows that because Pedro had
Boston's only two wins during the season-opening six-game trip that
Boston fans will be skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez once worried aloud about how his brother would be
received in Boston. Ramon Martinez said the reception has been
beyond anything he has ever experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' he said. ``It feels nice. It feels tense. Every
pitch you throw counts. A guy gets a base hit, the crowd goes
crazy. Even when they boo, it's because they want so much to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Nomar (Garciaparra) and I asked him, because
he used to live in LA, if he ever thought about signing with the
Dodgers or Angels. He said, yeah, at first he wanted to play for
the Dodgers _ until he got to Boston and felt this atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dodger fans are kind of quiet. You can be pitching a no-hitter
into the sixth or seventh inning, they start getting excited. In
Boston, it's a lot different. Even in the first inning, it's like a
World Series, especially last year, when I faced the Yankees. It
was unbelievable. It was like you hear everybody screaming, every
single pitch you throw. It was a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, for the moment, comes not from the champion
Yankees, but from the penny-ante Twins. And while Martinez already
shudders about the forecast, there's no place he'd rather be than
on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, ``this is worth all the pain.''

AT MOSCOW THEME EATERY, SOVIET FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The sprawling, grim apartment block across the river
from the Kremlin, once home to Communist Party elites, seems like
an odd locale for a Soviet nostalgia trip.
</P>
<P>
   During Josef Stalin's purges of the 1930s, the building, known
as the House on the Embankment, was an epicenter of foreboding, the
starting point of many one-way journeys to Siberia, a grim monument
to a repressive regime that devoured its most ardent believers.
</P>
<P>
   But a new theme restaurant that serves Soviet soul food in the
basement of these infamous premises has taken a softer look at a
time and place that Americans associate with shortages and terror.
The new eatery is part of a broader trend in Russian society, if
not to whitewash the abuses and inequities of the Soviet era, then
at least to cull from Russia's recent past a sense of what was
good, and amusing, about the old days.
</P>
<P>
   The place is called Special Snack Bar No. 7, and to the Russian
ear, the name alone is evocative of the exclusive eateries of the
Soviet ruling class.
</P>
<P>
   Dining out was not a privilege available to everyone in
Communist times. But a walk down the stairs past Special Snack Bar
No. 7's surly, slightly suspicious doorman in his gray,
quasi-military uniform, leads to a scene that re-creates how
Communist Party officials, Red Army generals, scientists, and
writers favored by the regime might have enjoyed a meal back in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The decor is painstakingly created from such period objects as
shaded green lamps, heavy wooden chairs, modernist re-creations of
Soviet-era posters, and an old phonograph that cranks out popular
Soviet songs. The smallest details _ teacup holders, vodka shot
glasses, silverware, the lace aprons worn by the silent waitresses
over their short, gray skirts _ recall the spirit of the era.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are objects from a time that has gone, but for which
many people have a soft spot in their hearts,'' said manager
Alexandra Zotova. ``We have tried to re-create that atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   We would like to show you a picture, but photography on the
premises, perhaps in a nod to Soviet society's preoccupation with
secrecy and paranoia, is strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The fare, too, is reminiscent of the old days. This is Soviet
homestyle cooking, hearty, economically priced dishes with names
that gently send up the propaganda of the Communist era. Modern
Russian diners may snicker at entries titled ``Lenin's Testament''
(a thick vegetable soup), ``Beat the Bourgeois'' (a fried pork
cutlet) or ``Red Poultry Farmer Woman,'' (an egg buried under a
beet salad with mayonnaise), but the dishes are as quintessentially
Russian as burger and fries are American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We named our meals to remind our younger clients how people
lived back then,'' Zotova said. ``For many people, this is the food
they grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Zotova said the idea for Special Snack Bar No. 7 came from a
former club, for residents of the House on the Embankment only,
that had a similarly clunky name: Special Cafeteria Distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best food in town,'' said Emilia Nikolayevna, 62, a
longtime resident of the House on the Embankment. Nikolayevna
barely remembers the 1930s, but her parents told her it was a time
when the Party officials partied all night as they waited for
secret police to knock on their doors. Some 600 residents of the
House were victims of the purges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the complex is just another piece of prestigious real
estate. Many of the old elites moved out long ago. Wealthy
Russians, drawn by the spacious apartments, central location, and a
Western-style supermarket on the street level, have moved in. A
small museum tucked away in a courtyard is the only reminder of the
complex's grim history.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Special Snack Bar No. 7 steer clear of that theme.
That this place even exists is a sign of how much Russia has
changed. The Special Cafeteria Distributor was open into the 1990s,
the lean, early days of post-Communist Russia when the special
restaurants and stores for the privileged elite were still a sore
point with ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took time for people to see this era as a joke,'' Zotova
said.
</P>
<P>
   Time has allowed the bitterness to pass. At Josef's, a retro
roadside cafe in Yelets, 300 miles south of Moscow, Stalin is again
the heroic figure he was in the '30s, '40s, and '50s. The cafe is a
treasure trove of Stalin memorabilia _ plates, vases, and portraits
bearing the dictator's mustachioed likeness, and one of the few
Stalin busts still standing in Russia, all preserved with a
reverence that the ghosts of the House on the Embankment might have
trouble appreciating.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in keeping with the old Bolshevik motto, ``Don't Blab,''
no one at the cafe wanted to talk to an American reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Not all retro is so reverent. Many Russians like to reminisce
about the old days, but that does not mean they actually want to go
back to them. Andrei Bilzho, a well-known cartoonist and the owner
of Petrovich, a popular Moscow club, says people remember the
Soviet days first of all as the time when they were young.
</P>
<P>
   Petrovich re-creates a later era, the 1960s and 1970s, and a
different part of society: the communal apartment world of the
Soviet ``middle class.'' The decor, which Bilzho describes as
``Soviet rococo,'' is also created from period objects: the
exaggeratedly crooked water pipes, clunky television sets, and
faded magazines that cluttered Soviet apartments. Menus are served
in the lopsided folders where bureaucrats, engineers, and students
kept their papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things from our youth,'' Bilzho said. ``They give us
a warm feeling. People see the old radio from their grandma's
house, or an old pack of the Soyuz-Apollo cigarettes, and they
understand that there is something about a lot of the old things
that, like them or not, they are what you are all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The humor here is light satire of the kitschy propaganda of the
day, irony of the sort that used to be common at Soviet kitchen
tables, often the only place where people could speak their minds
safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petrovich's dream of Paris, where he has never been,'' is the
name of a mushroom julienne. ``No to Racism'' is an entry of
pancakes and caviar. A salad bar is stuffed with traditional Soviet
favorites like ``Herring in a Fur Coat,'' an incongruous concoction
of fish, beets, and mayonnaise. Throughout the restaurant are
pictures of Bilzho's famous cartoon character, Petrovich, a sort of
post-Soviet Dilbert, a Russian Everyman coping with his mixed-up
world.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bilzho insists his restaurant's message is apolitical,
there is meaning in the collection of Soviet-era junk he has
assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an action against the introduction of American
things,'' he said. ``Many of the old things are gone and all
replaced by plastic. We risk turning into this eternal McDonalds. I
want to stop it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can EMC Corp. keep all its disks spinning in the Internet age?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question for the maker of computer-data storage
devices, one of the region's biggest success stories. EMC has long
kept several steps ahead of competitors, but it now faces a new set
of challenges posed by the growth of the Web and changes in storage
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopkinton, Mass. company designs and sells refrigerator-size
cabinets stuffed with disk drives. EMC's devices have become the
industry standard for business customers, ranging from large banks
and airlines to small e-commerce start-ups, that need to keep track
of vast amounts of computer data.
</P>
<P>
   Orders have boomed as these companies scramble to do business on
the Web, and EMC has gained market share at the expense of such
rivals as IBM and Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Investors understand and like EMC's business model _ a supplier
akin to the outfitters who sold pans and shovels to prospectors
during the Gold Rush. EMC's share price has more than doubled since
last year to give it a market value of nearly $150 billion, the
most of any public company in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But the online forces that have benefited EMC are also shifting
the competitive landscape.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, EMC's fastest-growing customers today include
many small dot-com start-ups rather than major corporations, and
EMC may have a difficult time retaining their loyalty against
competitors offering cheaper devices.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the Web has also given rise to a new generation
of companies that sell data-storage online. Their service enables
customers to store data remotely, potentially eliminating the need
for companies to own storage devices themselves. EMC has
investments in a few of these new storage providers, but some
analysts regard them as a long-term threat nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   All this, plus a pair of recent high-level departures, has
created a new round of strategic hurdles for EMC chief executive
Michael Ruettgers and Joseph Tucci, the former Wang Global chief
executive named EMC's president in January. They must prove EMC can
dominate the dot-com market and sort out relations with the online
storage providers.
</P>
<P>
   EMC also needs to maintain its hard-driving sales culture even
as it roughly doubles its work force in two years. By December, it
will have 21,500 employees, including 8,000 in Massachusetts. Much
of the increase stems from EMC's $1 billion purchase of Data
General Corp. of Westborough, Mass. last year, which gave EMC a
line of cheap storage devices to sell to smaller customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers said the company is focused on the opportunities
emerging in the storage market. He said dot-com companies accounted
for 14 percent of EMC's revenue last quarter, up from 2 percent a
year earlier, and he expects that percentage to increase as new
companies start to build computer systems from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, he said EMC is not only on track but will substantially
grow its revenue to $12 billion next year from $6.7 billion in
1999, with profits increasing proportionally. The total storage
market could grow to as much as $80 billion by next year, from
around $35 billion today, he projected, an increase chiefly driven
by the demands of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's heavy research and development spending _ $1.7 billion
this year and next _ will also create new software to make EMC's
disk-drive assemblies more flexible and reliable for all sorts of
tasks for customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a market that may not have any limits, and we're
certainly in the sweet spot as far as the technology is
concerned,'' Ruettgers said, referring to the new software.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics question whether EMC can continue its string of
successful quarters indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Storage analyst Gary Helmig of SoundView Technology Group thinks
EMC could suffer as the battle for market share intensifies.
``Storage will be one of the cornerstones of the Internet, and
everybody wants a piece of it'' Helmig said.
</P>
<P>
   Doubters also point to the exit of some high-level managers.
Last week Robert Dutkowsky stepped down from his job heading the
Data General division to join another company.
</P>
<P>
   In January, EMC's top sales executive, Harry Dixon, also left
amid disagreements about his ownership of shares in one of the new
online-storage companies, according to several people familiar with
the dispute. In a statement, EMC called that description an
``oversimplification'' but declined to elaborate. Dixon, now a
director at StorageNetworks Inc. in Waltham, Mass., didn't return
messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these departures, others note EMC has overcome plenty of
challenges in the past year. It has gained market share despite the
vows by IBM, Compaq, and Hewlett-Packard to catch up with new
products and marketing alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition just underestimated the difficulty of bringing
out the kind of product and features that EMC can provide,'' said
Phil Rueppel, analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Rueppel said much will depend on the reception EMC gets for new
software it plans to roll out later this month designed to make it
easier for companies to copy databases and retrieve information
across big computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EMC was founded by Richard Egan and Roger Marino in 1979 as a
maker of memory boards for minicomputers. Egan was the E, and
Marino the M, in the company's name (Egan remains chairman); the C
was a third partner, whom they won't identify, who dropped out just
as the company was getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers got the top job in 1988 as the company was suffering
from slowing sales and losing money. Two years later, he restored
the company's profitability by turning it into a supplier of
storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, storage accounted for a small fraction, less than 5
percent, of the total spending on information technology at most
large companies. The balance went to buy ever-faster mainframe and
server computers and networks to link them.
</P>
<P>
   Computer processing speeds advanced rapidly as a result,
allowing companies to collect far more information. Companies then
had to spend more to keep track of it. Forrester Research estimates
that storage accounted for around half of the total cost of major
corporate computer purchases last year, and that could rise to
nearly 75 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's expertise lies in packaging hundreds of disk drives with
proprietary circuits and fiber-optic cables. The assemblies can
locate and transmit data seconds faster than other formats, such as
the magnetic tape drives that were previously used to store
computer data.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds may not seem important, but it matters greatly to
Web site operators who have found users grow impatient if it takes
eight seconds or longer for a Web page to download. ``EMC plays a
huge role in ensuring that our customers receive prompt response
time,'' says John Hnanicek, chief information officer at online
retailer eToys.
</P>
<P>
   EMC doesn't manufacture drives itself. It buys millions of them
each year from vendors such as IBM and Seagate. As a result, EMC
for years was seen as a supporting player in the storage industry.
But its revenues took off as its products gained a reputation for
reliability and performance. Profits rose, too; last year, EMC's
net income rose 50 percent to $1.18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The increase shows that customers have stuck with EMC even
though they say EMC typically charges 30 percent or more than its
competitors for systems that store similar amounts of data.

SUPERE-FAST CHIPS ADVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer chips tend to get faster and more energy efficient as
they get smaller. But it's also harder to make these smaller chips
work properly, which is why a new breakthrough by scientists at IBM
Corp. may soon be emulated throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's laboratories have a strong reputation for developments in
pure science _ the company's researchers have won five Nobel
Prizes. But most of the work at IBM's labs is intended to produce
better and more products. And improving the performance of
microprocessors is a high priority at the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, IBM scientists figured out a way to use copper instead
of aluminum to create the tiny circuits that connect the millions
of transistors on a microchip. Copper is a much better conductor of
electricity than aluminum, says Bijan Davari, a vice president at
IBM's Semiconductor Research and Development Center in East
Fishkill, N.Y. ``(With) aluminum, the resistance is too high,''
Davari says.
</P>
<P>
   By switching to copper-based chips, each circuit can be made
thinner without losing the ability to carry electrons. In addition,
these smaller chips will run cooler and use less electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But there are miles of these tiny copper circuits on each chip.
Today's circuits are incredibly small _ only 0.18 micron, hundreds
of times thinner than a human hair. Now IBM wants to build chips
with circuits just 0.13 micron wide, and with just 0.1 micron of
space between any two circuits.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a problem. ``When they get that close,'' says Davari,
``they start interacting with each other.'' There's electrical
interference or ``crosstalk'' between the circuits. And that can
cause the chips to become unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   What was needed was a new kind of insulator that could fit in
those 0.1 micron gaps and seal off the circuits from each other.
Davari says that he and his lab mates have developed it. It's not a
glamorous or romantic sort of breakthrough, but it's vital for the
production of powerful chips that consume little electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the chips that drive today's portable devices, like
cell phones and handheld computers. Most of these devices offer
very limited functions, in order to preserve their limited
batteries. There's no way today's Palm Pilot could include a
computer chip powerful enough to recognize and transcribe your
voice, so that you could take notes simply by talking to it.
</P>
<P>
   Davari says that his research will help make it possible to make
chips that are more than powerful enough, and can still be driven
by a small battery. ``It allows you to reduce the power dissipation
by a factor of two, three, four,'' says Davari.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the recent ballyhoo about chips from Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. that have speeds as high as one
gigahertz. These superfast chips run in power-gobbling desktop
computers. But Davari says that in a few years, IBM's technology
will lead to the development of equally powerful chips that'll run
for hours in pocket-size devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM has always been one of the leaders in terms of making
these kinds of enhancements,'' says Nathan Brookwood, principal
analyst for the market research firm Insight 64 in Saratoga, Calif.
Other firms are embracing IBM-style copper chips. In the same way,
Brookwook expects that IBM's circuit-insulation ideas will catch on
throughout a chip industry that faces the big challenge of making
its products smaller.

TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION IS SHAKING THE IVORY TOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Colleges and universities, once slow to change, suddenly are
running on Internet time. High-tech classrooms, visiting
entrepreneurs, and distance-learning programs are commonplace. And
now business school curricula is being refashioned.
</P>
<P>
   MIT was one of the first to embrace electronic commerce. Last
fall, it established an e-Business track at its Sloan School of
Management and a Center for eBusiness(at)MIT to research e-commerce
issues ranging from pricing and profits to digital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Other graduate business schools are similarly grappling with
technology-driven changes, pushed in part by the interests of their
tech-savvy students. More than a dozen US business schools are
overhauling or reshaping their programs and courses to focus on
technology or to integrate it into their overall training.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always an easy transition at leafy campuses where the
new economy can seem remote. But institutions that have long prided
themselves on teaching the tried and true economic and management
philosophies are retooling.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth College's Amos Tuck School, marking its centennial
this year, calls itself the oldest graduate business school in the
world. Next January, it will roll out a new curriculum with
technology at its core. Included will be the Tuck General
Management Forum, requiring every first-year student to craft a
business plan that will incorporate technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just want to be a repository of tradition,'' said
Philip Anderson, associate professor of business administration,
who will be teaching a technology course to first-year Tuck
students under the new curriculum. ``We want to start our second
century by innovating.''
</P>
<P>
   Within academia, a debate is emerging over how to integrate
technology with business education. Sloan and a few like-minded
schools have designated e-commerce as a separate discipline, at
least for now. Other schools, such as Tuck, are weaving technology
into all management training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't put the Tuck brand on anyone who doesn't have a
fundamental understanding of technology,'' Anderson insisted.
``It's no longer a specialty, something that can be delegated to a
chief technology officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader Tavassoli, director of the e-Business track at Sloan, has
a different take. ``Given the speed of changes, we decided to make
a strong commitment,'' Tavassoli said, though he acknowledged the
e-business track might only be ``a transitional solution for maybe
five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph G. Morone, president of Bentley College, said the school
began offering an Information Age MBA last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of our entire graduate school, and our entire
institution,'' Morone said, ``is the integration of information
technology into the core business curriculum. Every core field of
business is being transformed by the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Tap into Harvard
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to go to Harvard Business School to tap its
intellectual capital. A new portal called HBS Working Knowledge
(www.hbsworkingknowledge.hbs.edu) lets you do it online.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Michalak, executive director of HBS's Baker Library, said
the concept for the Web site came from HBS graduates who wanted
useful and concise information that could help them in their
business lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our alumni were having withdrawal symptoms,'' Michalak said.
``They didn't want to read lots of stuff. They wanted `just enough,
just in time and just what I'm looking for.' ''
</P>
<P>
   HBS Working Knowledge launched for HBS alums last October; it
was opened to the public in December. Michalak said 4,400 people
have registered, about half of them alums.
</P>
<P>
   Among its features are summaries from Harvard Business Review
articles and the HBS Toolkit, a lifetime customer value calculator
for business people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the essence of technology-assisted education,'' said
Judy Uhl, vice president for higher education at HBS Publishing.
``We're using the computer to teach people.''

<P>
   Even the staunchest believers in technology stocks have had
their faith tested in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   For mutual fund investors, it's meant hanging on while
tech-heavy portfolios were pummeled _ and seeing that a euphoric
ride up can be grim on the way back down.
</P>
<P>
   Though last week was dramatic, with two violent days for the
Nasdaq Composite index, technology stocks have in fact been under
pressure since March 10, their recent high point. They've tumbled
nearly 12 percent since then, more than halving their gains since
the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very active quarter because the changes in the
market have been so drastic,'' said Gary Craven, manager of
Evergreen's successful Small Company Growth fund, who has been
standing up to the pressure admirably.
</P>
<P>
   Craven's $1.5 billion fund gained 18 percent in first-quarter
2000, while his peers tracked by Lipper Inc. in the
mid-capitalization growth group were up 17 percent, on average.
Year-to-date through Thursday, he was still up 13.6 percent,
outperforming the average 11.9 percent for the group.
</P>
<P>
   While tech stocks and biotechnology were the only place to be at
the end of 1999 and early this year, by late February, Craven
explained, those sectors had moved ``too far, too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the slump in the second half of March, aggressive
growth fund investors had little to complain about in the first
quarter. Mid-cap growth funds surged 17 percent, according to
Lipper; small-cap growth funds charged ahead 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret which sectors fared best. Science and technology
funds jumped nearly 18 percent in the quarter, while investors in
health and biotechnology funds enjoyed an 18.2 percent rise.
Telecommunications funds gained 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's gyrations, the small and the tech-oriented
funds have easily outpaced large stock funds this year. Craven
thinks that's where the best bets still lie as he looks ahead
through year-end. ``It's still the most attractive part of the
domestic market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's picky. He trimmed back his biotech holdings after
prices soared; some are again attractive, he suggests. He likes
technology, but avoids frivolous Internet plays. He's interested in
wireless companies and Web infrastructure. Those with no plans for
profitability need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms, both B2C and B2B, are really getting to the
point where they have to deliver,'' Craven said, ``and make it
clear how they're going to grow and ultimately make money.''
</P>
<P>
   The awakening to the risks of the market's Internet darlings
could push gains in other parts of the market, experts contend.
Large companies are having to become more serious about doing
business online, and those in the lagging ``value'' category, such
as construction, steel, and financial services, are trying to
remake themselves to compete with start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Goodman, chief economist at Putnam Investments in Boston,
calls this phenomenon the rise of the new old-economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the next six months, a new theme is going to develop on
Wall Street,'' Goodman predicted. The cyclical companies, he said,
are ``taking on growth-like characteristics and therefore should be
accorded growth valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a big shift in thinking. Value funds have posted
lackluster returns this year, not exceeding 5.8 percent on average.
Not since a brief period last April has value outpaced growth as a
category.
</P>
<P>
   One week is hardly enough to build a crystal ball around. But
last week, as tech funds were slumping 3.7 percent, large-cap value
funds rose 1.7 percent. Small- and mid-cap value funds gained more
than a percent each, as well.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, value funds are ahead of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index _ the large-cap growth benchmark _ which gained 0.9 percent
last week and is up a modest 2.3 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rosenbaum, research director at Lipper, called the recent
value gains ``further indication of a change of leadership in the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   But he warns against having too many eggs in any basket. ``This
market has been giving investors a wake-up call since March,'' he
said. ``Please examine your assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The best idea, of course, is to be exposed to all sectors.
Putnam's Goodman does not suggest shifting out of growth funds, but
adding new money to value funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tech area is alive and well,'' he said, and the bull
market is still chugging along. The trouble, he said, is that some
people have lost track of the level of risk they've taken on.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's because their aggressive funds have reaped such
strong returns that they now make up a larger part of their
portfolio than was intended. Others, Goodman said, ``think they can
just get on a computer and buy stocks they know nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies clearly believe there will be a continuing
appetite for technology-focused funds. Some are jumping on the
bandwagon late, having missed last year's dot-com frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Mutual Funds of Boston just kicked off a Science and
Technology fund, citing a ``dynamic and rewarding investment
sector.'' Boston-based MFS Funds is rolling out a technology fund
this month, despite its stance that profitless Internet stocks
don't meet its investment standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are big technology investors,'' MFS spokesman John Reilly
said. ``We also pay close attention to valuations. We're going to
use the same research discipline we use in everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly admits the timing could be better: ``Sometimes the knees
are a little weak after a sell-off,'' he said. ``We think it's
still an area of great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only on US soil that small growth funds have fared best
so far in 2000. International small-cap funds climbed 13.1 percent
in the first quarter. Other strong areas included China region
funds, which surged 14.8 percent _ making it the strongest gaining
foreign sector of the past 12 months. Canadian funds followed, up
10.9 percent. European funds notched a 5.9 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   Japan funds slumped 3 percent in the quarter, after their vast
rise of last year. Latin American funds rose 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, everybody's expecting volatile markets in the
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Said Craven, ``We've had it pretty easy for the past year.''
Look for a strong year, he said, but ``the second quarter should
prove to be challenging.''

 UNDATED: ... of data.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The size of its systems is measured in units called
``terabytes.'' One terabyte is the equivalent of a library of a
million books. A typical EMC customer is Gelco Information Network
in Minneapolis, which manages travel and expense accounts for other
companies. Recently, it spent $1.5 million for a system that can
manage up to three terabytes of information.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Peterson, a Gelco technology planner, said he considered a
system from IBM that would have cost around $1 million, but chose
EMC because it offered better software to back up and copy
databases.
</P>
<P>
   EMC says its prices are comparable to its competitors when
services and software are factored in. But analysts try to track
the premiums that EMC can get for its equipment as indication of
the company's technical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``EMC is almost always significantly more expensive than their
than their competitors,'' said Gartner Group analyst Stan Zaffos.
``But if you look at EMC as a company, they've got focus and they
invest in their vision. And people like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors insist its prices make EMC vulnerable. ``We can live
on much lower margins'' said Mark Lewis, a Compaq vice president.
IBM recently said it would hire 1,000 new sales specialists to tout
the cost advantages of its own equipment.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also points to customers like Peter Flaherty, a technology
manager at a Bayer Corp. division in Medfield, Mass. Flaherty
recently bought an IBM storage system partly for its lower price
and partly because the IBM servers he already owned ``sometimes get
confused'' by data stored on EMC machines. ``Sometimes it's simpler
to go with all from the same vendor,'' Flaherty said.
</P>
<P>
   EMC hopes to end such talk with software that makes it easier
for customers to use their data for tasks such as duplicating
databases full of payroll or purchase records. It will spend $1.3
billion on software research this year and next. Software accounted
for about 11 percent of its revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its traditional competitors, EMC also must come
to terms with a new set of virtual storage sellers.
</P>
<P>
   These are the companies known as ``storage utility providers,''
such as StorageNetworksInc. in Waltham, Mass. and Driveway.com in
San Francisco. These companies buy storage equipment from a variety
of vendors and lease access to other companies, either through
high-speed telecommunciations lines or the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these companies say they aren't specifically targeting
EMC, but some observers think they could pose a threat by draining
away the customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could displace a lot of the capacity that EMC might have
sold directly'' at a greater profit, said John Webster, storage
analyst at Illuminata group in Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   EMC executives say they don't regard the storage utility
providers as competition, and point out that EMC has already sold
the start-ups millions of dollars worth of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Hedging its bets, EMC has also made investments of its own in
the storage providers, buying a minority stake in Driveway.com and
holding discussions with X:drive in Santa Monica, Calif., and
zDisk.com in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the new storage providers will ``become a sales
channel for us'' and increase overall demand for storage, said
Ruettgers.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bell, chief executive of StorageNetworks and a former EMC
employee, agrees. Bell notes that EMC still pays its own sales
people commissions when they convince customers such as Merrill
Lynch to specify EMC equipment when ordering space in
StorageNetworks' data centers. ``I can't think of how we'd be
competitors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, EMC and StorageNetworks have a complex relationship.
Investors in StorageNetworks include EMC rival Dell Computer Corp.,
and executives from Compaq and Sun Microsystems, two other
competitors, serve as technical advisers. EMC cofounder Marino is a
StorageNetworks board member, as is Harry Dixon, the former EMC
sales chief who quit in January. (Like Dixon, Marino didn't return
messages seeking comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Some customers say they have signed up to use StorageNetworks to
avoid the cost and attention needed to own storage devices
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one less thing we have on our plate,'' said Greg
Strakosch, chief executive of TechTarget.com in Dedham, Mass. The
company operates a series of e-commerce Web sites devoted to
technical topics.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers says many companies that start out with
StorageNetworks might eventually buy their own gear instead _ and
EMC would be happy to supply it. Because they are building systems
from scratch, these companies' demands can be extremely large.
``Suddenly you have these little companies buying more storage than
the major banks,'' Ruettgers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet all comes down to access to information,'' he
said. ``We want to be the company that can provide it.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Imagine you were a nerdy 14-year-old in Philadelphia in
the 1950s, a science-fair kid enraptured by a gee-whiz book called
``Giant Brains or Machines That Think'' that forecast an astounding
future for computers.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine hanging onto that rapture through high school and
college, not dropping it as an adolescent fantasy, but actually
shaping your career around it, knowing there would be a computer
revolution back when the transistor was the epitome of high
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being Patrick J. McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, soft-spoken, worth billions now, McGovern could be the
archetypal geek. His career, dating to his first job in a one-room
office in Newtonville, Mass. in 1959, has moved seamlessly from the
days of the mainframe behemoths, to the minicomputers of the '70s,
to the PCs and Macs of the '80s, to the Web, handhelds, wireless,
B-to-B, and whatever the sizzle of the next
</P>
<P>
   nanosecond is likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   How did he know way back when that computers were no flash in
the pan?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mainframe era, we identified 140,000 people around the
world who used computers,'' McGovern said in an interview at the
headquarters of his privately held International Data Group. ``We
predicted that based on miniaturization and other factors there
would be one billion users by the year 2000. . . . By the end of
1999 there were 950 million users.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith in that uncannily accurate forecast enabled McGovern to
make his fortune the way the real money was made during the
California gold rush: by selling shovels to the miners.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern owns some of the world's most influential publications,
databases, and trade shows in high tech _ from the annual Macworld
Expo and a dozen others like it to the high-flying weekly Industry
Standard magazine to the hugely popular ``For Dummies'' book series
to a raft of PC and networking journals from Boston to Beijing. In
China alone, his tech magazines make him the biggest foreign
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at 62, McGovern can easily blend into a crowd, even in
Boston where he has been based for 36 years. He does not enjoy the
celebrity status of a Steven Jobs, Bill Gates, or Steve Case. Few
would term him insanely great, outrageously outspoken, or a pirate
of Silicon Valley. He even eschews the techie tie-less look,
favoring straight-ahead business suits, white shirts, and
conservative neckware.
</P>
<P>
   His main interest outside his company is MIT, from which he has
a degree in biophysics and where he is a trustee. McGovern and his
wife, Lore Harp McGovern, recently made headlines by donating a
whopping $350 million to the creation of a McGovern Institute for
Brain Research at MIT. He also quietly supports the Handel &AMP; Haydn
Society, works to promote classical music education in Boston
schools, has offered modest backing to Democrats such as former
governor Michael S. Dukakis, and chips in for various worthy
causes.
</P>
<P>
   But his local profile is low. Howard Foley, president of the
Massachusetts High Technology Council, said he hasn't talked with
McGovern for 10 years, but chalked that up to the global direction
McGovern has taken since making his headquarters in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt he was a couple of chapters ahead of us,'' Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
   While McGovern maintains a home in Hollis, N.H., and another in
the San Francisco area, he really lives in hotels. He logged
400,000 miles and spent 20 weeks on airplanes last year, he said.
Even at IDG headquarters, he can't settle. He works at a standup
desk.
</P>
<P>
   And here's an example of how his companies sell shovels to gold
miners: When Microsoft formally launched Windows 2000 on Feb. 17,
IDG's events division provided the presentation stage at the San
Francisco conference site. The company also launched a publication
for people who deal with the operating system, brought out 15 books
on Windows 2000, developed a special Web site, and then began
gathering data on Windows 2000 usage for sale to industry
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   There's revenue in all of those ventures, said Kelly Conlin,
IDG's CEO. Despite the close relationship with the Redmond, Wash.,
giant and other software powerhouses who advertise with or
otherwise engage the services of IDG, Conlin said, McGovern has
never allowed his publications' editorial independence to be
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   This despite the fact that, as far as can be gleaned from
everyone _ even rivals _ the man's a teddy bear. He is known (don't
groan) as the company's ``chief encouragement officer'' and
universally referred to as plain old ``Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees have good reason to be happy. McGovern has enriched
hundreds of them through an employee stock ownership program. His
far-flung enterprises are all run as virtually independent nations.
He advises and counsels but doesn't micromanage.
</P>
<P>
   He spends most of his time as head cheerleader. Some of this
verges on the shmaltzy. For instance, he writes ``good news notes''
on rainbow-decorated paper to his employees. He personally hands
out bonuses to the 5,000 US staffers, a feat that takes him from
Dec. 1 to Dec. 16 each year. He squires every employee _ there are
another 7,000 IDG workers outside the United States _ to dinner on
his or her 10th anniversary with the company.
</P>
<P>
   His $2.6 billion business could be called Pat's Info Shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``At heart, Pat is a familial figure,'' said John Battelle,
chairman of the Industry Standard, the San Francisco-based Internet
business magazine that has been one of McGovern's recent
Midas-touch creations. ``He loves his company. He is not a
fist-pounding organization man. He is not a temperamental visionary
like Jobs, he is not a hands-on manager like Jack Welsh'' of
General Electric. ``He is his own character.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern acts as an in-house venture capitalist and allows each
of his 120 units the latitude of an independent company. Where he
differs from every other new-age executive is that McGovern has
been letting a thousand flowers bloom since the late '60s _ long,
long before it became popular. Back then, the very model of a
corporation was the central-command approach of a Harold Geneen of
ITT.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1968, I had only been in business for four years and
typically I wanted to stay in charge of everything,'' he said.
``I'd make all the decisions and sign all the checks.''
</P>
<P>
   That couldn't last. McGovern came up with a three-point plan:
Conduct thorough market research; hire a passionate person to run
the new venture; provide assistance, training, funding, and backup
but otherwise stand back. Each time one of his units gets to
200-300 people, he splits it off. That size, he says, is optimum
for growth and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one case every couple of years where we have to
change a CEO because of bad business performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his great recent successes has been IDG Books based in
Foster City, Calif. When McGovern appointed John Kilcullen to run
the unit in 1990, it was publishing uninspired technical manuals
and losing money. Kilcullen said he recalled a friend needing to
learn Microsoft's DOS programming language but being frustrated
because the manuals were too wonky. What he needed, he complained,
was ``DOS for dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   A light bulb went on. Kilcullen brought the ``For Dummies'' idea
to McGovern. There are now more than 400 titles, as far afield as
``Sex for Dummies,'' and 75 million copies in print. IDG Books
Worldwide had revenues of $180 million last year and has acquired
CliffsNotes, Frommer's guides, and the publishing rights to the
Betty Crocker and Weight Watchers brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that in the future the new brands for
education won't be Harvard, Columbia, or Yale,'' Kilcullen says
boldly. ``They'll be `Cliff's College' or `Dummies College.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For years, IDG's chief rival was Ziff Communications, which had
PC Week, a direct rival to McGovern's ComputerWorld. Both were
privately owned companies. Ziff's approach was to concentrate on
the domestic market; IDG went global.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s it was very much like Coke and Pepsi'' between IDG
and Ziff, said Michael Kolowich, former president of ZDNet, an
offspring of Ziff-Davis. ``I'm not sure I really saw the global
synergy'' that McGovern pursued. And McGovern's approach prevailed.
With Bill Ziff's retirement in 1994, the Ziff empire has been been
parceled out.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern himself gives no indication of retiring, though his new
MIT research center will keep him in town more, and a recent public
offering of IDG Books and a planned one for the Industry Standard
may indicate a gradual breakup of IDG as well.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern sees his future linked to the new MIT brain center. It
is an interest, he said, that has remained constant throughout his
career, beginning with that ``Giant Brains'' book written,
coincidently, by computer pioneer Edmund Berkeley, who hired
McGovern for that Newtonville job at a pioneering magazine called
Computers and Automation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sure that there are better ways of presenting
information that will produce better learning, better
communications, and better education,'' he said. ``For instance,
only 15 to 20 percent of the information received by the optic
nerve is being sent back to the visual cortex. A lot of what we are
seeing is sampling, which is why eyewitnesses have different
recollections of what has happened. Perhaps we could improve
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rupert Murdoch or Bill Gates started talking about tinkering
with your visual cortex, it would sound chilling. Plain old Pat
just sounds helpful.

NASDAQ NOSEDIVE A RUDE AWAKENING FOR DOT-COM INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nasdaq nosedive was rude awakening for dot-com investors
</P>
<P>
   Something snapped last week.
</P>
<P>
   The giddiness, the smugness, was gone. Worry crept into the tone
of venture capitalists as they sought to reassure their investors,
to calm the nerves of IPO-hungry entrepreneurs and to pretend they
weren't sobered by the prospect of a cooling stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``One deal blowing up after another,'' grumbled one venture
capital partner, cursing under his breath as he rushed from a phone
conference into a meeting last week. ``This is ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a two-day plunge in the Nasdaq to bring reality back
into focus. The dive, following a few rocky weeks for tech stocks,
knocked some lofty Internet-related shares off their highs by half.
And the ride down came with a bleakness the dot-com world has been
dreading.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies on the brink of going public are now
scrambling to keep their plans on target, even as some investment
bankers are urging them to hold off.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, old economy IPOs such as Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and
MetLife zoomed unexpectedly last week, as investors lunged for
companies with track records and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Julian Robertson should have held on a bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of New York's famed Tiger Management hedge fund is
shutting down his operation because technology stocks have so badly
outrun his preferred playing ground of out-of-favor value stocks
for the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no quick end in sight . . . (to) the bear market in
value stocks,'' Robertson lamented in a March 30 letter to his
investors. He also predicted darkly, ``The current technology,
Internet and telecom craze, fueled by the performance desires of
investors, money managers and even financial buyers, is unwittingly
creating a Ponzi pyramid destined for collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been the battle cry of value folks for some time now.
And it rang hollow until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Now the venture community finds itself at the heart of this
vexing time for investors. Venture firms must balance the demands
of their investors _ who have entrusted them with hundreds of
millions of dollars to invest, at what may be the market's peak _
with their own unbridled optimism and love of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so many good deals,'' says Dan Nova, a
managing general partner with Highland Capital Partners in Boston.
He dismisses the notion that there's too much money chasing too few
deals. But he acknowledges that the smart money is not ignoring the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: If the portfolio managers at places like Fidelity
Investments and big pension funds don't want to buy the stocks the
venture gurus are bringing out, the IPOs will flop.
</P>
<P>
   This environment is going to demand more patience, says Michael
Carusi, a general partner with Advanced Technology Ventures in
Waltham, Mass. Venture firms may have to taper their investments in
new companies, he says. That's because the companies they've
already invested in may need additional rounds of funding if they
can't go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very careful,'' says Carusi, who with his partners
raised a $400 million fund, ATV's sixth, in January.
</P>
<P>
   How are venture investors, such as pension funds and endowments,
feeling after last week's stock market scare? The experienced ones
seem to be taking it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Says Scott Henderson, executive director of Massachusetts' $32
billion pension fund for state workers, ``We're long-term investors
in this asset class as in every other asset class.'' The returns in
venture capital have been extraordinary lately, he says, adding,
``But we don't expect them to last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Newer entrants to venture investing may not realize the ups and
downs they're in for. Some have loaded up on venture capital for
the first time ever. Says one Boston venture capitalist of the slew
of newcomers, ``It's amateur time.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Putnam Investments' parent, insurance broker Marsh &AMP; McLennan
Cos., is getting deeper into private equity.
</P>
<P>
   MarshMac's Marsh &AMP; McLennan Capital Inc. has launched a

INTERNET WORLD IS A FREE-FOR-ALL FOR CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the land of the free last week at Internet
World, the semi-annual conference of all things connected with the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   There were free briefcases, free martinis, free long-distance
phone calls, free high-speed Internet access, free legal advice _
even free money.
</P>
<P>
   All this added a frenzied quality to the meanderings of the
40,000 convention goers. They buzzed from booth to booth in search
of giveaways, dragging away giant bags ladened with stuffed
animals, T-shirts, keychains, yo-yos, rubber stress balls,
chocolate malted milk balls, and Chinese ``tranquility'' balls.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't free, it wasn't worth considering. Companies that
came empty-handed sat embarrassingly idle as neighboring booths
bearing gifts were mobbed.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the free-for-all, it would be tempting to conclude that
this collection of tchotchkes would make a telling time capsule of
the Internet Age, where billions of venture-backed marketing
dollars are flung away in a desperate attempt to garner attention.
</P>
<P>
   For the consumer, the goods technically were free. That, of
course, wasn't the case. Take for example, the money booth,
sponsored by Namezero.com, which was also giving away registrations
to Internet domain names, a service that normally costs between $35
and $70 a year per name.
</P>
<P>
   In the money booth, cash blew about while participants flailed
around grabbing as many dollar bills as possible in 20 seconds. The
hourly event made for a good spectacle, and it attracted dozens of
people at each giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for a chance at the money booth, people had to sign
up for a ``free'' domain name and walk around the convention
wearing buttons bearing the company's name and logo. The domain _
say, www.yourname.com _ would be free of annual registration fees
as long as the registrant hosts a banner advertisement on his or
her site.
</P>
<P>
   ``How free is free?'' asked Bobby Orbach, a scout for Techfarm,
a California start-up incubator, who was attending his fifth
Internet World. ``The vast majority of the time, there's always a
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Another company, FreeDSL.com in Newport Beach, Calif., gave away
high-speed Internet access, a service that typically costs $50 a
month. In exchange, consumers had to put up with ads and allow the
company to track their Internet surfing patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that they're watching you all the time,'' said
Orbach, who noted that many such companies are cropping up
throughout the country. In other words, the bargain often requires
consumers to give up a degree of privacy and grant companies the
possibility of future sales, Orbach said.
</P>
<P>
   FreeRide.com, in its name alone, sums up this new economy ethos.
The New York company awards points to consumers who surf and buy
products through its site. The points can be redeemed for books,
music, movie tickets, and a host of other items.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, gimmicky giveaways have existed for as long as
technology conventions have been around. But the unprecedented flow
of venture capital money into Internet companies has raised the
stakes and given companies free reign to promote their products and
services. The result is a one-upmanship that prompts companies to
be ever more flashy in their freebies, say those who have attended
such conventions for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are going to spend most of their money on
marketing. And that means pens, billboards, booze, and just about
anything that gets attention over the noise level, because the
noise level right now is very high,'' said John C. Dvorak, a
technology columnist and veteran convention goer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether companies get their money's worth is anyone's guess,
particularly when all the free gizmos start to look alike and
consumers get better at glazing over the company logos on their
mugs and pens.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dvorkak: ``The fact is, most of these companies are not
very memorable.''

GROUP AIMING FOR WEB ACCESS VIA ELECTRICAL OUTLETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A consortium of some of the technology industry's heaviest
hitters was to announce this week an effort that would eventually
allow consumers to connect their appliances to the Internet through
ordinary electrical outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is called HomePlug and is being tested at the
Chelmsford, Mass. laboratories of Cisco Systems Inc. It is being
heralded by its backers as a novel and inexpensive way for
consumers to bring the Internet to the plethora of gadgets
anticipated to flood the average home.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to take advantage of the electrical outlets that
already exist in abundance in virtually every American home rather
than rely on the far fewer numbers of phone jacks or cable outlets
to plug everything from televisions and toasters to stereos and
personal computers to the Internet. Once plugged in, the devices
will also ``talk'' to one another, so consumers, for example, can
turn on the coffee maker with their PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the premier technology for home
networking,'' said Philip Hunt, vice president of the HomePlug
Powerline Alliance. The consortium includes Cisco, Compaq, Intel
Corp., 3COM, Advanced MicroDevices Inc., Motorola, Texas
Instruments, Radio Shack, Diamond Multimedia, Intellon, Conexant,
and Enikia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power plugs are ubiquitous,'' Hunt said. ``They're everywhere.
And they're convenient. If you have a power cord on it today, we
can connect it tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Mantovani, president of HomePlug, said the ability to
use existing power lines is especially attractive in countries
outside the United States, where the ratio of phone jacks to
electrical outlets is much lower. In the United States, the average
house has 40 electrical plugs and 3.5 phone jacks. In other
countries, the average is 30 power plugs and 1.5 phone jacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go outside the US, the availability of phone lines
suddenly becomes very limited,'' Mantovani said.
</P>
<P>
   HomePlug will not actually provide Internet service; companies
such as America Online and Bell Atlantic will continue to sell
Internet access. Rather, HomePlug creates a way for multiple
gadgets and computers to share that Internet connection without
having to wire everything to a central modem.
</P>
<P>
   The market for home networking is potentially immense. More than
30 million homes, roughly 30 percent of all US households, will
have more than one computer by the end of the year, Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of homes that network those computers together is
tiny and the number of those that will use electrical plug as a
means to networking those computers is smaller still, according to
estimates from International Data Corp., a technology consulting
firm based in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 4.3 million households are expected to have home
networks, but only a fraction of those homes will rely on power
lines to link their computers, said Schelley Olhava, research
analyst with IDC. Meanwhile, other methods using wireless,
ethernet, and phone technology are more popular forms of bringing
together computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not enthusiastic about power-line technology because
there hasn't been a single standard that all companies can rally
around,'' Olhava said.
</P>
<P>
   HomePlug, the recently formed alliance, acknowledged the
shortcoming and is trying to change that by coming up with a de
facto standard that the entire industry will stick to.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major problems so far is that companies haven't
been talking to each other,'' said Mantovani. ``So there's no
common understanding of how these products should work. But
consumers want interoperability. They want all of their devices to
be compatible. That's going to be our primary focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge facing the group is the aggressive timeline
that it has given itself. HomePlug members say they will agree to a
final set of standards by October and have products on store
shelves by the end of the year or early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very tight schedule,'' acknowledged Mantovani. ``But
we need to work fast in order to have this be adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever technology emerges also has to be ultra-simple if it is
to be accepted by the mass market, said Todd Hanson, senior analyst
at Dataquest in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``True home networking has to be brain-dead simple for the mass
market,'' said Hanson. ``At the same time, it has to be
comprehensive enough for the most sophisticated user. But the
biggest challenge is for them to overcome people's fear of home
networking. The concept is just too scary, too abstract for most
people. They have to present it in terms of the benefits it
provides, like getting Internet access on your television, for
example. Then people will understand.''

GE BECOMES A SAFE HAVEN FOR INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As technology stocks have faltered over the past two weeks,
investors have sought out General Electric Co. the way flood
victims seek out higher ground. As of Monday that flight to safety
made GE the stock with the greatest market value, $523 billion,
surpassing Microsoft and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   In a tumultous world, GE is an island of stability. The company
always delivers on its earnings forecasts; its top and bottom lines
grow at a double-digit clip every year; its chief executive, Jack
Welch, is far and away the most admired businessman of his
generation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a company you can't help but love. But is it possible to
love GE too much? (Doesn't that sound like the title of a Jerry
Springer episode?) At least a few money managers are starting to
wonder if investors' passion for the company have pushed GE's stock
to unrealistic levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stock has taken on cult status,'' said one Boston money
manager, who asked to speak anonymously, because his firm has a big
position in GE stock. ``There is almost a religious fanaticism
about the confidence people have in the company and Welch.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Black of Delphi Management in Boston, a noted value
investor, calls GE a terrific company whose stock is way
overvalued. ``It's a sacred cow,'' complained Black. ``You're
paying an awful lot for the stock relative to its growth rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Black is referring to the favorite measure of the value
investor: the relationship of the stock price to a company's
long-term growth prospects. Money managers refer to this measure as
PEG, and they arrive at it by taking a stock's price-to-earnings
ratio and dividing it by the company's long-term growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   You got that? It sounds complicated, but it really isn't.
Consider GE, for example. It sells at price-to-earnings ratio of 42
and its earnings are expected to grow at just over 14 percent per
year, according to the analysts who track the company. That gives
GE a PEG of 3. The higher the PEG, the pricier the stock _ that is,
the more you are paying for a certain level of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The GE ``premium'' pops out when you compare the company to
other blue-chip stocks with similar growth prospects. Financial
stocks offer the best comparison because GE derives about 40
percent of its earnings from its financial services division.
</P>
<P>
   American International Group, a well-respected insurer, has a
PEG of 2.11; State Street Corp. has a PEG of 1.96; American Express
1.70; Citigroup, 1.42. Among blue chips in other fields, Wal-Mart,
with a PEG of 2.94, is one of the few to approach GE territory.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say there are other reasons for concern. GE is heavily
dependent on finance at a time of rising interest rates. Also, its
earnings are pumped up by sales of stakes in Internet companies.
According to Barron's, GE recorded over $300 million in gains from
venture investments in the fourth quarter of last year and another
$400 million in this year's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is the succession issue. Welch has
said he will depart next April, leaving some awfully big shoes to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   GE fans, a very large group, says such skepticism is
unwarranted. ``I would say the stock is somewhat undervalued,''
argued Richard Skaggs, a portfolio manager for Loomis Sayles.
Skaggs would not be surprised to see the stock reach $200 a share
by the end of 2001, up from $159.4375 Monday. Nicholas Heyman, an
analyst for Prudential Securites and a well-known GE booster,
recently upped his price target on the stock to $210.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-GE case rests on a few key elements. The first is
reliability. GE always makes its numbers. In uncertain times that
counts for a lot. ``Investors are willing to pay a premium for that
dependable, steady growth,'' said Paul McManus, manager of John
Hancock's Core Equity fund.
</P>
<P>
   The second pillar of support for GE is momentum. The mammoth
company isn't just growingly steadily, it is growing faster.
Revenue growth, which was 14 percent in 1998 and 15 percent last
year, is expected to reach 16 percent this year. ``As we enter the
new millennium, things are starting to explode,'' said Anthony
Forcione, an analyst with State Street Research.
</P>
<P>
   In late March GE said it would exceed Wall Street's target for
first-quarter profits, thanks to a bigger than expected increase in
orders. The stock has risen sharply since then.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Welch. At a session with GE executives last
fall, he said, ``Don't worry about succession because the system is
there. That system is not Jack Welch. It's a system.'' Much of Wall
Street believes just that. They are convinced that Welch has so
recast GE in his image that the company can continue its winning
ways even after he is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Welch is right. Maybe GE is such a great company it is
worth the premium Wall Street has accorded it.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, maybe not. Great companies can be overvalued _
even if they are not technology companies.

CHINA ISSUE IS LITMUS TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The AFL-CIO is targeting some of organized labor's strongest
congressional allies in a major effort to get them to vote against
the proposed bill to grant permanent normal trade relations status
to China.
</P>
<P>
   A series of new television advertisements was recently launched
to pressure certain House and Senate Democrats who may be leaning
toward voting for the bill, which would also scrap Congress's
annual review of China's human rights and trade record. Under the
current process, Congress must decide each year whether to continue
a free trade relationship with China after reviewing China's
progress in human rights and fair trade access to its market.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is strongly backed by President Clinton, who has been a
strong ally of labor, as well as by Vice President Al Gore, who has
been endorsed by the AFL-CIO and the Communications Workers of
America in his bid to succeed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore, as well as the forthcoming GOP presidential
nominee, Texas Governor George W. Bush, argue that granting
permanent trade status to China will result in more jobs for US
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet organized labor strongly believes that the massive increase
in trade with China under this bill will result in more jobs losses
among American workers and will make life worse for the nation's
working families. The growing trade deficit with China, they
further argue, has already cost hundreds of thousands of US jobs
and lowered the wages of American workers.
</P>
<P>
   The national AFL-CIO's campaign has included Massachusetts
Senator John F. Kerry among its congressional targets, apparently
because he has not yet taken a position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The national ad urges voters to call members of Congress,
including Kerry, and tell them to vote against the China trade bill
and to keep China on probation, in reference to that portion of the
bill that would end Congress's annual review of China's human
rights and trade record.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the AFL-CIO's national campaign has excluded Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy. Some say that despite his vote for the
labor-opposed NAFTA bill earlier this decade, this exclusion was
out of respect for his long and successful labor record that has
virtually elevated him to labor's patron saint in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The state AFL-CIO, however, said it is lobbying Kennedy as well
as Kerry and is heavily lobbying at least three Massachusetts
members of the US House including Representatives Edward J. Markey,
Martin T. Meehan, and Richard E. Neal.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other members of the Massachusetts delegation, the
AFL-CIO views Representatives Joseph Moakley, Barney Frank, James
McGovern, John Tierney, John Olver, Michael Capuano, and William
Delahunt as opposed to the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The labor organization is particularly focused on Markey,
Meehan, and Neal, for good reason. While the AFL-CIO and other
critics expect the bill to pass the Senate, they see a close vote
in the US House, and they suggest that members of the Massachusetts
delegation could determine the outcome of that vote.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is aware that the vote of two or three Massachusetts
members could well determine the outcome of the bill in the House.
With organized labor having an influence in the outcome of some
state congressional races in recent years, as some elected House
members can testify, their vote on the permanent trade bill could
determine how much support labor will provide them in future
re-election bids.
</P>
<P>
   What the AFL-CIO is telling them, in effect, is that if they
vote for the permanent trade bill, they are voting against the
state's working families. And these congressmen are likely to be
reminded in future elections of how they voted when they ask
working families to vote for them.

MOST OF ALL, JOB-HOPPERS SEEK SATISFACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To her friends, Maura Fitzsimmons is somewhat unusual: The
31-year-old biologist has worked at the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority for 10 years, longer than many professionals
her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends change jobs every four years,'' she said.
``People want top dollar and, depending on what they do, they can
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Job-changing, for some the fastest and surest route to monetary
and career advancement, is a critical problem for employers
confronted with low unemployment and, as a result, a labor
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are bonus-hopping, which means they are staying just
long enough to collect that $5,000 or $10,000 bonus,'' said
Marc(cq) Drizin(cq), vice president of Businesses Alliances at
Walker Information, an Indianapolis research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The US Labor Department reports the length of stay at US
companies among workers ages 25 to 34 has steadily declined,
dropping from three years in 1983 to 2.7 years in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two trends have contributed to the labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, US employers saw a 3.5 percent net increase in job
applicants, with the influx of large numbers of college graduates
and women into the work force. By the mid-1990s, however, the
percentage of new employees entering the work force had dropped to
1.2 percent. Low unemployment and a tight labor market are expected
to lower that percentage even further to 0.4 percent by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, we will see for the first time in our
history a net decrease of employees, or less people entering the
work force than are retiring,'' Drizin &UR;  &LR; said. ``So, if we think it
is harder to find and keep people today, just wait. It will get
even tougher, because Americans are having fewer children and we
have a large generation, the boomers, leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Human resource consultants say there are numerous ways to retain
good staff. Some point to the importance of ``soft'' benefits or
traits, what most people call intangibles. Soft traits include
appreciation for a job well done, concern for workers' well-being,
trust in their abilities, honesty, and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Build those traits into your corporate culture, Drizin said, and
you will be rewarded with greater loyalty and concern for the
company's health and survival. Leave them out, and don't be
surprised when workers turn their backs and march out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bookbinder, a principal at Towers Perrin in Boston, said
that job satisfaction depends largely on the kind of work you do
and where you do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are working at a call center and someone offers 75
cents more per hour at another company, then you just might
leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many issues here. Learning and development and work
environment are just two of them. The work environment is where
caring and concern and trust come in. But the ability to advance,
or the just the ability to work in different sections of a company,
are also important.''
</P>
<P>
   For some employees, he said, the key questions are:
</P>
<P>
   Does this job guarantee high visibility?
</P>
<P>
   Am I in a place where my work will be seen, where I am more
likely to develop a following, even a name?
</P>
<P>
   Does this job offer career security, as opposed to job security?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other factors that are also becoming incredibly
important to people, (such as) the reputation of the company,''
added Bookbinder. ``Do others think of this particular company as a
good place to work?''
</P>
<P>
   For those in the software industry, job-hopping may have less to
do with ``soft'' benefits and more to do with who is doing the most
interesting, challenging, or innovative work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who want to be with the best don't think too much about
whether it is a fair and trusting environment,'' noted Bookbinder.
``Dot-com people are more motivated by opportunities that are
linked to pay in various ways. They want an environment that looks
hip. Many of these companies have espresso machines, but, of
course, what it takes to retain people will require much more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is age.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young person fresh out of college is more willing to put up
with a lot if it means being with the best and being able to
maximize learning and development,'' he said. ``Microsoft never
competed directly with pay or benefits in the beginning. Instead,
it told people, `Look, one day we'll rule the world.' People bought
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Juris(cq) of Hewitt Associates, a benefits consultancy
in Lincolnshire, Ill., said employees today, particularly those
between ages 25 and 34, first look for competitive pay, solid
benefits, and stock options. Then, the softer benefits come into
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salary and benefits must be competitive to draw people, but
once they are earning a competitive salary, people want to feel as
if they make a difference,'' he said. ``They want to feel needed,
trusted, and respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world, this would be true of all workplaces,''
Juris added. ``The fact is, at many jobs this is not the case. But
with the job market as competitive as it is, employees now have a
choice, which should be a wake-up call to employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, it isn't. Most employers are still operating under
the old paradigm: Throw more money their way and they will stay.
This type of thinking is tripping up some employers, reports the
Hudson Institute and Walker Information.
</P>
<P>
   At a Northeastern University meeting with business leaders and
entrepreneurs last week, representatives from both research firms
reported that less than half of all employees (45 percent) feel a
strong attachment to their organization or believe that it deserves
their loyalty (42 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The findings were gathered in random polls of 2,293 adults
employed at firms with a minimum of 50 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings: Twenty-four percent were committed to their
employers and planned to stay for two years or more; 33 percent
were not committed and planned to leave before the two-year mark;
and 39 percent described themselves as ``trapped,'' meaning they
were not committed but were unable to leave for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe the six workplace factors that had the
greatest influence on an employee's commitment, those surveyed
cited fairness, including fair pay; care and concern; satisfaction
with day-to-day activities; an employer who trusts the employees;
knowing the company has a solid reputation; and work and job
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Employers spend far too little time showing staff they care
about their workers' well-being, according to the survey.
Communication and appreciation of new ideas and contributions were
among other factors needing more attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, pay is a satisfier,'' Drizin said. ``If you throw
money at a person, you will get them to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the behaviors you get from employees who are only staying
for the money differ markedly from the behavior of those who stay
for that and other reasons such as fairness, honesty, and
respect.''

 PM-BRITAIN-LIPSTADT-0411-COX &HT;    BRITISH COURT REBUKES NAZI HISTORIAN'S CLAIM HE WAS FALSELY
PORTRAYED AS 'EXTREMIST'
 &HT;    (600&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Maverick historical writer David Irving received a
stinging rebuke in a British courtroom Tuesday when a judge agreed
with a portrayal of him in a book by an Emory University professor
who described him as an anti-Semitic zealot who skews history to
fit his extremist political views.
</P>
<P>
   In a 66-page, detailed ruling, Judge Charles Gray assailed
Irving for his 30-year record of attacking long-held accounts of
the Holocaust, which Irving often has dismissed as fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the evidence showed that Irving ``persistently and
deliberately manipulated historical evidence'' and that he
portrayed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in a favorable light that is
unsupportable by the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, wearing a periwig and robes, took strong exception to
Irving's contention that there were no gas chambers at the
Auschwitz concentration camp and that the Nazis never used deadly
gas to kill masses of Jews at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   The trial featured the testimony of several highly respected
historians who presented reams of documentation about the Nazi
campaign to exterminate the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my conclusion that no objective, fair-minded historian
would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at
Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to
kill hundreds of thousands of Jews,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving sued Emory professor Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher
Penguin Books for assertions in her 1994 book ``Denying the
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said it is likely that Irving will be asked to pay the cost
of the litigation, estimated to be in excess of $3.2 million. The
judge also rejected Irving's request for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt never testified during the trial. While she believes
the case was an important moment in her struggle against Holocaust
deniers, she said that it was a conflict she would have happily
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``What choice did I have? I was sued,'' she said in an interview
Monday. `` I don't go after these guys with law suits. If I hadn't
fought it, the court would have sided with him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the trial may have provided Irving a platform, but in
her view the trial critically damaged his reputation as a
historian. ``We exposed him for what he is, a liar and a falsifier
of history,'' she said. ``I think a lot of people who thought he
was a serious historian have started
</P>
<P>
   to think twice.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Lipstadt portrayed Irving as a dishonest historian
who manipulated historical fact to support his view that the
Holocaust, as it is commonly known, never happened. She also linked
him to a collection of right-wing extremists such as American black
nationalist Louis Farrakhan, the Russian anti-Semitic organization
Pamyat and Middle East terrorist groups,
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah and Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Irving contended that this portrayal was false and cost him his
lucrative career as a historical writer and lecturer. He also said
that he has been exposed to scorn and perhaps personal danger
because of Lipstadt's work.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, which began Jan. 11, the defense argued that
Irving was the architect of his own downfall. The prestigious
defense team argued that Irving intentionally misrepresented his
own historical research, ignored other evidence available to him
and often twisted translations of German documents to suit his
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that he was sympathetic with Hitler and his Third
Reich regime. The defense also argued he was motivated by extreme
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The trial presented a rare opportunity for Holocaust experts to
confront a representative of the small cadre of revisionist
historians who claim that the Nazi program of mass extermination
either never happened or was greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in many ways, the case has been an exploration of
assumptions about what happened in Germany and Eastern Europe
during the World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government considered the trial important enough to
provide Lipstadt's lawyers with the unpublished prison papers of
Hitler lieutenant Adolf Eichmann to help undermine Irving's
assertions. However, the documents were too late to be used in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Irving maintained that he doesn't believe
the Nazis killed as many 6 million Jews in a systematic
extermination effort. However, he accepts that the Nazis were
responsible for the deaths of many Jews, maybe a million, most of
whom were killed by malnutrition, disease or firing squads.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he contended the scope of the Holocaust has been
overblown by Jews seeking to boost reparations payments from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Irving also rejected as fiction accounts of Nazis gassing Jews
at concentration camps, and says the gas chambers still seen by
tourists at Auschwitz are fakes.
</P>
<P>
   A biographer of Hitler, Irving also argued that the Nazi leader
was unaware of the campaign against Jews and other minorities until
late in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Irving depicted himself as an unconventional researcher who is
simply challenging conventional wisdom. Seeing himself as a David
battling a Goliath, Irving has argued that he is the victim of an
international Jewish conspiracy.

 PM-BRITAIN-LIPSTADT-0411-COX &HT;    BRITISH COURT REBUKES NAZI HISTORIAN'S CLAIM HE WAS FALSELY
PORTRAYED AS 'EXTREMIST'

   LONDON _ Maverick historical writer David Irving received a
stinging rebuke in a British courtroom Tuesday when a judge agreed
with a portrayal of him in a book by an Emory University professor
who described him as an anti-Semitic zealot who skews history to
fit his extremist political views.
</P>
<P>
   In a 66-page, detailed ruling, Judge Charles Gray assailed
Irving for his 30-year record of attacking long-held accounts of
the Holocaust, which Irving often has dismissed as fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the evidence showed that Irving ``persistently and
deliberately manipulated historical evidence'' and that he
portrayed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in a favorable light that is
unsupportable by the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, wearing a periwig and robes, took strong exception to
Irving's contention that there were no gas chambers at the
Auschwitz concentration camp and that the Nazis never used deadly
gas to kill masses of Jews at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   The trial featured the testimony of several highly respected
historians who presented reams of documentation about the Nazi
campaign to exterminate the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my conclusion that no objective, fair-minded historian
would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at
Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to
kill hundreds of thousands of Jews,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving sued Emory professor Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher
Penguin Books for assertions in her 1994 book ``Denying the
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said it is likely that Irving will be asked to pay the cost
of the litigation, estimated to be in excess of $3.2 million. The
judge also rejected Irving's request for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt never testified during the trial. While she believes
the case was an important moment in her struggle against Holocaust
deniers, she said that it was a conflict she would have happily
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``What choice did I have? I was sued,'' she said in an interview
Monday. `` I don't go after these guys with law suits. If I hadn't
fought it, the court would have sided with him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the trial may have provided Irving a platform, but in
her view the trial critically damaged his reputation as a
historian. ``We exposed him for what he is, a liar and a falsifier
of history,'' she said. ``I think a lot of people who thought he
was a serious historian have started
</P>
<P>
   to think twice.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Lipstadt portrayed Irving as a dishonest historian
who manipulated historical fact to support his view that the
Holocaust, as it is commonly known, never happened. She also linked
him to a collection of right-wing extremists such as American black
nationalist Louis Farrakhan, the Russian anti-Semitic organization
Pamyat and Middle East terrorist groups,
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah and Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Irving contended that this portrayal was false and cost him his
lucrative career as a historical writer and lecturer. He also said
that he has been exposed to scorn and perhaps personal danger
because of Lipstadt's work.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, which began Jan. 11, the defense argued that
Irving was the architect of his own downfall. The prestigious
defense team argued that Irving intentionally misrepresented his
own historical research, ignored other evidence available to him
and often twisted translations of German documents to suit his
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that he was sympathetic with Hitler and his Third
Reich regime. The defense also argued he was motivated by extreme
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The trial presented a rare opportunity for Holocaust experts to
confront a representative of the small cadre of revisionist
historians who claim that the Nazi program of mass extermination
either never happened or was greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in many ways, the case has been an exploration of
assumptions about what happened in Germany and Eastern Europe
during the World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government considered the trial important enough to
provide Lipstadt's lawyers with the unpublished prison papers of
Hitler lieutenant Adolf Eichmann to help undermine Irving's
assertions. However, the documents were too late to be used in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Irving maintained that he doesn't believe
the Nazis killed as many 6 million Jews in a systematic
extermination effort. However, he accepts that the Nazis were
responsible for the deaths of many Jews, maybe a million, most of
whom were killed by malnutrition, disease or firing squads.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he contended the scope of the Holocaust has been
overblown by Jews seeking to boost reparations payments from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Irving also rejected as fiction accounts of Nazis gassing Jews
at concentration camps, and says the gas chambers still seen by
tourists at Auschwitz are fakes.
</P>
<P>
   A biographer of Hitler, Irving also argued that the Nazi leader
was unaware of the campaign against Jews and other minorities until
late in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Irving depicted himself as an unconventional researcher who is
simply challenging conventional wisdom. Seeing himself as a David
battling a Goliath, Irving has argued that he is the victim of an
international Jewish conspiracy.

 &HT;    Income tax return errors can cause you to lose time or money
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are two kinds of tax bloopers.
</P>
<P>
   One costs you time, because you messed up and the Internal
Revenue Service expects you to straighten out your return.
</P>
<P>
   The other costs you money, because it caused you to miss out on
any number of tax-saving provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a short list of common mistakes. First the ones that cost
you real money if you overlook them or decide to skip the extra
paperwork:
</P>
<P>
   _ Child tax credit. In years past, according to professional tax
preparers, too many people have overlooked this item. It can reduce
a family's tax bill by as much as $500 for each dependent child.
Check the instruction booklet that came with your tax form for
details.
</P>
<P>
   The child or dependent care credit is an additional benefit,
available under some circumstances, to families that paid someone
else to care for children under 13 or adults who can't care for
themselves. Form 2441 has the details.
</P>
<P>
   You can get copies of that and other IRS forms and publications
from IRS offices or on the Internet at www.irs.gov/formspubs
/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   _ Education credits. The Hope credit can be worth up to $1,500
for those with educational expenses. The lifetime learning credit
can reduce taxes by a maximum of $1,000. See Form 8863 for details.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missed deductions. Mortgage interest and charitable gift
deductions are fairly obvious. Medical expenses require more
paperwork but may result in a savings if out-of-pocket spending is
high.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people overlook certain miscellaneous expenses, which
include things like tax preparation fees, job-hunting expenses, the
fee for a safe-deposit box, a variety of work-related expenses and
even gambling losses. Check out Publication 17, which is available
free from the IRS, for details.
</P>
<P>
   _ Interest on student loans. The maximum deduction went up from
$1,000 to $1,500. See the instruction booklet for income
limitations and other details.
</P>
<P>
   _ Excess Social Security withholding. If you had more than one
employer and earned more than $72,600, too much Social Security tax
may have been held back from your paychecks. You're allowed a
credit for the amount of FICA taxes withheld above $4,501.20.
</P>
<P>
   _ Earned-income tax credit. Don't claim it unless you are
certain you are entitled to it. This provision provides credits,
and possibly refunds, to low-income working people. But too many
people have tried to scam the system, and the IRS is watching for
cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are the fumbles that will make the IRS kick
back your return. Surprisingly, the feds expect at least 8 million
taxpayers to make one or more of these elementary mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   These are mistakes that could slow processing of your return _
and any refund you have coming:
</P>
<P>
   _ Missing signatures. If you're filing jointly, be sure both
spouses sign the return.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missing or incorrect Social Security numbers. Don't forget to
give numbers for your children or other dependents. In 1998,
270,000 people got a child's number wrong. Believe it or not,
160,000 flubbed their own Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mistakes in arithmetic. Double-check each entry, including
addition and subtraction. The IRS checks all returns for math
errors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Illegible handwriting. If the tax collectors can't read it,
they can't process it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missing information. Make sure you've filled in all the blanks
and that you include all necessary forms and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Incorrect numbers copied from one form or schedule to another.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax table goofs. Many people copy the wrong line of the tax
tables.
</P>
<P>
   Your fifth-grade teacher was right: Always check your work
before you turn it in.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Childhood dreams come true in a
chinaberry tree
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Norma Whitney Busby
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   I was seven when I discovered gifts of the chinaberry tree.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1939, and mother and daddy had been left penniless by the
low economic activity of that period.
</P>
<P>
   My grandparents persuaded them to move into their home on a
small farm in rural Georgia until the crunch was over.
</P>
<P>
   It was bitterly cold the morning we drove to that old house.
Gusts of wind whistled through every crack in our battered truck,
and peaks of frosty, reddish clay glistened like crystals along the
bumpy dirt road.
</P>
<P>
   When we finally arrived, daddy wheeled into grandfather's neat
yard and parked beside a strange looking tree.
</P>
<P>
   Mother saw me looking at it. ``It's an umbrella-chinaberry
tree,'' she said. ``Your dad and I sat under it when we courted.''
</P>
<P>
   Its branches, low-hanging and shaped like an umbrella, seemed to
offer shelter against the hardships my parents endured.
</P>
<P>
   We carried our few possessions up the squeaky wooden steps to
the door and knocked. Anxious hands helped us inside.
</P>
<P>
   The room was warmed by hugs and crimson flames dancing in the
fireplace. Grandma lifted me up to snuggle on her aproned lap. We
rocked in her old cane chair so close to the blaze that our legs
glowed from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   At bedtime I skipped barefoot over the cold linoleum floors,
jumped between frigid sheets and snuggled under a hand-stitched
quilt that smelled of moth balls.
</P>
<P>
   A light bulb dangled from the high ceiling, swaying to and fro
and casting shadows on bright papered walls. A picture of Jesus
hung above the mantel.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most beautiful room I had ever seen. At first I was
too excited to sleep. But warmth from the fireplace and a twig from
the chinaberry tree, tapping against a window pane, finally lulled
me to dreamland.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning after a breakfast of hot biscuits and homemade
blackberry jelly, I slipped on a hooded jacket and ran outside to
explore my new home.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly discovered that my grandparents' large yard was ruled
over by a tough old rooster. When he saw me coming he ruffled his
feathers, lowered his beak and began to give chase.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the front yard, I was able to make a hasty getaway by
pulling myself onto a low branch of the chinaberry tree. That was
the first of its many gifts I would learn of as time passed.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I was in the chinaberry tree, my imagination soared
like a chariot pulled by a white mythical creature, carrying me
into a world where childhood dreams came true.
</P>
<P>
   In spring the chinaberry surrendered clusters of fragrant,
lilac-colored flowers to fashion skirts for stick dolls.
</P>
<P>
   In summer the tree offered shade and a cool place for my family
to sit and sip sweet tea.
</P>
<P>
   In fall the tree gave berries for pretend tea served in tiny
cups made from acorns.
</P>
<P>
   The chinaberry tree inspired my love for birds. I watched them
pluck fruit and nest in its dense growth. I listened to their
melodic twills.
</P>
<P>
   I played in the chinaberry tree all spring, summer and fall. It
was in the chill of winter that Daddy got a job and the time came
for us to move away.
</P>
<P>
   Before we left, I ran to tell the tree goodbye, shoo the rooster
and hug my grandparents. We all wept. It had been a happy year.
</P>
<P>
   Recently my husband Bob and I were in the area. We drove by the
old home place. I had not seen it in years.
</P>
<P>
   It was deserted. Bob stopped the car for a moment so I could
look. But my benefactor, the umbrella-chinaberry tree, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' I whispered to Bob. ``Did you hear that? A child
laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the wind,'' he scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   We drove off, but I glanced back for one last look. I saw a
faint shadow, plainly in the shape of an umbella. It stretched
gracefully across the untidy yard.

 &HT;    Spring cleaning for dummies
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _The house is a shambles. I've ripped it apart
on the pretense of spring cleaning. Now comes the phase where I sit
in the middle of the mess and congratulate myself on having begun
early enough to finish by lilac time. I've made it only once in 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   Today I awoke with the Windex in one hand and a polishing rag in
the other, ready to launch a daybreak attack, but that didn't
happen. Instead, I'm sitting on the office floor among stacks of
old math books - everything from my son's
</P>
<P>
   fifth-grade ``Elementary School Mathematics'' to my own
``College Math for Dummies Who Absolutely Cannot Make It Through
Real Algebra'' text. I'm trying to calculate my body mass.
</P>
<P>
   I never should have stopped for tea, toast, and the morning
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that the Miss Americas are getting skinnier?
According to experts from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health,
based on body mass calculations, most winners of the coveted crown
are now falling into the ``undernourished'' category. Pitiful, my
mama would have called it.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, contestants had a body mass index in the range now
considered normal _ 20 to 25. Rosemary LaPlanche, the 1941 winner,
was tops at 22.4. The lowest at 16.9 was 1986 winner, Susan Akin.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, I was obsessed. And although I have no desire to
starve myself into a stick figure with Barbie bosoms, I have, for
some obscure reason, determined life will not be worth living if I
cannot figure out how to divide my weight by the square of my
height _ before lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers hold the same combination of fascination and dread for
me that tarantulas do for arachnaphobics _ with one major
difference. The spiders can be avoided by staying out of Texas and
giving up bananas. Numbers, on the
</P>
<P>
   other hand, are inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Body mass index is weight divided by the square of height,''
the article explains. Okay. I ought to be able to do that. My
calculator has one of those squiggly things that means square roots
_ I think. So I try it.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary computations show that I'm in the ``starving to
death but not looking like it'' range at 17.17.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I need ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe I should have converted my height, 5-feet-3, into
inches instead of punching in 5.3. I try again and come up two
index points lower, 15.75.
</P>
<P>
   I am rapidly wasting away.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be that my calculations need rethinking. Maybe the
height (in inches this time) is supposed to be multiplied by
itself. I try that but run into a problem with the decimal point.
If I move it left, I end up with the body mass of a praying mantis.
Two places to the right and I'd have to be 6-feet-5 to fall back
into the acceptable range.
</P>
<P>
   I call a friend for help. Gail comes down from the ladder where
she's been sorting through volumes for the used book dealer who's
due to arrive at any minute, and reaches into her desk drawer for a
calculator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read me the problem,'' she says and I do.
</P>
<P>
   Number crunching sounds. ``Mmm.'' Punch, punch. ``No! Stupid!
Wrong formula!'' She's talking to herself. ``Height into weight.''
More tapping. Then, ``Aha! Got it! You have a body mass index of
1.98.'' I thank her and suggest she get back
</P>
<P>
   to her books. It's easier than trying to explain.
</P>
<P>
   I think about calling my son at his office, but it might
embarrass him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I could try down at the bank. They're always real nice
about returning my checkbook to reality whenever I've wandered off
into thenever-never-land of debits and credits.
</P>

 &HT;    Two tykes from Cuba
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ This is how wars get started: You have an
assumption that gets built into a presumption, which becomes a
pretension. Then you have a person, who becomes a personification.
Ultimately it hardly matters that it's a 6-year-old who doesn't
know Che Guevara from Tinky Winky.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable, the train of baggage that follows Elian Gonzalez'
every step. What should be a simple custody case has become a
fuse-point for potential street combat, not to mention political
dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's fashionable _ and easy _ to beat up on Attorney
General Janet Reno, she has dealt with this particular embroglio
with clarity.
</P>
<P>
   The oceans may foam with rightful outrage about Fidel Castro.
The questions may linger about what the future holds for the boy
back in his homeland with his father, but Reno is on the mark:
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to start judging parents on the basis of their
political beliefs, we would change the concept of family for the
rest of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno cuts through the foam. This is not about political systems.
This is about prejudging a parent's fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is. And we reserve the right to prejudge.
</P>
<P>
   The other day in the oddest of convergences, the front page of
the Waco Tribune-Herald conveyed the story of two little Cuban
boys. One, of course, was Elian. The other was little Alberto
Melis.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto is not so little any more. He's 51 and Waco's new chief
of police.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago in December he came to Miami with his mother _
on a tourist flight, not a perilous Caribbean trek _ and the family
sought asylum. Ultimately he would become an accomplished Florida
cop, chief of the Lauderhill Police Department and now the Waco
PD's top man.
</P>
<P>
   What's made the Melis appointment newsworthy, aside from the
fact that Waco got a cop with a reputation for community policing,
is that a few people weren't happy that he is Cuban-born. They
certainly don't speak for the city council, which supported him
unanimously, or for most Waco citizens. But I'm imagining their
numbers exceed what the rest of us would wish.
</P>
<P>
   One letter to the editor asserted that only a native is suited
to enforce our laws. ``It really comes down to a thing called
loyalty,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   My own prejudices show through here, but here's a guess. I'll
bet that most of the people who became squeamish about hiring
51-year-old Alberto Melis as Waco police chief are at the same time
gung-ho about keeping 6-year-old Elian here. They'll say that
regardless of any paternal issues, the best place for the boy is
America.
</P>
<P>
   They may well be right, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Melis' family was right when it made its flight from Cuba.
Millions of immigrants were right when they come to these shores
seeking freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, those who judge Gonzalez's father by virtue of his
having stayed in the nation of his birth are trying to jab a rain
cloud with a lance.
</P>
<P>
   And those who judge Alberto Melis' loyalty or ability based on
the nation of his birth are, simply, people looking for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``American'' isn't necessarily decreed at birth. Quite
often, it is acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The prejudice against Melis begs the question: If Elian were to
stay, would he have every opportunity a native-born child had? To
be a Central Texas police chief, for instance? We should hope.
</P>
<P>
   Something tells me that in some eyes, as soon as his trophy
status wore off, Elian would be ``just another foreigner out to
take an American's job.''

 &HT;    Don't like gas prices? Reduce your usuage
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news at the gas pump is that gasoline prices should be
coming down. The best guess as to when is ``by summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if summer were declared next Monday, it would be later
than anyone who is currently filling gas tanks would like.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you can do something to stretch your gas
mileage, short of purchasing a more fuel-efficient vehicle.
Remember, these are baby stretches. Just like a diet, don't expect
to see huge immediate results, but consider the gain over a month
or six weeks. It will add up to a tank of gas, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you can do is eliminate jackrabbit starts. When
that light turns green, push lightly on your accelerator pedal. You
really don't have to plant your size nine in the carburetor to get
where you are going.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you are going, think about how you are going to stop.
Think about stopping well before you get to the intersection or
stop sign. Instead of jabbing on the brakes at the last minute,
coast to that stopping point.
</P>
<P>
   You may or may not have an onboard computer in your car that
tells you instant gas consumption. If you do, you can check this
for yourself. If you don't, allow me to relate my experience.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving an Audi A8 equipped with a digital readout of
mileage to empty. With a full tank, the gauge read 425 miles. If I
jumped on the accelerator, it dropped immediately to 400 miles.
When I backed off the throttle _ not slowing down but only opening
the throttle part way _ the number began to creep back toward 415
miles. When I took my foot completely off the accelerator and
allowed the car to coast the last couple of hundred feet to the
stopping point, the number went back to 420 miles. This is a
graphic example of what to do with the car's brake and accelerator
pedal to improve overall fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to just slow down. I know that isn't a popular
concept, but you are kidding yourself if you think the sticker's
fuel-efficiency tests are run at Atlanta interstate speeds.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I have owned a pickup truck equipped with a
454-cubic-inch engine. Drive it over 70 mph, and the only way you
will ever see better than 6 (yes, that's right, 6) mpg is to push
it off a cliff. Drop the speed to 55 mph, and you'll get 8 mpg. It
may not sound like much, but that 2 mpg is a 33 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Going on a long trip? The driver of that 18-wheeler really can
be your good buddy. A big rig punches a big hole in the air. The
air behind that rig is ``soft'' air. It doesn't take as much fuel
to move your vehicle in soft air. I'm not suggesting that you draft
6 feet off the big rig's back bumper. You can travel as far back as
10 car lengths and still reap the benefits of the soft air.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the most straightforward thing you can do is reduce
the amount that you drive. It's easier than you think. Instead of
running to the store every time the notion hits you, plan your
week's errands. Pick up last-minute items on the way home from
work; don't make a special trip later.
</P>
<P>
   With a little forethought, you can reduce your daily fuel usage.

 &HT;    Low-end Kia Sportage offer some offroad capability
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's little, loud and generally viewed as being crude
and underpowered, but the Korean-built Kia Sportage has some
noteworthy pluses, including a strong record in off-road racing.
</P>
<P>
   The Sportage, available in two- and four-wheel drive with two
trim levels, is built to be cheap, but start adding options and the
bottom line can pass the $20,000 mark. The test base Sportage with
part-time four-wheel drive, automatic transmission, AC and CD
player totaled $19,509.
</P>
<P>
   Kia, which has been importing sedans and sport-utilities since
1991, also offers a convertible Sportage base-priced at $14,445.
Like the four-door Sportage, its future is uncertain after the
buyout of Kia by Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the four-door Sportage remains a decently
equipped vehicle with specially prepared versions winning class
competitions in the SCORE and Silver State desert races, which
probably have about as much relationship to real-world use as
stock-car races do to daily driving of production cars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite frequent criticism for its lack of sophistication, the
Sportage is regularly referred to as a ``handsome'' vehicle.
Simplicity reigns, with clean body lines and no garish gingerbread
adorning the exterior. The visual appeal does drop inside the
Sportage, though, with the tester sporting lots of gray plastic and
cloth. The effect is not objectionable, but it isn't uplifting,
either. Dull, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   Like classmates such as the Suzuki Vitara and Chevrolet Tracker,
the Sportage does have the plus of maneuverability _ so long as it
is in two-wheel drive. In four-wheel drive, the Sportage binds up
in turns, and the test vehicle developed a groan and creak in the
dash when switched to four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Not all buyers are really going to need the four-wheel-drive
version, but it is relatively easy to shift in and out of
four-wheel drive. Kia uses a center console shift stick, while many
SUVs have push-button systems.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine is certifiably one of the
noisiest around, but it moves the 3,200-pound Sportage around quite
well once it revs up to the 4,000-rpm range. The noise does not
abate at cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has good room for adults and all-around visibility
impeded only slightly by the rear seat headrests and a full-size
spare tire mounted on a swing-away holder on the swing-open rear
door. The 25.8 cubic feet of cargo space can be doubled by folding
down the rear seat, which sits fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much can be said of the Sportage overall, too. Kia
set out to make it a low-end vehicle with some off-road capability
and succeeded, although the cost cutting that went on did rob it of
any mechanical or comfort sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Kia Sportage four-door sport-utility vehicle
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $19,999 (base: $16,295, plus $450 delivery)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine (130 horsepower),
optional four-speed automatic transmission with two-speed transfer
case ($1,000)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: Dual air bags, driver's-knee air bag,
side-impact beams, optional anti-lock brakes ($490)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: Air conditioning, $900; stereo
radio with CD player, $475; rear wiper, $125; floor mats, $69; roof
rack, $195
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 19 mpg regular unleaded city, 22 mpg highway

 &HT;    We can't fix your car as a `class project'
 &HT;    By Nora Roberts
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I often receive letters and even phone calls from readers with
similar questions and concerns about their vehicles. Rather than
address them individually, I thought I would discuss the subjects
in general.
</P>
<P>
   Readers often contact me about having the automotive students
work on their vehicles as ``class projects.''
</P>
<P>
   The state automotive curriculum offers the students a
combination of theory and applied skills in specific areas of the
vehicles. The hands-on lab portions of these classes are limited to
working with training components, vehicles provided by the school
and, occasionally, a student's personal vehicle when the repairs
needed are appropriate to the class being taught at that time.
</P>
<P>
   This method allows the student the experience of real-world
problems while progressing at a regulated pace under the
supervision of an instructor. It maintains a professional
shop/classroom atmosphere without promoting a ``hobby shop''
environment, and it eliminates any element, real or perceived, of
interference with the retail automotive repair industry.
</P>
<P>
   We are in the business of training mechanics/technicians to go
to work in the repair shops around town. It is unwise to cut the
throats of our students' potential employers by competing with
them. No, we do not work on outside vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   I get many questions from do-it-yourselfers about specific
repairs on their vehicles. For instance: ``A shop in town wants to
charge me $200 to put shocks on my 1974 Ranger, but I can buy them
for $4.99 apiece at the local discount parts store. What do I need
to do to put them on in my driveway?'' or ``What kind of tools do I
need to check my 1987 Peugeot's computer system?''
</P>
<P>
   What you need isn't me _ it's automotive repair manuals. That is
where you need to start your search for this kind of information.
Like most serious technicians, I have spent many years and dollars
accumulating these occupants of my personal automotive library
shelves. They are as important to the success of repairing a
vehicle as any of my hand tools. Working without a manual is about
as productive as trying to pound nails with a rock.
</P>
<P>
   Before you decide to use your primary source of transportation
as your next home fix-it victim, do a little research. Most of the
larger discount parts chains catering to the driveway repair crowd
stock a generous selection of repair manuals for sale at reasonable
prices. Buy the one you need for the car you're about to dissect,
and read the section on the repair you want to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time for some honest self-evaluation and unbiased
situation overview. Do you possess the skills, tools and time to do
the job yourself? Without all three, you could end up in a much
worse mess than you started with.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have the time to learn Peugeot computer systems? Are the
$4.99 shocks the same quality as the $200 quote, or will you need
extensive dental work after driving over the first railroad
crossing?
</P>
<P>
   When you throw up your hands or throw down your tools in
frustration, don't expect to get your questions answered by a
competent technician on the other end of a phone line. He or she
doesn't make a living answering questions or giving out free
mechanical advice.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly age-old mechanic/technician terminology surfaced
again from a somewhat less than ardent reader. I looked up some
definitions in a couple of dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic (n) 1: manual worker. 2: one who repairs machines or 1:
a workman skilled in making, using or repairing machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Technician (n) 1: a specialist in the technical details of a
subject or occupation. 2: one who has acquired the technique of an
art or other area of specialization.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a problem or identity crisis with either of these
words. I am both and will wear either badge proudly. There is no
shame in hard work and dirty fingernails, and I continually pay a
technician's dues.

 &HT;    Income tax return errors can cause you to lose time or money
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are two kinds of tax bloopers.
</P>
<P>
   One costs you time, because you messed up and the Internal
Revenue Service expects you to straighten out your return.
</P>
<P>
   The other costs you money, because it caused you to miss out on
any number of tax-saving provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a short list of common mistakes. First the ones that cost
you real money if you overlook them or decide to skip the extra
paperwork:
</P>
<P>
   _ Child tax credit. In years past, according to professional tax
preparers, too many people have overlooked this item. It can reduce
a family's tax bill by as much as $500 for each dependent child.
Check the instruction booklet that came with your tax form for
details.
</P>
<P>
   The child or dependent care credit is an additional benefit,
available under some circumstances, to families that paid someone
else to care for children under 13 or adults who can't care for
themselves. Form 2441 has the details.
</P>
<P>
   You can get copies of that and other IRS forms and publications
from IRS offices or on the Internet at www.irs.gov/formspubs
/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   _ Education credits. The Hope credit can be worth up to $1,500
for those with educational expenses. The lifetime learning credit
can reduce taxes by a maximum of $1,000. See Form 8863 for details.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missed deductions. Mortgage interest and charitable gift
deductions are fairly obvious. Medical expenses require more
paperwork but may result in a savings if out-of-pocket spending is
high.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people overlook certain miscellaneous expenses, which
include things like tax preparation fees, job-hunting expenses, the
fee for a safe-deposit box, a variety of work-related expenses and
even gambling losses. Check out Publication 17, which is available
free from the IRS, for details.
</P>
<P>
   _ Interest on student loans. The maximum deduction went up from
$1,000 to $1,500. See the instruction booklet for income
limitations and other details.
</P>
<P>
   _ Excess Social Security withholding. If you had more than one
employer and earned more than $72,600, too much Social Security tax
may have been held back from your paychecks. You're allowed a
credit for the amount of FICA taxes withheld above $4,501.20.
</P>
<P>
   _ Earned-income tax credit. Don't claim it unless you are
certain you are entitled to it. This provision provides credits,
and possibly refunds, to low-income working people. But too many
people have tried to scam the system, and the IRS is watching for
cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are the fumbles that will make the IRS kick
back your return. Surprisingly, the feds expect at least 8 million
taxpayers to make one or more of these elementary mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   These are mistakes that could slow processing of your return _
and any refund you have coming:
</P>
<P>
   _ Missing signatures. If you're filing jointly, be sure both
spouses sign the return.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missing or incorrect Social Security numbers. Don't forget to
give numbers for your children or other dependents. In 1998,
270,000 people got a child's number wrong. Believe it or not,
160,000 flubbed their own Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mistakes in arithmetic. Double-check each entry, including
addition and subtraction. The IRS checks all returns for math
errors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Illegible handwriting. If the tax collectors can't read it,
they can't process it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missing information. Make sure you've filled in all the blanks
and that you include all necessary forms and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Incorrect numbers copied from one form or schedule to another.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax table goofs. Many people copy the wrong line of the tax
tables.
</P>
<P>
   Your fifth-grade teacher was right: Always check your work
before you turn it in.

 &HT;    Don't like gas prices? Reduce your usuage
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news at the gas pump is that gasoline prices should be
coming down. The best guess as to when is ``by summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if summer were declared next Monday, it would be later
than anyone who is currently filling gas tanks would like.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you can do something to stretch your gas
mileage, short of purchasing a more fuel-efficient vehicle.
Remember, these are baby stretches. Just like a diet, don't expect
to see huge immediate results, but consider the gain over a month
or six weeks. It will add up to a tank of gas, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you can do is eliminate jackrabbit starts. When
that light turns green, push lightly on your accelerator pedal. You
really don't have to plant your size nine in the carburetor to get
where you are going.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you are going, think about how you are going to stop.
Think about stopping well before you get to the intersection or
stop sign. Instead of jabbing on the brakes at the last minute,
coast to that stopping point.
</P>
<P>
   You may or may not have an onboard computer in your car that
tells you instant gas consumption. If you do, you can check this
for yourself. If you don't, allow me to relate my experience.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving an Audi A8 equipped with a digital readout of
mileage to empty. With a full tank, the gauge read 425 miles. If I
jumped on the accelerator, it dropped immediately to 400 miles.
When I backed off the throttle _ not slowing down but only opening
the throttle part way _ the number began to creep back toward 415
miles. When I took my foot completely off the accelerator and
allowed the car to coast the last couple of hundred feet to the
stopping point, the number went back to 420 miles. This is a
graphic example of what to do with the car's brake and accelerator
pedal to improve overall fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to just slow down. I know that isn't a popular
concept, but you are kidding yourself if you think the sticker's
fuel-efficiency tests are run at Atlanta interstate speeds.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I have owned a pickup truck equipped with a
454-cubic-inch engine. Drive it over 70 mph, and the only way you
will ever see better than 6 (yes, that's right, 6) mpg is to push
it off a cliff. Drop the speed to 55 mph, and you'll get 8 mpg. It
may not sound like much, but that 2 mpg is a 33 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Going on a long trip? The driver of that 18-wheeler really can
be your good buddy. A big rig punches a big hole in the air. The
air behind that rig is ``soft'' air. It doesn't take as much fuel
to move your vehicle in soft air. I'm not suggesting that you draft
6 feet off the big rig's back bumper. You can travel as far back as
10 car lengths and still reap the benefits of the soft air.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the most straightforward thing you can do is reduce
the amount that you drive. It's easier than you think. Instead of
running to the store every time the notion hits you, plan your
week's errands. Pick up last-minute items on the way home from
work; don't make a special trip later.
</P>
<P>
   With a little forethought, you can reduce your daily fuel usage.

 &HT;    Low-end Kia Sportage offer some offroad capability
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's little, loud and generally viewed as being crude
and underpowered, but the Korean-built Kia Sportage has some
noteworthy pluses, including a strong record in off-road racing.
</P>
<P>
   The Sportage, available in two- and four-wheel drive with two
trim levels, is built to be cheap, but start adding options and the
bottom line can pass the $20,000 mark. The test base Sportage with
part-time four-wheel drive, automatic transmission, AC and CD
player totaled $19,509.
</P>
<P>
   Kia, which has been importing sedans and sport-utilities since
1991, also offers a convertible Sportage base-priced at $14,445.
Like the four-door Sportage, its future is uncertain after the
buyout of Kia by Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the four-door Sportage remains a decently
equipped vehicle with specially prepared versions winning class
competitions in the SCORE and Silver State desert races, which
probably have about as much relationship to real-world use as
stock-car races do to daily driving of production cars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite frequent criticism for its lack of sophistication, the
Sportage is regularly referred to as a ``handsome'' vehicle.
Simplicity reigns, with clean body lines and no garish gingerbread
adorning the exterior. The visual appeal does drop inside the
Sportage, though, with the tester sporting lots of gray plastic and
cloth. The effect is not objectionable, but it isn't uplifting,
either. Dull, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   Like classmates such as the Suzuki Vitara and Chevrolet Tracker,
the Sportage does have the plus of maneuverability _ so long as it
is in two-wheel drive. In four-wheel drive, the Sportage binds up
in turns, and the test vehicle developed a groan and creak in the
dash when switched to four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Not all buyers are really going to need the four-wheel-drive
version, but it is relatively easy to shift in and out of
four-wheel drive. Kia uses a center console shift stick, while many
SUVs have push-button systems.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine is certifiably one of the
noisiest around, but it moves the 3,200-pound Sportage around quite
well once it revs up to the 4,000-rpm range. The noise does not
abate at cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has good room for adults and all-around visibility
impeded only slightly by the rear seat headrests and a full-size
spare tire mounted on a swing-away holder on the swing-open rear
door. The 25.8 cubic feet of cargo space can be doubled by folding
down the rear seat, which sits fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much can be said of the Sportage overall, too. Kia
set out to make it a low-end vehicle with some off-road capability
and succeeded, although the cost cutting that went on did rob it of
any mechanical or comfort sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Kia Sportage four-door sport-utility vehicle
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $19,999 (base: $16,295, plus $450 delivery)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine (130 horsepower),
optional four-speed automatic transmission with two-speed transfer
case ($1,000)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: Dual air bags, driver's-knee air bag,
side-impact beams, optional anti-lock brakes ($490)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: Air conditioning, $900; stereo
radio with CD player, $475; rear wiper, $125; floor mats, $69; roof
rack, $195
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 19 mpg regular unleaded city, 22 mpg highway

 &HT;    We can't fix your car as a `class project'
 &HT;    By Nora Roberts
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I often receive letters and even phone calls from readers with
similar questions and concerns about their vehicles. Rather than
address them individually, I thought I would discuss the subjects
in general.
</P>
<P>
   Readers often contact me about having the automotive students
work on their vehicles as ``class projects.''
</P>
<P>
   The state automotive curriculum offers the students a
combination of theory and applied skills in specific areas of the
vehicles. The hands-on lab portions of these classes are limited to
working with training components, vehicles provided by the school
and, occasionally, a student's personal vehicle when the repairs
needed are appropriate to the class being taught at that time.
</P>
<P>
   This method allows the student the experience of real-world
problems while progressing at a regulated pace under the
supervision of an instructor. It maintains a professional
shop/classroom atmosphere without promoting a ``hobby shop''
environment, and it eliminates any element, real or perceived, of
interference with the retail automotive repair industry.
</P>
<P>
   We are in the business of training mechanics/technicians to go
to work in the repair shops around town. It is unwise to cut the
throats of our students' potential employers by competing with
them. No, we do not work on outside vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   I get many questions from do-it-yourselfers about specific
repairs on their vehicles. For instance: ``A shop in town wants to
charge me $200 to put shocks on my 1974 Ranger, but I can buy them
for $4.99 apiece at the local discount parts store. What do I need
to do to put them on in my driveway?'' or ``What kind of tools do I
need to check my 1987 Peugeot's computer system?''
</P>
<P>
   What you need isn't me _ it's automotive repair manuals. That is
where you need to start your search for this kind of information.
Like most serious technicians, I have spent many years and dollars
accumulating these occupants of my personal automotive library
shelves. They are as important to the success of repairing a
vehicle as any of my hand tools. Working without a manual is about
as productive as trying to pound nails with a rock.
</P>
<P>
   Before you decide to use your primary source of transportation
as your next home fix-it victim, do a little research. Most of the
larger discount parts chains catering to the driveway repair crowd
stock a generous selection of repair manuals for sale at reasonable
prices. Buy the one you need for the car you're about to dissect,
and read the section on the repair you want to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time for some honest self-evaluation and unbiased
situation overview. Do you possess the skills, tools and time to do
the job yourself? Without all three, you could end up in a much
worse mess than you started with.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have the time to learn Peugeot computer systems? Are the
$4.99 shocks the same quality as the $200 quote, or will you need
extensive dental work after driving over the first railroad
crossing?
</P>
<P>
   When you throw up your hands or throw down your tools in
frustration, don't expect to get your questions answered by a
competent technician on the other end of a phone line. He or she
doesn't make a living answering questions or giving out free
mechanical advice.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly age-old mechanic/technician terminology surfaced
again from a somewhat less than ardent reader. I looked up some
definitions in a couple of dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic (n) 1: manual worker. 2: one who repairs machines or 1:
a workman skilled in making, using or repairing machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Technician (n) 1: a specialist in the technical details of a
subject or occupation. 2: one who has acquired the technique of an
art or other area of specialization.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a problem or identity crisis with either of these
words. I am both and will wear either badge proudly. There is no
shame in hard work and dirty fingernails, and I continually pay a
technician's dues.

   Last September, Americans got a nasty reminder of how the rest
of the world measures weights and distances. NASA's $165 million
Mars Climate Orbiter stumbled disastrously off course because of a
small mistake: One team of flight controllers had programmed the
spacecraft with English units (pounds and feet), while the other
had entered numbers using a metric scheme (newtons and meters).
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1964, the U.S. National Bureau of Standards officially
endorsed the metric system, with its convenient multiples of 10.
Not much happened. In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter pushed
for national metrication. Not much happened again.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and technologists _ not to mention auto-repair shops
_ deal in centimeters, as they have for years, while everyday life
still chugs along inch by inch.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to going metric in America is not just laziness.
America's common English units often fall into convenient sizes
that do not have simple equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   There's no easy metric substitute for a cup or a gallon _ who
wants a 3.785-liter milk container? A shot of whiskey rolls off the
tongue, but 3 cubic centimeters doesn't. America's customs, from
45-caliber pistols (0.45-inch-diameter barrel bore) to recipes
calling for tablespoons, are awkward at best to metrify.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists sometimes blame the media for perpetuating antiquated
and irrational units of measure, but the press needn't apologize.
The meter is not especially logical or meaningful either.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the meter was supposed to represent 1/10,000,000 of
the distance between the equator and either pole. Then it was
redefined by a particular bar of platinum in a vault in France and
later specified as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange light
emitted by krypton-86 atoms under certain conditions. These days
it's designated as the distance light travels in a vacuum in
1/299,792,458 of a second _ not exactly a household concept.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenheit, with its 180 divisions between water's freezing and
boiling points, is nearly twice as fine as the Celsius system. One
degree Fahrenheit is about the smallest temperature differential a
person can discern. And the 180-degree theme is familiarly repeated
in surveying, geometry, longitude and astronomical positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Problems arise not from the choice of units but from people's
stubborn inconsistency. The aviation community insists that
latitudes be expressed in feet, but that speed be in knots.
Astronomers use 24 hours of ``right ascension'' to make east-west
positions but degrees of ``inclination'' for north-south.
</P>
<P>
   Metric measurement is dumped overboard for jewelry (carats),
sound measurements (decibels) and wherever people prefer the
simplicity of the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of scientifically correct terms goes beyond the
English vs. metric battle. Astronomers, for example, have replaced
the easily understood ``light-year'' with mind-numbing ``parsec.''
A parsec is an arcane unit, 3.26 light-years long, defined as the
distance with which an object would appear to shift back and forth
by an angle of one arc-second as Earth orbits the sun. The
light-year is a logical unit that depends on the amazing constancy
of light's speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Orion nebula is some 1,500 light-years away, meaning its
image has traveled 1,500 years to reach us: simple and easy.
Today's specialists who prefer to think of Orion as 500 parsecs
away are all too reminiscent of ancient priests, drawn to obscure
terminology that kept the common folk baffled.

   &UR; BUBBLING UNDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Volcanoes like Krakatau and Mount St. Helens are famous for
their destruction, but studies at a unique undersea observatory are
revealing a much less familiar, nurturing side to eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists with the New Millennium Observatory, monitoring the
ocean bottom 290 miles off the Oregon coast, hit pay dirt in 1998,
when Navy hydrophones picked up loud rumblings of the Axial
Volcano.
</P>
<P>
   A massive outpouring of lava rose up to fill a scar formed where
the Pacific Ocean is pulling away from North America, while Axial's
crater sank by about 10 feet as part of a process that perpetuates
the constant drifting of the continents by creating new ocean
floor.
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of submersible vehicles, tethered robots and automatic
cameras has gathered data ever since the eruption transformed the
landscape nearly a mile down.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption also created an unprecedented opportunity for
scientists to continuously observe a startling sequence of
ecological changes.
</P>
<P>
   Even as lava overran old life at the bottom, jets of water
squeezed out by the volcano disgorged bacteria that thrive at 220
degrees Fahrenheit _ hotter than household boiling water _ from
even more searing environments below.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complete lack of sunlight, bacterial colonies
bloomed around Axial, feeding on volcanic chemicals like hydrogen
sulfide, and tube worms arrived seemingly from nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes of rebirth are probably common along the 40,000
miles of mid-ocean ridges, where the Earth's crust is torn apart.
It will take years for scientists to digest Axial's lessons about
the long-hidden connection between undersea volcanoes, the
biosphere and our planet's geological evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more direct observations of eruptions on Io than on
the seafloor,'' says geologist Robert Embley of NOAA's Pacific
Marine Environmental Laboratory in Oregon, who led two of the
expeditions around Axial. ``This is a whole hidden world.''

</P>
<P>
   Leonardo da Vinci was convinced that sperm came down from the
brain through a channel in the spine, but he could never have
imagined the mysteries of sex revealed by modern technology.
</P>
<P>
   Gynecologist Willibrord Weijmar Schultz of University Hospital
Groningen in the Netherlands persuaded eight couples to have
intercourse inside an MRI scanner and observed never-before-seen
physiological changes.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that, in the missionary position, the penis is
shaped like a boomerang. And contrary to the findings of famed sex
researchers Masters and Johnson, the uterus does not double in size
during intercourse; in fact, it hardly changes at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basic science,'' says Weijmar Schultz. ``Based on this
knowledge, doctors and sexologists can better understand their
patients' problems and find new ways of therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GENETIC CODE BREAKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Human Genome Project began in 1990, scientists expected
it would take 15 years to produce a blueprint of our DNA. But
vastly improved computers and software sped the task: By the end of
this spring, researchers predict, their map will be 90 percent
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Collins, one of the project's chief researchers, shares
his thoughts on cracking the human genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why does it matter if we know the sequences of our 46
chromosomes?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  This is the instruction book for human biology. Everything
we do _ from the time we are a one-celled embryo until adulthood _
and all the ways we fight off diseases or fall victim to them will
be illuminated by understanding these instructions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are probably half a million folks in the
United States who are at risk for colon cancer because they've
inherited a mutation in a DNA repair gene. Now we can identify
those who have this mutation and get them into a medical
surveillance program as early as age 25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Does isolating a genetic defect make it easier to cure the
disease?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Finding the cystic fibrosis gene in 1989 has not yet led to
a cure. But we've learned a huge amount about the normal function
of that gene and how you might compensate for its lack of function.
</P>
<P>
   There are about two dozen new drugs in clinical trials, most of
which would never have been thought of without the gene in hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How many of us bear gene mutations for deadly diseases?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We all carry about four or five lethal recessive genes. If
both parents carried the same recessive gene and they both passed
it on to a child, that would produce a lethal disease. And we all
walk around with 30 or 40 DNA variants that convey a risk for
ailments like diabetes, heart disease, cancer or schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Could insurance companies use this information to refuse
coverage for high-risk carriers?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Both parties in both houses of Congress and the president
of the United States have publicly said we need legislation that
makes it illegal for a health-insurance company to use genetic
information to set premiums or to deny coverage. We just haven't
seen it happen yet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Has your work as a geneticist ever conflicted with your
faith?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  No. For me, being involved in the genome project seems
illuminated by faith. As someone who believes in a personal God, I
find that the opportunity to uncover some of the mysteries of human
biology is also an opportunity for worship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BIRD ON THE PLAIN FLIES MAINLY WITH THE BRAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With accuracy rivaling that of piloted airplanes, homing pigeons
navigate thousands of miles of flight. Nobody knows their secret _
it is almost as if they are reading a map.
</P>
<P>
   That may be exactly what they are doing, says geophysicist Jon
Hagstrum of the United States Geological Survey. He believes the
birds recognize landscapes by sensing infrasound, or very low
frequency sound.
</P>
<P>
   Waterfalls, meteors, ocean waves and winds whistling over
mountains or through tunnels all generate distinctive washes of
infrasound. Lab experiments show that pigeons are sensitive to such
low frequencies, but results do not reveal why.
</P>
<P>
   Hagstrum claims that pigeons use the deep noises to build up
elaborate mental topographic maps. Hagstrum looked at records of
carrier-pigeon races, in which thousands of birds are released all
at once. Four races stood out because the birds returned hopelessly
late or not at all. Each of these events coincided with nearby
flights of the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   The correlation led Hagstrum to the idea that sonic booms from
the plane temporarily deafened the birds, knocking out a natural
ability to picture and map the landscape in infrasound. Other
animals might use the same technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``This theory may explain how monarch butterflies, migratory
birds and whales navigate,'' he says. ``Birds also react to
something before major earthquakes, and I think it's infrasound.''
</P>
<P>
   That may hold clues for humans about how to predict earthquakes.

   &UR; BUBBLING UNDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Volcanoes like Krakatau and Mount St. Helens are famous for
their destruction, but studies at a unique undersea observatory are
revealing a much less familiar, nurturing side to eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists with the New Millennium Observatory, monitoring the
ocean bottom 290 miles off the Oregon coast, hit pay dirt in 1998,
when Navy hydrophones picked up loud rumblings of the Axial
Volcano.
</P>
<P>
   A massive outpouring of lava rose up to fill a scar formed where
the Pacific Ocean is pulling away from North America, whle Axial's
crater sank by about 10 feet as part of a process that perpetuates
the constant drifting of the continents by creating new ocean
floor.
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of submersible vehicles, tethered robots and automatic
cameras has gathered data ever since the eruption transformed the
landscape nearly a mile down.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption also created an unprecedented opportunity for
scientists to continuously observe a startling sequence of
ecological changes.
</P>
<P>
   Even as lava overran old life at the bottom, jets of water
squeezed out by the volcano disgorged bacteria that thrive at 220
degrees Fahrenheit _ hotter than household boiling water _ from
even more searing environments below.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complete lack of sunlight, bacterial colonies
bloomed around Axial, feeding on volcanic chemicals like hydrogen
sulfide, and tube worms arrived seemingly from nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes of rebirth are probably common along the 40,000
miles of mid-ocean ridges, where the Earth's crust is torn apart.
It will take years for scientists to digest Axial's lessons about
the long-hidden connection between undersea volcanoes, the
biosphere and our planet's geological evolution.

<P>
   Last September, Americans got a nasty reminder of how the rest
of the world measures weights and distances. NASA's $165 million
Mars Climate Orbiter stumbled disastrously off course because of a
small mistake: One team of flight controllers had programmed the
spacecraft with English units (pounds and feet), while the other
had entered numbers using a metric scheme (newtons and meters).
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1964, the U.S. National Bureau of Standards officially
endorsed the metric system, with its convenient multiples of 10.
Not much happened. In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter pushed
for national metrication. Not much happened again.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and technologists _ not to mention auto-repair shops
_ deal in centimeters, as they have for years, while everyday life
still chugs along inch by inch.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to going metric in America is not just laziness.
America's common English units often fall into convenient sizes
that do not have simple equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   There's no easy metric substitute for a cup or a gallon _ who
wants a 3.785-liter milk container? A shot of whiskey rolls off the
tongue, but 3 cubic centimeters doesn't. America's customs, from
45-caliber pistols (0.45-inch-diameter barrel bore) to recipes
calling for tablespoons, are awkward at best to metrify.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists sometimes blame the media for perpetuating antiquated
and irrational units of measure, but the press needn't apologize.
The meter is not especially logical or meaningful either.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the meter was supposed to represent 1/10,000,000 of
the distance between the equator and either pole. Then it was
redefined by a particular bar of platinum in a vault in France and
later specified as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange light
emitted by krypton-86 atoms under certain conditions. These days
it's designated as the distance light travels in a vacuum in
1/299,792,458 of a second _ not exactly a household concept.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenheit, with its 180 divisions between water's freezing and
boiling points, is nearly twice as fine as the Celsius system. One
degree Fahrenheit is about the smallest temperature differential a
person can discern. And the 180-degree theme is familiarly repeated
in surveying, geometry, longitude and astronomical positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Problems arise not from the choice of units but from people's
stubborn inconsistency. The aviation community insists that
latitudes be expressed in feet, but that speed be in knots.
Astronomers use 24 hours of ``right ascension'' to make east-west
positions but degrees of ``inclination'' for north-south.
</P>
<P>
   Metric measurement is dumped overboard for jewelry (carats),
sound measurements (decibels) and wherever people prefer the
simplicity of the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of scientifically correct terms goes beyond the
English vs. metric battle. Astronomers, for example, have replaced
the easily understood ``light-year'' with mind-numbing ``parsec.''
A parsec is an arcane unit, 3.26 light-years long, defined as the
distance with which an object would appear to shift back and forth
by an angle of one arc-second as Earth orbits the sun. The
light-year is a logical unit that depends on the amazing constancy
of light's speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Orion nebula is some 1,500 light-years away, meaning its
image has traveled 1,500 years to reach us: simple and easy.
Today's specialists who prefer to think of Orion as 500 parsecs
away are all too reminiscent of ancient priests, drawn to obscure
terminology that kept the common folk baffled.

   A massive outpouring of lava rose up to fill a scar formed where
the Pacific Ocean is pulling away from North America, while Axial's
crater sank by about 10 feet as part of a process that perpetuates
the constant drifting of the continents by creating new ocean
floor.
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of submersible vehicles, tethered robots and automatic
cameras has gathered data ever since the eruption transformed the
landscape nearly a mile down.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption also created an unprecedented opportunity for
scientists to continuously observe a startling sequence of
ecological changes.
</P>
<P>
   Even as lava overran old life at the bottom, jets of water
squeezed out by the volcano disgorged bacteria that thrive at 220
degrees Fahrenheit _ hotter than household boiling water _ from
even more searing environments below.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complete lack of sunlight, bacterial colonies
bloomed around Axial, feeding on volcanic chemicals like hydrogen
sulfide, and tube worms arrived seemingly from nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes of rebirth are probably common along the 40,000
miles of mid-ocean ridges, where the Earth's crust is torn apart.
It will take years for scientists to digest Axial's lessons about
the long-hidden connection between undersea volcanoes, the
biosphere and our planet's geological evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more direct observations of eruptions on Io than on
the seafloor,'' says geologist Robert Embley of NOAA's Pacific
Marine Environmental Laboratory in Oregon, who led two of the
expeditions around Axial. ``This is a whole hidden world.''

<P>
   Leonardo da Vinci was convinced that sperm came down from the
brain through a channel in the spine, but he could never have
imagined the mysteries of sex revealed by modern technology.
</P>
<P>
   Gynecologist Willibrord Weijmar Schultz of University Hospital
Groningen in the Netherlands persuaded eight couples to have
intercourse inside an MRI scanner and observed never-before-seen
physiological changes.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that, in the missionary position, the penis is
shaped like a boomerang. And contrary to the findings of famed sex
researchers Masters and Johnson, the uterus does not double in size
during intercourse; in fact, it hardly changes at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basic science,'' says Weijmar Schultz. ``Based on this
knowledge, doctors and sexologists can better understand their
patients' problems and find new ways of therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GENETIC CODE BREAKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Human Genome Project began in 1990, scientists expected
it would take 15 years to produce a blueprint of our DNA. But
vastly improved computers and software sped the task: By the end of
this spring, researchers predict, their map will be 90 percent
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Collins, one of the project's chief researchers, shares
his thoughts on cracking the human genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why does it matter if we know the sequences of our 46
chromosomes?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  This is the instruction book for human biology. Everything
we do _ from the time we are a one-celled embryo until adulthood _
and all the ways we fight off diseases or fall victim to them will
be illuminated by understanding these instructions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are probably half a million folks in the
United States who are at risk for colon cancer because they've
inherited a mutation in a DNA repair gene. Now we can identify
those who have this mutation and get them into a medical
surveillance program as early as age 25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Does isolating a genetic defect make it easier to cure the
disease?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Finding the cystic fibrosis gene in 1989 has not yet led to
a cure. But we've learned a huge amount about the normal function
of that gene and how you might compensate for its lack of function.
</P>
<P>
   There are about two dozen new drugs in clinical trials, most of
which would never have been thought of without the gene in hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How many of us bear gene mutations for deadly diseases?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We all carry about four or five lethal recessive genes. If
both parents carried the same recessive gene and they both passed
it on to a child, that would produce a lethal disease. And we all
walk around with 30 or 40 DNA variants that convey a risk for
ailments like diabetes, heart disease, cancer or schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Could insurance companies use this information to refuse
coverage for high-risk carriers?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Both parties in both houses of Congress and the president
of the United States have publicly said we need legislation that
makes it illegal for a health-insurance company to use genetic
information to set premiums or to deny coverage. We just haven't
seen it happen yet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Has your work as a geneticist ever conflicted with your
faith?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  No. For me, being involved in the genome project seems
illuminated by faith. As someone who believes in a personal God, I
find that the opportunity to uncover some of the mysteries of human
biology is also an opportunity for worship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BIRD ON THE PLAIN FLIES MAINLY WITH THE BRAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With accuracy rivaling that of piloted airplanes, homing pigeons
navigate thousands of miles of flight. Nobody knows their secret _
it is almost as if they are reading a map.
</P>
<P>
   That may be exactly what they are doing, says geophysicist Jon
Hagstrum of the United States Geological Survey. He believes the
birds recognize landscapes by sensing infrasound, or very low
frequency sound.
</P>
<P>
   Waterfalls, meteors, ocean waves and winds whistling over
mountains or through tunnels all generate distinctive washes of
infrasound. Lab experiments show that pigeons are sensitive to such
low frequencies, but results do not reveal why.
</P>
<P>
   Hagstrum claims that pigeons use the deep noises to build up
elaborate mental topographic maps. Hagstrum looked at records of
carrier-pigeon races, in which thousands of birds are released all
at once. Four races stood out because the birds returned hopelessly
late or not at all. Each of these events coincided with nearby
flights of the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   The correlation led Hagstrum to the idea that sonic booms from
the plane temporarily deafened the birds, knocking out a natural
ability to picture and map the landscape in infrasound. Other
animals might use the same technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``This theory may explain how monarch butterflies, migratory
birds and whales navigate,'' he says. ``Birds also react to
something before major earthquakes, and I think it's infrasound.''
</P>
<P>
   That may hold clues for humans about how to predict earthquakes.

   Volcanoes like Krakatau and Mount St. Helens are famous for
their destruction, but studies at a unique undersea observatory are
revealing a much less familiar, nurturing side to eruptions.

<P>
   Last September, Americans got a nasty reminder of how the rest
of the world measures weights and distances. NASA's $165 million
Mars Climate Orbiter stumbled disastrously off course because of a
small mistake: One team of flight controllers had programmed the
spacecraft with English units (pounds and feet), while the other
had entered numbers using a metric scheme (newtons and meters).
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1964, the U.S. National Bureau of Standards officially
endorsed the metric system, with its convenient multiples of 10.
Not much happened. In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter pushed
for national metrication. Not much happened again.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and technologists _ not to mention auto-repair shops
_ deal in centimeters, as they have for years, while everyday life
still chugs along inch by inch.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to going metric in America is not just laziness.
America's common English units often fall into convenient sizes
that do not have simple equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   There's no easy metric substitute for a cup or a gallon _ who
wants a 3.785-liter milk container? A shot of whiskey rolls off the
tongue, but 3 cubic centimeters doesn't. America's customs, from
45-caliber pistols (0.45-inch-diameter barrel bore) to recipes
calling for tablespoons, are awkward at best to metrify.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists sometimes blame the media for perpetuating antiquated
and irrational units of measure, but the press needn't apologize.
The meter is not especially logical or meaningful either.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the meter was supposed to represent 1/10,000,000 of
the distance between the equator and either pole. Then it was
redefined by a particular bar of platinum in a vault in France and
later specified as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange light
emitted by krypton-86 atoms under certain conditions. These days
it's designated as the distance light travels in a vacuum in
1/299,792,458 of a second _ not exactly a household concept.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenheit, with its 180 divisions between water's freezing and
boiling points, is nearly twice as fine as the Celsius system. One
degree Fahrenheit is about the smallest temperature differential a
person can discern. And the 180-degree theme is familiarly repeated
in surveying, geometry, longitude and astronomical positioning.
</P>
<P>
   Problems arise not from the choice of units but from people's
stubborn inconsistency. The aviation community insists that
latitudes be expressed in feet, but that speed be in knots.
Astronomers use 24 hours of ``right ascension'' to make east-west
positions but degrees of ``inclination'' for north-south.
</P>
<P>
   Metric measurement is dumped overboard for jewelry (carats),
sound measurements (decibels) and wherever people prefer the
simplicity of the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of scientifically correct terms goes beyond the
English vs. metric battle. Astronomers, for example, have replaced
the easily understood ``light-year'' with mind-numbing ``parsec.''
A parsec is an arcane unit, 3.26 light-years long, defined as the
distance with which an object would appear to shift back and forth
by an angle of one arc-second as Earth orbits the sun. The
light-year is a logical unit that depends on the amazing constancy
of light's speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Orion nebula is some 1,500 light-years away, meaning its
image has traveled 1,500 years to reach us: simple and easy.
Today's specialists who prefer to think of Orion as 500 parsecs
away are all too reminiscent of ancient priests, drawn to obscure
terminology that kept the common folk baffled.

   A massive outpouring of lava rose up to fill a scar formed where

   Even as lava overran old life at the bottom, jets of water

   Despite the complete lack of sunlight, bacterial colonies

miles of mid-ocean ridges, where the Earth's crust is torn apart.
It will take years for scientists to digest Axial's lessons about
the long-hidden connection between undersea volcanoes, the
biosphere and our planet's geological evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more direct observations of eruptions on Io than on
the seafloor,'' says geologist Robert Embley of NOAA's Pacific

expeditions around Axial. ``This is a whole hidden world.''

<P>
   Leonardo da Vinci was convinced that sperm came down from the
brain through a channel in the spine, but he could never have
imagined the mysteries of sex revealed by modern technology.
</P>
<P>
   Gynecologist Willibrord Weijmar Schultz of University Hospital
Groningen in the Netherlands persuaded eight couples to have
intercourse inside an MRI scanner and observed never-before-seen
physiological changes.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that, in the missionary position, the penis is
shaped like a boomerang. And contrary to the findings of famed sex
researchers Masters and Johnson, the uterus does not double in size
during intercourse; in fact, it hardly changes at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basic science,'' says Weijmar Schultz. ``Based on this
knowledge, doctors and sexologists can better understand their
patients' problems and find new ways of therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GENETIC CODE BREAKER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Human Genome Project began in 1990, scientists expected
it would take 15 years to produce a blueprint of our DNA. But
vastly improved computers and software sped the task: By the end of
this spring, researchers predict, their map will be 90 percent
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Collins, one of the project's chief researchers, shares
his thoughts on cracking the human genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why does it matter if we know the sequences of our 46
chromosomes?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  This is the instruction book for human biology. Everything
we do _ from the time we are a one-celled embryo until adulthood _
and all the ways we fight off diseases or fall victim to them will
be illuminated by understanding these instructions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are probably half a million folks in the
United States who are at risk for colon cancer because they've
inherited a mutation in a DNA repair gene. Now we can identify
those who have this mutation and get them into a medical
surveillance program as early as age 25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Does isolating a genetic defect make it easier to cure the
disease?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Finding the cystic fibrosis gene in 1989 has not yet led to
a cure. But we've learned a huge amount about the normal function
of that gene and how you might compensate for its lack of function.
</P>
<P>
   There are about two dozen new drugs in clinical trials, most of
which would never have been thought of without the gene in hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How many of us bear gene mutations for deadly diseases?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We all carry about four or five lethal recessive genes. If
both parents carried the same recessive gene and they both passed
it on to a child, that would produce a lethal disease. And we all
walk around with 30 or 40 DNA variants that convey a risk for
ailments like diabetes, heart disease, cancer or schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Could insurance companies use this information to refuse
coverage for high-risk carriers?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Both parties in both houses of Congress and the president
of the United States have publicly said we need legislation that
makes it illegal for a health-insurance company to use genetic
information to set premiums or to deny coverage. We just haven't
seen it happen yet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Has your work as a geneticist ever conflicted with your
faith?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  No. For me, being involved in the genome project seems
illuminated by faith. As someone who believes in a personal God, I
find that the opportunity to uncover some of the mysteries of human
biology is also an opportunity for worship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BIRD ON THE PLAIN FLIES MAINLY WITH THE BRAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With accuracy rivaling that of piloted airplanes, homing pigeons
navigate thousands of miles of flight. Nobody knows their secret _
it is almost as if they are reading a map.
</P>
<P>
   That may be exactly what they are doing, says geophysicist Jon
Hagstrum of the United States Geological Survey. He believes the
birds recognize landscapes by sensing infrasound, or very low
frequency sound.
</P>
<P>
   Waterfalls, meteors, ocean waves and winds whistling over
mountains or through tunnels all generate distinctive washes of
infrasound. Lab experiments show that pigeons are sensitive to such
low frequencies, but results do not reveal why.
</P>
<P>
   Hagstrum claims that pigeons use the deep noises to build up
elaborate mental topographic maps. Hagstrum looked at records of
carrier-pigeon races, in which thousands of birds are released all
at once. Four races stood out because the birds returned hopelessly
late or not at all. Each of these events coincided with nearby
flights of the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   The correlation led Hagstrum to the idea that sonic booms from
the plane temporarily deafened the birds, knocking out a natural
ability to picture and map the landscape in infrasound. Other
animals might use the same technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``This theory may explain how monarch butterflies, migratory
birds and whales navigate,'' he says. ``Birds also react to
something before major earthquakes, and I think it's infrasound.''
</P>
<P>
   That may hold clues for humans about how to predict earthquakes.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Conservative columnist Peggy Noonan, the sweet-talking former
White House speechwriter who gave George Bush his line about ``a
thousand points of light,'' has had her share of first lady
dust-ups. As the only female speechwriter for Ronald Reagan, she
refused requests to write for Nancy Reagan. Later, when she penned
a few gentle words about former Democratic presidents for Barbara
Bush, that first lady never delivered them.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Noonan has always had something nice to say
about America's first ladies _ until now. In her new book, ``The
Case Against Hillary Clinton,'' Noonan throws down the gauntlet,
charging Clinton with everything from ``narcissism'' and
``selfishness'' to ``breathtaking gall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other presidents and first ladies do their work, leave their
imprint and make a graceful exit,'' she writes. ``But the Clintons
_ they'll stay until the last footlight fizzles and pops, and then
we'll have to wrestle them to the floor of the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the first first lady's run for the U.S. Senate,
Noonan is ready to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of imagine myself with a megaphone saying, `This isn't
good!''' she says, sitting on an overstuffed sofa in her cozy Upper
East Side apartment on opening night of this year's presidential
primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton's ambition knows no bounds,'' she continues.
``Her No. 1 priority is to be elected to the Senate. That's her way
of staying in the game. Then she wants to return to the White House
to be the first woman president.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan got the idea for her book last July while writing one of
her regular columns for the Wall Street Journal, in which she
described Hillary as ``the mad boomer,'' eager to represent a state
``that she had no connection to, no history with and no previously
demonstrated interest in.''
</P>
<P>
   And Noonan acknowledges that Hillary could win: ``She has a
real, serious shot. One can't help but assume she is going through
the awkward days of her campaign now and in the last three or four
months, when it really counts, she will have her sea legs and be
highly functioning as a first-rate candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is helped, Noonan says, by her shameless lack of loyalty
to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If her campaign absorbs money that would otherwise have gone
to Gore, that's fine with her,'' Noonan says. ``She doesn't care
who the presidential nominee is, as long as it's somebody who will
help her numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the spate of recently released Hillary books promising
scandalous new revelations about the controversial first lady,
Noonan's polemic focuses on Clinton's political record and what she
describes as her ``prison matron'' need for government to
``discipline people.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing simply and clearly, she accuses the first couple of
``small-time, tin-horn, me-first gimme-ism'' unworthy of liberal
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Noonan's obvious antipathy for Clinton _ whom she has
met several times in Washington _ the two women share some common
ground. Each experimented on both sides of the political aisle,
starting at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before Hillary became a Goldwater girl at her
suburban Chicago high school, 9-year-old Noonan, one of seven
children in an Irish Catholic family, was passing out bumper
stickers for John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my parents' stickers and surreptitiously put them on
the neighbors' cars,'' she recalls. ``Unfortunately, I didn't know
you were supposed to put them on the bumper. And in those days, the
stickers were really sticky.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 27, after graduating from New Jersey's Fairleigh
Dickinson University, she got a job with CBS News radio. Despite
being CBS' token conservative, she spent three years writing for
Dan Rather before leaving to join Reagan's speechwriting shop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, she divorced her husband and returned with her son to
New York, where she wrote her best-selling political memoir, ``What
I Saw at the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Noonan has little doubt that George W. Bush will be
the Republican presidential nominee, although she wonders about his
parents' role on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something odd about it when the father says, `Here's
my boy. He'll make a good president,''' she explains. ``When John
Kennedy ran for president, his parents were hidden. Old Joe never
came out of hiding, and we didn't see the old lady until
inauguration night, when she was interviewed wearing the same dress
she'd worn when she was received by the King and Queen of England
in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to be said for hidden parents,'' Noonan adds,
taking a sip from her ever-present cup of coffee.  &QL; p &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Like her hero, Ronald Reagan, Noonan understands the power of
nostalgia. ``I miss America when it was boring, when you came home
at 5 p.m. to a dinner of mashed potatoes, a little roast beef and
creamed corn out of a can,'' she says with a sigh. ``There was no
self-esteem movement in the old America. Nobody really thought they
deserved a Hermes scarf.'' (She herself likes her neckwear long and
tasseled.)
</P>
<P>
   She also misses the idea of a simpler first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the next first lady can be whoever she wants without
being pushed into an activist role by those who say Hillary Clinton
broke boundaries,'' Noonan says. ``Imagine someone who is happy
with her husband and children, who has her own career and wants to
take on a special issue, such as mental health. In the end, she may
have to fight to be who she wants.'' &QL;

   Noonan got the idea for her book last July while writing one of
her regular columns for the Wall Street Journal, in which she
described Hillary as ``the mad boomer,'' eager to represent a state
``that she had no connection to, no history with and no previously
demonstrated interest in.''
</P>
<P>
   And Noonan acknowledges that Hillary could win: ``She has a
real, serious shot. One can't help but assume she is going through
the awkward days of her campaign now and in the last three or four
months, when it really counts, she will have her sea legs and be
highly functioning as a first-rate candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is helped, Noonan says, by her shameless lack of loyalty
to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If her campaign absorbs money that would otherwise have gone
to Gore, that's fine with her,'' Noonan says. ``She doesn't care
who the presidential nominee is, as long as it's somebody who will
help her numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the spate of recently released Hillary books promising
scandalous new revelations about the controversial first lady,
Noonan's polemic focuses on Clinton's political record and what she
describes as her ``prison matron'' need for government to
``discipline people.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing simply and clearly, she accuses the first couple of
``small-time, tin-horn, me-first gimme-ism'' unworthy of liberal
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Noonan's obvious antipathy for Clinton _ whom she has
met several times in Washington _ the two women share some common
ground. Each experimented on both sides of the political aisle,
starting at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before Hillary became a Goldwater girl at her
suburban Chicago high school, 9-year-old Noonan, one of seven
children in an Irish Catholic family, was passing out bumper
stickers for John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my parents' stickers and surreptitiously put them on
the neighbors' cars,'' she recalls. ``Unfortunately, I didn't know
you were supposed to put them on the bumper. And in those days, the
stickers were really sticky.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 27, after graduating from New Jersey's Fairleigh
Dickinson University, she got a job with CBS News radio. Despite
being CBS' token conservative, she spent three years writing for
Dan Rather before leaving to join Reagan's speechwriting shop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, she divorced her husband and returned with her son to
New York, where she wrote her best-selling political memoir, ``What
I Saw at the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Noonan has little doubt that George W. Bush will be
the Republican presidential nominee, although she wonders about his
parents' role on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something odd about it when the father says, `Here's
my boy. He'll make a good president,''' she explains. ``When John
Kennedy ran for president, his parents were hidden. Old Joe never
came out of hiding, and we didn't see the old lady until
inauguration night, when she was interviewed wearing the same dress
she'd worn when she was received by the King and Queen of England
in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to be said for hidden parents,'' Noonan adds,
taking a sip from her ever-present cup of coffee.  &QL; p &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Like her hero, Ronald Reagan, Noonan understands the power of
nostalgia. ``I miss America when it was boring, when you came home
at 5 p.m. to a dinner of mashed potatoes, a little roast beef and
creamed corn out of a can,'' she says with a sigh. ``There was no
self-esteem movement in the old America. Nobody really thought they
deserved a Hermes scarf.'' (She herself likes her neckwear long and
tasseled.)
</P>
<P>
   She also misses the idea of a simpler first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the next first lady can be whoever she wants without
being pushed into an activist role by those who say Hillary Clinton
broke boundaries,'' Noonan says. ``Imagine someone who is happy
with her husband and children, who has her own career and wants to
take on a special issue, such as mental health. In the end, she may
have to fight to be who she wants.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ It's been long overdue, but retailers and designers
are beginning to capitalize on a trend that's gaining momentum:
maternity chic.
</P>
<P>
   Forget oversized men's shirts, A-line tent dresses and blouses
with panels. The new look being ushered in is sexy and body
conscious _ from HotPants and leather boot-cut designs to halter
tops and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Barneys New York launched a maternity department in
its Manhattan, Beverly Hills and Chicago locations. The department
showcases the store's new private label collection called Barneys
New York Procreation, as well as bikinis from maternity labels
Lattessa and silk shantung dresses from Momma Luna by Soledad
Twomby.
</P>
<P>
   The tony store has also solicited contemporary resources to
create special items _ boot-cut pants from Chaiken and halter
dresses from Tocca, to name a few. Chaiken and Tocca said they are
considering expanding their maternity offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gap, which this month began selling a 16-style
maternity collection online. The offerings include slim stretch
pants and capri jeans. A company spokeswoman said the line is doing
well, but noted the retailer has no immediate plans to stock
maternity wear in its stores.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's East, which has maternity wear in 56 of its 88 locations,
opened a maternity department this spring at its Herald Square
flagship.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a burgeoning crop of 30-something maternity
designers such as Liz Lange, a former Vogue editor; Pumpkin
Wentzel, a former rocker; and Lauren Sara, who closed her
sportswear collection to concentrate on her maternity label M. All
three are developing a loyal clientele of women who can afford to
pay $500 for a dress to be worn for only a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Why the buzz over maternity wear? Fashion observers said what's
pushing maternity chic into the limelight are the recent spate of
pregnant celebrities, such as Annette Bening, Cindy Crawford, Kelly
Preston, Elizabeth Shue and Catherine Zeta-Jones, all of whom have
been proud to be boasting their bellies in sleek designs, not to
mention the recent hoopla surrounding Madonna's pending motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming out ... looking incredible,'' said Emilia
Fabricant, senior vice president and divisional manager of Barneys'
Co-op division. ``They are boasting their pregnancy and wearing
form-fitting, sexy designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness the very pregnant Bening, who turned up at the Academy
Awards in a sleek custom-made black Armani gown.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Armani, however, said it doesn't plan to get
into the maternity business, adding, ``Annette is a close friend of
the house of Armani.''
</P>
<P>
   Another catalyst, according to observers, is that women are
increasingly delaying their decision to have children into their
late 30s and early 40s, and consequently have more money to spend
on maternity wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women have more money and they have a clearly defined
sense of style. They don't want to be hanging around in oversized
men's shirts,'' said Lange, who on March 1 opened a
3,000-square-foot boutique at 958 Madison Avenue featuring denim
HotPants, floral dresses, colorful printed stretch blouses, stretch
boot-cut pants and apron-style tops.
</P>
<P>
   The store offers a wide span of products, including hats, shoes
and bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   Lange, who previously had been working out of a 600-square-foot
store and office space on Lexington Avenue, said she has been
surprised at how fast her business has taken off. In 1997, her
first year of business, sales reached $650,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lange said she has big drams, and plans to open 20 more
boutiques around the country within the next two or three years.
She added that she expects to open a store in Beverly Hills in
September and envisions boutiques in Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco
and Atlanta. Lange also wants to sell her clothes online by next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a designer brand,'' Lange said.
</P>
<P>
   Lange said she is not interested in selling in department stores
because she believes they won't be able to give the high level of
customer service needed.
</P>
<P>
   Her Madison Avenue store, for example, has five salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   Former rocker Wentzel, who is eight months pregnant, conceived
of the idea of starting a maternity wear business in the fall of
1996 when she was touring with her band in a converted fish truck.
</P>
<P>
   Wentzel thought of her sister and best friend complaining about
a dearth of styled maternity wear. Two and a half years ago, she
launched her line under the Pumpkin label and has been able to
attract a solid following. Last year, the business rang up $350,000
in wholesale volume.
</P>
<P>
   Her fall collection, which features 22 styles, including leather
pants and peasant shirts, is sold through her Web site _
Pumpkinmaternity.com _ and through her catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Wentzel's collection is also sold in a couple of San Francisco
stores. The Pumpkin collection retails from $58 for a cotton
T-shirt to $148 for a bias-cut silk dress.
</P>
<P>
   Next on Wentzel's agenda is to open a boutique in NoLIta
sometime in September. She noted that her celebrity clientele,
which has included Kelly Preston, Molly Ringwald and Vanessa
Williams, have helped jump-start the business, given exposure in
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion magazines are paying more attention to maternity
wear,'' Wentzel said.
</P>
<P>
   Maternity wear designer Sara agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in such a media-crazed society, where the consumer is
privy to every intimate private moment,'' said Sara, who dressed
Bening during all four pregnancies. ``Combine that with network
anchors who work until the very day they deliver. There's
heightened interest in personal details about celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara, who operates a studio outside Philadelphia, travels to New
York three days a week to see her clients and also spends time in
Los Angeles to visit her celebrity clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her business, founded six years ago, hit $1 million
in sales, generated from her catalog and through her Web site,
Laurensara.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sara outfits range from $160 for a tank dress to $2,500 for a
beaded gown.
</P>
<P>
   Sara got her start in 1994, when Ellin Saltzman, then Bergdorf
Goodman's fashion director, asked her to design clothes for Lauren
Tisch and other socialites. That prompted her to get into maternity
wear, though despite some heavy lobbying by Sara, Bergdorf's hasn't
carried the label _ or maternity wear.
</P>
<P>
   Being a maternity designer has its challenges, acknowledged
Sara, pointing out that there are still plenty of stores not
committed to a category that has a limited life span for the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult. I don't want to sell to maternity stores,''
Sara said. ``My customer doesn't walk into maternity stores. She
dresses in Jil Sander and Calvin Klein.'' &QL;

 By SUSAN WATTERS  
 c.2000 Fairchild Publications   
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Conservative columnist Peggy Noonan, the sweet-talking former
White House speechwriter who gave George Bush his line about ``a
thousand points of light,'' has had her share of first lady
dust-ups. As the only female speechwriter for Ronald Reagan, she
refused requests to write for Nancy Reagan. Later, when she penned
a few gentle words about former Democratic presidents for Barbara
Bush, that first lady never delivered them.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Noonan has always had something nice to say
about America's first ladies _ until now. In her new book, ``The
Case Against Hillary Clinton,'' Noonan throws down the gauntlet,
charging Clinton with everything from ``narcissism'' and
``selfishness'' to ``breathtaking gall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other presidents and first ladies do their work, leave their
imprint and make a graceful exit,'' she writes. ``But the Clintons
_ they'll stay until the last footlight fizzles and pops, and then
we'll have to wrestle them to the floor of the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the first first lady's run for the U.S. Senate,
Noonan is ready to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of imagine myself with a megaphone saying, `This isn't
good!''' she says, sitting on an overstuffed sofa in her cozy Upper
East Side apartment on opening night of this year's presidential
primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton's ambition knows no bounds,'' she continues.
``Her No. 1 priority is to be elected to the Senate. That's her way
of staying in the game. Then she wants to return to the White House
to be the first woman president.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan got the idea for her book last July while writing one of
her regular columns for the Wall Street Journal, in which she
described Hillary as ``the mad boomer,'' eager to represent a state
``that she had no connection to, no history with and no previously
demonstrated interest in.''
</P>
<P>
   And Noonan acknowledges that Hillary could win: ``She has a
real, serious shot. One can't help but assume she is going through
the awkward days of her campaign now and in the last three or four
months, when it really counts, she will have her sea legs and be
highly functioning as a first-rate candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is helped, Noonan says, by her shameless lack of loyalty
to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If her campaign absorbs money that would otherwise have gone
to Gore, that's fine with her,'' Noonan says. ``She doesn't care
who the presidential nominee is, as long as it's somebody who will
help her numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the spate of recently released Hillary books promising
scandalous new revelations about the controversial first lady,
Noonan's polemic focuses on Clinton's political record and what she
describes as her ``prison matron'' need for government to
``discipline people.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing simply and clearly, she accuses the first couple of
``small-time, tin-horn, me-first gimme-ism'' unworthy of liberal
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Noonan's obvious antipathy for Clinton _ whom she has
met several times in Washington _ the two women share some common
ground. Each experimented on both sides of the political aisle,
starting at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before Hillary became a Goldwater girl at her
suburban Chicago high school, 9-year-old Noonan, one of seven
children in an Irish Catholic family, was passing out bumper
stickers for John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my parents' stickers and surreptitiously put them on
the neighbors' cars,'' she recalls. ``Unfortunately, I didn't know
you were supposed to put them on the bumper. And in those days, the
stickers were really sticky.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 27, after graduating from New Jersey's Fairleigh
Dickinson University, she got a job with CBS News radio. Despite
being CBS' token conservative, she spent three years writing for
Dan Rather before leaving to join Reagan's speechwriting shop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, she divorced her husband and returned with her son to
New York, where she wrote her best-selling political memoir, ``What
I Saw at the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Noonan has little doubt that George W. Bush will be
the Republican presidential nominee, although she wonders about his
parents' role on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something odd about it when the father says, `Here's
my boy. He'll make a good president,''' she explains. ``When John
Kennedy ran for president, his parents were hidden. Old Joe never
came out of hiding, and we didn't see the old lady until
inauguration night, when she was interviewed wearing the same dress
she'd worn when she was received by the King and Queen of England
in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to be said for hidden parents,'' Noonan adds,
taking a sip from her ever-present cup of coffee.  &QL; p &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Like her hero, Ronald Reagan, Noonan understands the power of
nostalgia. ``I miss America when it was boring, when you came home
at 5 p.m. to a dinner of mashed potatoes, a little roast beef and
creamed corn out of a can,'' she says with a sigh. ``There was no
self-esteem movement in the old America. Nobody really thought they
deserved a Hermes scarf.'' (She herself likes her neckwear long and
tasseled.)
</P>
<P>
   She also misses the idea of a simpler first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the next first lady can be whoever she wants without
being pushed into an activist role by those who say Hillary Clinton
broke boundaries,'' Noonan says. ``Imagine someone who is happy
with her husband and children, who has her own career and wants to
take on a special issue, such as mental health. In the end, she may
have to fight to be who she wants.'' &QL;

 By SUSAN WATTERS  
 c.2000 Fairchild Publications   
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Conservative columnist Peggy Noonan, the sweet-talking former
White House speechwriter who gave George Bush his line about ``a
thousand points of light,'' has had her share of first lady
dust-ups. As the only female speechwriter for Ronald Reagan, she
refused requests to write for Nancy Reagan. Later, when she penned
a few gentle words about former Democratic presidents for Barbara
Bush, that first lady never delivered them.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Noonan has always had something nice to say
about America's first ladies _ until now. In her new book, ``The
Case Against Hillary Clinton,'' Noonan throws down the gauntlet,
charging Clinton with everything from ``narcissism'' and
``selfishness'' to ``breathtaking gall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other presidents and first ladies do their work, leave their
imprint and make a graceful exit,'' she writes. ``But the Clintons
_ they'll stay until the last footlight fizzles and pops, and then
we'll have to wrestle them to the floor of the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the first first lady's run for the U.S. Senate,
Noonan is ready to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of imagine myself with a megaphone saying, `This isn't
good!''' she says, sitting on an overstuffed sofa in her cozy Upper
East Side apartment on opening night of this year's presidential
primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton's ambition knows no bounds,'' she continues.
``Her No. 1 priority is to be elected to the Senate. That's her way
of staying in the game. Then she wants to return to the White House
to be the first woman president.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan got the idea for her book last July while writing one of
her regular columns for the Wall Street Journal, in which she
described Hillary as ``the mad boomer,'' eager to represent a state
``that she had no connection to, no history with and no previously
demonstrated interest in.''
</P>
<P>
   And Noonan acknowledges that Hillary could win: ``She has a
real, serious shot. One can't help but assume she is going through
the awkward days of her campaign now and in the last three or four
months, when it really counts, she will have her sea legs and be
highly functioning as a first-rate candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is helped, Noonan says, by her shameless lack of loyalty
to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If her campaign absorbs money that would otherwise have gone
to Gore, that's fine with her,'' Noonan says. ``She doesn't care
who the presidential nominee is, as long as it's somebody who will
help her numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the spate of recently released Hillary books promising
scandalous new revelations about the controversial first lady,
Noonan's polemic focuses on Clinton's political record and what she
describes as her ``prison matron'' need for government to
``discipline people.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing simply and clearly, she accuses the first couple of
``small-time, tin-horn, me-first gimme-ism'' unworthy of liberal
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Noonan's obvious antipathy for Clinton _ whom she has
met several times in Washington _ the two women share some common
ground. Each experimented on both sides of the political aisle,
starting at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before Hillary became a Goldwater girl at her
suburban Chicago high school, 9-year-old Noonan, one of seven
children in an Irish Catholic family, was passing out bumper
stickers for John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my parents' stickers and surreptitiously put them on
the neighbors' cars,'' she recalls. ``Unfortunately, I didn't know
you were supposed to put them on the bumper. And in those days, the
stickers were really sticky.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 27, after graduating from New Jersey's Fairleigh
Dickinson University, she got a job with CBS News radio. Despite
being CBS' token conservative, she spent three years writing for
Dan Rather before leaving to join Reagan's speechwriting shop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, she divorced her husband and returned with her son to
New York, where she wrote her best-selling political memoir, ``What
I Saw at the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Noonan has little doubt that George W. Bush will be
the Republican presidential nominee, although she wonders about his
parents' role on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something odd about it when the father says, `Here's
my boy. He'll make a good president,''' she explains. ``When John
Kennedy ran for president, his parents were hidden. Old Joe never
came out of hiding, and we didn't see the old lady until
inauguration night, when she was interviewed wearing the same dress

in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to be said for hidden parents,'' Noonan adds,

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's been long overdue, but retailers and designers
are beginning to capitalize on a trend that's gaining momentum:
maternity chic.
</P>
<P>
   Forget oversized men's shirts, A-line tent dresses and blouses
with panels. The new look being ushered in is sexy and body
conscious _ from HotPants and leather boot-cut designs to halter
tops and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Barneys New York launched a maternity department in
its Manhattan, Beverly Hills and Chicago locations. The department
showcases the store's new private label collection called Barneys
New York Procreation, as well as bikinis from maternity labels
Lattessa and silk shantung dresses from Momma Luna by Soledad
Twomby.
</P>
<P>
   The tony store has also solicited contemporary resources to
create special items _ boot-cut pants from Chaiken and halter
dresses from Tocca, to name a few. Chaiken and Tocca said they are
considering expanding their maternity offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gap, which this month began selling a 16-style
maternity collection online. The offerings include slim stretch
pants and capri jeans. A company spokeswoman said the line is doing
well, but noted the retailer has no immediate plans to stock
maternity wear in its stores.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's East, which has maternity wear in 56 of its 88 locations,
opened a maternity department this spring at its Herald Square
flagship.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a burgeoning crop of 30-something maternity
designers such as Liz Lange, a former Vogue editor; Pumpkin
Wentzel, a former rocker; and Lauren Sara, who closed her
sportswear collection to concentrate on her maternity label M. All
three are developing a loyal clientele of women who can afford to
pay $500 for a dress to be worn for only a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Why the buzz over maternity wear? Fashion observers said what's
pushing maternity chic into the limelight are the recent spate of
pregnant celebrities, such as Annette Bening, Cindy Crawford, Kelly
Preston, Elizabeth Shue and Catherine Zeta-Jones, all of whom have
been proud to be boasting their bellies in sleek designs, not to
mention the recent hoopla surrounding Madonna's pending motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming out ... looking incredible,'' said Emilia
Fabricant, senior vice president and divisional manager of Barneys'
Co-op division. ``They are boasting their pregnancy and wearing
form-fitting, sexy designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness the very pregnant Bening, who turned up at the Academy
Awards in a sleek custom-made black Armani gown.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Armani, however, said it doesn't plan to get
into the maternity business, adding, ``Annette is a close friend of
the house of Armani.''
</P>
<P>
   Another catalyst, according to observers, is that women are
increasingly delaying their decision to have children into their
late 30s and early 40s, and consequently have more money to spend
on maternity wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women have more money and they have a clearly defined
sense of style. They don't want to be hanging around in oversized
men's shirts,'' said Lange, who on March 1 opened a
3,000-square-foot boutique at 958 Madison Avenue featuring denim
HotPants, floral dresses, colorful printed stretch blouses, stretch
boot-cut pants and apron-style tops.
</P>
<P>
   The store offers a wide span of products, including hats, shoes
and bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   Lange, who previously had been working out of a 600-square-foot
store and office space on Lexington Avenue, said she has been
surprised at how fast her business has taken off. In 1997, her
first year of business, sales reached $650,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lange said she has big dreams, and plans to open 20 more
boutiques around the country within the next two or three years.
She added that she expects to open a store in Beverly Hills in
September and envisions boutiques in Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco
and Atlanta. Lange also wants to sell her clothes online by next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a designer brand,'' Lange said.
</P>
<P>
   Lange said she is not interested in selling in department stores
because she believes they won't be able to give the high level of
customer service needed.
</P>
<P>
   Her Madison Avenue store, for example, has five salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   Former rocker Wentzel, who is eight months pregnant, conceived
of the idea of starting a maternity wear business in the fall of
1996 when she was touring with her band in a converted fish truck.
</P>
<P>
   Wentzel thought of her sister and best friend complaining about
a dearth of styled maternity wear. Two and a half years ago, she
launched her line under the Pumpkin label and has been able to
attract a solid following. Last year, the business rang up $350,000
in wholesale volume.
</P>
<P>
   Her fall collection, which features 22 styles, including leather
pants and peasant shirts, is sold through her Web site _
Pumpkinmaternity.com _ and through her catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Wentzel's collection is also sold in a couple of San Francisco
stores. The Pumpkin collection retails from $58 for a cotton
T-shirt to $148 for a bias-cut silk dress.
</P>
<P>
   Next on Wentzel's agenda is to open a boutique in NoLIta
sometime in September. She noted that her celebrity clientele,
which has included Kelly Preston, Molly Ringwald and Vanessa
Williams, have helped jump-start the business, given exposure in
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion magazines are paying more attention to maternity
wear,'' Wentzel said.
</P>
<P>
   Maternity wear designer Sara agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in such a media-crazed society, where the consumer is
privy to every intimate private moment,'' said Sara, who dressed
Bening during all four pregnancies. ``Combine that with network
anchors who work until the very day they deliver. There's
heightened interest in personal details about celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara, who operates a studio outside Philadelphia, travels to New
York three days a week to see her clients and also spends time in
Los Angeles to visit her celebrity clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her business, founded six years ago, hit $1 million
in sales, generated from her catalog and through her Web site,
Laurensara.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sara outfits range from $160 for a tank dress to $2,500 for a
beaded gown.
</P>
<P>
   Sara got her start in 1994, when Ellin Saltzman, then Bergdorf
Goodman's fashion director, asked her to design clothes for Lauren
Tisch and other socialites. That prompted her to get into maternity
wear, though despite some heavy lobbying by Sara, Bergdorf's hasn't
carried the label _ or maternity wear.
</P>
<P>
   Being a maternity designer has its challenges, acknowledged
Sara, pointing out that there are still plenty of stores not
committed to a category that has a limited life span for the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult. I don't want to sell to maternity stores,''
Sara said. ``My customer doesn't walk into maternity stores. She
dresses in Jil Sander and Calvin Klein.'' &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If you seek the city of Sherlock Holmes, the fog-bound London
illuminated by gaslight and dreams, you can still find it to a
surprising degree. On a visit last August, I discovered that Holmes
was an apt guide to London, where the game's still afoot, and so is
the touring.
 &HT;    In ``The Red-Headed League,'' Holmes remarks to Watson, ``It is
a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.'' So, using
his tales, I set out to follow Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's clues on
foot.
 &HT;    The Holmes pilgrim is often cast down by the dull expanse of
modern Baker Street. This heavily trafficked artery between
Regent's Park and Oxford Street is filled with small businesses,
sandwich shops and banks, and certainly doesn't evoke hansom cabs
clip-clopping along cobbled streets.
 &HT;    Since 1932, the Abbey National Bank headquarters has filled the
space for Nos. 215 to 229 Baker Street, including, of course, what
would have been 221-B Baker St., Holmes' fictional address. So, the
bank has long fostered an association with the detective, even
posting an historical plaque in 1985 across the street from the
Baker Street Underground station.
 &HT;    The first time I found it, an English friend turned to me and
said, ``Don't you think it is odd we are standing here, visiting an
imaginary address of an imaginary person?''
 &HT;    Sherlock Holmes has assumed a reality few fictional characters
have. Abbey National has a full-time employee answering 40 to 100
letters and requests a week addressed to him. His 221-B Baker St.
vies with No. 10 Downing St. as the most famous address in London.
 &HT;    Things on Baker Street have changed in the last 10 years,
however. G. K. Chesterton, noting the astonishing popularity of
Conan Doyle's creation, proposed 70 years ago that London needed a
statue of Holmes. Though it took decades, that idea was finally
realized last September, when a nine-foot bronze statue by the
English sculptor John Doubleday was unveiled outside of the
Marylebone exit of the Baker Street station.
 &HT;    The imposing and calm Holmes, holding his pipe, now looms over
his rightful place, providing the magnet his followers have always
sought.
 &HT;    But the person who really forged a new Baker Street identity is
a businesswoman, Marcelle Shulman. A decade ago, she started
selling and producing a few quality souvenirs of Holmes to satisfy
tourists who were disappointed that their hero was so invisible.
Her Sherlock Holmes Memorabilia Company at No. 230 sells walking
sticks, deerstalker hats, pipes, chess sets and hundreds of other
Holmesian items.
 &HT;    Across the street is the Sherlock Holmes Museum, an evocation of
No. 221-B, even to the 17 steps to the first-floor rooms and its
usurpation of the address. Everything in the three-story museum is
presented in an agreeably understated manner, without the
hyper-appeal of lasers and holograms found at so many new London
attractions. Nothing is displayed that is not mentioned in the
stories, and the crowded and ornate Victorian spell is so expertly
cast that you feel Holmes and Watson may walk in at any moment.
 &HT;    Farther south on Baker Street, No. 109 is one of the few
three-story red brick flats on the street dating from 1900, looking
as No. 221-B might have in Conan Doyle's day. Baker Street would
have been quiet and placid in that era.
 &HT;    As you near Oxford Street, you will be near the Wallace
Collection, one of London's loveliest museums. The Wallace's quiet,
ornate galleries provide a welcome respite from the city's pace. It
has many paintings by the Vernets, a French family of painters, in
Rooms 11 and 23.
 &HT;    In ``The Greek Interpreter,'' Holmes confesses to Watson that he
is descended from the Vernet family, and ``art in the blood is
liable to take the strangest forms.''
 &HT;    Upon reaching Oxford Street, it's a short walk east to Regent
Street, which curves splendidly to Piccadilly Circus. On the left,
just where it curves at the Quadrant, is the Cafe Royal, a
splendidly elegant French restaurant since 1865 and the place where
Holmes was attacked in ``The Adventure of the Illustrious Client.''
 &HT;    A little farther on, opposite the Eros statue in Piccadilly
Circus, was the Criterion Bar, where Watson first heard mention of
Holmes, an eccentric fellow studying at St. Bartholomew's Hospital
who needed a roommate. Past the Circus on Regent are the stately
clubs of Pall Mall, one of which might have been the Diogenes Club,
Holmes's brother Mycroft's club, where members were forbidden to
speak.
 &HT;    Turning east, continue to Charing Cross Road, the great avenue
that just before the young Sherlock arrived in London, was cut
through from Oxford Street to Trafalgar Square, sweeping aside some
of the poorest slums.
 &HT;    The Victorians boldly transformed the London of Dickens into
that of Conan Doyle, creating not just Charing Cross Road, but
rebuilding Regent Street, enlarging Piccadilly Circus, laying out
the great Shaftesbury Avenue, and most magnificently of all,
constructing the three-mile Embankment along the Thames.
 &HT;    In front of the Charing Cross Hotel, you can stand near the spot
where Holmes caught a spy, where Watson banked (and kept his box of
notes) and where, just across the street, they sent off urgent
telegrams. It is here, not Baker Street, where the most incidents
in the Holmes saga are recorded.
 &HT;    Among the many bookstores of Charing Cross, Murder One is a must
for anyone who loves detective stories. It claims to stock every
mystery story in print in Britain, and specializes in Sherlock
Holmes material from all over the world.
 &HT;    South of Murder One, along Cecil Court, where there are clusters
of specialty book shops, Nigel Williams has a good selection of
first editions of Conan Doyle.
 &HT;    After Charing Cross Road becomes Tottenham Court Road, a right
onto Great Russell Street leads to the British Museum, across from
which is the Museum Tavern. This place, the pub in Holmes'
Christmas tale, ``The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle,'' seems
hardly changed. The outside lamps are gas, inside is old wooden
paneling.
 &HT;    When he came to London in the late 1870s, Holmes lived around
the corner on Montague Street, near where Conan Doyle himself lived
when he moved to London.
 &HT;    Heading south on Shaftesbury and then on Neal Street brings you
to Covent Garden, where the Christmas goose in ``The Blue
Carbuncle'' was procured. The bustling wholesale flower, vegetable
and fruit markets of Holmes's era have been swept away, replaced by
crowds enjoying performance art and singers putting on free shows.
 &HT;    Nothing satisfied Holmes more after the conclusion of a
particularly baffling case than to end the evening at the renowned
Simpson's-in-the-Strand. Strolling south to the Strand, you'll pass
the recently renovated Royal Opera House, often attended by Holmes
in its previous incarnation. See as well the police court on Bow
Street where Holmes makes an astonishing deduction to conclude
``The Man with a Twisted Lip.''
 &HT;    Simpson's, with its classic English menu and white-vested formal
waiters, has been a part of the London scene since 1828, one of the
few places that allows you to feel that you have entered Victorian
society. All it takes is reservations (and a tie for gentlemen) and
there you are, being soberly served as if you were Prime Minister
Gladstone, who came for the rolling steamers of roast beef or lamb
ready to be cut to one's specifications.
 &HT;    Amid the gleaming crystal and old dark Adam paneling, it's clear
why Watson describes in 1902 the pleasures to be had sitting here
at a table ``looking down at the rushing stream of life on the
Strand.''
 &HT;    Another favorite destination of Sherlockians is a small pub
tucked in at the turn of Northumberland Street, near Charing Cross
Station. The Sherlock Holmes Public House and Restaurant, near Old
Scotland Yard and the Turkish baths frequented by Holmes and
Watson, is in what was the Northumberland Arms, the hotel mentioned
in the greatest of all mystery stories.
 &HT;    It was there that Henry Baskerville stayed when he arrived in
England to claim his inheritance, and only his finding a boot in
the hallway started Holmes toward a solution to the deadly curse of
the Baskervilles.
 &HT;    The pub is often crowded and serves good ales and classic pub
grub. Exhibits line the walls detailing the adventures of the great
detective, including a mounted head of the ghastly hound, an army
service revolver of the type Watson carried, and old Strand
Magazine drawings by the master illustrator Sidney Paget.
 &HT;    Upstairs, a 10-by-12-foot reproduction of the famous sitting
room of 221-B, created for the 1952 Festival of Britain by the
Abbey National Bank, is on display, too. Behind glass is a wax
figure of Holmes in the window by which he foiled an assassination
attempt in ``The Empty House,'' and the violin, and the pipe rack
and the morphine needles of Holmes's most unfortunate habit.
 &HT;    A bit more refined menu is served upstairs in a crowded room
with a clublike atmosphere. I ordered Mrs. Hudson's Steak and Ale
Pie (named for Holmes's landlady), a grand, flaky puff pastry atop
generous portions of cubed steak and potatoes, which came with a
wonderful salad.
 &HT;    On my last night in London, I managed to return to the pub 10
minutes before it closed. Savoring the special Sherlock Holmes Ale,
I sat outside as a street cleaner swept the deserted Westminster
Street. Soon, I found myself strolling along the Strand,
remembering the passage from ``The Resident Patient'' when Holmes
turns to Watson and says: ``But the evening has brought a breeze
with it. What do you say to a ramble through London?''

 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Hotels have become as adept as the airlines at shifting their
prices to suit the marketplace. So when it comes time to shop
around, a single call or a simple visit to a Web site is rarely
enough. It's usually worth calling the hotel directly and visiting
their Web site. Granted, there are times when the prices for the
same room are identical, but there are also times when there are
sharp differences.
 &HT;    For example, there may be incentives for booking through the Web
site. A hotel may be trying to funnel more traffic through its
Internet site and offering a discount for those who do so.
 &HT;    There are also special offers floating around and it's vital to
inquire about them. That's because these offers are not always
targeted at every traveler who's staying at the property. A special
may be aimed at a local market, to beef up weekend stays. It may be
targeted regionally; or nationally. So it always pays to ask _ just
as it always pays to use every additional discount, from those
offered by the American Automobile Association and the American
Association of Retired Persons.
 &HT;    For big city hotels, start with hotel brokers like Quikbook (381
Park Ave. South, New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887;
www.quikbook.com), Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder,
Colo. 80301; 800-356-1123; www.express-res.com) and Hotel
Reservations Network (8140 Walnut Hill Lane, Suite 800, Dallas,
Texas 75231; 800-96-HOTEL; www.180096hotel.com).
 &HT;    Figure on discounts from 15 percent to 40 percent off published
rates in major U.S. city hotels, based on availability, of course.
Use their maps and descriptions to find a property. Then call the
hotel directly to make sure it is indeed a rock-bottom price.
 &HT;    Unfamiliar with a city? Head to one of the city guides on
Digital City (www.digitalcities.com), which is probably the best
city guide on the Web. It now offers hotel reservations through a
link with Travelocity.com (www.travelocity.com).
 &HT;    Other online agencies, such as Expedia.com (www.expedia.com),
also offer the ability to book hotels online. These rates are
usually subject to some discounting, also referred to as a
``preferred rate.''
 &HT;    If your ideal vacation paradise must include sand and palm
trees, Pleasant Holidays (2404 Townsgate Road, West Lake Village,
Calif. 91361; 800-242-9244; www.2hawaii.com) is a master discounter
known for putting together some of the best-priced
air/hotel/transfer deals to Hawaii and Mexico, utilizing a vast
stock of hotels and condos.
 &HT;    Consumers should also contact airlines like American, Delta and
United or visit their Web sites and peruse the air/hotel/transfer
packages that they market. Their prices are often favorable because
they move so many people.
 &HT;    What's more, there are often short-term sales that might appeal
to the undecided. There might be a fire sale on unsold beach
vacations to Jamaica, Miami or Puerto Rico. Those same airlines'
tour desks also offer vacations, and sales, to Asia, Europe and
Latin America. That can be the best way to get a good rate on a
foreign hotel.
 &HT;    For upscale resorts, such as the Four Seasons and Oberoi chains,
in Asia or the Caribbean, a travel agent can be a godsend. It's
also true for luxury hotels in Europe. But expect to be charged a
fee for such service.
 &HT;    A good agent who's a member of the consortium called Virtuoso
(500 Main St., Suite 500 E, Fort Worth, Texas 76102; 800-401-4274;
www.apitravel.com), formerly known as API Travel Consultants, can
often get travelers an upgrade or other perks. It's not discounting
but value-added service that they provide.
 &HT;    Virtuoso is now partnering with Travelocity.com on a new
``Specialists Referral Network.'' It's fee-based and allows Web
travelers a chance to use the expertise and clout of a Virtuoso
member.
 &HT;    For those who are booking a major chain hotel on their own _
from a Sheraton to a Westin to a Hyatt _ visit their Web site, call
their toll-free number and then call the front desk directly. There
may be a disparity in price.
 &HT;    Sometimes it's the local phone call that yields the best deal.
Why? Because it's the manager's price. He's the one looking at the
advance bookings with an eye to filling his property. An unsold
room provides no revenue.
 &HT;    But it's different with smaller, independently owned hotels or
small, mid-priced chains. Book directly with them or use their Web
sites.
 &HT;    The Web route is a good strategy for those who are taking charge
of a European vacation, for example, and their French or Italian
won't pass muster on an international phone call. Besides, small
European hotels often won't budge from their posted prices.
 &HT;    Small hotels are not subject to the yield management and
consequent multiple prices for the exact same room that major chain
hotels have. The price difference has to do with room size, with
smaller rooms priced accordingly. The price-sensitive traveler
should ask about such rooms.
 &HT;    The bottom line is that with a few calls, some Web browsing and
a little perseverance, every traveler should be able to get the
best possible price on a hotel room.

 &HT;    Hotels have become as adept as the airlines at shifting their
prices to suit the marketplace. So when it comes time to shop
around, a single call or a simple visit to a Web site is rarely
enough. It's usually worth calling the hotel directly and visiting
their Web site. Granted, there are times when the prices for the
same room are identical, but there are also times when there are
sharp differences.
 &HT;    For example, there may be incentives for booking through the Web
site. A hotel may be trying to funnel more traffic through its
Internet site and offering a discount for those who do so.
 &HT;    There are also special offers floating around and it's vital to
inquire about them. That's because these offers are not always
targeted at every traveler who's staying at the property. A special
may be aimed at a local market, to beef up weekend stays. It may be

DEDUCING HOLMES' CITY

Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN KENDRICK  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If you seek the city of Sherlock Holmes, the fog-bound London
illuminated by gaslight and dreams, you can still find it to a
surprising degree. On a visit last August, I discovered that Holmes
was an apt guide to London, where the game's still afoot, and so is
the touring.
 &HT;    In ``The Red-Headed League,'' Holmes remarks to Watson, ``It is
a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.'' So, using
his tales, I set out to follow Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's clues on
foot.
 &HT;    The Holmes pilgrim is often cast down by the dull expanse of
modern Baker Street. This heavily trafficked artery between
Regent's Park and Oxford Street is filled with small businesses,
sandwich shops and banks, and certainly doesn't evoke hansom cabs
clip-clopping along cobbled streets.
 &HT;    Since 1932, the Abbey National Bank headquarters has filled the
space for Nos. 215 to 229 Baker Street, including, of course, what
would have been 221-B Baker St., Holmes' fictional address. So, the
bank has long fostered an association with the detective, even
posting an historical plaque in 1985 across the street from the
Baker Street Underground station.
 &HT;    The first time I found it, an English friend turned to me and
said, ``Don't you think it is odd we are standing here, visiting an
imaginary address of an imaginary person?''
 &HT;    Sherlock Holmes has assumed a reality few fictional characters
have. Abbey National has a full-time employee answering 40 to 100
letters and requests a week addressed to him. His 221-B Baker St.
vies with No. 10 Downing St. as the most famous address in London.
 &HT;    Things on Baker Street have changed in the last 10 years,
however. G. K. Chesterton, noting the astonishing popularity of
Conan Doyle's creation, proposed 70 years ago that London needed a
statue of Holmes. Though it took decades, that idea was finally
realized last September, when a nine-foot bronze statue by the
English sculptor John Doubleday was unveiled outside of the
Marylebone exit of the Baker Street station.
 &HT;    The imposing and calm Holmes, holding his pipe, now looms over
his rightful place, providing the magnet his followers have always
sought.
 &HT;    But the person who really forged a new Baker Street identity is
a businesswoman, Marcelle Shulman. A decade ago, she started
selling and producing a few quality souvenirs of Holmes to satisfy
tourists who were disappointed that their hero was so invisible.
Her Sherlock Holmes Memorabilia Company at No. 230 sells walking
sticks, deerstalker hats, pipes, chess sets and hundreds of other
Holmesian items.
 &HT;    Across the street is the Sherlock Holmes Museum, an evocation of
No. 221-B, even to the 17 steps to the first-floor rooms and its
usurpation of the address. Everything in the three-story museum is
presented in an agreeably understated manner, without the
hyper-appeal of lasers and holograms found at so many new London
attractions. Nothing is displayed that is not mentioned in the
stories, and the crowded and ornate Victorian spell is so expertly
cast that you feel Holmes and Watson may walk in at any moment.
 &HT;    Farther south on Baker Street, No. 109 is one of the few
three-story red brick flats on the street dating from 1900, looking
as No. 221-B might have in Conan Doyle's day. Baker Street would
have been quiet and placid in that era.
 &HT;    As you near Oxford Street, you will be near the Wallace
Collection, one of London's loveliest museums. The Wallace's quiet,
ornate galleries provide a welcome respite from the city's pace. It
has many paintings by the Vernets, a French family of painters, in
Rooms 11 and 23.
 &HT;    In ``The Greek Interpreter,'' Holmes confesses to Watson that he
is descended from the Vernet family, and ``art in the blood is
liable to take the strangest forms.''
 &HT;    Upon reaching Oxford Street, it's a short walk east to Regent
Street, which curves splendidly to Piccadilly Circus. On the left,
just where it curves at the Quadrant, is the Cafe Royal, a
splendidly elegant French restaurant since 1865 and the place where
Holmes was attacked in ``The Adventure of the Illustrious Client.''
 &HT;    A little farther on, opposite the Eros statue in Piccadilly
Circus, was the Criterion Bar, where Watson first heard mention of
Holmes, an eccentric fellow studying at St. Bartholomew's Hospital
who needed a roommate. Past the Circus on Regent are the stately
clubs of Pall Mall, one of which might have been the Diogenes Club,
Holmes's brother Mycroft's club, where members were forbidden to
speak.
 &HT;    Turning east, continue to Charing Cross Road, the great avenue
that just before the young Sherlock arrived in London, was cut
through from Oxford Street to Trafalgar Square, sweeping aside some
of the poorest slums.
 &HT;    The Victorians boldly transformed the London of Dickens into
that of Conan Doyle, creating not just Charing Cross Road, but
rebuilding Regent Street, enlarging Piccadilly Circus, laying out
the great Shaftesbury Avenue, and most magnificently of all,
constructing the three-mile Embankment along the Thames.
 &HT;    In front of the Charing Cross Hotel, you can stand near the spot
where Holmes caught a spy, where Watson banked (and kept his box of
notes) and where, just across the street, they sent off urgent
telegrams. It is here, not Baker Street, where the most incidents
in the Holmes saga are recorded.
 &HT;    Among the many bookstores of Charing Cross, Murder One is a must
for anyone who loves detective stories. It claims to stock every
mystery story in print in Britain, and specializes in Sherlock
Holmes material from all over the world.
 &HT;    South of Murder One, along Cecil Court, where there are clusters
of specialty book shops, Nigel Williams has a good selection of
first editions of Conan Doyle.
 &HT;    After Charing Cross Road becomes Tottenham Court Road, a right
onto Great Russell Street leads to the British Museum, across from
which is the Museum Tavern. This place, the pub in Holmes'
Christmas tale, ``The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle,'' seems
hardly changed. The outside lamps are gas, inside is old wooden
paneling.
 &HT;    When he came to London in the late 1870s, Holmes lived around
the corner on Montague Street, near where Conan Doyle himself lived
when he moved to London.
 &HT;    Heading south on Shaftesbury and then on Neal Street brings you
to Covent Garden, where the Christmas goose in ``The Blue
Carbuncle'' was procured. The bustling wholesale flower, vegetable
and fruit markets of Holmes's era have been swept away, replaced by
crowds enjoying performance art and singers putting on free shows.
 &HT;    Nothing satisfied Holmes more after the conclusion of a
particularly baffling case than to end the evening at the renowned
Simpson's-in-the-Strand. Strolling south to the Strand, you'll pass
the recently renovated Royal Opera House, often attended by Holmes
in its previous incarnation. See as well the police court on Bow
Street where Holmes makes an astonishing deduction to conclude
``The Man with a Twisted Lip.''
 &HT;    Simpson's, with its classic English menu and white-vested formal
waiters, has been a part of the London scene since 1828, one of the
few places that allows you to feel that you have entered Victorian
society. All it takes is reservations (and a tie for gentlemen) and
there you are, being soberly served as if you were Prime Minister
Gladstone, who came for the rolling steamers of roast beef or lamb
ready to be cut to one's specifications.
 &HT;    Amid the gleaming crystal and old dark Adam paneling, it's clear
why Watson describes in 1902 the pleasures to be had sitting here
at a table ``looking down at the rushing stream of life on the
Strand.''
 &HT;    Another favorite destination of Sherlockians is a small pub
tucked in at the turn of Northumberland Street, near Charing Cross
Station. The Sherlock Holmes Public House and Restaurant, near Old
Scotland Yard and the Turkish baths frequented by Holmes and
Watson, is in what was the Northumberland Arms, the hotel mentioned
in the greatest of all mystery stories.
 &HT;    It was there that Henry Baskerville stayed when he arrived in
England to claim his inheritance, and only his finding a boot in
the hallway started Holmes toward a solution to the deadly curse of
the Baskervilles.
 &HT;    The pub is often crowded and serves good ales and classic pub
grub. Exhibits line the walls detailing the adventures of the great
detective, including a mounted head of the ghastly hound, an army
service revolver of the type Watson carried, and old Strand
Magazine drawings by the master illustrator Sidney Paget.
 &HT;    Upstairs, a 10-by-12-foot reproduction of the famous sitting
room of 221-B, created for the 1952 Festival of Britain by the
Abbey National Bank, is on display, too. Behind glass is a wax
figure of Holmes in the window by which he foiled an assassination
attempt in ``The Empty House,'' and the violin, and the pipe rack
and the morphine needles of Holmes's most unfortunate habit.
 &HT;    A bit more refined menu is served upstairs in a crowded room
with a clublike atmosphere. I ordered Mrs. Hudson's Steak and Ale
Pie (named for Holmes's landlady), a grand, flaky puff pastry atop
generous portions of cubed steak and potatoes, which came with a
wonderful salad.
 &HT;    On my last night in London, I managed to return to the pub 10
minutes before it closed. Savoring the special Sherlock Holmes Ale,
I sat outside as a street cleaner swept the deserted Westminster
Street. Soon, I found myself strolling along the Strand,
remembering the passage from ``The Resident Patient'' when Holmes
turns to Watson and says: ``But the evening has brought a breeze
with it. What do you say to a ramble through London?''

 &HT;    If you seek the city of Sherlock Holmes, the fog-bound London
illuminated by gaslight and dreams, you can still find it to a
surprising degree. On a visit last August, I discovered that Holmes
was an apt guide to London, where the game's still afoot, and so is
the touring.
 &HT;    In ``The Red-Headed League,'' Holmes remarks to Watson, ``It is
a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.'' So, using
his tales, I set out to follow Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's clues on
foot.
 &HT;    The Holmes pilgrim is often cast down by the dull expanse of
modern Baker Street. This heavily trafficked artery between
Regent's Park and Oxford Street is filled with small businesses,
sandwich shops and banks, and certainly doesn't evoke hansom cabs
clip-clopping along cobbled streets.
 &HT;    Since 1932, the Abbey National Bank headquarters has filled the
space for Nos. 215 to 229 Baker Street, including, of course, what
would have been 221-B Baker St., Holmes' fictional address. So, the
bank has long fostered an association with the detective, even
posting an historical plaque in 1985 across the street from the
Baker Street Underground station.
 &HT;    The first time I found it, an English friend turned to me and
said, ``Don't you think it is odd we are standing here, visiting an
imaginary address of an imaginary person?''
 &HT;    Sherlock Holmes has assumed a reality few fictional characters
have. Abbey National has a full-time employee answering 40 to 100
letters and requests a week addressed to him. His 221-B Baker St.
vies with No. 10 Downing St. as the most famous address in London.
 &HT;    Things on Baker Street have changed in the last 10 years,
however. G. K. Chesterton, noting the astonishing popularity of
Conan Doyle's creation, proposed 70 years ago that London needed a
statue of Holmes. Though it took decades, that idea was finally
realized last September, when a nine-foot bronze statue by the
English sculptor John Doubleday was unveiled outside of the
Marylebone exit of the Baker Street station.
 &HT;    The imposing and calm Holmes, holding his pipe, now looms over
his rightful place, providing the magnet his followers have always
sought.
 &HT;    But the person who really forged a new Baker Street identity is
a businesswoman, Marcelle Shulman. A decade ago, she started
selling and producing a few quality souvenirs of Holmes to satisfy
tourists who were disappointed that their hero was so invisible.
Her Sherlock Holmes Memorabilia Company at No. 230 sells walking
sticks, deerstalker hats, pipes, chess sets and hundreds of other
Holmesian items.
 &HT;    Across the street is the Sherlock Holmes Museum, an evocation of
No. 221-B, even to the 17 steps to the first-floor rooms and its
usurpation of the address. Everything in the three-story museum is
presented in an agreeably understated manner, without the
hyper-appeal of lasers and holograms found at so many new London
attractions. Nothing is displayed that is not mentioned in the
stories, and the crowded and ornate Victorian spell is so expertly
cast that you feel Holmes and Watson may walk in at any moment.
 &HT;    Farther south on Baker Street, No. 109 is one of the few
three-story red brick flats on the street dating from 1900, looking
as No. 221-B might have in Conan Doyle's day. Baker Street would
have been quiet and placid in that era.
 &HT;    As you near Oxford Street, you will be near the Wallace
Collection, one of London's loveliest museums. The Wallace's quiet,
ornate galleries provide a welcome respite from the city's pace. It
has many paintings by the Vernets, a French family of painters, in
Rooms 11 and 23.
 &HT;    In ``The Greek Interpreter,'' Holmes confesses to Watson that he
is descended from the Vernet family, and ``art in the blood is
liable to take the strangest forms.''
 &HT;    Upon reaching Oxford Street, it's a short walk east to Regent
Street, which curves splendidly to Piccadilly Circus. On the left,
just where it curves at the Quadrant, is the Cafe Royal, a
splendidly elegant French restaurant since 1865 and the place where
Holmes was attacked in ``The Adventure of the Illustrious Client.''
 &HT;    A little farther on, opposite the Eros statue in Piccadilly
Circus, was the Criterion Bar, where Watson first heard mention of
Holmes, an eccentric fellow studying at St. Bartholomew's Hospital
who needed a roommate. Past the Circus on Regent are the stately
clubs of Pall Mall, one of which might have been the Diogenes Club,
Holmes's brother Mycroft's club, where members were forbidden to
speak.
 &HT;    Turning east, continue to Charing Cross Road, the great avenue
that just before the young Sherlock arrived in London, was cut
through from Oxford Street to Trafalgar Square, sweeping aside some
of the poorest slums.
 &HT;    The Victorians boldly transformed the London of Dickens into
that of Conan Doyle, creating not just Charing Cross Road, but
rebuilding Regent Street, enlarging Piccadilly Circus, laying out
the great Shaftesbury Avenue, and most magnificently of all,
constructing the three-mile Embankment along the Thames.
 &HT;    In front of the Charing Cross Hotel, you can stand near the spot
where Holmes caught a spy, where Watson banked (and kept his box of
notes) and where, just across the street, they sent off urgent
telegrams. It is here, not Baker Street, where the most incidents
in the Holmes saga are recorded.
 &HT;    Among the many bookstores of Charing Cross, Murder One is a must
for anyone who loves detective stories. It claims to stock every
mystery story in print in Britain, and specializes in Sherlock
Holmes material from all over the world.
 &HT;    South of Murder One, along Cecil Court, where there are clusters
of specialty book shops, Nigel Williams has a good selection of
first editions of Conan Doyle.
 &HT;    After Charing Cross Road becomes Tottenham Court Road, a right
onto Great Russell Street leads to the British Museum, across from
which is the Museum Tavern. This place, the pub in Holmes'
Christmas tale, ``The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle,'' seems
hardly changed. The outside lamps are gas, inside is old wooden
paneling.
 &HT;    When he came to London in the late 1870s, Holmes lived around
the corner on Montague Street, near where Conan Doyle himself lived
when he moved to London.
 &HT;    Heading south on Shaftesbury and then on Neal Street brings you
to Covent Garden, where the Christmas goose in ``The Blue
Carbuncle'' was procured. The bustling wholesale flower, vegetable
and fruit markets of Holmes's era have been swept away, replaced by
crowds enjoying performance art and singers putting on free shows.
 &HT;    Nothing satisfied Holmes more after the conclusion of a
particularly baffling case than to end the evening at the renowned
Simpson's-in-the-Strand. Strolling south to the Strand, you'll pass
the recently renovated Royal Opera House, often attended by Holmes
in its previous incarnation. See as well the police court on Bow
Street where Holmes makes an astonishing deduction to conclude
``The Man with a Twisted Lip.''
 &HT;    Simpson's, with its classic English menu and white-vested formal
waiters, has been a part of the London scene since 1828, one of the
few places that allows you to feel that you have entered Victorian
society. All it takes is reservations (and a tie for gentlemen) and
there you are, being soberly served as if you were Prime Minister
Gladstone, who came for the rolling steamers of roast beef or lamb
ready to be cut to one's specifications.
 &HT;    Amid the gleaming crystal and old dark Adam paneling, it's clear
why Watson describes in 1902 the pleasures to be had sitting here
at a table ``looking down at the rushing stream of life on the
Strand.''
 &HT;    Another favorite destination of Sherlockians is a small pub
tucked in at the turn of Northumberland Street, near Charing Cross
Station. The Sherlock Holmes Public House and Restaurant, near Old
Scotland Yard and the Turkish baths frequented by Holmes and
Watson, is in what was the Northumberland Arms, the hotel mentioned
in the greatest of all mystery stories.
 &HT;    It was there that Henry Baskerville stayed when he arrived in
England to claim his inheritance, and only his finding a boot in
the hallway started Holmes toward a solution to the deadly curse of
the Baskervilles.
 &HT;    The pub is often crowded and serves good ales and classic pub
grub. Exhibits line the walls detailing the adventures of the great
detective, including a mounted head of the ghastly hound, an army
service revolver of the type Watson carried, and old Strand
Magazine drawings by the master illustrator Sidney Paget.
 &HT;    Upstairs, a 10-by-12-foot reproduction of the famous sitting
room of 221-B, created for the 1952 Festival of Britain by the
Abbey National Bank, is on display, too. Behind glass is a wax
figure of Holmes in the window by which he foiled an assassination
attempt in ``The Empty House,'' and the violin, and the pipe rack
and the morphine needles of Holmes's most unfortunate habit.
 &HT;    A bit more refined menu is served upstairs in a crowded room
with a clublike atmosphere. I ordered Mrs. Hudson's Steak and Ale
Pie (named for Holmes's landlady), a grand, flaky puff pastry atop
generous portions of cubed steak and potatoes, which came with a
wonderful salad.
 &HT;    On my last night in London, I managed to return to the pub 10
minutes before it closed. Savoring the special Sherlock Holmes Ale,
I sat outside as a street cleaner swept the deserted Westminster
Street. Soon, I found myself strolling along the Strand,
remembering the passage from ``The Resident Patient'' when Holmes
turns to Watson and says: ``But the evening has brought a breeze
with it. What do you say to a ramble through London?''

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Hotels have become as adept as the airlines at shifting their
prices to suit the marketplace. So when it comes time to shop
around, a single call or a simple visit to a Web site is rarely
enough. It's usually worth calling the hotel directly and visiting
their Web site. Granted, there are times when the prices for the
same room are identical, but there are also times when there are
sharp differences.
 &HT;    For example, there may be incentives for booking through the Web
site. A hotel may be trying to funnel more traffic through its
Internet site and offering a discount for those who do so.
 &HT;    There are also special offers floating around and it's vital to
inquire about them. That's because these offers are not always
targeted at every traveler who's staying at the property. A special
may be aimed at a local market, to beef up weekend stays. It may be
targeted regionally; or nationally. So it always pays to ask _ just
as it always pays to use every additional discount, from those
offered by the American Automobile Association and the American
Association of Retired Persons.
 &HT;    For big city hotels, start with hotel brokers like Quikbook (381
Park Ave. South, New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887;
www.quikbook.com), Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder,
Colo. 80301; 800-356-1123; www.express-res.com) and Hotel
Reservations Network (8140 Walnut Hill Lane, Suite 800, Dallas,
Texas 75231; 800-96-HOTEL; www.180096hotel.com).
 &HT;    Figure on discounts from 15 percent to 40 percent off published
rates in major U.S. city hotels, based on availability, of course.
Use their maps and descriptions to find a property. Then call the
hotel directly to make sure it is indeed a rock-bottom price.
 &HT;    Unfamiliar with a city? Head to one of the city guides on
Digital City (www.digitalcities.com), which is probably the best
city guide on the Web. It now offers hotel reservations through a
link with Travelocity.com (www.travelocity.com).
 &HT;    Other online agencies, such as Expedia.com (www.expedia.com),
also offer the ability to book hotels online. These rates are
usually subject to some discounting, also referred to as a
``preferred rate.''
 &HT;    If your ideal vacation paradise must include sand and palm
trees, Pleasant Holidays (2404 Townsgate Road, West Lake Village,
Calif. 91361; 800-242-9244; www.2hawaii.com) is a master discounter
known for putting together some of the best-priced
air/hotel/transfer deals to Hawaii and Mexico, utilizing a vast
stock of hotels and condos.
 &HT;    Consumers should also contact airlines like American, Delta and
United or visit their Web sites and peruse the air/hotel/transfer
packages that they market. Their prices are often favorable because
they move so many people.
 &HT;    What's more, there are often short-term sales that might appeal
to the undecided. There might be a fire sale on unsold beach
vacations to Jamaica, Miami or Puerto Rico. Those same airlines'
tour desks also offer vacations, and sales, to Asia, Europe and
Latin America. That can be the best way to get a good rate on a
foreign hotel.
 &HT;    For upscale resorts, such as the Four Seasons and Oberoi chains,
in Asia or the Caribbean, a travel agent can be a godsend. It's
also true for luxury hotels in Europe. But expect to be charged a
fee for such service.
 &HT;    A good agent who's a member of the consortium called Virtuoso
(500 Main St., Suite 500 E, Fort Worth, Texas 76102; 800-401-4274;
www.apitravel.com), formerly known as API Travel Consultants, can
often get travelers an upgrade or other perks. It's not discounting
but value-added service that they provide.
 &HT;    Virtuoso is now partnering with Travelocity.com on a new
``Specialists Referral Network.'' It's fee-based and allows Web
travelers a chance to use the expertise and clout of a Virtuoso
member.
 &HT;    For those who are booking a major chain hotel on their own _
from a Sheraton to a Westin to a Hyatt _ visit their Web site, call
their toll-free number and then call the front desk directly. There
may be a disparity in price.
 &HT;    Sometimes it's the local phone call that yields the best deal.
Why? Because it's the manager's price. He's the one looking at the
advance bookings with an eye to filling his property. An unsold
room provides no revenue.
 &HT;    But it's different with smaller, independently owned hotels or
small, mid-priced chains. Book directly with them or use their Web
sites.
 &HT;    The Web route is a good strategy for those who are taking charge
of a European vacation, for example, and their French or Italian
won't pass muster on an international phone call. Besides, small
European hotels often won't budge from their posted prices.
 &HT;    Small hotels are not subject to the yield management and
consequent multiple prices for the exact same room that major chain
hotels have. The price difference has to do with room size, with
smaller rooms priced accordingly. The price-sensitive traveler
should ask about such rooms.
 &HT;    The bottom line is that with a few calls, some Web browsing and
a little perseverance, every traveler should be able to get the
best possible price on a hotel room.

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the coming presidential election, women hold
the key swing votes, and what's the key to winning those votes?
Well, here's a clue. A poll recently found that women respond
positively to anything politicians do ``for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this explains why George W. Bush has been hanging out with
little kids in schools and talking like an educrat, or why Al Gore
has been supporting the Miami Cubans who have been acting like
children.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a male cynic, but when I hear people say they're doing
it ``for the children'' I look for the adults who are using
children as pawns.
</P>
<P>
   One word: Elian.
</P>
<P>
   When those wackos in Miami, Al Gore or Fidel Castro, say they're
looking out for the 6-year-old's interests, does anyone believe any
of them? They're just waging political combat on the battlefield of
a little boy's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Give him back to his dad and let him go home. By the time he
grows up, Castro will be dead, and Elian can make his own decisions
about coming to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Do it for us, the grown-ups who have to listen to the childish
idiocy about Elian all day, every day in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about exploitation of children. Elian has been a major
profit center for CNN and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Doing it for the children will be a major media theme on or
about April 20, the first anniversary of the slaughter at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The media love anniversary stories because they're easy to plan.
And anniversary stories of massacres give them the chance to rerun
all that gruesome footage. If it's kids who were massacred, the
gruesome footage can be rerun in the name of moral lessons and for
society, the schools and the children.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Columbine High School already have been planning
for the anniversary, which they call ``A Time to Remember, A Time
to Hope.'' They even have a copyrighted logo for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, a lot of kids are worried about being overrun by
reporters. Somebody had the bright idea of having kids express
their willingness to be interviewed by wearing buttons saying
``Yes'' or ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   They're doing it for the children. I like Denver columnist
Michael Roberts' suggestion that reporters wear signs on their
press badges saying ``How's my reporting? Call 1-800-JERKWAD.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine now means more than a flower resembling a flock of
doves. It's a watershed in bloodshed, used in phrases like ``in
post-Columbine America.''
</P>
<P>
   In post-Columbine America, children aren't better or worse off
than they were in pre-Columbine America. But the terms of adult
political debate have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The murders of 12 students and a teacher at Columbine have been
used by politicians on the left to push for gun laws, and
politicians on the right to push for prayer in schools. Politicians
and pundits all across the spectrum blamed the massacre on violent
movies and video games.
</P>
<P>
   The media are still making money off Columbine, and the
politicians are still finding the lessons they wish to find.
Millions are being spent on metal detectors to place at school
doors, even though the likelihood of being shot in school is about
the same as being hit by lightning on a sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reports on its Web site that the number of kids fatally shot
in school is 29 in the last 18 months, but acts as if that's an
epidemic, even though the rate of such murders has been declining
for a decade. It just looks like an epidemic because of the copycat
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Adults consistently rate schools as unsafe places, while the
kids, teachers and cops who occupy schools rate them as very safe.
The problem is that adults have been watching too much CNN and
MSNBC, not that kids have been playing too many violent video
games.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the New York Times did all of us a service by analyzing
the mass killers of the last 50 years. The story showed that few of
the killers were addicted to violent movies or video games, but
most had mental disorders that went unnoticed by those around them.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools are not only adding metal detectors, they're adding
mental detectors, in the form of profiles of kids who may be
violent. Of course, these profiles are unreliable. And since the
threat of school shootings is so small, they're as unjustifiable as
those zero-tolerance policies that expel kids for bringing plastic
butter knives to school.
</P>
<P>
   But all those adults are doing it for the children, and that
gives them license to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   What we really should celebrate are kids who do it for the kids.
That's what Diane Sawyer will be doing on ``Good Morning America''
one day next week as the networks commemorate the anniversary of
the Columbine massacre.
</P>
<P>
   As her guests, she will have Lance Kirklin, who was badly
wounded at Columbine, and Rashad Williams, a student in California
who helped raise tens of thousands of dollars for Kirklin's medical
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rashad is really excited about it,'' said his mother, Sheila
Burton-Harrison, ``because he'll get to see his buddy again.''
</P>
<P>
   These are great kids, what America is all about. Kids today
aren't so bad, and we adults have to remember that.

HISTORIAN'S HOLOCAUST LIBEL SUIT DISMISSED BY JUDGE IN LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Irving, a British historian who minimized the tragedy of
the Holocaust, ``misrepresented and manipulated historical
evidence,'' a judge in London ruled Tuesday in throwing out
Irving's libel suit against a U.S. scholar who had accused him of
distorting what occurred in Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The British historian, David Irving, 62, sued Deborah Lipstadt,
a history professor at Emory University in Atlanta, and Penguin
Books, which published her book in Britain six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on
Truth and Memory,'' Lipstadt described Irving as ``one of the most
dangerous spokespersons for Holocaust denial,'' who played down
Adolph Hitler's responsibility for the slaughter of millions of
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Irving has not denied that Jews died in Nazi custody, but he
contended that far fewer were murdered than was widely accepted and
said that none died in the notorious gas chambers of Auschwitz. He
argued that Lipstadt's book made it difficult to find publishers
for his writings.
</P>
<P>
   But after presiding over the libel trial for more than eight
weeks, Judge Charles Gray ruled against Irving Tuesday, calling him
``anti-Semitic and racist'' and ``a right-wing pro-Nazi
polemicist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me to be incontrovertible that Irving qualifies
as a Holocaust denier,'' Gray said, underscoring what the
historian's critics have said for years. ``Not only has he denied
the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz and asserted that no Jew
was gassed there, he has done so on frequent occasions and
sometimes in the most offensive terms.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gray also said that Irving was content to mix with neo-fascists
and seemed to share many of their racist and anti-Semitic
prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges which I have found substantially true include the
charges that Irving has for his own ideological reasons
persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated
historical evidence,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Irving described the decision against him as ``perverse'' and
said he would appeal. Gray has yet to rule on who must bear the
legal costs of the trial, but he indicated that Irving would have
to pay most of the defense team's costs, which could exceed $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Irving enjoyed an advantage in suing Lipstadt in a British court
rather than an American one. In British libel law, the burden of
proof lies on the defendants, in this case Lipstadt and Penguin
Books, while in a U.S. court the responsibility rests with the
plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's implications were considered so significant that the
Israeli government offered the unpublished handwritten memoirs of
Adolph Eichmann to buttress Lipstadt's defense. Eichmann, the Nazi
official who organized the deportation of millions of Jews to death
camps during World War II, was captured by Israeli agents in
Argentina and, after a highly publicized trial in Jerusalem, was
hanged in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said Tuesday that Irving failed to show that Lipstadt's
book had damaged his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups that have worked to preserve the memory of the
Holocaust expressed satisfaction with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Irving's career as a historian is over,'' the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said in a statement. ``Today's
decision definitely places Irving where he belongs _ not as a
historian but as a leading apologist for those who seek to
whitewash the most heinous crime in human history.''

   What is daytrading?
</P>
<P>
   The term has been thrown around to the point where no one
bothers to lay out its meaning. If this seems a little too William
Safire, think again. Much of the federal government and the
reigning securities regulation regime, if not public opinion, is
stacked up against ``daytrading'' right now.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is wary and monitoring
the actions of daytraders, pollyannas on the editorial pages rail
against daytraders and TV anchors ask if daytraders are to blame
for market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Most worrisome, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations recently turned its furrowed brow toward daytrading.
</P>
<P>
   But what is daytrading? It's become the new pornography:
indefinable, but you know it when you see it. And just as dirty.
</P>
<P>
   It's a catchall for the Internet's ills. Daytrading is, to some,
synonymous with the most extreme uses of the Net, suggesting
irresponsible instant wealth, high-risk behavior and bad hygiene
all at once.
</P>
<P>
   And yet a lucid definition of this term is wanting. Last month,
the Senate subcommittee held a two-day hearing to discuss its
so-called ``investigation'' into the seedy world of daytraders. The
hearing was held in the same Senate chambers where 15 years ago
Twisted Sister's Dee Snider was singled out as a corrupter of
society. With the same righteous indignation, daytrading was now
taking the heat.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the senators trotted out horror stories of lost
fortunes, with a few failed daytraders blaming the firms they
traded with. Singled out among those firms was Atlanta-based
daytrading firm Momentum Securities, where Mark Barton once toiled.
After losing more than $100,000, Barton went on a rampage, killing
his wife and two children, then killing nine people in a shooting
spree at two brokerages, before finally shooting himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging in the air with these Senate hearings is a notion that
anyone who opens up an ETrade account is in danger of going off the
deep end. Daytrading, it is suggested, is a clear and present
danger. It's as if there is something about this calling -- above
all other stressful, money-centric professions -- that sends
regular people postal.
</P>
<P>
   Is a daytrader someone who spends part of his day logged on to
the Net trading stocks? Is it someone who holds a stock for a day?
Or someone who holds a stock for an hour, but never longer than a
day?
</P>
<P>
   There are, in fact, two types of traders. There's the average
Joe with his Schwab account -- he may hold stocks for a year, he
may hold them for an hour. It would be nice to have a different
name for this kind of activity -- ``e-traders'' perhaps. But if
it's daytime and he placed a trade, Aunt Millie calls this guy a
``daytrader.''
</P>
<P>
   The wave of personal involvement in the stock market is not
about to slow. According to a study by analyst James Marks of
Credit Suisse First Boston, online brokerage accounts have grown to
more than 23.1 million. The same study said the major online
brokerages -- led by Charles Schwab, Fidelity, TD Waterhouse, Quick
&AMP; Reilly, ETrade and Ameritrade -- now hold some $1.3 trillion in
customer assets. Many of these people, and surely millions of these
dollars, dabble in this ``daytrading.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are not the daytraders the Senate is after. Our
congressmen are investigating a subset of this daytrading
phenomenon. Let's call them ``professional daytraders'' (an
oxymoron along the lines of ``military intelligence'' or ``quiet
storm'').
</P>
<P>
   These are individuals who, strapped with loans on margin, enter
dozens of trades a day, rapid-fire buys and sells, hoping to latch
on to quarter-point gains throughout the day. According to the
Electronic Trading Association, they number just 45,000 -- a tiny
number compared with the millions of stock traders on the Internet
online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service loosely defines daytraders as
people whose occupation is doing their own trading full time for
their personal account.
</P>
<P>
   I've interviewed these people. I've watched them trade like kids
playing Quake. They say they do 50 to 100 trades a day, 15,000 to
25,000 a year. They create huge commissions for their clearing
firms -- if they don't go broke.
</P>
<P>
   As such, they're turning in massive profits for the firms that
clear their trades. Fifteen firms studied by the Senate
subcommittee have seen revenues jump 275 percent in the last two
years, with earnings rising by 200 percent, according to the staff
memorandum released last month called ``Day Trading: Everyone
Gambles But the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying these guys are amateur ``daytraders'' is like saying
minor league ballplayers play catch. They might be operating as
individuals, but they're engaged in a high-stakes profession.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate subcommittee's report is hardly fair, or, for that
matter, accurate. It goes out of its way to portray an abusive,
volatile market out of control (at one point saying ``Qualcomm's
stock price rose during the week of Jan. 4, 2000, from $9.94 to
$150.'' Um, not quite. That incredible rise took 52 weeks).
</P>
<P>
   But let's allow the Senate to have the last word on defining
daytrading. When we talk about daytrading from here on out, let's
think of the guys in the sweat shop, cranking out a dozen trades an
hour. And let's use the Senate's new official definition:
</P>
<P>
   Daytrading (da -TRAD- ng) n. Placing multiple buy and sell
orders for securities and holding positions for a very short period
of time, usually minutes or a few hours, but rarely longer than a
day. Daytraders seek profits in small increments from momentary
fluctuations in stock prices after paying commissions, which can
range from $15 to $25 per trade.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody call the Oxford English Dictionary on this one, quick.

fortunes, with a few failed daytraders blaming the firms they
traded with. Singled out among those firms was Atlanta-based
daytrading firm Momentum Securities, where Mark Barton once toiled.
After losing more than $100,000, Barton went on a rampage, killing
his wife and two children, then killing nine people in a shooting
spree at two brokerages, before finally shooting himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging in the air with these Senate hearings is a notion that
anyone who opens up an ETrade account is in danger of going off the
deep end. Daytrading, it is suggested, is a clear and present
danger. It's as if there is something about this calling -- above
all other stressful, money-centric professions -- that sends
regular people postal.
</P>
<P>
   Is a daytrader someone who spends part of his day logged on to
the Net trading stocks? Is it someone who holds a stock for a day?
Or someone who holds a stock for an hour, but never longer than a
day?
</P>
<P>
   There are, in fact, two types of traders. There's the average
Joe with his Schwab account -- he may hold stocks for a year, he
may hold them for an hour. It would be nice to have a different
name for this kind of activity -- ``e-traders'' perhaps. But if
it's daytime and he placed a trade, Aunt Millie calls this guy a
``daytrader.''
</P>
<P>
   The wave of personal involvement in the stock market is not
about to slow. According to a study by analyst James Marks of
Credit Suisse First Boston, online brokerage accounts have grown to
more than 23.1 million. The same study said the major online
brokerages -- led by Charles Schwab, Fidelity, TD Waterhouse, Quick
&AMP; Reilly, ETrade and Ameritrade -- now hold some $1.3 trillion in
customer assets. Many of these people, and surely millions of these
dollars, dabble in this ``daytrading.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are not the daytraders the Senate is after. Our
congressmen are investigating a subset of this daytrading
phenomenon. Let's call them ``professional daytraders'' (an
oxymoron along the lines of ``military intelligence'' or ``quiet
storm'').
</P>
<P>
   These are individuals who, strapped with loans on margin, enter
dozens of trades a day, rapid-fire buys and sells, hoping to latch
on to quarter-point gains throughout the day. According to the
Electronic Trading Association, they number just 45,000 -- a tiny
number compared with the millions of stock traders on the Internet
online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service loosely defines daytraders as
people whose occupation is doing their own trading full time for
their personal account.
</P>
<P>
   I've interviewed these people. I've watched them trade like kids
playing Quake. They say they do 50 to 100 trades a day, 15,000 to
25,000 a year. They create huge commissions for their clearing
firms -- if they don't go broke.
</P>
<P>
   As such, they're turning in massive profits for the firms that
clear their trades. Fifteen firms studied by the Senate
subcommittee have seen revenues jump 275 percent in the last two
years, with earnings rising by 200 percent, according to the staff
memorandum released last month called ``Day Trading: Everyone
Gambles But the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying these guys are amateur ``daytraders'' is like saying
minor league ballplayers play catch. They might be operating as
individuals, but they're engaged in a high-stakes profession.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate subcommittee's report is hardly fair, or, for that
matter, accurate. It goes out of its way to portray an abusive,
volatile market out of control (at one point saying ``Qualcomm's
stock price rose during the week of Jan. 4, 2000, from $9.94 to
$150.'' Um, not quite. That incredible rise took 52 weeks).
</P>
<P>
   But let's allow the Senate to have the last word on defining
daytrading. When we talk about daytrading from here on out, let's
think of the guys in the sweat shop, cranking out a dozen trades an
hour. And let's use the Senate's new official definition:
</P>
<P>
   Daytrading (da -TRAD- ng) n. Placing multiple buy and sell
orders for securities and holding positions for a very short period
of time, usually minutes or a few hours, but rarely longer than a
day. Daytraders seek profits in small increments from momentary
fluctuations in stock prices after paying commissions, which can
range from $15 to $25 per trade.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody call the Oxford English Dictionary on this one, quick.
</P>

MASSACHUSETTS SEEN AS SCHOOLS TESTING BATTLEGROUND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts may be carrying a new banner in the
nation's public school testing wars: Backlash capital.
</P>
<P>
   The third round of MCAS testing begins this week, and protests
are planned at school districts across the state as students,
parents, and some teachers are expected to voice their hatred for
the test, and the singular place it has come to occupy in education
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But students who walk out of school or otherwise boycott the
exam could be facing some of the toughest consequences yet: While
Cambridge says students will not be penalized, Brookline will
average a ``zero'' into students' English grades if they refuse to
take the test. In Arlington, a group of 20 students planning to
boycott the MCAS have been told they will be suspended for three
days.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Massachusetts' students and teachers who will be
watching the fallout across the state. Increasingly, parents in
other parts of the country are using Massachusetts as a model to
craft their own attacks on standardized tests. Many are copying the
boycotts and the letters of protests generated by many
Massachusetts residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about Massachusetts' testing; it's been in the news a
lot. I went on the Internet, Massachusetts popped up,'' said Lisa
Amspaugh, leader of a revolt group in Georgia, where students also
need to pass a test in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FairTest, the national antitesting group that's based
in Cambridge, is acting as a grass-roots guide: They are linking
parents from Virginia to California via e-mail to share protest
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is not something that is being pushed by
established organizations,'' said Monty Neill, head of FairTest.
``FairTest's goal is to help coordinate a national movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Although other states have had mandatory statewide testing
longer than Massachusetts has, few have been hit with organized
large-scale protests. Now, 18 states have imposed tests that
students must pass to graduate from high school. As these kinds of
tests have gained momentum, opponents have searched for ways to
turn the tide, arguing that it is unfair to withold diplomas on the
basis of a single, written test. Last week, two congressmen from
Virginia and Minnesota proposed federal legislation that would
prevent states from relying solely on test scores to award
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at how other states are reaching the grass
roots, how they are convincing businesses it's not the right thing
to do, and joining forces with teachers and reaching legislators,''
said Mickey VanDerwerker of Parents Across Virginia United to
Reform the Standards of Learning.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to MCAS will undoubtedly continue to grow in
Massachusetts as 2003, when students who do not pass the test will
first be denied diplomas, draws near. This year, the testing will
be spread among more grades. This week's test, an English
composition exam, will be given on one day for grades 4, 8, and 10.
During May 15-26, students in grades 4-8 and 10 will take tests in
math, science, English, and history.
</P>
<P>
   In many communities, conflicts are expected between students and
administrators. In Western Massachusetts, a group of students whose
e-mail membership reaches Boston will be organizing a different
kind of protest: During the exam, instead of answering the
questions, they will write essays about why they think MCAS should
be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, administrators have promised to suspend the group
of sophomores who have been pledging to boycott the tests since
November. ``It's a penalty that has some bite to it,'' said Charles
McCarthy, principal of Arlington High School, of the three-day
suspensions. ``A one-day suspension is self-defeating. It gives
kids what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   But students said they were trying to set an example for future
MCAS test-takers. They say their reasons are simple: One test
doesn't determine a person's intellect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like the high-stakes nature of it; some people have
trouble taking the test,'' said Chris Carmody, one of the student
protesters. ``It's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cambridge, where school officials are expecting a large
boycott, superintendent Bobbie D'Alessandro said that while they
are encouraging students to take the test, they are also providing
alternatives for those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no reprisals for families or faculty who do not
choose to take or give the test. We are trying to provide a
productive atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   While the state Department of Education frowns on boycotting
MCAS, Commissioner David P. Driscoll respects a student's right to
skip the test. However, he has said that boycotting the test ``is
not accepting their responsibility.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The owl, white-faced and yellow-eyed, silently watches a raft
of black ducks floating in the saltmarsh off the windswept Duxbury
Beach. With a few pumps of her enormous wings, the owl sets upon
the surprised flock, grabs an unlucky victim with powerful taloned
feet and carries it skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner is served.
</P>
<P>
   Snowy owls, masters of the Arctic tundra, have long made
Massachusetts their winter home, coming down from the frigid, dark
polar regions for the abundant food in New England. Here, these
ghost-white birds leave an indelible impression on all who see
them, whether they're snatching ducks in Duxbury or patrolling for
rats on the grasslands at Logan Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, precisely because the birds nest across a vast, largely
inaccessible region from Siberia to Northern Europe, scientists
know far less about snowy owls than they do about other great birds
of prey like the bald eagle and peregrine falcon. A population
estimate is hard to come by, and efforts to study the birds in
their winter quarters have raised as many questions as they answer:
for no apparent reason, their numbers in Boston fluctuate widely
from dozens in some winters to none at all in others.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers hope that the duck hunter in Duxbury and five
other owls will help them solve the mysteries of the snowy owls,
from their population trend to the forces that determine their
nomadic wanderings. With transmitters strapped to their backs,
these birds will be tracked by satellite over the next 1 to 2
years, allowing scientists to know where they go, where they hunt,
and perhaps even how they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about them excites me,'' said Denver Holt, founder
of the Owl Research Institute in Charlo, Montana, and one of two
key researchers behind the transmitter project. ``Do snowy owls
wander randomly or do they know . . . they can go somewhere else if
they find no (food in one area). Will we see any predictable
movement patterns over time?''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials say the transmitters will greatly speed
up scientific progress in understanding the owls, allowing
conservation officials to confront potential threats such as heavy
metal pollution recently discovered in the Arctic or the legal
hunting of owls in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our learning curve is going as fast as the technology will let
us,'' said Thomas French, assistant director of the Massachusetts
Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Birders and owl researchers know that many snowy owls spend the
winter somewhere in a swath that starts in the Pacific Northwest
and extends eastward through the Canadian prairie Provinces,
northern tier states and Great Lakes and New England. What's hard
to predict is where and when the owls will congregate in the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike migratory birds that follow the same paths to the same
places year after year, snowy owls follow no obvious pattern.
Researchers who apply identification bands to the owls at Logan
Airport, led by Norman Smith of Massachusetts Audubon's Blue Hills
Trailside Museum, have caught as many as 43 snowy owls in a season
and as few as zero.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, ornithologists know by observation and examining
regurgitated owl pellets what snowy owls eat and how they spend
their time while wintering in New England. But the researchers can
only shrug if you ask them where the snowy owls go in April and
May. They don't know what route the birds take or where they're
going. They don't even know whether the birds prefer to nest near
an ample supply of lemmings _ the birds' main food source _ or
whether the owls are loyal to the same nest year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking animals by attaching satellite transmitters has been an
important research tool since the 1980s. The ``charismatic
megafauna'' of the Arctic _ caribou, grizzly and polar bears, musk
ox and whales _ have been tracked and retracked. Even smaller fauna
such as geese and ducks have been extensively studied. But, until
now, snowy owls, the most nomadic and unpredictable of all the
North American owls, have been overlooked, in part because they
have no political constituency, such as a hunters' advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith of Audubon and Holt of the Owl Research Institute
have been studying snowy owls for years with Smith studying them on
the New England wintering grounds and Holt prying into their summer
nesting areas around Barrow, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Holt have affixed transmitters to six snowy owls. Holt
captured his snowy owls (two males and a female) last July on the
nesting grounds in Alaska. Smith netted his owls (two females and a
male) at Logan Airport, releasing them on Duxbury Beach over the
past three months.
</P>
<P>
   The transmitter weighs little more than an ounce and is held to
the bird's back by Teflon straps across the animal's chest that the
owls seem to barely notice. Dental floss and glue join the straps
at cross points so the transmitters don't slip or chafe.
</P>
<P>
   Microcomputers inside the transmitters send a periodic signal to
any one of four National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
satellites in low polar orbits. Initially, the transmitter signals
for eight hours every 200 hours _ though the frequency of signals
will increase at key times _ and staff at the Snake River Raptor
Refuge in Idaho gather the data and e-mail each researcher with
updates.
</P>
<P>
   Already, just a few weeks after their release, the Massachusetts
birds are behaving in unexpected ways, to the delight of the
researchers. One owl, a male, had already travelled 250 miles to
the northwest at last satellite check-in, reaching an area just
west of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The two other owls, both caught more recently at Logan and
released at Duxbury Beach, are still in the state. The female is
hanging out near Sandy Neck in Barnstable, while the other male
headed north to George's Island and then Hull.
</P>
<P>
   These three animals may serve as a living rebuttal to the
once-conventional wisdom about the owls that come to New England.
Researchers once believed that they came here in high numbers
mainly when the supply of lemmings and other food sources in the
north was low, leaving these birds both desperate for a meal and
with a poor chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific literature says these birds (in Massachusetts)
supposedly aren't going to make it back to the Arctic. The
literature says that these birds come here to die. But we've had
birds that have returned to the Arctic (based on banding
returns),'' said Smith, noting that one bird is already well on his
way home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What stimulates these birds to move? No one has a clue and we
wouldn't have a clue to where these owls are without the
transmitters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some 4,500 miles from Boston on the other side of the
continent, three other snowy owls, released in the Barrow area last
July, are also moving in ways that surprise the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Two owls have left Alaska altogether, crossed frozen areas of
the Chukchi Sea, flown south of the Arctic Circle past St. Lawrence
Island in the Bering Sea and across to the Siberian peninsula
Chukotskiy Poluostrov, nearly 700 miles from Barrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Owl Research Institute's third tagged bird, a male, presents
a mystery. The transmitters relay temperature. This bird's pack is
cold and has not moved since mid-December. That means that either
the owl has died or the transmitter has fallen from the bird.
</P>
<P>
   Although the snowy owls are not listed as threatened or
endangered, that reflects ignorance as much as studies of the
species' good health. For instance, snowy owls may face more human
predators than records suggest: the owls are hunted legally in four
game management areas in Alaska, as long as the birds are eaten or
used for clothing, and the Inuit in Canada shoot an unknown number
of snowy owls. In addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that large
numbers of snowy owls may be trapped for food in remote areas of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Holt hope to attach more transmitters to snowy
owls in the winters ahead. Smith has funding both from an anonymous
donor and a small grant from the Nuttall Ornithological Club at
Harvard University to tag more owls. Holt looks to a five-year
horizon and support from foundations and private donors to fund his
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take many years to unravel this,'' said Holt.

UNIVERSAL ADDS AN ON-SITE HOTEL AND A WILD NEW RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The visitors from Portofino, Italy, gazed in
wonder at the Portofino Bay Hotel, with its bright buildings,
boats, and bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' said one of them. ``It looks 95 percent like the
real Portofino.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the other 5 percent?'' the visitor was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No garbage cans here.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, perhaps, is as it should be because this is Orlando,
where reality is a sometimes thing. Almost everything here is a bit
brighter, a bit cleaner, a bit cheerier. Take this new hotel at
Universal Orlando, as the theme-park resort is now calling itself.
Here _ for a price, of course _ guests stroll, swim, and stay in a
peaceful environment while just a few minutes away flash and crash
predominate as superheroes battle the forces of evil and the movies
inspire rollicking rides.
</P>
<P>
   The 750-room Portofino Bay Hotel, which opened late last year,
represents more than a hotel to Universal. Rather, it is the final
ingredient in creating a multibillion-dollar, self-contained resort
complex. Now people can stay at Universal and go to its two theme
parks and its shops, restaurants, and night spots without ever
having to get in a car or even encounter one, unless it's part of a
theme-park ride. So although Universal Orlando is only a fraction
of the size of that place a few miles down the road called Walt
Disney World _ 840 acres vs. 43 square miles _ everything is now in
place for an alternative, or additional, vacation experience.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are nice (and this one seemed quite nice), but the theme
parks and their attendant thrills are the big draw, and new
attractions are constantly added to keep the crowds coming back.
That's why Universal opened its second park, Islands of Adventure,
last year, featuring superhero rides that whirl and twirl and hurl,
roaring dinosaurs, splashy water adventures, and attractions
involving the whimsical characters created by Dr. Seuss. And that's
why the resort's original movie-based theme park, Universal Studios
Florida, is scheduled to open an alien adventure sometime this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Men in Black: Alien Attack, inspired by the 1997 Will Smith
movie, will let participants determine the outcome of the ride by
zapping aliens and thus scoring points. So far that sounds a little
like Disney World's Buzz Lightyear attraction, but in this ride,
the 120 animatronic aliens fight back, sending the ride vehicles
spinning crazily out of control _ or so it will seem, thanks to a
computerized gadget called a ``roving motion platform.'' When the
ride is over, and the planet is presumably saved once again,
occupants of the various ride vehicles will be rewarded (or
condemned) with everything from a hero's welcome to a loser's
farewell. There are 12 possible endings.
</P>
<P>
   Alien Attack will be in good company at Universal Studios
Florida, with attractions such as Back to the Future, The E.T.
Adventure, Jaws, Earthquake, Twister, Terminator 2 3-D, Woody
Woodpecker's Kid Zone, and old banana-breath himself, King Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while Universal may not have the cuddly quality of the
Disney parks (and Woody Woodpecker will never replace Donald Duck
in my heart), it has some of the best and most envelope-pushing
rides anywhere. Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park, which
opened last year, dishes out the thrills with attractions like the
Amazing Adventures of Spiderman, which puts you in the middle of a
3-D battle so startling that it is worth waiting out any
computer-related delays that may occur if the ride is being
fine-tuned. Other attractions include the Incredible Hulk Coaster
(so speedy that one ride was plenty for me . . . for life), Dudley
Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls flume trip, Dr. Seuss's One Fish Two Fish
Red Fish Blue Fish ride, The Jurassic Park River Adventure (watch
out for that 85-foot drop!), and Triceratops Encounter, where you
can meet and pet a dino crafted so realistically that she even, er,
wets.
</P>
<P>
   Universal will no doubt be anxiously gauging how much repeat
business the new Islands of Adventure park attracts. Helping to
lure parkgoers back will be two new attractions scheduled to open
this summer. Storm Force, at the park's Marvel Super Hero Island,
will be a whirling indoor ride that with sound, light, and special
effects will create a thunderstorm adventure. And The Flying
Unicorn will be a child-sized roller coaster at the Lost Continent
Island. Youngsters will journey through a mystical forest on the
back of a unicorn.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of Universal Orlando is CityWalk, 30 acres of
nightclubs, shops, movies, and themed restaurants. The newest
restaurant there is NBA City, a joint project of the Hard Rock Cafe
and the National Basketball Association. In addition to food, there
are electronic games and scenes of basketball's greatest moments on
giant video screens. When I walked in, who should be on the screen
but number 33 himself, Larry Bird, shown in his Boston Celtics
days, with the big screen showing him larger than life. But then he
always has been.
</P>
<P>
   The parks and CityWalk give visitors at least two full days and
nights of activities, and that's where the Portofino Bay Hotel
comes in. Because this Loews hotel is on the premises, adults who
have had enough adventures can let their older children walk (with
no highways to cross) or take a shuttle boat to the parks.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty, however, for those who stay behind at the
Portofino, which has gone way outside the boxy look to create a
hotel that gives the appearance of dozens of adjoining buildings,
covered with trompe l'oeil art, as are the buildings in the actual
town in northwest Italy. Inside, opera and other music play in the
public areas _ you might, for instance, hear Puccini in the
restrooms. Many staff members, recruited from Central Florida's
Italian community, are from Italy or at least speak Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hotel's nine restaurants carry on the theme.
Particularly intriguing is Mama Della's, where the story is told
that because Mama's children grew up, she decided to convert her
house into a restaurant. Thus, the various rooms have different
wallpaper, the chairs and plates don't always match, and the
atmosphere is homey. Strolling musicians sing Italian songs, and if
you're lucky you might be there when Mama herself joins in. The
Delfino Riviera, meanwhile, is coolly elegant. (Both restaurants
have won praise from critics who know more about fine dining than I
do. I know what I like, however, and Mama's lasagna and the
Delfino's osso buco were fine by me.) For fun eating, there's the
Trattoria del Porto, where Universal characters drop in from time
to time. For instance, I was treated to the sight of Popeye doing
the twist in the trattoria.
</P>
<P>
   The Portofino also has three pools, a half-dozen shops or
boutiques, nine ballrooms or meeting rooms, and a spa and fitness
center. (I don't indulge in spa treatments myself, but my wife
always welcomes the opportunity, saying they leave her as relaxed
as cooked spaghetti.)
</P>
<P>
   All of this, however, shouldn't be considered a substitute for
the real Portofino, garbage cans and all. And the hotel people know
this: General manager Crawford Sherman, who spent part of his
childhood in Portofino, says his fondest wish is that his hotel
will inspire people to want to travel to the actual village. It did
that for me.

ABC'S BOGUS CASE AGAINST ALEXIS HERMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not to pile on poor ABC News _ the place is having
a month from hell _ but it was hard not to notice how little the
network did with the announcement last week that Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman had been exonerated after another of those
multimillion-dollar independent counsel investigations of
``charges'' that turned out to be bogus.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was ABC's story, brought to the Justice Department
with all the fanfare a TV network can produce, pumped up with
helium and then, at the moment of truth, essentially ignored.
</P>
<P>
   This tale lacks the hype and celebrity buzz associated with the
network's other headaches _ its inability to acknowledge that in a
farcical search for ratings it sent Leonardo DiCaprio to interview
President Clinton about the environment; and its handling of
another interview with Elian Gonzalez, age 6.
</P>
<P>
   But the mistreatment of Herman is every bit as revealing because
it illustrates the extent to which journalism standards have
plummeted in this age of commercialism and competition-driven
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The story is not very complicated. A guy named Laurent Yene from
Cameroon in the 1990s ended up in a personal and business
relationship with Vanessa Weaver, a woman who used to be Herman's
partner in a consulting firm. Both relationships ended four years
ago, whereupon Yene began saying ugly things about her and her
former partner, who had bought Herman's interest in their firm when
Herman entered the Clinton administration in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly Thing No. 1: Yene claimed that Herman agreed to accept a 10
percent kickback in cash on every piece of business she steered to
him and Weaver in their effort to represent people and firms
seeking government assistance. He claimed to have handed Herman a
cash-filled envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly Thing No. 2. Yene also claimed that Herman, at his
encouragement, was part of scheme to get a Singapore businessman
seeking a satellite license to make illegal contributions to the
Democratic Party through Weaver and her sister, Caryliss. There was
no direct corroboration of any of this, but, hey, this is modern
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Yene hung around in the shadows during Herman's irresponsibly
delayed confirmation as labor secretary in 1997 but was paid no
serious heed. But late that fall, ABC began greasing the
independent counsel skids by getting around the no-evidence
problem.
</P>
<P>
   First, it got the guy on camera making his claims. Second, it
let him show his array of bank statements and other documents that
do not contain a single mention of Herman and permitted him to say
they showed a fancy scheme to get money to her. Third, they did
what the courts never allow for good reason, they gave Yene a
polygraph that he ``passed.'' And fourth, investigative guru Brian
Ross walked the guy into the Justice Department and reported that
officials were looking into charges that consisted of ABC's report.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Attorney General Janet Reno hired an independent
counsel, as she always has. This one will end up costing about $4
million after taking nearly two years. As things turned out, the
businessman from Singapore, Abdul Rahman, was indicted for making
illegal contributions of $150,000 to the Democratic Party in the
names of the Weaver sisters. When that was reported two months ago,
it was given a sinister tone because it was part of the ``Herman
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was the clue that the probe by Maine Republican
Ralph Lancaster was winding down. There were no charges against the
Weaver sisters, much less Herman, because there was no evidentiary
link to Rahman's contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Herman is in fact one of those people who labor valiantly to
make public life worthwhile. She was a Democratic Party star in the
period leading up to Clinton's election and before that a labor
relations expert known as a go-to person for Fortune 500 firms. Her
record as labor secretary has included the deft settlement of an
ugly Teamsters strike, the completion of a long effort to
consolidate the department's bewildering array of job-training
programs into a simpler, efficient system, and she is one of the
key people who has made welfare-to-work a success.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this ridiculous ordeal, Herman never complained. The
easy way out would have been to say that this was just another
example of what made the independent counsel system such a joke for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But there has always been more to this than too much
partisanship. A standards-challenged press has been the critical
triggering mechanism at every juncture. The editors and producers
who enable this behavior are kidding themselves if they don't think
the public has caught on to the game.

IDEAS ON WHAT TO SEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just what is a family vacation? The answer may seem simple
enough, but just as there are new interpretations of what a family
is, so, too, are there many ideas of what a family vacation is.
</P>
<P>
   No longer does ``family'' just mean mom, dad, and the kids. The
term could mean a single parent has the children, or it could
include grandparents, grandchildren, or extended families. And the
family vacation no longer means heading to the beach and booking a
cabin for a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Families are on the move. And the travel world is out to help
with lots of family-friendly ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island just held a swearing-in of a bumper crop of family
travel ambassadors. Right on the steps of the capitol in
Providence, Governor Lincoln Almond welcomed Mr. and Mrs. Potato
Head as the state's newest ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Potato Head, created by Rhode Island-based Hasbro in 1952,
was selected to be the spokespud of the ``Rhode Island . . . The
Birthplace of Fun!'' promotion to encourage families from across
the nation to vacation in the tiny state. Throughout Rhode Island,
6-foot-tall Mr. Potato Heads, each decorated in styles ranging from
a mosaic bikini-clad beach beauty to a bejeweled sparkling spud,
will sprout at visitor attractions, restaurants, and recreational
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are encouraged to call 800-507-6700 for a free family
fun guide and information on a contest to locate at least three Mr.
Potato Head statues and win prizes, including, naturally, a
treasure chest of Hasbro toys. In 1999, Disney's Family Fun
magazine cited the state in four categories: top cities
(Providence); top zoos (Roger Williams Park Zoo); top tourist towns
(Newport); and top historic sites (the Newport mansions).
</P>
<P>
   A growing trend is to travel to the far corners of the world for
adventure. Thompson Family Adventures of Cambridge, Mass. has trips
to Africa, Nepal, Egypt, Alaska's wild areas, and the Galapagos.
The company's founders, Rick Thomson and Judi Wineland, have been
living an adventurous life for more than 20 years with homes both
in the Boston area and Tanzania. And, having children of their own,
they understand what traveling with the kids is all about, allowing
time for relaxation and adventure. Trips are planned to coincide
with spring breaks, summer vacation, and school holidays, and are
priced for family budgets.
</P>
<P>
   When travelers book a trip, the children are enrolled in an
Adventurer's Club, matching them with pen pals from where they will
be traveling as well as with others who will be traveling with
them. They also will be sent material geared to their age on the
destination, and once there they will participate in hands-on
activities designed for them. For details, call 800-262-6255 or
visit www.FamilyAdventures.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to head for the hills _ ski resorts in summer
offer great family escapes. Waterville Valley in New Hampshire has
a Summer Unlimited plan that begins at $61 a day per person and
includes lodging, use of the athletic club with its pools and
exercise equipment, boating, mountain biking, tennis, golf, camp
for the kids, and more. For details, call 800-GO VALLEY or visit
www.waterville.com. In Vermont, Smugglers' Notch has been winning
accolades for its children's programs _ both summer and winter _
for years. It's so good, they guarantee fun or refund the cost of
funless times. Call
</P>
<P>
   Or you could head to a resort. Connecticut's Sunrise Resort is
the last remaining family vacation place of the ``Dirty Dancing''
genre. And it's not just surviving, it's thriving. This 140-acre
resort has been cited in magazines and books. The resort offers a
complete vacation package, including three meals daily and lots of
activities and entertainment. And it's family owned. It's also very
accommodating, with lodging that ranges from space for tents and
RVs to waterfront cottages and motel rooms. For information on this
Moodus, Conn., resort, call 800-225-9033 or visit
www.sunriseresort.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of going to Florida, instead of the usual
Disney World or Universal Studios tour, let the kids get their
hands dirty on a summer camping experience that includes
hand-feeding giraffes, giving a black rhinoceros an afternoon mud
bath, or maybe even assisting a veterinarian in conducting a
physical exam on an exotic white tiger.
</P>
<P>
   All this is possible during one of the Sea World/Busch Gardens
Adventure Camps at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. There are camps for
different age groups _ even parents and kids as well as teachers.
These camps are not for everyone: You can get dirty, it can be hot,
but it might be the experience of a lifetime. And it's not all
work. Nights are for fun activities and there are adventures along
the Gulf of Mexico beaches and canoe trips. Of course, Busch
Gardens is famous for its roller coasters and other rides as well
as live shows and a water park. For more information, call Will
Darnall at 813-987-5780 or visit www.buschgardens.org.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows of the fun of Disney World, Disneyland, Universal
Studios, and other theme parks, but how about a Revolutionary Fun
Vacation Package? Virginia offers 400 years of fun, all within a
few days and all without a lot of travel. At first, kids might not
be enthusiastic about going to Colonial Williamsburg, but throw in
the great theme park attractions of Busch Gardens Williamsburg,
Water Country USA, and two more historic attractions, Jamestown
Settlement and the Yorktown Victory Center, and you've got a
getaway that offers great history, learning, and fun.
</P>
<P>
   And lest the kids think going to Williamsburg is just for
adults, let them know history there is kid-friendly. America's
oldest and largest outdoor living history museum lets kids get up
to their elbows in cake batter in an 18th-century household. This
gives a new meaning to hands-on, and it's just one of the things
children will love doing in this 18th-century capital. At Jamestown
Settlement, they'll learn about one of the earliest settlements in
America, and the Yorktown Victory Center brings the American
Revolution to life.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, a family of four can vacation beginning at $715,
including lodging and admissions. Prices depend on length of stay,
dates of travel, and accommodations sought. For information, call
the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation at 800-400-2851. Packages are
available May 6-Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego is another area with lots of variety. Here one can
visit Legoland California, a ``country just for kids (2-12).''
There's also Sea World San Diego, with not only whales, penguins,
and dolphins but interactive play areas and even dolphin
interaction programs. Then there is the San Diego Zoo, a
world-famous showcase for 3,800 animals of 800 species, and San
Diego Wild Animal Park where a monorail takes visitors to view
3,500 animals roaming free. All this and we haven't mentioned the
museums, beaches, the nearby desert, nearby Mexico, or the historic
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you might stay home. Home in this case is Boston,
and it's a great city for family vacations. People travel around
the world to see Boston's historic sites. Instead of spending lots
of money on air fares, head into this family-friendly city.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau produces a great
Family Fun guide to attractions and hotels with special family
deals. They'll even send you a discount book to help cut costs.
Call 888-SEE BOSTON or, on the Web, visit www.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to take a cruise. Temptress Adventure Cruises,
which travels along Costa Rica and Panama, has five-night family
cruises with adult fares beginning at $1,210 and children 12 and
under receiving a 50 percent discount June 3-Aug. 30. Temptress
cruises at night, leaving the days for exploring and
eco-adventures. On-board naturalists lead daily excursions. For
information, call 800-336-8423 or, on the Web, visit
www.temptresscruises.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you head to Europe, drop by Kensington Palace in London to
see a showcase of six generations of royal children's clothes from
1810 to the outfits worn by Prince Charles and Princess Anne at
their mother's coronation in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Family vacations even include mulitgenerational ones for women.
Explorations in Travel has outdoor and cultural vacations for women
over 40. And on their multigeneration trips, all they ask is that
one participant be over 40, the others over 21. For information,
call 802-257-0152 or, on the Web, visit www.exploretravel.com.
</P>
<P>
   For busy parents and even grandparents looking for help, travel
agencies are ready and willing to put together vacations.

&HT;     WOMEN'S SOCCER TURNING PRO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTOPHER ARGYRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Parlaying deep-pocketed investors, a strong
television presence and the popularity of the World Cup champions,
a women's professional soccer league plans to begin play next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's United Soccer Association said Monday it approved
teams for Atlanta, Boston, New York, Orlando-Tampa, Philadelphia,
San Diego, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The league begins in April 2001 and has letters of intent to
play from all 20 members of the 1999 U.S. world championship team.
</P>
<P>
   WUSA envisions stadiums with capacities of 6,500 to 10,000 for
an 80-game schedule, far smaller than Major League Soccer sites.
</P>
<P>
   It might not find those venues immediately, league officials
said, and could temporarily emulate the MLS, which has many teams
playing in NFL stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get one season behind us so we know our exact venue
needs,'' said John Hendricks, the chairman and chief executive of
Discovery Communications and board chairman of WUSA.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to success are signing the best players and hooking up
with television, league officials said. Television coverage would
be on TNT and CNNSI, mostly on weekend afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get some of the local stars that Bay Area fans
are familiar with from the World Cup,'' said Amos Hostetter, who
along with Hendricks is co-owner of the San Francisco franchise.
</P>
<P>
   World Cup heroine Brandi Chastain, also assistant coach of the
Santa Clara women's team, is a marquee player coveted by the
franchise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have Brandi, certainly, as a top player in
women's soccer,'' Hostetter said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not rule out the possibility of tabbing Chastain as a
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the MLS, Hostetter said, there is ``no talk of limiting''
the number of foreign players available to each team.
</P>
<P>
   Star players would be spread among the eight teams in a
league-wide draft later this summer, with remaining slots filled
through a series of open tryouts, Hostetter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have franchise venues set, with players and coaches
signed, by the end of the summer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Official U.S. Soccer standards require each team with a minimum
salary level of $400,000, Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the investor side, to get the absolute top players
involved, we needed to double that budget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the initial eight markets required a $5 million
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Soccer Federation set a May 1 deadline to submit
business plans. The WUSA, with a four-year TV contract with Turner
Broadcasting and such heavy corporate supporters as Time-Warner,
Comcast and Cox Communications, already has met that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   MLS also has expressed interest in forming a women's league and
spoke with Hendricks in December about combining efforts. But WUSA
officials and prospective players disagreed, saying they wanted to
keep the focus on the women's game.

RECORD SHOWS GORE LONG EMBELLISHING TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON AND MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore brings a remarkable life story to the
presidential race: His father was such an unwavering supporter of
civil rights that it cost him his Senate seat. His older sister was
the first-ever volunteer in the Peace Corps, that heroic outpost on
President Kennedy's New Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   By Gore's account: He was raised in hardscrabble Tennessee farm
country. He was a brilliant student, in high school and at Harvard.
And despite his political pull, he received no special treatment,
opting instead to go to Vietnam where he was ``shot at.''
</P>
<P>
   After his Army service, he spent seven years as a journalist,
and his reporting at the Tennessean in Nashville put corrupt
officials in prison.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior member in the US House, he was a major force: He
wrote and then spearheaded passage of the Superfund law. He even
authored the US nuclear negotiating position. And at a time when
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev faced off on
the superpower stage, Gore had his own meeting with Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, he created the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At various times in his political career, Gore, the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee, has said all those things about
himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
   None are quite true.
</P>
<P>
   Some are exaggerations grown up around kernels of biographical
fact. Others are simply false. A few, like the boastful claim about
the Internet, have become comic fodder, even for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery, even for Gore's friends, is why he has persistently
embroidered a political resume and pedigree that shorn of
embellishments are impressive by any measure. Gore did press for
early funding of the network that grew into the Internet. He served
in Vietnam when he could have arranged a safer setting, unlike his
Republican rival, George W. Bush. His journalism did unearth
corruption. And in Congress, he exerted uncommon influence on
technology and national security matters, notwithstanding his lack
of seniority.
</P>
<P>
   But for Gore, the facts have never been quite enough. Starting
as a junior congressman and continuing through this year's
primaries, Gore has regularly promoted himself, and skewered his
opponents, with embroidered, misleading, and occasionally false
statements to a degree that even some of his allies concede is rare
for a politician of his stature.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gore's inflated claims have been reported, though only a
few prominently. But a review by the Globe of Gore's public
statements over more than 20 years, as well as two recent
biographies, suggest that the pattern has been more pronounced than
previously believed, and that it remains unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier fears that Gore would be hobbled by President Clinton's
character failings have abated. Now, it is Gore's credibility that
could become an issue. Behind the scenes, according to sources, top
campaign aides have met to consider the issue's potential for
damaging Gore's candidacy. His Republican opponent, Texas Governor
Bush, has already telegraphed his plans to attack Gore's
believability.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's recent campaign rhetoric has invited scrutiny of his
sometimes freewheeling treatment of facts. Several times, he
misstated his own record and that of his Democratic opponent,
former senator Bill Bradley. In Iowa, Gore's misleading claim that
Bradley voted against disaster relief for the flood-stricken state
dealt a serious blow to Bradley's insurgent candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we believe that you will tell the truth as
president if you don't tell the truth as a candidate?'' Bradley
asked Gore at a debate in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's
Annenberg School of Communications, said she is troubled that Gore
sometimes continues to use exaggerated or inaccurate claims even in
the face of public evidence that he is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder if it's a failure to listen or an impulse to
deceive,'' said Jamieson, who monitors the accuracy of political
statements. ``The question is, is there a basic personality flaw
there that will make it more difficult for him to be president? Is
there a tendency to exaggerate? Is there a tendency to reconstruct
the past? When you start counting on the fingers of both hands you
start to say maybe there's a pattern here.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a campaign spokesman, said Gore could not be
interviewed on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody makes mistakes, and every politician's utterances
are pounced upon. But it is not fair to pull out every misstatement
and honest mistake and attack him for it,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Many political candidates portray themselves as more effective
or courageous than the facts justify and paint their opponents in
the worst possible light.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bush has made claims about his gubernatorial record
that are open to challenge. To cite one case, Bush takes credit for
a major HMO reform in Texas. In fact, he opposed the bill and it
became law without his signature. And during the New York primary,
Bush's campaign ran an advertisement that falsely characterized
Senator John McCain's record on breast cancer research. Bush
narrowly won that election.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of Gore's supporters glumly acknowledge that Gore
stands out for the extent to which he has created myths about his
life and his record. As the Globe reported in January, the issue so
troubled his presidential campaign staff in 1988 that aides twice
sent him memos warning him about it.
</P>
<P>
   More recent Gore claims make it clear that the predilection
persists. In announcing his candidacy last June, Gore praised his
father's courage on civil rights but sidestepped an obvious
contradiction: The elder Gore strongly opposed the landmark 1964
Civil Rights Act. And his sister was a salaried midlevel political
appointee at Peace Corps headquarters, and not, as Gore has said on
a couple of occasions, a ``volunteer,'' the label reserved for
those who serve overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek reporter Bill Turque, the author of a new biography,
``Inventing Al Gore,'' said Gore is prone to ``self
aggrandizement.'' Yet in most instances, Turque noted, the
embellishments are not made up out of whole cloth, but involve a
``nugget of fact'' that Gore has embroidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most bewildering thing is that, in most of the cases, the
straight story is as praiseworthy as the one he inflates,'' Turque
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Turque and Bob Zelnick, a former ABC News reporter and the
author of a 1999 Gore biography, ``Gore: A Political Life,'' both
trace Gore's tendency to exaggerate his resume to the vice
president's childhood. They said the child of prominent parents
could never quite measure up to their unreasonable expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In his parents' eyes, said Turque, ``it was not enough for him
to be good, to be excellent. He had to be transcendent, he had to
save the world. This desire of his to please them left him with a
compulsion in the retelling to stretch what are honorable, credible
accomplishments.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dukakis responds &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1988 presidential primary campaign, then-Massachusetts
Governor Michael S. Dukakis, needled once too often by Gore,
upbraided him during a debate: ``Please get your facts straight. If
you want to be president of the United States, you better start by
being accurate.'' Another candidate, former Senator Paul Simon,
scolded Gore during another debate for making ``sweeping charges.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, Simon and Dukakis were reluctant to
discuss their scrapes with the man who is now their party's
standard bearer. But Simon said Gore's rhetorical excesses that
year ``could accurately be described as brashness, which obviously
didn't get him anywhere. . . . It was a combination of youth and
inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   But what raised the most eyebrows in 1988 was not what Gore said
about his opponents. It was his inclination, during his first
audition on a national stage, to add lustrous detail to his own
resume.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Vt. _ Three years ago, with an address written down
on a slip of paper, 65-year-old Randy Boardman drove out of the
hills and 120 miles north into Canada to buy the tiny pink pills
his doctor had prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he took his skeptical friend Doug, whose derision
had given way to desperation under the pressure of his
out-of-pocket yearly drug bill of $4,500. By that evening, when
they crossed back across the border, Canada's price controls had
saved them $1,260.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, solitary journeys like Boardman's began to take on
the look of a movement: From a senior center in Burlington, 30
elderly Vermonters climbed onto a chartered bus and were served
doughnuts by a congressman, independent US Representative Bernie
Sanders of Burlington. Now Sanders is taking his support to a new
level, launching an Internet campaign advertising bargains to be
had in Canada. Three Vermont senior centers are organizing regular
bus trips, as are groups in Montana, Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota
and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly New Englanders taking their business north of the
45th parallel would not describe themselves as radical. But from
the standpoint of Washington, the trips are part of a rumbling
message of protest. Politicians like Sanders _ who says the issue
arouses more anger than any he has encountered in his political
career _ hope to ``embarrass the US Congress'' into controlling
prices on prescription drugs for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   And the powerful pharmaceutical industry has responded by
blitzing the border states with a dire warning: That price controls
would drastically slow drug research and usher in the worst flaws
of socialized medicine. The real medical exodus runs southward, the
advertisements argue, with hundreds of thousands of Canadians
crossing the border every year for superior treatment in American
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   For 64-year-old Maurice Brown, who has voted Republican all his
life and signed up for ``Bernie's bus,'' politics hardly seem
relevant: He would back any politician who promised to tackle drug
prices. Brown's alternative cost-cutting strategy is to stop taking
all four of his heart and respiratory prescriptions toward the end
of the year, when the $2,500 allotted by his health insurer runs
out, and staying away from dangerous activity, like shoveling his
driveway, until Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not rabble-rousing people,'' said Chip Castle,
director of the Central Vermont Senior Center. ``I think in some
ways they feel they're betraying their own doctor. It's pretty
weird at this point in their lives they have to hop on a bus and go
to Montreal to buy pills.''
</P>
<P>
   As pressure to lessen the burden of drug prices on senior
citizens _ who make up 12 percent of the US population, yet shell
out 30 percent of drug expenditures _ has built to a high pitch in
Washington, few politicians have more relentlessly fingered the
pharmaceutical companies than Sanders. He has sponsored legislation
that would allow pharmacists in the United States to reimport
medicines from their counterparts in Canada, dramatically forcing
prices down by integrating the country's markets. Canadian retail
prices are 30 to 80 percent lower because Canada offers universal
health care, so the state purchasing agent has more power to demand
lower prices than individual HMOs would, said David Sirota, a
Sanders spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the pharmaceutical companies _ which support
resolving the problem by increasing Medicare coverage _ began
fighting back with TV and radio advertisements making the case that
the American health care system is far preferable to the Canadian
one. At risk, if Sanders succeeds, is America's top-flight research
and development, the best possible medication, and access to
life-saving cancer treatments, argue the advertisements and a Web
site, http://www.busfromcanada.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just cherry-pick what you want when it's part and
parcel of a whole system,'' said Tim Ryan, executive director of
Citizens for Better Medicare. ``You have to understand the downside
of government controls of these prices.''
</P>
<P>
   On the red-brick main street of a border town like Bedford,
Quebec, comparing the two health care systems is a matter of
everyday commerce, especially when the exchange rate is
particularly favorable: Americans show up to get their cavities
filled, or buy dentures, or _ more and more often _ walk into
Jacques Bouchard's pharmacy with a brand-new prescription from a
Canadian doctor, which they need in order to buy the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, one of Bouchard's relatives, who has breast
cancer, was just referred to a hospital in Burlington for radiation
treatments, because the wait in Montreal would be too long. All
things considered, Bouchard said, shrugging, both the American and
Canadian health care systems have their flaws.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of drug price control said comparing our system
with Canada's is missing the point, and call the industry's
campaign a scare tactic. Per capita health care spending in Canada
is half what it is in America, and that explains scarcity and long
waits, said Alan Sager, a Boston University professor who and has
testified before Congress in support of price controls. In fact,
Sager said, if Americans could afford medications, it would shrink
hospital deficits, because they would better regulate their own
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has responded to the advertisements with his own Web
site, http://www.bernie.house.gov/bustocanada, which lists the
price of prescription drugs in the United States and Canada, based
on his own comparative shopping visits north.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the pharmaceutical industry is doing is a vulgar way to
deflect attention from the real issue,'' Sanders said. ``The debate
about the Canadian and American health care systems is a very
interesting issue, but that is not what this is about.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, says Sanders, are the dangerous medical
decisions seniors are making under pressure. Castle said that, in
one case that came up at the Central Vermont Council on Aging, a
couple did it this way: The wife took her prescription for one
month, and then the husband took his prescription for one month.
There were similar stories among on Sanders' bus:
</P>
<P>
   Phil and Phyllis Atwood, who live in South Burlington and are
both 70, can't quit their jobs; Lucille Danyow of St. Albans, who
is 78, slices her pills in half so her supply will last longer. And
Maurice Brown just stops taking his medications and tries not to do
anything that might bring on a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like these eat at 68-year-old Boardman, a retired
bulldozer operator who drinks out of a ``Good Morning, Grumpy'' mug
and routinely refers to his sister-in-law as ``General Patton.''
When Boardman retired, seven years ago, he had never taken a pill
except aspirin. It came as a surprise to discover he needed to
spend $1,241 every year to lower his cholesterol. He'll make the
drive, but it doesn't sit right with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, this nation, as rich as it is,'' he said. ``Why should I
have to leave it to buy medicine?''

NICK TOSCHES WRITES ELEGANTLY ABOUT AMERICA'S UNDERBELLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nick Tosches enters a room with the authority of an
Old World aristocrat _ and the wariness of a mean-streets tough.
You better be tough, if you expect to get away with wearing a silk
homburg in the West Village on a weekday morning. ``I always felt
that that was one of the rewards of being 50, you could wear a
homburg,'' he says with a lazy grin, ``that and the strength of
merely having gotten there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosches (rhymes with galoshes) has reason to grin. He's just
come out with two books, ``The Devil and Sonny Liston,'' a
biography of the late heavyweight champion, and ``The Nick Tosches
Reader,'' a gathering of three decades of writing for publications
as various as Teenage Wasteland Gazette and Vanity Fair (where he's
a contributing editor).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick has the ability to get completely loose and seem to be
saying whatever pops into his mind _ to say things that are
scabrous, outrageous, confusing _ and at the same time do this in a
stylistic framework of absolute eloquence and really pristine
form,'' says Greil Marcus, a longtime friend and the author of such
books as ``Mystery Train'' and ``Invisible Republic.'' ``It's like
there's a wild heart beating in this late-19th-century dandy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, Peter Wolf, lead singer of the J. Geils Band,
likens the ``Reader'' to ``a box set, with the early works, the
demos. You get a chronicle of a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an apt analogy, for Tosches' best-known writing has been
about music. He began his career back in the early '70s, patrolling
the wilder shores of rock criticism. He wrote a flaunting, bravura
prose and would occasionally review records he hadn't listened to _
or, on at least a couple of occasions, that didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Tosches' first book, ``Country'' (1977), about country and
western music, demonstrated a bent for maniacally detailed research
that he would later bring to bear on Jerry Lee Lewis (``Hellfire,''
1982) and Dean Martin (``Dino,'' 1992). The latter book helped
begin the current Rat Pack revival, something that causes Tosches
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that admirers of ``Dino'' run the gamut from Regis
Philbin to the novelist Don DeLillo suggests just how difficult it
is to peg Tosches. Forced to assign him to a category, though, one
could do worse than ``American id studies.'' Tosches' writing
abounds in characters who make Sonny Liston seem almost subdued:
rockabilly anarchs, Vegas libertines, Machiavelli-quoting hit men
(Tosches has written two novels about the Mafia, ``Cut Numbers''
(1988), and ``Trinities'' (1999), as well as ``Power on Earth,'' a
1986 biography of Michele Sindona, the notorious Italian financier
whose clientele included both the Mafia and the Vatican. Sex and
drugs and (of course) rock 'n' roll figure prominently, as do
violence, redemption, and what Wolf laughingly calls ``spending the
other side of midnight together.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing so well captures the Toschean ideal as the
tribute he pays to the jump blues singer Amos Milburn in his 1984
collection, ``Unsung Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll.'' Milburn's voice,
Tosches writes, ``bespoke the ceaseless saxophones of salvation,
the crossing and uncrossing of restless nylon knees, the eightfold
path of the unfiltered Kool, and the miracle of Our Lady of the
After-Hours Joint.''
</P>
<P>
   At his most characteristic, Tosches can read like a cross
between the King James Bible and a peep show. His sentences leer
and jeer, hoot and holler _ yet all the while retain an Old
Testament cadence. ``Nick can really write like a 17th-century
Puritan when he wants to, (there's) a lot of Cotton Mather in
him,'' says Marcus. ``His books have a film-noir aspect,'' adds
Wolf. It's a tribute to Tosches' talent (as well as his
unusualness) that they're both right.
</P>
<P>
   In person, the film-noir aspect is more visible. A residue of
considerable Camel smoke coats his voice, and Tosches has the
tight-drawn skin of a man once likelier to respond to thirst than
hunger. ``Nick and Jerry Lee look quite a bit alike these days,''
deadpans Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Tosches points out that, thanks to diabetes and the sheer
passage of time, he now leads a far tamer life. He admits to a
measure of surprise, as well as pleasure, at having reached the
half-century mark. ``So many things I've done and been involved
in,'' he sighs. ``up until even 10 years ago _ drugs, alcohol,
general lifestyle habits, dissipation (we have so many nice words
for so many terrible things). But the physical cause of death would
have been drugs and alcohol, if not being shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosches' past is as colorful as his writing. He grew up in, as
he puts it, ``this Golden Triangle'' of Newark, Jersey City, and
Manhattan. Disarmingly cynical and charmingly surly, he learned at
an early age _ courtesy of his father, a tavern owner _ that few
things in this life are on the level. ``I was a kid working for
him,'' Tosches explains. ``Payday came. He gave me the money and
said, `Aren't you going to count it?' I said, `No, I trust you.'
He'd shortchanged me. It was just his way of telling me, hey, this
can happen when you're in a world among thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosches, in fact, had his run-ins with the law and claims to
have written his first five books on a stolen typewriter. Does he
think he could have ended up a made man?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. It was the environment I grew up in, and for the most
part these characters were among the most benign forces in the
neighborhood.. . . Bookmakers, shylocks, killers, whatever, and I
became aware of this at a very early age because there were certain
really nice, gentlemanly people in the neighborhood who didn't have
jobs. So I said to my mother, `What does Louie do for a living?'
`Oh, he's in the rackets.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the rackets (or, for that matter, college), Tosches
held what he describes as ``a bunch of strange jobs, both
legitimate and illegitimate.'' They included tending bar, pasting
on labels at the Lovable Underwear Company (Tosches swears that's
the real name), and catching snakes at the Miami Serpentarium. One
bite on the shin, and he headed back north. This was in 1972, the
year Tosches got married. He later divorced and remains single.
</P>
<P>
   Tosches sold his first piece, at 19, to the Boston-based rock
magazine Fusion. By the time he moved to Nashville in the mid-'70s
to research ``Country,'' he was supporting himself exclusively
through his writing.
</P>
<P>
   What drew Tosches to country music, he says, was its providing
him with ``a renegade subject . . . damned, ignored, and
dismissed.'' His fondness for outsiders and extreme cases is
patent. And it's hard to imagine more of a renegade, someone more
outside or extreme, than Charles ``Sonny'' Liston. A convicted
felon who didn't so much box his opponents as maul them, Liston
lived the gangsta life long before there was such a thing. Even
worse, from respectable society's viewpoint, he succeeded at it.
``The bad guys are supposed to lose,'' Liston liked to say. ``I
change that. I win.''
</P>
<P>
   The '60s generation embraced Muhammad Ali, who twice defeated
Liston, as a symbol of rebellion. Tosches, who is convinced Liston
threw both fights to Ali, sees Liston as the true outlaw. ``Ali
presented a very benign, lovable character,'' Tosches says. ``He
fit right in the hypocritical capacity of middle-class, white
America to embrace blacks. He was entertaining . . . whereas Sonny
was just real. He was so pure, it was almost like a gift from God.
He transcended black, white, racism, good, and evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonny really was a tragic figure _ a term too freely used, but
in his case justified _ and I felt I wanted to restore his soul to
some sort of dignity.. . . He offers us an opportunity to see byond
this whole racial thing . . . to see a man so deprived in so many
ways, so set against in so many ways, who lived and endured.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Reader'' can be seen as Tosches' own, literary monument to
three decades of living and enduring. ``When the book was finally
done, there was something about that phrase `30 years' that had
some sort of weight to it that made me feel good. Here was the big
postcard from what I did with my summer vacation. And, God, now I
can fool them all: It's like I spent half the time (screwing) up,
and now it looks like I'm prolific. You stick around long enough
and you look prolific.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to go from picking up cigarette butts out of
urinals, which is how I started out (and I've never flicked one in
since), to the great leap forward of waiting for a $20 paycheck so
I could buy a barbecued chicken and a quart of milk, to now having
financial complaints that sound so utterly luxurious I never could
have imagined them in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Tosches will publish a book on an obscure minstrel
singer named Emmett Miller, who looms large in ``Country.'' Two
years later, he hopes to publish ``In the Hand of Dante,'' a novel
set simultaneously in the early 1300s and today that braids
together ``The Divine Comedy'' and organized crime. And somewhere
down the road _ by the time he hits 60? _ there's what Tosches
calls his ``dream'': ``to do my own translation of `The Divine
Comedy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   To go from the Mob to medieval epic _ ``Great Balls of Fire'' to
terza rima _ Dino to Dante? Tosches takes another puff on another
Camel, then smiles his all-knowing smile. ``Sometimes I think God's
greatest blessing to us is delusion.''

FROM THE BOOK OF RUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth C. Ellis doesn't understand all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker called her a woman of
``power, audacity and joy.'' Whenever she attends a public event,
people cluster around her, wanting to talk to her, hug her, just
spend some time in her aura. There have been gushy e-mails from
France, adoring phone calls from England. And ``Ruth Ellis Day'' is
celebrated each February in Detroit as part of Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis is perplexed by all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just an ordinary little woman,'' she said. ``I sometimes
wonder what this is all about; I'm not that important.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, Ellis is that important. A woman of abundant spirit,
hers is a refreshingly resilient soul, especially in a society that
doesn't always embrace the things Ellis embodies. According to the
award-winning documentary on her life, ``Living With Pride: Ruth
Ellis at 100,'' she is the ``oldest `out' African-American known.''
The film, by Yvonne Welbon, can be seen on the cable's Sundance
Channel April 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Ellis recalls her mother taking her to see the
Wright Brothers on one of their earliest flights; her
neighborhood's jubilance the day World War I ended; and how her
father, with only a sword, defended the family's home during race
riots in 1908. Even during a brief conversation, Ellis is a living,
breathing history book.
</P>
<P>
   While being the oldest known black lesbian is the reason Ellis
has become a celebrity in the lesbian and gay community, it's a
distinction she playfully challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do they know I'm the oldest?'' said Ellis, who celebrated
her 100th birthday last July, during a recent phone interview from
her home in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   That feistiness is what attracted filmmaker Welbon, 37, who
first saw Ellis at a women of color dance in Bloomington, Ind.,
three years ago. Ellis _ then a mere nonagenarian _ spent entire
evening wearing out various partners on the dance floor. Welbon was
instantly intrigued by this energetic spite of a woman with the
ready grin and shock of white hair.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Welbon, who lives in Chicago, visited
and filmed Ellis, including Ellis's trips to Provincetown to attend
Golden Threads, an annual gathering for lesbian and gay senior
citizens. ``I'm the oldest one there,'' Ellis offered. ``Of course,
I'm the oldest one every place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes to be around people her age, but of course, there's
no one her age,'' Welbon joked. ``The woman who founded Golden
Threads was 93, and when she saw Ruth she said, `Thank you for
making me a baby dyke, Ruth!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Springfield, Ill., on July 23, 1899, Ellis was the
youngest of four born to Charles Ellis Sr. and Carrie Faro. Her
mother died from a stroke when Ellis was 12, and she was raised
under the protective eye of her father, who had little patience for
boys hanging around his only daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy used to tell me, `Boys and books don't go together,'
'' Ellis said. ``So, if he came home and saw me on the front porch
talking to a boy, I got balled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father's discouragement of male suitors was just fine with
Ellis. She recalled falling in love with her high school gym
teacher, and learning about homosexuality from such books as the
Radclyffe Hall classic, ``The Well of Loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Ellis learned was self-taught, including bowling,
piano, photography, and typesetting, which led to Ellis opening her
own printing shop in Detroit. It was also in the Motor City where
Ellis began her 30-year-plus relationship with Ceceline ``Babe''
Franklin, a woman she met at a dance in Springfield. The two women
bought a home and lived together until shortly before Franklin's
death in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has been single since Franklin's death, Ellis never
wants for companionship. She has a large circle of friends, which
seems ever larger since Welbon's documentary began making its way
through various film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a celebrity. I just want to be as I am,''
Ellis said. ``I'm like Popeye the sailor man _ `I am what I am, and
that's all that I am.' I didn't think I had enough history to make
a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Having recently witnessed the turn of yet another century, Ellis
isn't enjoying what she has seen so far. People aren't ``living
right, '' she said, and ``they aren't compassionate and friendly
like they should be.'' She is discouraged with the persistence of
racism, and just doesn't understand homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``God loves everybody. Some people in the church don't believe
that because they don't accept gay and lesbian people,'' said
Ellis, a devout churchgoer. ``But God accepts them; otherwise, He
wouldn't have put them here.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's that matter-of-fact pride that makes Ruth Ellis an icon
in the lesbian and gay community. Even though arthritis has lately
limited her mobility _ ``Old age has got a hold of me,'' she said _
she still gets out as often as possible, courtesy of her friends.
She's planning her annual P-town sojourn, and her 101st birthday
party is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the youngsters tell me I'm an inspiration,'' she said.
``Well, I guess I'm just glad this old lady can inspire someone.''

THE JOY OF A FAMILY TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family vacation: What makes those words so magical? Is it the
memories? The sharing of laughter and fun? Yes to both, but mostly
it is the joy of just being with one another.
</P>
<P>
   During our ``normal lives,'' we are so busy we don't have much
time for one another. But on vacation, the opposite is true _ our
time revolves around one another.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, my family vacationed at Yellowstone. It was one of
my best trips, and one reason I had so much fun was that I was with
my family.
</P>
<P>
   On a family vacation, you have time to learn things about each
other you never knew. You also have time to look around and learn
more about the earth. Besides being fun, Yellowstone was beautiful,
and gave our family new things to learn: the park's history and
facts about geysers, hot springs, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice thing about that vacation was our lodgings. At the
Roosevelt Cabins, the first place we stayed in the park, we shared
a tiny, one-room building. At the main lodge, though, we would all
sit on the large porch, with its many rocking chairs. My sister,
Natalie, and I always brought a board game, and we would play
quietly while our parents read.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, we would head back to the lodge for a huge
family-style dinner. Once we were full, we would drive around
looking for wolves and other wild animals.
</P>
<P>
   One night, we walked to the stables for an Old West cookout. The
leaders of the group first gathered us together and told stories.
Then we were given the option to ride horseback or in a horse-drawn
buggy to the dinner site. We had a delicious dinner and told more
stories. We rode back, and we went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   The second place we stayed at was the Old Faithful Inn, right
next to Old Faithful. The inside was amazing; everything was shiny
and made of wood. When we walked in and looked up, we were
surprised to see that each floor had a big balcony.
</P>
<P>
   The inn was huge, and had a lot of nooks and crannies that were
great fun to discover. My sister and I got to have our own room for
the first time on a trip, and we used a shared bathroom down the
hall. Our parents were next door.
</P>
<P>
   Built onto the ceiling of the inn was a small room that
resembled a treehouse. It was called the Crow's Nest, but
unfortunately was closed to the public for safety reasons. There
was also a huge fireplace surrounded by chairs where people sat and
read while listening to piano music coming from the second-floor
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   During our stay at the inn, we did a lot of lounging around, and
spent a good amount of time on the second-floor porch watching Old
Faithful erupt hourly. My sister and I wrote letters and stories
galore.
</P>
<P>
   One morning we got up early for a guided walk through a geyser
basin. We saw lots of eruptions and other interesting sights.
</P>
<P>
   The entire stay was great, mostly because we had time to sit
together, read together, and have fun together.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, we are planning to go to California, and we are
expecting the trip to be just as much fun as Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years from now, we will all look back on our family
vacations, and be very glad we had the opportunity to do such a
wonderful thing.

 &HT;     SAN FRANCISCO MOVES AHEAD WITH PLAN TO NAME PARK FOR DiMAGGIO  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ City officials intend to proceed with naming a
small park for Joe DiMaggio, despite threats from a Florida lawyer
who says the baseball legend deserves a more prominent memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Gavin Newsom, who has been pushing to find a civic
honor for DiMaggio, said Monday that the city would move forward
with plans to hang the Yankee Clipper's name at the North Beach
Playground.
</P>
<P>
   Dom DiMaggio, Joe DiMaggio's only surviving sibling and a
baseball star in his own right, supports the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has been very good to my family, starting with my
immigrant parents and continuing to this day,'' DiMaggio, a former
All-Star center fielder with the Boston Red Sox, said in a written
statement from his Florida home. ``As far as I'm concerned, the
city can determine for itself the way in which it wants to honor
its native sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, who died in March 1999 at the age of 84, lived a
block away from the playground and played ball there as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown signed on to the proposal Monday to rename
the 2 1/2-acre playground in DiMaggio's honor.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes despite a demand from Morris Engelberg, the
Hollywood, Fla., lawyer handling DiMaggio's estate, who threatened
to sue to stop the name change.
</P>
<P>
   He said a more fitting tribute to DiMaggio would be to rename
the Bay Bridge or San Francisco International Airport, not a
concrete playground, after DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Newsom earlier this year, Engelberg said he would
``pursue all legal means available to stop the unauthorized use of
Joe DiMaggio's name.''
</P>
<P>
   After checking with the city attorney on San Francisco's legal
standing, Newsom said he was confident the city would prevail if
any legal action is taken.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, the Recreation and Park Commission voted 20
years ago to rename North Beach Playground for DiMaggio, though the
move was never consummated with a changing of signs and city maps.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the city will not use DiMaggio's name for
commercial purposes. Therefore, Newsom has concluded that City Hall
has the green light to name the playground after DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has a bedrock foundation legally,'' Newsom said.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg could not be reached for comment.

KEEPING THEM CALM IN THE CAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family travel is often accompanied by a question: How do you
keep the kids from tearing one another apart during long car rides?
Here, from SmarterKids.com, are portable products that the Web
site's educators have rated highest for fun and learning:
</P>
<P>
   --Brain Quest for Car _ The game includes 1,100 cards with
questions and answers about America, as well as original games
designed to be played in the vehicle. (Workman, $8.95, for grades
3-6.)
</P>
<P>
   --Electronic Hand-Held Yahtzee _ This one-player device lets a
youngster experience all the joys of the traditional game. (Milton
Bradley, $14.95, grades 2-12.)
</P>
<P>
   --Feltkids Travel Playset _ A sturdy case with a handle unfolds
to reveal _ ta da! _ a blue felt playing surface for 24 felt pieces
depicting a boy, a girl, and travel-related items. (Learning Curve,
$24.95, toddlers to Grade 1.)
</P>
<P>
   --Kids Trip Diary _ This activity book has pages to help
children prepare for their trip, record their memories (and perhaps
write nasty notes about their siblings), and play travel games.
(Marlor Press, $5.95, grades 1-5.)
</P>
<P>
   --Rush Hour _ It's a sliding block puzzle designed to challenge
sequential-thinking skills, whatever that means. There are 16
puzzle pieces, 40 challenge cards, and four levels of play. (Binary
Arts, $13, grades 3-12.)
</P>
<P>
   And who knows, if such products keep the kids busy enough, they
may ask ``Are we there yet?'' only a couple hundred times! &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go: When you set out in the car for your family vacation
_ or any other time _ be sure your children are properly buckled in
the proper seat for their size. Six out of 10 children killed in
crashes are not restrained. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What is London's most-visited tourist attraction?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``My brothers and sisters and I used to find the biggest,
most beautiful tree . . . make a treehouse in it, and pretend it
was the grandest house in all the world'' _ Dolly Parton,
explaining the inspiration behind a huge treehouse, which is part
of the new Dreamland Forest at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: Oklahoma law forbids taking a bite out of
another's hamburger. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fabulous photos in family-friendly Philly: When your family visits
Philadelphia, you'll surely photograph your children near the
Liberty Bell and in front of Independence Hall. But consider also
taking photos at these spots, with these poses: on the steps of the
Museum of Art, imitating Rocky of movie fame; aboard the RiverLink
Ferry, with the city in the background; in front of the LOVE statue
at JFK Plaza; posing as ``The Thinker'' statue in front of the
Rodin Museum; in front of the walk-through heart at the Franklin
Institute; and eating a cheese steak sandwich at Pat's Steaks. The
suggestions are from photographer Bob Krist via the Greater
Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corp. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Killer Web site: Everyone has a Web site these days _ even Shamu
the killer whale, a resident of SeaWorld Florida in Orlando. To see
Shamu in action, go to www.shamu.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Yeah, right: From a letter sent to the Orlando tourism people:
``Please send me four Disney World tickets _ I'll send you the
money later.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lions for lions' sake: A lion, long the symbol of MGM, is now in
residence at the MGM Grand Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. In fact, a
few lions live there. The Lion Habitat, inside the property, has a
variety of the beautiful beasts, including Goldie, Metro, and Baby
Lion, descendants of MGM Studio's marquee lion, Metro. A
see-through walkway tunnel runs through the habitat. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Madame Tussaud's wax museum; it attracts some 2
1/2 million visitors a year. &QL;

SMALL-TOWN LIFE IN ZAMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUKUNI, Zambia _ The barefoot girls on the road gang are
fiercely attacking weeds with mattocks. Well, it isn't exactly a
road, just one of the pathways through this village of 8,000
inhabitants not far from the Zambian end of that mighty African
waterworks: Victoria Falls. There is no automotive traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these teenagers seem good-natured about swinging their
long-handled tools on a hot, sunny afternoon, about keeping the
sandy crimson right-of-way neat. After all, as slender 22-year-old
Albina Similonga (a sort of one-woman Mukuni chamber of commerce)
explains, heavy-hitting _ plus lifting _ is traditionally women's
work in this locale. As well as such other toil as tending
children, goats and cows, raising the food _ corn, millet,
vegetables, chicken, beef _ and cooking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is better for the women lately, since we got a pump,''
says Albina, who has graduated from high school and has a less
strenuous (moreover, remunerative) job, showing visitors around for
a tourist agency. ``Before the government drilled the well and put
in the pump, we had to walk miles to a spring and back, carrying
heavy jars of water.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Helen Chalmers, in Harare, the capital of neighboring
Zimbabwe, had suggested, ``When you go to the falls, you might as
well cross the border and look in at Mukuni and see how most people
in this part of Africa live. Village life.''
</P>
<P>
   Small town stuff. Good. I liked her idea since I'd been raised
in a tranquil Ohio town of about the same population, also lying
amid farmland. Some people had water pumps when I was a boy. But
they were adjoining the kitchen sink, not communal. And the houses
weren't circular structures of mud and boughs with conical,
grass-thatched roofs. We probably missed something.
</P>
<P>
   My last stopover in Zambia, 30 years earlier, covering a State
Department good will tour of tennis champs Arthur Ashe and Stan
Smith, had been confined to the capital, Lusaka. It had the usual
leading city amenities: paved streets, electric lighting, plumbing
_ leftovers from the British colonies, Northern Rhodesia and
Nyasaland, prior to their combination as independent Zambia in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   At first not much good will was dispensed in our direction
because the day before we landed Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda,
paying a call on Washington, had been told that President Nixon,
was too busy to see him. It was headlined in Lusaka as a snub, a
national insult.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ashe turned down some of the heat. On TV he charmed the
local populace, intrigued by a significant champion with a black
face. He made points with his statesmanlike demeanor, by holding
instructional sessions for African kids _ and beating the tall,
blond Smith in an exhibition match.
</P>
<P>
   On that junket through Africa, Smith (the better player at the
time) was virtually nameless, a far-down second banana. Obviously
it was the Ashe tour. As in the heavyweight championship days of
Joe Louis's ``bum of the month club'' victims, Stan was the ``bum
of the layover'' in the eyes of Arthur's admirers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we got to Zambia, Smith, unassuming sportsman and
close friend of Ashe, was getting rankled by the lack of attention
being paid him. Frank Deford of Sports Illustrated straightened him
out. ``Stan, have you been paying attention to where we are? You're
along strictly for the ride. You are the Big O _ for opponent. The
other guy. The foil. That's all. At least you're getting room and
board.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had to laugh, thereafter enjoying the role of Big O,
frequently spoiling the show by beating Ashe. There were no tank
towns on that itinerary. Just teeming principal cities where tennis
courts were available, along with US diplomatic corps ambassadors
to furnish the room and board for nomadic sporting ambassadors.
It's a shame those State Department tours involving a variety of
American athletes have died. The athletes are too busy making too
much money to volunteer themselves as makers of good impressions
for their country.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago. But things haven't changed much since in
Albina's quiet hometown or mine. Of course, rural Ohio and Zambia
aren't very similar, but small-town folks are generally friendly
anywhere, proud of their settlement. Mukunians are no exception. My
town had maybe a half-dozen saloons, indoor establishments serving
trademarked brands. Mukuni guys prefer to make their own at home.
Boiling the bark of waterberry trees, they produce a strain of
white lightning called ``kachasu,'' that they drink while lying
around is the shade of leafy trees in wood-fenced yards. The
climate is favorable to year-round outdoor imbibing, an exercise in
light lifting they seem to specialize in. Sometimes noisily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kachasu is very powerful,'' says Albina, ``and is a very old
custom.'' Looks like it. Mukuni goes back to the 15th century, aged
something like 400 years senior to my former hamlet where the elder
swillery, a tavern called the Polish Village, is a youngster, about
75. But it may be only a matter of time before the PV's regular
communicants plant waterberry trees and introduce kachasu moonshine
to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   With the Songwe Hills a few miles away forming a hazy blue
backdrop and a nearby forest as scenic substitute for indoor
outhouses, the villagers appear content and healthy. Their life
pattern, far from indolent, would seem serious slo-mo to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The men with a trade, woodcarvers, sit on the ground of alfresco
studios. Shielded from the sun by low-hanging branches, they shape
animal and human figures from deep-purple-striped zebra wood. They
do good work. It's on sale at a market near the village chief's
stockaded residence, considered by the locals ``a palace,'' and
called Lumpasa (lion's den) in their dialect. Chief Patrick
Mufalali's place is accorded palatial status because of the
substantial size and appearance of the main house (graced by TV
antenna), a collection of outbuildings in a generous courtyard, and
the fact that his domicile has windows. What's more: glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief isn't home today,'' says Albina, ``but I will show
you some nice homes. Smaller, of course, but very pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   This is like strolling with the mayor. Everybody knows Albina.
An aged lady named Rosemary waves, and we stop to talk. Sitting
beside a pile of small nuts from a native tree, the knobbly-barked
maketi, Rosemary is opening them with a handy implement: a rock.
Not a balletic movement, but this nutcracker's sweet as she pounds
and explains that the nuts can be pressed for cooking oil or ground
up into flour.
</P>
<P>
   Operating her open-air beauty parlor farther along, Isabel
Muzamba has a couple of teenage customers, and everybody's busy.
While Isabel braids her hair, Theresa nurses her baby and stems
beans. Regina, awaiting her turn with the hairdresser, is cutting
up bean leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scene would please an efficiency expert,'' says my
friend, Aurelio.
</P>
<P>
   Albina takes us into a family compound where the odors are
delicious. The lady of the house, Veronika, has a beef stew
simmering in a black iron pot over a small wood fire. Aurelio
wonders about taking pot luck, but Albina says that, though we'd be
welcome, there's a large family to be fed.
</P>
<P>
   She wants us to meet Rosa Keelo at a location down the lane, the
householder at, apparently, the village showplace. Rosa's ground
floor is concrete, not ground, and she owns a rare TV set
(battery-run) to the great pleasure of her four kids. A pretty
mulberry bush decorates the earthen compound that is spotlessly
brushed.
</P>
<P>
   The Keelos are people of substance (meaning numerous cattle),
occupying three huts within their perimeter: a kitchen, one for the
kids, the other for the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope you can come back and spend more time,'' Rosa says as
her offspring beam at the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope you can come to Boston,'' says Aurelio, ``although
Boston drivers are scarier than the lions around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I wish I had time to get my hair braided by the
adroit coiffeuse, Isabel Muzamba
</P>
<P>
   But Aurelio says, ``Forget it. Please accept that you are on a
career bad hair trip.''

PATRIOTIC FUN ABOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not July 4 but next weekend Boston will hold an
all-American celebration almost equal to the Independence Day
holiday. Patriots Day weekend, April 15-17, celebrates the 225th
anniversary of the American Revolution, and more than 200,000
visitors are expected to be on hand to watch reenactments of the
shot heard round the world, Paul Revere's ride, and, of course, the
104th running of the Boston Marathon. What a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Only Massachusetts and Maine, once part of Massachusetts, mark
Patriots Day. It is a legal holiday in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   The reenactments include the battles with the redcoats on
Lexington Green. In Concord, there will be encampments of
Minutemen, and for the first time since 1775, the events of the
first day of the war for independence will be reenacted in
chronological order.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the celebration will be a weeklong Let Freedom Ring!
2000 program of tours, parades, and performances related to the
events of 1775. Along Boston's famed Freedom Trail, the Old North
Church will be the scene of a lantern service (it was from its
steeple that Revere watched for the signal, one if by land, two if
by sea), and performances of ``Paul Revere Tonight!'' On April 17 a
parade featuring the Ancient and Honorable Artillery (the nation's
oldest military organization) will begin at City Hall Plaza, and
along the trail there will be a Revolutionary Ramble, with costumed
guides. On April 17, runners from more than 51 countries will take
to the road from Hopkinton to Boston's Copley Square, a 26-mile
event that ranks behind only the Super Bowl as the largest
single-day sporting event in the world.
</P>
<P>
   For complete information on the celebration, as well as hotel
packages, call the Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau at

European steppes from the seventh to third centuries BC. These
marauders were patrons of lavish gold and silver objects. Many of
the items on view were only recently unearthed and are seen for the
first time outside Ukraine. For information, call 410-547-9000. The
exhibit will later travel to Los Angeles County Museum of Art July
2-Sept. 24; the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Oct. 29-Jan. 21, 2001;
Royal Ontario Museum, Feb. 18-April 29, 2001; the Nelson Atkins
Museum of Art, Kansas City, May 27-Aug. 11, 2001; and the Grand
Palais, Paris, Sept. 25-Dec. 31, 2001.

   The Houston Museum of Natural Science offers ``Kremlin Gold:
1,000 Years of Russian Gems and Jewels'' from April 15-Sept. 4.
More than 140 golden relics, jeweled masterpieces, and precious art
objects, many of which have never traveled beyond the Kremlin walls
since they were crafted centuries ago, will be on view. Items range
from the 4th to 12th centuries, pieces created in the Kremlin
workshops between the 13th and 18th centuries, a select number of
Faberge Imperial Easter Eggs crafted in St. Petersburg during the
19th century, and award-winning contemporary works from the last
half of the 20th century. For information, call 713-639-4629 or
visit www.hmns.org.

   Adding to the exhibit will be another called ``Gold: Highlights
from The Harvard University Collection,'' featuring many items
collected in California in the early 1850s. And, through Sept. 7,
the Wortham IMAX Theatre will feature ``Gold Fever,'' which looks
at cultures around the world and the significant roles gold plays
in these cultures. Gold has had a mystique going back 5,000 years.
It was the first metal used by humans. People have chased and
fought for it over the centuries, and it still remains an allure
today, said the film's director, David Lickley. &QL;

A FAMILY FUED, A POLARIZED CITY

<P>
   MIAMI _ Defiance has given way to disgusted resignation.
</P>
<P>
   After the surge of energy that followed the Miami-Dade mayor's
threat to disregard federal law 13 days ago, the reality has set in
that Elian Gonzalez's transfer back to his father _ and return to
Cuba _ is pretty much a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   For his supporters in the Cuban-American exile community here,
this comes as a bitter blow. Once again, they fear, Fidel Castro
will win. Once again, the patriarch in his seemingly endless autumn
is poised to have the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters held a model of Fidel wearing a bra outside the
Gonzalez family home Monday, but the grim attempt at humor did
little to dispel the gnawing, palpable frustration of the 100 or so
protesters at the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has steadily stepped up the heat since
Elian's Miami relatives walked out of negotiations last Thursday.
The US government's proclamations that the transfer of the
six-year-old boy back to his father, Juan Miguel, will definitely
happen has taken on new weight, coming as it does now not from
Robert Wallis, the head of the Miami office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, but from Janet Reno, the US attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, Elian's supporters have little to cling to. His claim
for asylum is weak, and his Miami family's claim to custody _ even
if that were an issue, which Reno insists it is not _ is even
weaker. Supporters continue to call on Juan Miguel to come to Miami
so this can be settled ``as a family,'' but why should a father
have to negotiate with long-lost relatives for his own son?
</P>
<P>
   They are a family with irreconcilable differences, as this is a
city whose views of this crisis are far apart.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami Herald/NBC poll published Sunday confirmed the strong
sense that the matter of Elian has polarized Miami. While
Cuban-Americans opposed the boy's return to Cuba by a margin of 83
percent to 9 percent, every other ethnic group, including other
Hispanics, overwhelmingly supported it.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the gulf is unusual, even for an issue involving
Cuba. Rob Schroth, who conducted the poll, was quoted in the Herald
stating that the gap was the largest he had seen in 20 years of
polling Miami-Dade County, truly a tale of two cities.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to the transfer appears to be crumbling for
several reasons, but one of them is the failure of its leaders to
persuasively make their case to the world. The world, they say,
simply does not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand our pain,'' said Victor Silva. ``I came
to the United States in 1961 when I was seven years old and I've
seen that pain in my own family. I was Elian back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he admitted that the large-scale civil disobedience promised
a few days ago seems increasingly unlikely. ``We are a law-abiding
people,'' he said. ``We march, we walk, but we'll obey the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Disbelief that Juan Miguel is speaking for himself remains
strong. He must be a puppet, people here say. He has no choice but
to do Castro's bidding, both for his own sake and that of his
family on the island. It is simply inconceivable to many exiles
here that he would choose a life under Castro for his son over
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The unhealed wounds of exile are never far from the surface in
Miami. Cuban-Americans are a wildly successful immigrant group, an
American success story. They have remade Miami, a city so different
from the one I was born in that it amounts to a different town. Yet
the big prize _ the end of Fidel, the family reunion _ remains
maddeningly elusive. Even their neighbors are puzzled that they
still care, but, then, it isn't their fight.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that this is at heart a family feud, and that
is true. But it is not just a feud of the Gonzalez klan. A much
larger extended family _ separated by 90 miles, 41 years, and
irreconcilable notions of government and liberty _ is finding that
reunion is impossible, at least for now.

WHEN IDIOMS STOP MAKING SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can use an everyday idiom for years, and suddenly, one day,
the words look absurd: What does it mean to egg on someone who's
spoiling for a fight? Or maybe you're a fan of professional
verbivore Richard Lederer, who makes a specialty of finding
``contradictions'' in the language: ``How can blunt speech and
sharp speech be the same?'' he asks in ``Crazy English.'' And don't
take that nonstop flight, warns Lederer: ``You'll never get down.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect stranger and broad daylight had Heidi Berger's mother
wondering _ and, writes Berger, ``I had to agree with her they made
no logical sense. Can you enlighten us as to how they came about?''
</P>
<P>
   No problem, to use a more recent catchphrase. Berger's
expressions aren't especially opaque, as idioms go _ in fact,
perfect stranger is in my desk dictionary, illustrating the use of
perfect to mean ``pure, utter, sheer, absolute.'' The reason you
can talk perfect nonsense or have a perfectly awful time is that
perfect comes from the Latin for ``to finish''; its first sense is
completeness rather than goodness.
</P>
<P>
   Broad daylight is also in current dictionaries, with broad
meaning ``extending all about, full''; this may be the only common
phrase with exactly that sense, but it's no more of a stretch than
other figurative uses of the word _ a broad hint, a broad view.
</P>
<P>
   But English offers plenty of idioms that are more obscure.
What's a square meal? Why is a sticky situation a pickle, or even a
pretty pickle? Hot under the collar is obvious _ it would translate
into any language whose speakers wear tailored shirts. But easy as
taking candy from a baby? Clearly coined by someone not familiar
with your typical baby's grip strength. When you make no bones
about it, what are dem bones? And what does a corn dodger dodge?
</P>
<P>
   Other languages have weird idioms too, of course. Peter
Sokolowski, who edits French books for Merriam-Webster, offers the
example il n'y en a pas 36 _ which means ``there aren't many of
them,'' but translates literally as ``there aren't 36.'' Why 36?
Qui sait?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes idioms can be tracked to their origins, but caution is
recommended. Whenever an expression is no longer transparent, folk
etymologies spring up to explain it: Witness the wide circulation
on the Internet of ``Life in the 1500s,'' a collection of spurious
derivations for both unexplained phrases, like raining cats and
dogs, and quite traceable ones, like dead ringer and saved by the
bell.
</P>
<P>
   Even reputable sources can disagree _ which means someone's
leading you astray. Take (up) to the nines, meaning ``to
perfection,'' which we now use almost exclusively in dressed to the
nines. Penguin's Dictionary of English Idioms (1994) says it's ``a
corruption of medieval English `to the eyne' _ `to the eyes,'
meaning from head to foot.'' Sounds perfectly plausible,
considering such similar constructions as armed to the teeth, up to
my eyeballs in work, a lady to her fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms (1997) says the
original meaning has been lost _ and opines that it probably
``alludes to the fact that nine, the highest single-digit numeral,
stands for `best.' '' (Or did, before the movie ``10'' made that
number the synonym for perfection.)
</P>
<P>
   Penguin says cut no ice, meaning ``have no influence,'' refers
to a skate blade cutting into ice; American Heritage traces it to
the days of iceboxes, when the iceman would saw off a chunk for
each customer. They can't both be right _ so check carefully before
you start telling your friends what idioms ``really'' mean.
</P>
<P>
   Derivations are a secondary issue, though, as long as we all
agree on what the expressions mean now. Objecting to them on
grounds of ``logic'' simply misunderstands the nature of language:
All these symbols are arbitrary (why call a shoe a shoe, or a
lentil a lentil?), and we constantly use combinations of words that
can't be reduced to their literal meanings: He went ballistic, I've
got to knuckle down, she gets my goat. Exploring the origins of
``crazy English'' can be fun, but don't get sidetracked by the
notion that idiomatic language ``doesn't make sense.'' To sensible
people, it's perfectly clear.

 UNDATED: ... own resume.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the embellishments were unearthed at the time, but
attracted little attention because Gore's 1988 campaign proved a
hapless effort.
</P>
<P>
   The aides in 1988 who warned Gore about sticking to the facts
had plenty to worry about: Gore's claim that he grew up in
Carthage, Tenn., when he was reared in a Washington hotel suite;
his exaggeration of his farming background; his statements, later
debunked, that he had been under fire in Vietnam and that his
investigative reporting at the Tennessean in Nashville in the 1970s
had sent people to jail; his claim to have been schooled in rural
Tennessee and urban Washington, when he was educated at an elite
private school in the capital; and his insistence that he had been
a homebuilder and small businessman when he had minimal involvement
in a small Tennessee subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Gore reasserted his claim to have been a developer
and small businessman. And, starting in 1994, Gore has added two
years to his journalistic experience, upping the figure from the
five years he once claimed to seven.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1988 ad, Gore claimed to have been a ``brilliant
student,'' but that has been contradicted by Turque's biography.
Gore's transcripts show that his high school and college grades
were predominantly B's and C's. The same campaign ad also said Gore
``refused any special treatment'' when he joined the Army for two
years and went to Vietnam, where he spent five months. Yet Turque
discovered evidence that General William C. Westmoreland played
some role in Gore's enlistment. And when Gore arrived in Vietnam,
Turque reports, his commanding officer issued instructions that
Gore be kept away from danger.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway, Gore's spokesman, said that if there was any
preferential treatment, Gore was unaware of it. ``The fact is,''
Hattaway said, ``everyone in Vietnam was in danger. And Al Gore
served in Vietnam, when a lot of people were doing their best to
avoid it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaigns in 1984 and 1988, Gore awarded himself credit
for national policy accomplishments that a junior member of the
House or Senate could only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore immersed himself in the nuclear arms debate,
becoming one of a number of House moderates whose support was
coveted by the Reagan administration. The Democrats, led by
Representative Les Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn, and backed by Gore,
wanted a less destabilizing option than the multiple-warhead MX
missile. Their plan, ultimately shelved by the White House, called
for the single-warhead Midgetman missile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Gore ran for the Senate in 1984, one TV ad proclaimed,
``He wrote the bipartisan plan on arms control that US negotiators
will take to the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a vast overstatement. He had nothing to do with what
we proposed to the Soviets,'' Kenneth Adelman, who was the director
of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said in an
interview. Adelman's view is supported by the two biographies, and
by contemporaneous news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   When he ran for president four years later, Gore aired
television ads showing him shaking hands with Gorbachev. And he
told audiences that he had met with the Soviet leader. But Gore's
only ``meeting'' with Gorbachev took place when the two men shook
hands during a luncheon Gorbachev had with 26 members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And further seeking to highlight his national security
credentials in that race, Gore visited the naval base in Norfolk,
Va. in February 1988 to chastise his Democratic primary opponents
for opposing funds to build new aircraft carriers. As for himself,
Gore said, ``I would stand for a strong America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore neglected to mention that he had voted in the Senate
against the funding for carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In two other campaign ads in 1988, Gore awarded himself credit
for the landmark 1980 Superfund legislation, saying he ``led the
fight to clean up toxic waste'' and was the ``author of a tough
Superfund law to protect the environment and crack down on toxic
polluters.'' But someone else was the author. Gore played only a
supporting role as one of 42 House co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco is another issue where Gore's statements have been open
to question. Despite his assertions, repeated this year, that he
worked for tougher restrictions against tobacco, Gore was a
reliable vote for tobacco interests while he was in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an emotional speech at the 1996 Democratic National
Convention in Chicago that biographers like Turque and Zelnick find
even more troubling. In it, Gore recounted his sister's death from
lung cancer, caused by cigarettes she began smoking at age 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow morning, another 13-year-old girl will start smoking.
I love her, too,'' Gore declared, bringing tears to the eyes of
many listeners. ``Three thousand young people in America will start
smoking tomorrow. One thousand of them will die a death not unlike
my sister's. And that is why until I draw my last breath, I will
pour my heart and soul into the cause of protecting our children
from the dangers of smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Gore was accused of hypocritically exploiting his
sister's death for political gain. The reason: For seven years
after his sister died, Gore remained an ally of big tobacco and
accepted both tobacco campaign contributions and federal subsidies
for the tobacco grown on his farm.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of lingering questions about his tendency to
embellish, the vice president nevertheless misstated his own record
and distorted Bradley's at several critical junctures in the last
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson, the University of Pennsylvania scholar, said this
year's most egregious example of Gore's willingness to stretch the
truth was his continued repetition of the charge that Bradley had
opposed flood relief for midwestern farmers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   During a Jan. 9 debate in Des Moines, Gore chastised Bradley for
opposing flood aid. The attack had been choreographed in advance:
Gore asked a local farmer hurt by the floods to stand for dramatic
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Gore unveiled television advertisements in which
Iowa Senator Tom Harkin touted Gore as ``the only Democratic
candidate for president who helped make sure that Iowa got the help
we desperately needed after those floods.''
</P>
<P>
   Caught off guard in debate, Bradley failed to respond. But Gore
was widely criticized when details of the flood votes emerged,
showing that Bradley had voted for $4.8 billion in Midwest flood
relief and opposed only an amendment to add $900 million more. Even
the White House opposed the amendment until the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   Under criticism, the Gore campaign briefly stopped running the
ad. But on the weekend before Iowa's caucus, it reappeared on Iowa
airwaves. Bradley was badly drubbed in Iowa, sending him into a
tailspin from which he never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Zelnick, who now teaches at Boston University, called
the disaster relief accusation a ``premeditated falsehood.'' That
incident, Zelnick said in an interview, ``was far different from
speaking off the cuff and having an irresistible impulse to
embellish. The farmer was a total plant, and the assertion
misrepresented Bill Bradley's position. It is and should be a
subject of concern for voters.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Family members get praise &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just his own life story and record that Gore has
selectively rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Since his father died 16 months ago, the vice president has
described the elder Gore in several speeches, including one last
April before an NAACP audience, as an early champion for civil
rights during his three Senate terms from 1953 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halfway through this century,'' Gore said, in declaring his
candidacy last June, ``when my father saw that thousands of his
fellow Tennesseans were forced to obey Jim Crow laws, he knew
America could do better. He saw a horizon in which his black and
white constituents shared the same hopes in the same world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a moving tribute, but with a notable omission: The elder
Gore voted against the landmark civil rights legislation of his
time, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which repudiated the Jim Crow
laws.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Albert Gore Sr. stood out among Southern Democrats
in the Senate. He refused to support the Southern Manifesto in the
1950s, supported the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and voted against two
Supreme Court nominees who opposed civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   `Those brave stands probably cost him his career,'' Gore told
the NAACP audience in Detroit last April 25.
</P>
<P>
   But historians and the elder Gore have attributed his 1970
defeat mostly to his opposition to the Vietnam War. Before other
audiences, Gore has cited the war as the issue that cost his father
his Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   And, during his lifetime, the elder Gore made no claims to match
his son's recent recollections. Late in his life, he said he
regretted his vote against the 1964 measure. In his memoirs, he
said he was ``no white knight'' on civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway played down the contrast between Gore's claims and his
father's record, noting that many civil rights leaders have praised
Gore's father's record.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Gore Hunger, who was 10 years older than her brother,
worked as a paid staff aide at Peace Corps headquarters from early
1961, when the agency was founded, until 1964, according to Peace
Corps records and several friends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore, in a 1992 appearance on C-SPAN, called his sister
``the very first volunteer for the Peace Corps.'' In 1994, when the
University of Tennessee at Knoxville established a chair in her
name, Gore said: ``She was the very first volunteer in the Peace
Corps. She did so much for so many.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Gore addressed a meeting of Peace Corps officials,
for whom the ``volunteer'' label has special meaning, he did not
describe her as a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Coates Redmon, author of a book about the Peace Corps and a
Peace Corps colleague of Nancy Gore Hunger's, said the agency's
first volunteers have always been afforded special status.
</P>
<P>
   For the vice president to describe his sister that way, Redmon
said, ``amounts to stretching the truth.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Vt. _ Three years ago, with an address written down
on a slip of paper, 65-year-old Randy Boardman drove out of the
hills and 120 miles north into Canada to buy the tiny pink pills
his doctor had prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, he took his skeptical friend Doug, whose derision
had given way to desperation under the pressure of his
out-of-pocket yearly drug bill of $4,500. By that evening, when
they crossed back across the border, Canada's price controls had
saved them $1,260.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, solitary journeys like Boardman's began to take on
the look of a movement: From a senior center in Burlington, 30
elderly Vermonters climbed onto a chartered bus and were served
doughnuts by a congressman, independent US Representative Bernie
Sanders of Burlington. Now Sanders is taking his support to a new
level, launching an Internet campaign advertising bargains to be
had in Canada. Three Vermont senior centers are organizing regular
bus trips, as are groups in Montana, Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota
and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly New Englanders taking their business north of the
45th parallel would not describe themselves as radical. But from
the standpoint of Washington, the trips are part of a rumbling
message of protest. Politicians like Sanders _ who says the issue
arouses more anger than any he has encountered in his political
career _ hope to ``embarrass the US Congress'' into controlling
prices on prescription drugs for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   And the powerful pharmaceutical industry has responded by
blitzing the border states with a dire warning: That price controls
would drastically slow drug research and usher in the worst flaws
of socialized medicine. The real medical exodus runs southward, the
advertisements argue, with hundreds of thousands of Canadians
crossing the border every year for superior treatment in American
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   For 64-year-old Maurice Brown, who has voted Republican all his
life and signed up for ``Bernie's bus,'' politics hardly seem
relevant: He would back any politician who promised to tackle drug
prices. Brown's alternative cost-cutting strategy is to stop taking
all four of his heart and respiratory prescriptions toward the end
of the year, when the $2,500 allotted by his health insurer runs
out, and staying away from dangerous activity, like shoveling his
driveway, until Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not rabble-rousing people,'' said Chip Castle,
director of the Central Vermont Senior Center. ``I think in some
ways they feel they're betraying their own doctor. It's pretty
weird at this point in their lives they have to hop on a bus and go
to Montreal to buy pills.''
</P>
<P>
   As pressure to lessen the burden of drug prices on senior
citizens _ who make up 12 percent of the US population, yet shell
out 30 percent of drug expenditures _ has built to a high pitch in
Washington, few politicians have more relentlessly fingered the
pharmaceutical companies than Sanders. He has sponsored legislation
that would allow pharmacists in the United States to reimport
medicines from their counterparts in Canada, dramatically forcing
prices down by integrating the country's markets. Canadian retail
prices are 30 to 80 percent lower because Canada offers universal
health care, so the state purchasing agent has more power to demand
lower prices than individual HMOs would, said David Sirota, a
Sanders spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the pharmaceutical companies _ which support
resolving the problem by increasing Medicare coverage _ began
fighting back with TV and radio advertisements making the case that
the American health care system is far preferable to the Canadian
one. At risk, if Sanders succeeds, is America's top-flight research
and development, the best possible medication, and access to
life-saving cancer treatments, argue the advertisements and a Web
site, http://www.busfromcanada.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just cherry-pick what you want when it's part and
parcel of a whole system,'' said Tim Ryan, executive director of
Citizens for Better Medicare. ``You have to understand the downside
of government controls of these prices.''
</P>
<P>
   On the red-brick main street of a border town like Bedford,
Quebec, comparing the two health care systems is a matter of
everyday commerce, especially when the exchange rate is
particularly favorable: Americans show up to get their cavities
filled, or buy dentures, or _ more and more often _ walk into
Jacques Bouchard's pharmacy with a brand-new prescription from a
Canadian doctor, which they need in order to buy the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, one of Bouchard's relatives, who has breast
cancer, was just referred to a hospital in Burlington for radiation
treatments, because the wait in Montreal would be too long. All
things considered, Bouchard said, shrugging, both the American and
Canadian health care systems have their flaws.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of drug price control said comparing our system
with Canada's is missing the point, and call the industry's
campaign a scare tactic. Per capita health care spending in Canada
is half what it is in America, and that explains scarcity and long
waits, said Alan Sager, a Boston University professor who and has
testified before Congress in support of price controls. In fact,
Sager said, if Americans could afford medications, it would shrink
hospital deficits, because they would better regulate their own
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has responded to the advertisements with his own Web
site, http://www.bernie.house.gov/bustocanada, which lists the
price of prescription drugs in the United States and Canada, based
on his own comparative shopping visits north.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the pharmaceutical industry is doing is a vulgar way to
deflect attention from the real issue,'' Sanders said. ``The debate
about the Canadian and American health care systems is a very
interesting issue, but that is not what this is about.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, says Sanders, are the dangerous medical
decisions seniors are making under pressure. Castle said that, in
one case that came up at the Central Vermont Council on Aging, a
couple did it this way: The wife took her prescription for one
month, and then the husband took his prescription for one month.
There were similar stories among on Sanders' bus:
</P>
<P>
   Phil and Phyllis Atwood, who live in South Burlington and are
both 70, can't quit their jobs; Lucille Danyow of St. Albans, who
is 78, slices her pills in half so her supply will last longer. And
Maurice Brown just stops taking his medications and tries not to do
anything that might bring on a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like these eat at 68-year-old Boardman, a retired
bulldozer operator who drinks out of a ``Good Morning, Grumpy'' mug
and routinely refers to his sister-in-law as ``General Patton.''
When Boardman retired, seven years ago, he had never taken a pill
except aspirin. It came as a surprise to discover he needed to
spend $1,241 every year to lower his cholesterol. He'll make the
drive, but it doesn't sit right with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, this nation, as rich as it is,'' he said. ``Why should I
have to leave it to buy medicine?''

&HT;     INTERNET SECURITY CENTER OPENING IN SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Equinix Inc., of San Jose, is opening the
Silicon Valley's first high-security Internet Business Exchange
(IBX), a Fort Knox-like complex that will house some of the
heavy-duty equipment that makes the Net click.
</P>
<P>
   The complex should make the Internet safer and faster for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Security features include biometric hand-scanners at the
entrance, a security ``man-trap'' device to retain uninvited
guests, perimeter alarms that operate with infrared laser
technologies and Kevlar-coated walls to prevent penetration of
artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   Equinix will not release the location of the site, saying only
that it is in the ``greater San Jose area.'' Visitors have been
blindfolded for the drive to the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Equinix and Bechtel Corp. announced in November an agreement to
build 35 of these hubs around the world in a $1.2 billion
partnership intended to bring stability and security to Internet
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley's IBX is the third such structure built,
joining facilities in Washington, D.C., and New Jersey, both of
which opened for business in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more businesses and individuals rely upon the
Internet for e-mail, information and e-commerce transactions, the
companies that power the Internet are demanding ... reliability and
security,'' Al Avery, the president and chief executive of Equinix,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will rent space in the IBX facility and use it to
manage their Internet traffic. The building will be stacked with
servers, routers and switches.
</P>
<P>
   Each company will rent a separate ``cage'' to store the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To date, telephone companies and universities have borne the
brunt of that kind of service, renting their internal machinery to
e-commerce companies and Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Equinix believes it is poised to capitalize on the burgeoning
growth of the Internet and Internet service providers, or ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we existed, the only infrastructure that was out there
were network access points, or NAPs,'' said Jay Adelson, chief
technology officer and founder of Equinix. ``These were
network-only hubs, where ISPs connected their networks together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually existed in old telecom buildings that had little
or no security, and were mostly operating at full capacity for
years. They were not designed for the e-commerce explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Equinix, a privately held company that plans to go public,
boasts an impressive list of investors, including Cisco Systems,
Benchmark Capital, America Online, ETrade, Dell Computers,
Microsoft, Reuters and EPartners, a division of Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great about Equinix is that it's a private, new network
access point,'' said Jeanne Schaaf, an analyst at Forrester
Research. ``The old NAPs were all congested and slowed traffic
considerably. Equinix will make life better for most of us.''

HOYTS KEEP ROLLING AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At first, no one knew what to make of them.
</P>
<P>
   When the Boston Athletic Association was approached in 1980 by a
40-year-old man from Holland, Mass., asking to enter the Boston
Marathon as the ``arms and legs'' for his wheelchair-bound son, who
had been born with cerebal palsy, the governing body balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something brand new,'' said Dick Hoyt, now 59, and five
years retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard.
``Nobody had ever seen anything like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   While the BAA was not exactly receptive to the notion of a
father pushing his son in a tri-wheeled carriage over the famed
course, ``They were never rude or nasty to us,'' Hoyt was quick to
point out.
</P>
<P>
   The BAA politely denied the request for an official number and
told Hoyt that if wanted to be officially recognized, he would have
to qualify just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all Hoyt ever wanted for his son _ to be treated just
like everyone else, and not as someone who should be
institutionalized and forgotten, as one doctor callously suggested
to Dick and Judy Hoyt shortly after the difficult birth.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hoyts took Rick home, they began a lifelong quest to
help him fit in the mainstream. They soon discovered that their
love and devotion would help their son break down the barriers that
have impeded others like him. They set his spirit free by allowing
him to realize the pure joy of competition as a disabled marathoner
and triathlete _ with a little help from Dad, of course.
</P>
<P>
   So after two years of unofficial entries, the Hoyts qualified
for Boston in 1983 with a time of 2:45:23 in the People's Marathon
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that I'm just lending Rick my arms and my
legs,'' Dick said. ``He's the one with the heart. He's the one with
the engine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cold stares, the colder remarks, and other the obstacles of
exclusion have been overcome. Hoyt and his 38-year-old son are now
warmly embraced by organizers and fans as fixtures in the Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it wouldn't be the same without them,'' said Rob Hoyt,
the middle brother, who will turn 36 on race day Monday. ``I think
they have opened the door for a lot of physically challenged
athletes to be able to be in competition with mainstream
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Who does not know of Team Hoyt by now? Who among the legion of
Boston Marathon fans has not been moved by the sight of Dick, his
legs churning and burning, pushing Rick? When they compete, the
Hoyts are swept along by a wave of adulation that, Dick said,
``lifts you up and makes you feel like you're running on air.'' The
cheering, he said, ``leaves our ears ringing for two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoyts have become an integral part of the annual trek from
Hopkinton to Boston, woven into the fabric of the race's rich
tapestry of competitors like Joan Benoit Samuelson, Bill Rodgers,
and Johnny Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hoyts take their customary starting spot Monday, just
behind the wheelchair athletes, it will mark their 20th Boston race
and 60th marathon overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've been a source of both pride and inspiration
for those who've enjoyed the Marathon for the last 20 years,'' said
race director Guy Morse. ``They've come to symbolize hope and
inclusion, which is what we've strived for here in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has marveled at Rick's enthusiasm for the race and
everybody has marveled at Dick's record of athletic achievement in
Boston. He actually qualifies for the race. It's quite an
accomplishment and I think the Boston community is aware of the
level of his accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rick's tidy Brookline apartment, where he lives on his own
with the aid of a personal care assistant, a living room wall is
festooned with ribbons, medals, banners, plaques, and posters. On
the opposite wall is a floor-to-ceiling quilt made from a
goose-down comforter sewn with T-shirts from the many events the
Hoyts have competed in all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   There is a framed photograph of the Hoyts with Ronald Reagan
during a 1989 visit to the former president's home in California,
and another with Dave Cowens and Cam Neely at a black-tie gala for
the New England Sports Museum. They are cherished mementos of their
racing career, of a father's devotion to his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty wild,'' said Russ, 32, the youngest of the Hoyt
sons. ``But it's definitely not surprising that they've gotten into
it the way they have, knowing my dad and how he dedicated he is.
What's been amazing is all the respect and recognition they've
gotten from people all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rick, a 1993 Boston University graduate, works as a computer
consultant at Boston College's Campus School, where he helps
develop computer programs for disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Though unable to speak, Rick communicates with the assistance of
a computer designed in 1974 by Tufts University that was paid for
with $5,000 the Hoyts cobbled together from tag sales, dinner
dances, and various fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   When the computer was hooked up, Rick's parents eagerly waited
their son's first words _ joking among themselves that they would
be ``Hi, Mom!'' or ``Hi, Dad! _ but they broke up in laughter when
the computer's digitized voice uttered, ``Go Bruins!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bruins were playing for the Stanley Cup at the time,''
Dick said. ``And he was a big fan.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day of this interview, the computer was inoperable, but
Rick was not deterred from exulting in the memories of the 20
Boston Marathons he has experienced with his father. Dick
deciphered his son's subtle facial movements and head bobs, but
when Rick was asked if passing through the BU campus near Kenmore
Square still ranked as his favorite part of the route, no
translation was needed for the broad smile that creased his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a personality, without a doubt,'' said brother Rob. ``The
ability for Rick to smile like that, considering his life
situation, is certainly an inspiration to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same expression Rick wore when he and his father
crossed the finish line of their first race _ ``next to last, but
not last,'' Dick joked _ a charity 10K for a Westfield State
lacrosse player who had been paralyzed in an auto accident.
Unbeknownst to many, it was Rick's idea to enter the race, and some
criticized the elder Hoyt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly they were from other families who had children with
disabilities,'' Dick said. ``We got a lot of phone calls. There
were a lot of people upset with me who said, `What are you doing
dragging that poor kid out there? He's disabled.' But Rick's been
mainstreamed all of his life, and he's been included and that's the
way we feel it should be. The big thing right now is going around
and educating people that that's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, Dick recalled, ``I was the one who felt
handicapped. I couldn't move. I was so sore all over.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoyt was soom uplifted and ready for more when Rick
delivered this message via his computer: ``Dad, when we're running,
I feel like I'm not even handicapped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew we had found a sport for him to participate
in,'' Dick said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At first, Rick's younger brothers, particularly Rob, struggled
with the attention he got.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob had a hard time with it,'' Dick said. ``Rob was the middle
one. He's 35 now, but back then he couldn't understand why we had
to spend so much time with Rick, but at least Russ had Rob, so it
wasn't so difficult for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rob, ``I just felt, at an earlier age, that I had a lot of
responsibility put on me. I felt like his babysitter, but as I
progressed with my ability, Rick's disability became more apparent
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As they grew to become gifted athletes at Westfield High _ Rob
was captain of the swim team and an all-state selection, and Russ
was a three-sport star who excelled as captain of the wrestling
team, going undefeated and winning all-state recognition his senior
year _ they could count on their older brother to be in the stands
at every meet or game.
</P>
<P>
   Now the roles are reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it now that we have a chance to give back to him by
being there for him and my father,'' said Russ, who, along with
Rob, was the support staff for Team Hoyt's two Ironman Triathlon
appearances in Hawaii, assisting in the transitions from swim gear
to bike equipment to marathon chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had races where they've gotten lost, gone a couple of
miles off track and still wound up not finishing last,'' Russ said.
``They've had their share of flat tires, and there was the time
when they were running their first triathlon together, and dad was
pulling Rick on a tow-cart in the bike portion of the race. It
accidentally tipped over and Rick fell and got a little road rash
from that. They've had their ups and downs, but they've had more
ups than downs.''
</P>
<P>
   One particular high came at Russ's expense in his first
triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 18 at the time and I had been a competitive swimmer, but
I hadn't done anything to train,'' Russ recalled. ``I mean, I was
18 and I felt invincible, as most 18-year-olds do.''
</P>
<P>
   He felt even more so when he shaved three minutes off his
father's and brother's five-minute headstart in the swim portion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I passed them about 2 miles into the bike race,'' Russ
said. ``When I went by them, I told them I'd be waiting for them at
the finish line, sitting under a shady tree, having a cold one.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a 30-minute lead into a 5.7-mile run, but there was one
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got off the bike, I was cooked. I was finished,'' Russ
said with a laugh. ``About 5 miles into it, I remember hearing the
whum-whum-whum of the wheels on Rick's chair as it came from behind
me. As they went by, I looked over and I could see Rick going
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rob, ``I've heard other runners talk about how you can
always hear the Hoyts coming from behind, because you hear Dad's
plodding feet. It's like a locomotion train going right by you. You
can almost feel the breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene that will likely be played out again Monday. There
are no signs of Team Hoyt slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're planning to go to Germany for a triathlon, then
they're talking to people about going back to Hawaii for the
Ironman,'' Rob said. ``There's Boston, which is a must, and then
there's the Marine Corps Marathon. So that's two triathlons, two
marathons, plus they also like to do the Falmouth Road Race. Then
when the weather warms up, they do the smaller sprint triathlons
every other weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't know how it's going to end,'' Rob said. ``With Dad
turning 60 in June, I'd think there'd certainly be a limitation,
but he's very fit for a man his age. I don't know if they'll fade
out or what. I know they're going to be remembered, but I don't
know what's going to happen. That part of the story hasn't been
written yet.''
</P>
<P>
   How many more Bostons can they do? Can they keep up their hectic
pace for another 10 years? Another 20?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Dick said. ``With this one, we'll have done
more consecutive marathons than anyone in the field. If I feel like
I do right now, I don't see why we should stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning to his son, Dick said, ``What do you think, Rick?
Think I'll be able to do this when I'm 80? Think we can go for
Johnny Kelley's record?''
</P>
<P>
   Rick registered his enthusiastic approval with another broad
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Dick said. ``Why not?''

SOME PEOPLE IN GRAHAM THINK THE TOWN OUGHT TO BE IN PICTURES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once you get beyond the stacks of rusted oil-well equipment,
Graham blossoms into a picturesque town. And now some members of
the community think that picture ought to be on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Graham's Main Street Motion Picture
Committee is holding a special event intended to heighten
Hollywood's recognition of the North Texas city. That shouldn't be
difficult, because Hollywood has heretofore never recognized
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has invited Earl Bellamy, a motion picture
director, to take a look at the town and lend his advice. Graham
wants to know what it has to do to draw movie crews. It wants to be
a movie location.
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy has directed movies and television shows. His TV credits
include ``MASH,'' ``The Andy Griffith Show,'' ``Get Smart,'' ``The
Love Boat'' and ``Fantasy Island.'' His movies include ``Seven
Alone'' and ``Fluffy.''
</P>
<P>
   The later stars Tony Randall and Shirley Jones. It is a film
about a college professor who believes that all animals can be
domesticated, even a lion. The film will be shown Wednesday night
at the National Theatre on the town square's west side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Joyer brought us the idea of drawing movies here,'' said
Claire Spivey, executive director of the Graham Chamber of
Commerce. ``Joe is in the oil business here in Graham, but his
father was a director in Hollywood, and he knew Mr. Bellamy.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivey said that once the idea of movies was raised, several
people in the community began to consider the possibility
seriously. Tickets to Wednesday night's meeting with Bellamy have
sold quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that two of Bellamy's friends also will be on
hand _ Dale Robertson and Dean Smith. Robertson, some people will
remember, was agent Jim Hardie in ``Tales of Wells Fargo''; Smith
began his career as a stuntman and as an actor appeared in the John
Wayne movies ``Big Jake,'' ``Rio Lobo'' and ``El Dorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is originally from Breckenridge, and he attended school in
Graham. He, too, has offered to help the town find its way into the
movie business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think our community is unique,'' Spivey said. ``We
have the largest town square in America. We have a fort near here.
We could use a new industry, the new revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham has what amounts to two town squares placed together. On
one side rests the Young County Courthouse; on the other sits an
American Legion post, the Sheriff's Department and an old post
office that is now a museum and art center.
</P>
<P>
   The fort is Fort Belknap, established in 1851 as the
northernmost of a chain of forts from the Red River to the Rio
Grade that protected Texas against hostile Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the other forts, Belknap hasn't been fully
restored, and it needs a little work if it is to ever serve as a
movie set. ``I believe it could be used,'' Spivey said, ``but it is
one of the forts that probably needs a little more attention. It
doesn't have the barracks-style setup like Fort Concho in San
Angelo.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Graham does sit in a beautifully preserved part of the
state. Long, rolling hills filled with mesquite, cedar and post oak
surround the city. Development has been held to the nearby
oilfields, where low-profile pump jacks are hidden behind trees and
rocks. Only an occasional power line ruins the open horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly recognize that there are a lot of beautiful parts
of Texas,'' Spivey said. ``But we believe ours is unique too, and
we hope to create an interest in it.''

   (``The Runner.'' By Christopher Reich. Delacorte. $26.95. 448
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Reich's terrific debut thriller, ``Numbered
Account,'' was on the New York Times bestseller list for 11 weeks.
His post-World War II thriller, ``The Runner,'' should do even
better.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin Parnell Judge had spent the war working in the U.S.
Attorney's office in New York. Now he is in Paris as a member of
the International Military Tribunal, which will try Nazi leaders
for war crimes. Judge has a personal reason for being on the
tribunal. On Dec. 17, 1944, 113 Americans surrendered to a German
tank column at Malmedy, Belgium. They were disarmed and herded into
a field, where the Germans opened fire. Then two SS officers went
into the field and ``administered the coup de grace as necessary.''
Seventy-three were killed and 40 escaped by running into the nearby
woods or playing dead. Among the dead was Judge's brother, Francis
Xavier Judge, a chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Devlin Judge tracks down a German report that names
the SS officer who gave the order to fire, Major Erich Seyss, known
as Germany's White Lion, the runner who was expected to defeat
Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics. Then Judge learns that Seyss has
just escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Bavaria. He gets
permission to go to Gen. George Patton's headquarters in Bavaria
and lead the hunt for Seyss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Runner'' is an intriguingly crafted cat-and-mouse hunt
that takes Judge and his prey from Bavaria to Berlin and back to
Patton's headquarters. The intensity of the chase is fueled by
realistic dialogue and well-drawn characters. Move over, Jack
Higgins and Robert Ludlum, Reich has grabbed hold of your genre and
made it sing.

   (``Half Moon Street.'' By Anne Perry. Ballantine. $25. 311
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Anne Perry's latest Victorian mystery featuring Bow Street
Superintendent Thomas Pitt has a lost feel to it. Something key is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, Pitt is called to the banks of the Thames to
inspect the body of a male murder victim found drifting in a punt.
The victim's hands and feet have been chained to the sides of the
punt, he is wearing a torn green dress and flowers are strewn
around the body.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering that a French diplomat has been reported missing,
Pitt sends a constable to the French Embassy in London to request
that someone come to take a look at the body. The envoy says the
victim is not the missing diplomat, so now Pitt has two cases to
solve.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt's investigation will lead him to a photography club and a
very bohemian actress. And throughout the investigation, Pitt seems
a lost soul because his wife, Charlotte, and his children are away
on holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's absence clearly hurts ``Half Moon Street'' because
in all the previous books in the series, Charlotte's involvement in
his investigations added greatly to the stories. There is nothing
wrong with the plot, the dialogue or the pacing. But it desperately
needs the warmth that Charlotte has given to the series.

   (``Blind Instinct.'' By Robert W. Walker. Berkley Books. $21.95.
369 pages.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are a fan of Patricia Cornwell's series featuring Dr.
Kate Scarpetta, you will enjoy ``Blind Instinct,'' whose
protagonist is Dr. Jessica Coran, the FBI's top forensic
pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   Working at the Behavioral Science Unit at Quantico, Va., Coran
is awaiting the shipment of the body of a man who had been
viciously attacked and killed by a pack of rabid dogs. He carried
no identification. His entire body is covered in tattoos. If they
can find the artist, they can learn the victim's identity, then
figure out who wanted him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Before the body arrives, she receives a call from Inspector
Richard Sharpe of New Scotland Yard asking what she knew about
murder by crucifixion. Sharpe says he and his colleague believe an
unidentified woman died of the wounds she received when she was
nailed to a cross. ``Then you are already wrong,'' Coran tells
Sharpe. ``If she hung from the cross for any length of time, and
from the sound of her wounds _ I've heard talk over the Internet
about the case, and the gaps where gravity did its work around the
spike  &Cx1f; _ then I must say she died of asphyxiation, not her
crucifixion wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, Sharpe shows up at Quantico and says there
are now two more victims. He requests that Coran go to London to
help in the investigation of the crucifixion murders. Her superiors
agree, and she flies to London to help develop a profile that will
help track down the killer. Meanwhile, she stays in touch with her
aides at Quantico and continues to work on the case of the tattooed
man.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Walker deftly handles the two investigations. Coran
and Sharpe are both very likable and believable characters. The
murders are ingenious. Well-paced, ``Blind Instinct'' is worthy of
the bestseller list.

STORM PROVES LOVE HASN'T GONE OUT OF STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the ferocious storm that tore through the
Metroplex recently, many heartwarming stories of courage and
compassion have emerged. I have seen numerous media stories
detailing the heroic acts of men and women who risked life and limb
to protect their families.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to know that love has not gone out of style.
</P>
<P>
   In my own neighborhood, I personally witnessed an act of bravery
that I think deserves a Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the storm, I was in bed using an adding machine
to count the days to my retirement. It was a beautiful, sunny
evening, and I was totally unaware of the evil winds blowing our
way. My children, who were watching television in another room,
alerted us to the storm warnings. Moments later, as if on cue, the
sky became ashen with fear. The calm winds became restless, and the
clouds started to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's just another Texas thunderstorm, I thought. It'll blow
over like they always do. I barely stirred from my resting place.
My family, however, hovered in front of the television watching the
progress of the storm. My spouse, who thinks I'm afraid of
thunderstorms, invited me to join the family in the den. I declined
until the thunder and lightning got into a shouting match.
</P>
<P>
   Like a kid, I went running into the den with my pillow and my
blanket. My husband smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about the children,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm grew worse, we huddled and debated whether or not
we needed to move into the closet or bathroom. The storm was a few
miles southwest of our home when the pitter-patter of hail began to
serenade us through the window. My spouse located the flashlight
while I lit a few candles in anticipation of a power outage.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I remembered the family that lives in our back yard.
Marie Antoinette and her husband live on our patio. My husband
tried to make them move but they refuse to leave. Marie is
expecting twins, so I asked him to let them stay until the children
are born and then we can find them a nice home. He's mad because
they killed his hanging plants. Marie resides in one plant with her
eggs and the Dad lives in the other one.
</P>
<P>
   They're pretty quiet birds and they don't poop all over the
place, so I don't have a problem with them. The plants were going
to die eventually, anyway. Now those crows that sit on the roof and
peck at the gutter really tick me off, but these birds are nice. I
don't know what kind of birds they are, but they look sort of like
doves. They have huge necks like Mike Tyson and long tails that
hang out of the plants when they roost. They're not white, though.
I learned only eight colors in elementary school, so it's hard for
me to describe anything that's not one of those colors. If you've
seen the book ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' they're the same shade as
the background on the cover. If you haven't seen the book, then
they're sort of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I gathered up my courage and peeped out of the window to
see how our Marie and company were faring. The hanging plants were
whipping around like a trapeze at the circus. It seemed like they
would fall from the hooks at any moment. The petals on the flowers
had blown away, leaving me a clear view of Marie's little head
peeking over the edge of the basket. The Dad's adopted nest was
deserted. I didn't know that an animal with a brain the size of
marble could have that kind of determination. She was determined to
protect those eggs, come what may.
</P>
<P>
   I considered going outside and putting the basket in a sheltered
area on the patio, but then the warning sirens started blaring and
I had to concern myself with my own family.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, we were spared any damage in the storm and my heart
goes out to all of the families who suffered such tremendous losses
in the tornado. The following day, I remembered Marie and her
family. I went onto the patio and there she was, still sitting in
her basket, defying the odds.
</P>
<P>
   If it's natural to love your children to the extent that you'd
risk your life for them, it must be unnatural to feel any other
way. That's as basic as the birds and the bees. Don't you think so?

RIPPLEWOOD PLANS TO INVEST IN JAPANESE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Ripplewood Holdings LLC, the Wall Street investment firm
that recently bought one of Japan's nationalized banks, said
Tuesday that it is pursuing investment opportunities in Japan's
chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Greenwich Chemical Partners LLC, Ripplewood plans
to use some of its $1 billion fund for Japanese investments to buy
stakes in chemical concerns here. Greenwich Chemical, headed by
John A. Georges, the former top executive of International Paper,
is one of Ripplewood's ``industrial partners,'' an investment and
advisory firm that will oversee the investments in this particular
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The firms said they believe that the Japanese chemical industry
is poised to follow patterns that are reshaping its counterpart in
the United States, where companies such as Monsanto and DuPont are
moving into areas like agricultural biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect they're in a different stage in terms of their
willingness and know-how, but they will move in similar
directions,'' Georges said.
</P>
<P>
   Georges said Ripplewood is in the process of purchasing a
specialty chemical company in the United States for roughly $500
million. That deal will give it a plant and research lab in Japan.
He declined to name the company because the deal has not been
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ripplewood leads the consortium of investment banks that bought
bankrupt Long-Term Credit Bank from the government, making it the
first foreign owner of a Japanese bank.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has also announced plans to buy Japanese hotel
properties in partnership with Marriott. Thus far, however, those
plans have bogged down over differences about the value of the
properties, with Japanese hotel owners complaining privately that
Ripplewood is seeking exceedingly low sale prices.

across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, thousands of the
company's employees will be staying up late to watch them on TV and
scanning the next morning's newspapers to root for them. That, Home
Depot's executives say, is precisely the reason the company has
spent several million dollars hiring dozens more Olympic athletes

their target of a 70 percent mail-back rate for census
questionnaires, and may not match the 65 percent rate from 1990,

behind the scenes, several Republican officials and business
leaders are trying to build a bipartisan coalition against a bill
that would extend a moratorium on new Internet taxes, including
sales taxes, until 2006. They say the bill, expected to clear the
Senate Commerce Committee this week, could erode the tax base for
state and local governments, forcing them to either boost income
and property taxes or turn to Washington for more federal grants
funded by income taxes. (Geewax, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

South Carolina _ where an NAACP tourism boycott is in effect _ has
taken its toll elsewhere. In Pensacola, Fla., the City of Five
flags, the city manager has removed the battle flag from city
property in favor of the national flag of the Confederacy. City
officials in Jackson, Miss., also removed the Confederate battle
flag from its buildings. Legislators in Mississippi, which uses the
battle emblem in its state flag, have debated whether to remove the
insignia. The emotional debate has seeped into Georgia, where the
SCLC has threatened a tourism boycott of the Peach State if the
General Assembly won't remove the Civil War battle design from the
state flag. South Carolina senators may debate the flag issue until
it reaches a compromise. Set up for debate starting Wednesday in

&HT;     RECORDS SHOW LINK BETWEEN MAYOR, INVESTMENT BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHUCK FINNIE and LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three months after it cut Mayor Willie Brown in
on a string of red-hot initial stock offerings, the Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter investment bank was chosen to underwrite a $28 million
bond issue for the San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Airport Director John Martin on March 23 chose Morgan Stanley
for the bond deal because the investment company submitted a
competitive bid that carried the lowest interest costs, airport
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were unaware of the mayor's stock trades
when Morgan Stanley was selected as lead underwriter on the bonds,
issued to pay for the construction of an airport parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   According to public records, after a Morgan Stanley broker
steered some lucrative stock deals to Brown, the company was
soliciting bond underwriting business at the airport, which is run
by a commission appointed by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In a financial disclosure report filed last week with the San
Francisco Ethics Commission, Brown said he had invested in eight
companies during a four-week period last year at the height of his
re-election campaign. The shares, representing companies that were
selling stock for the first time, soared in value on the day they
were first traded publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, his press office said Brown bought the shares
independently as an e-trader, but later the mayor said he invested
$25,000 through a Morgan Stanley broker. Three months later, the
IPO portfolio Brown bought was valued at about $40,000, according
to stock tables.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley is a big player in municipal finance in
California, and in 1997 Brown himself tapped the company to
underwrite $100 million worth of bonds for the new San Francisco
49ers stadium. The project has stalled and the bonds were never
issued.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Morgan Stanley said it had no bond business with the
city. After reporters called the company's attention to the airport
bonds, Ray O'Rourke, a Morgan Stanley spokesman in New York, said
that the investment bank had not mentioned the airport deal because
it viewed the airport as an independent agency.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investment bank's bond underwriting business is
managed separately from its stock brokerage services and that the
company got no help from the mayor's office in landing the airport
bond deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a competitive bid. We offered the very best interest
rate and we were awarded the loan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said the bank was reviewing its brokerage
arrangement with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make absolutely sure no industry regulations or
internal policies were violated,'' he said. ``We are concerned
about the appearances this situation presents.''
</P>
<P>
   No laws or regulations prohibit investment banks from giving
preferential treatment to elected officials looking for a piece of
a highly sought after IPO, finance experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has banned
so-called ``pay for play'' dynamics in municipal finance, schemes
in which investment bankers made hefty campaign donations to local
officials in exchange for the right to compete for lucrative
municipal bond underwriting contracts. Violators can be barred from
bidding on public finance deals for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers also
have moved to regulate so-called ``spinning'' of hot IPO shares, in
which brokerage firms seeking corporate finance business steer IPOs
to the personal investment accounts of executives at the companies
being wooed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither set of rules applies specifically to the scenario of a
brokerage tossing hot IPOs to a powerful politician while at the
same time it is seeking bond contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Political Reform Act forbids California officials
from accepting gifts valued at more than $300. But the 1974 law
apparently does not apply to initial stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no Political Reform Act implications because there
were no IPOs when the act was written,'' said Robert Stern,
president of the Center for Government Studies in Los Angeles and
the law's co-author.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's foray into IPO investing ``certainly is a story and
certainly is news, but I don't think it is illegal,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In interviews, O'Rourke and Rose Pak, Chinatown activist and a
Brown confidante, offered details of how the mayor became a stock
trading client of Morgan Stanley during a chance meeting with a
broker from Morgan Stanley's Fremont office at a San Francisco
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   By this account, the broker, whom O'Rourke and Pak declined to
identify, approached Brown and pitched the mayor on investing in
the initial public offering of United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   The broker, according to O'Rourke, hoped that by cutting Brown
in on some IPOs he would cultivate him as a long-term client.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing sinister. He was just in awe and worshiped the
mayor,'' Pak said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown opened an account with Morgan Stanley and on Nov. 9 bought
$20,000 worth of UPS stock at the initial price of $50, according
to a memo on the transactions provided by the mayor's office. The
stock rose to $67 at the close of its first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   In the month that followed, according to the memo, Brown bought
a handful of shares in seven hot IPOs, including such market
winners as Cache Flow Inc., which rose from $24 to $126 on its
first day of trading, and McAfee Communications, which went from a
$12 opening price to $44 at first close.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Brown flipped the IPO shares his broker sold him,
selling his 25 shares of Microsoft spin-off Expedia Inc. two days
after buying them, making a $975 profit.
</P>
<P>
   According to his disclosure report, Brown held onto the other
stocks he bought from Morgan Stanley at least until the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, those stocks had risen in value from their
purchase price of $25,000 to more than $40,000, a $15,000 gain.
Brown has declined to comment on whether he still owns the stocks.
He told a reporter last week that he had closed the Morgan Stanley
account because the commissions were too high.

HISTORIAN DETAILS UGLY CHAPTER OF RACISM AND INNOCENT YOUNG
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY MOIVING IN THE ``E'' AND ``L'' CATEGORIES.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades before political scandals cast a shadow over Arizona at
the end of the 20th century, a series of events in Clifton-Morenci
wrote an ugly chapter of state's history at the beginning of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chapter full of racism, anti-Catholic bigotry and
orphans dickered over like dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1980s and 1990s saw a governor deposed, a governor
indicted and stat legislators drawing up plans to secede from the
Union, no less shameful was the nasty tug of war that ensued over
40 homeless children sent west from New York in hopes of finding
new families.
</P>
<P>
   To officials of the New York Foundling Hospital, their plan
seemed simple: Place orphans with good Catholic families in the
wide-open spaces of the Arizon territory.
</P>
<P>
   How naive.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice and politics proved insurmountable barriers between
the fair-skinned Irish foundlings and their would-be foster
parents, all of whom happened to be Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the territory's quest for statehood was
driving citizens to prove their American patriotism and resist
efforts to form one large state with the territory of New Mexico,
which had a higher percentage of Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors converged in an episode that still causes
pain in the adjoining mining communities of Clifton and Morenci in
southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   University of Wisconsin historian Linda Gordon has chronicled
these events in a her book, ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction''
(Harvard University Press, 1999), a work rich in detail about the
town and the scandal that pitted Anglo residents against their
Mexican-American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Principal players were two nuns and a placement officer from the
New York orphanage, representatives of the local Catholic diocese,
Mexican families eage to adopt the orphans, White residents of
Clifton and Morenci bent on halting the adoptions and officials of
the Phelps Dodge Corp., whose economic caste system helped to
reinforce the notion that Mexican workers were inferior to Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   The story in ``Orphan Abduction'' is played out against the
backdrop of racial bia often tolerated in turn-of-the-century
America. Race meant not only Black and White, but also Irish,
German, Italian, Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we call such divisions ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon opens her story on a night in October 1904 as a posse
arrives at the home of Margarita Chacon to demand the return of two
fair-haired orphans recently placed with Senora Chacon and her
husband, Cornelio.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, the Chacons would be only one of
many couples forced to surrender children promised to them by the
New York orphanage and their own parish priest, Constant Mandin.
</P>
<P>
   Father Mandin saw his Mexican parishioners as good Catholics
willing to take in foundlings. Anglos saw them as brown-skinned
kidnappers unfit to raise White children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AN EASTERN SOLUTION  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children had come west on one of the celebrated orphan
trains operating in Eastern cities concerned with a growing
population of homeless children and street urchins.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, some children found loving new families. Some
found themselves valued only as unpaid farm labor.
</P>
<P>
   In Clifton-Morenci, a handful found homes, and a few were given
away as ``gifts,'' but the social climate prevented a generally
positive outcome. Most of the New York orphans reboarded their
train and were sent back for re-distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by a strike and a devastating flood in 1905 _ events
coincidenta lly repeated in 1983 _ the residents of Clifton-Morenci
were left with wounds slow to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose academic specialty is women, families and labor
issues, discovered the orphan saga while reading histories of labor
disputes, in which the actions of Phelps Dodge are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there were kids in this piqued my interest,''
Gordon said while vacationing in Portland., Ore., and on leave from
UW to teach at New York University. ``I came to understand the
story more and more as I went along ... I thought it was an amazing
story.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was intrigued by the racial aspect of a story that
involved not Blacks and Whites but ``Anglos,'' as she calls them in
the book, and ``Mexicans,'' as Mexican-Americans were known at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began her research in 1994 and finished the book in 1998.
She made three trips to Clifton-Morenci during that time to
interview elderly residents and glean a sense of what the
communities were like 90 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Not all residents welcomed her inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Festering wounds had reopened during the strike of 1983, when
the communities once again split along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The strike destroyed once-thriving Clifton, Gordon said. Phelps
Dodge fired its protesters and replaced them with strike-breakers.
The town's young people moved away. Senior workers retired. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ANGRY COMMUNITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when Gordon arrived with pen in hand, some
residents refused to be interviewed. Even when she explained that
her interest was the 1905 orphan incident, conversations invariably
returned to the 1983 strike and the pain it had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some people opened up. One of Gordon's best sources was
the venerable Al Fernandez, a former mayor of Clifton and renowned
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to talk and had great stories,'' Gordon said of the
man who died in December at age 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, Catholic Church officials, eager to expose what they
believed had been an episode of anti-Catholic bigotry, made church
archives readily available.
</P>
<P>
   And in Phoenix, Gordon found a historian's pot of gold: complete
transcripts from a state Supreme Court trial whose verdict had
upheld taking the orphans from their Mexican foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, even the attorneys for the Foundling Hospital
had ``concede'' that Mexican homes were inferior to those of Anglos
and probably unsuitable for White children.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexicans had been called as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Gordon pieced together the strange story. When the
train from New York pulled into the Clifton station on the evening
of Oct. 1, 1904, and unloaded its cargo of 40 weary children, Anglo
residents took notice.
</P>
<P>
   Where had these children come from, and where were they going?
</P>
<P>
   To their dismay, they discovered that the youngsters were
heading for their new homes. Mexican homes.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated both by prejudice and a sincere sense of concern for
motherless children, a group of Anglos, mostly women, began to
protest the placeme nt of the orphans. They and their husbands,
many armed with rifles, threatened Father Mandin, the sisters, the
placement officer, the bishop from Tucson and Mexican parents who
had the audacity to take the children into their homes and hearts.
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HUMAN MERCHANDISE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anglos demanded that they be given the ``babies''as they fought
over the human merchandise like bargains at a rummage sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me,'' Gordon said of that chapter in her
research.
</P>
<P>
   With courts as high as the U.S. Supreme Court siding with the
vigilantes, the nuns eventually were forced to back down. One rainy
night, the Mexican families were ordered to turn over the children
to waiting Anglos. Fifteen of the orphans went to Anglo homes in
Clifton and Morenci. One child was sent to a Los Angeles family as
a ``gift'' from one of the law-enforcement officers. The rest were
returned to New York and found homes in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexican family was allowed to keep a child.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said she believes that Phelps Dodge helped foster the
prejudice that divided Mexicans from Anglos. Looking at blueprints
of company housing, she found that ``Americans'' had been assigned
homes with running water and flushing toilets, while the Mexicans'
accommodations were more primitive. The copper company rationalized
the disparity, she said, by asserting that Mexicans were used to
such conditions and aspired to nothing more. In truth, Mexicans
were upwardly mobile and sought parity with their Anglo neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Subjugating the Mexicans became a self-fulfilling prophecy as
poverty equated with inferiority and, in the case of the orphans,
immorality. Anglos hurled slurs at the foster parents, accusing
them of keeping dirty homes (untrue), being prostitutes (untrue)
and being prone to drink (Anglos ran the saloons).
</P>
<P>
   Although bigotry against minority laborers reared its head in
other pa rts of the country - Chinese workers often were vilified
on the West Coast - ``it became more deeply entrenched'' in
Clifton-Morenci, Gordon said.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MISGUIDED INTENTIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is not entirely unsympathetic to the Anglo women who took
back the orphans. Given the tenor of the times, they truly believed
that Anglo children belonged in Anglo homes and needed to be
``rescued '' from the clutches of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't always know their own motives,'' Gordon
speculates.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the officials of the New York Foundling Hospital
might not have fully understood the racial implications of their
proposal or exactly what the term ``Mexican'' meant. They knew the
Southwesterners as ``Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Gordon fault the nuns who buckled at the threat of
a well -aimed Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect them to be heroes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction'' could be used in
high school and university history courses, its target audience is
a broad one, Gordon said. Anyone interested in history or in the
``true crime'' genre will find it absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said her book, already in its second printing, has
received good reviews from critics, and she finds that rewarding,
but she added that her favo rite reviews have come from former
residents of Clifton-Morenci.
</P>
<P>
   In their letters, she said, they tell her, ``You got it just
right.'' &QL;

   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, governments and busi nesses should pressure the
Taliban the way they pressured South Africa to end racial
apartheid, said Deb Ellis, author of the soon-to-be-pub lished book
``Women of the Afghan War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate, who asks to be identified only as Sajeda, is
angry at the U.S. government for getting involved during the Soviet
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Afghan people fought the British (gaining its independence
in 1919). Afghanistan could have de feated the Russians without the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   She also feels betrayed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N. can send peacekeepers to East Timor to pave the
way for ademocratic election, why can't they do it in Afghanistan?
They say, `We must be invited by the government,' but since there
is no government in Afghanistan, that's just an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hassina Sherjan-Samad, founder of Children's Voice,
traveled to Kabul, where, escorted by the Taliban, she visited
classrooms, filled only with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person with me asked one of the boys if there were any
differences between men and women. This boy, about 12 or 15, said,
`Women have 9 million brain cells, and men have 15 million brain
cells.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked, `How do you know?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Physics proved it.' This is what they teach.'' Reach

 &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE: www.dailynewspix.com
</P>
<P>
   The photo archive of the New York Daily News includes several
free features, including a gallery that showcases famous photos
taken over the years, many wit strong historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   From the main site, click on Photo Gallery, and you'll reach a
screen with `Greatest Hits'' and `New York Noir.'' The Greatest
Hits section includes a number of notable Daily News photos,
including the well-known Charles Hoff picture of the Hindenburg
zeppelin ablaze after exploding at Lakehurst, N.J., i 1937, plus
the obligatory duck-and-cover photo from a 1960s atomic bomb drill
and a portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono. There is also a Rosie
the Riveter photo from the World War II era, during which women
entered factories to replace men who were fighting overseas; a
photo of David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam killer, being led into
police headquarters; and poet Allen Ginsberg reading his work in
Washington Square Park.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Noir section is devoted to crime photos, including
the picture of Ruth Snyder being executed in the electric chair at
Sing Sing prison, the aftermath of the assassination of mobster
Albert Anastasia and several other graphic street crime photos.
</P>
<P>
   The site also features a portfolio work from Evy Mages, a Daily
News photographer who was named the New York Press Photographers
Association Photographer of the Year. There are several other
features, including a search engine for guests and members and a
link to the Daily News Web site (www.nydailynews.com). &QL;

 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ARCHAEOLOGY'S DIG'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying to drag your kids away from those dreaded Pok mon cards?
Want to trick them into learning something? Then Dig, a bi-monthly
published by the Archaeological Institute of America, is for you.
It's archaeology for kids, chock full of interesting articles,
games, puzzles and cartoons, all based on ancient cultures and
discovery. Written in a straightforward, accessible style, the
magazine actually tries to make learning fun. Don't let the board
of education hear about this. Lead story, about the great pyramids
of Egypt, does a fine job explaining why the pyramids are such an
amazing feat of engineering (no slide rules, pocket protectors or
the Internet back in those days). Of course, it goes a little over
the top in quoting Napoleon, in the original French, remarking on
the pyramids. There is another good piece on how archaeologists
date artifacts, explaining how different items are found on
different levels of a dig, and how carbon-14 dating is used.
Another interesting piece trie s to determine whether Hercules
really lived, or is just a creation of Greek mythology and Michael
Eisner. Can you dig it?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BIOGRAPHY'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's cover story profiles Paul Newman, salad dressing
entrepreneur and part-time actor. Naturally, the story is a fawning
piece of fluff, but the pictures are cool, stretching from Newman's
high school yearbook photo to studio shots of him in Cool Hand
Luke, The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Color
of Money, for which he won an Oscar. The story starts out talking
about how amusing Newman is, but none of the jokes he tells are
very funny. But he does, the author slyly notes, still have those
same blue eyes. Let's hope so. In the way of actual history, there
is a decent piece on John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil,
the mammoth monopoly that was broken up by a trust-busting Teddy
Roosevelt and turned into most of the gas stations you see on
corners today. The story also notes that Rockefeller turned
philanthropist in his later years, giving millions to education,
health care, churches and orphanages. Bully. In the Masters of the
Stunningly Obvious section, there's a story noting that movie star
Cameron Diaz is quite fetching. Bully, bully. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lead story examines the hullabaloo around the Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP for short), a NASA project that will catalog
microwave photons to answer the largest questions of the universe:
how old it is, how it will end, whether space is really infinite
and where exactly did I leave my car keys? The mission is a
follow-up to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) that found the
faint afterglow of the Big Bang. If it survives its testing, and
launch, MAP will use its sophisticated equipment to recreate ``the
universe's baby picture.'' Another article notes that chimpanzees
speak in dialects, invent odd grooming styles and drum better than
most kids in marching bands, meaning they are closer to humans than
previously thought. And their TV shows are better than prime time,
too. In the category of Tediously Pointless Pursuits, a group of
climbers clambered up Mount Everest to stick a global positioning
device on top, to finally, once and for all, get its exact
elevation. And they got it. Plus or minus 7 feet. Doh!  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ROLLING STONE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cover story checks in on the Red Hot Chili Peppers, noting that
Flea and the boys are back on their game with the release of
``Californication,'' which the mag calls ``their finest sustained
work ever.'' Piece holds that the Chili Peppers have evolved from
half-naked out-of-control young turks to half-naked elder
statesmen, after 17 years and seven albums. Article's funniest line
points out that the Chili Peppers ``have had so many guitarists _
seven _ they could hold a reunion barbecue for them every summer.''
There is also a well-written piece on Levon Helm, drummer for The
Band (``The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,'' ``Up On Cripple
Creek''), who is recovering from throat cancer and revisiting the
Delta blues and daughter Amy. In a Q&AMP;A, Latino heartthrob Marc
Anthony admits that he used to get sick to his stomach at the idea
of performing. Now he's engaged to a former Miss Universe. Go
figure. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Susan Merrell (HarperCollins, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel is built on a provocative idea but suffers in the
execution. Chris and Deborah Latham and their 3-year-old daughter
are the perfect family when they adopt an orphaned toddler from
Romania, but their dreams of a happy foursome are destroyed by
troubles from their new son's past. Because he was neglected as a
baby, Michael grows into a brutal boy _ his adoptive father calls
him ``amoral,'' incapable of love or socialization. By the time he
starts kindergarten, he is a danger to his classmates. Deborah's
efforts to help him and her determination to keep him in the family
even as he chips away a t her marriage are heart-rending.
Unfortunately, our sympathy for Michael is strained _ at times, he
is nothing less than demonic. Merrell also adds a distra cting
subplot about Chris Latham's past that culminates in a long scene
during which he and Deborah seem to forget that they've left
Michael at home, attacking his tutor. The book could do with less
plot and a defter touch with the lit tle boy at its heart.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BEREFT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jane Bernstein (North Point, $24) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One evening in 1966, an Arizona State University student named
Laura Bernstein was stabbed six times as she was locking up her
bicycle behind the Casa Loma Hotel in Tempe. Later the same night,
17-year-old Jane Bernstein was in ed in her family's house in New
Jersey when she heard the telephone ring in her parents' bedroom.
Like a voyeur, she sneaked to their door and pressed her ear to it.
``Are you sure? Are you positive?'' she heard her mother say. Then
her mother hung up and said, ``Our baby is dead.'' In 1989, Jane
Bernstein came to Phoenix to see the place where her sister was
murdered for no reason, and for the next five years, she thought of
little else. This is her memoir, the story of a woman's troubled
life in the shadow of her sister's death, equal parts obsession and
avoidance. She writes of the murderer, a man named David Mumbaugh,
who died in prison in 1993. She was sad for him, she says _ ``not
sorry for him, but sad at the way this had turned out for all of
us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``FAIR BALL'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Bob Costas (Broadway, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The oft-quoted Jacques Barzun line goes, ``Whoever wants to know
the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball.'' Bob
Costas is not convinced. ``All I can say, really, is that Jacques
Barzun scares me a little bit,'' he writes. Costas is not the
baseball romantic he's often made out to be. He's a Bull Durham guy
who never liked that other Kevin Costner movie about the gam e. And
he's here to remind you that on Opening Day 2000, the sport began
its seventh season as a dysfunctional operation, that fans were
``gamely hanging on out of loyalty, memory and sheer faith, long
after baseball itself had ceased to care much about any of that.''
He offers a cogent analysis of what went wrong and what might make
it right, and he hopes people have the will to read it. As he
points out, if Bobby Thomson's home run happened today, here's how
Russ Hodges would call it: ``The Giants win the pennant!! The
Giants win the pennant!! The Dodgers get the wild card!! The
Dodgers get the wild card!!''Isn't that exciting? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``AMERICAN POETRY: THE TWENTIETH CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Library of America, $35 each) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is Dorothy Parker on Alfred Lord Tennyson: ``Should heaven
send me any son,/ I hope he's not like tennyson./ I'd rather have
him play a fiddle/ Than rise and bow and speak an idyll.'' We never
miss a chance to quote her, even when she's among more quotable
company. We also were happy to find Don Marquis here with archy and
mehitabel _ every collection of poetry needs a cockroach in it,
just to keep it honest. These are the first two volumes in a
four-volume set and include work written by poets born before 1914.
Organized by the poets' birth dates, there are multiple
contributions from the big guns _ Robert Frost, William Carlos
Williams, Carl Sandburg, Ezra Pound, e.e. cummings _ and surprise
showings by people such as Joe Hill, Ma Rainey, Cole Porter, Edith
Wharton, Bessie Smith and Tennessee Williams. They begin with Henry
Adams and end with May Swenson, and it's a long, pleasant journey
between.  &QL;

   ``If the U.N. can send peacekeepers to East Timor to pave the

HISTORIAN DETAILS UGLY CHAPTER OF RACISM AND INNOCENT YOUNG
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY MOIVING IN THE ``E'' AND ``L'' CATEGORIES.)
</P>
<P>
   Decades before political scandals cast a shadow over Arizona at
the end of the 20th century, a series of events in Clifton-Morenci
wrote an ugly chapter of state's history at the beginning of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chapter full of racism, anti-Catholic bigotry and
orphans dickered over like dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1980s and 1990s saw a governor deposed, a governor
indicted and stat legislators drawing up plans to secede from the
Union, no less shameful was the nasty tug of war that ensued over
40 homeless children sent west from New York in hopes of finding
new families.
</P>
<P>
   To officials of the New York Foundling Hospital, their plan
seemed simple: Place orphans with good Catholic families in the
wide-open spaces of the Arizon territory.
</P>
<P>
   How naive.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice and politics proved insurmountable barriers between
the fair-skinned Irish foundlings and their would-be foster
parents, all of whom happened to be Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the territory's quest for statehood was
driving citizens to prove their American patriotism and resist
efforts to form one large state with the territory of New Mexico,
which had a higher percentage of Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors converged in an episode that still causes
pain in the adjoining mining communities of Clifton and Morenci in
southeastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   University of Wisconsin historian Linda Gordon has chronicled
these events in a her book, ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction''
(Harvard University Press, 1999), a work rich in detail about the
town and the scandal that pitted Anglo residents against their
Mexican-American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Principal players were two nuns and a placement officer from the
New York orphanage, representatives of the local Catholic diocese,
Mexican families eage to adopt the orphans, White residents of
Clifton and Morenci bent on halting the adoptions and officials of
the Phelps Dodge Corp., whose economic caste system helped to
reinforce the notion that Mexican workers were inferior to Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   The story in ``Orphan Abduction'' is played out against the
backdrop of racial bia often tolerated in turn-of-the-century
America. Race meant not only Black and White, but also Irish,
German, Italian, Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we call such divisions ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon opens her story on a night in October 1904 as a posse
arrives at the home of Margarita Chacon to demand the return of two
fair-haired orphans recently placed with Senora Chacon and her
husband, Cornelio.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, the Chacons would be only one of
many couples forced to surrender children promised to them by the
New York orphanage and their own parish priest, Constant Mandin.
</P>
<P>
   Father Mandin saw his Mexican parishioners as good Catholics
willing to take in foundlings. Anglos saw them as brown-skinned
kidnappers unfit to raise White children.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AN EASTERN SOLUTION  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children had come west on one of the celebrated orphan
trains operating in Eastern cities concerned with a growing
population of homeless children and street urchins.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, some children found loving new families. Some
found themselves valued only as unpaid farm labor.
</P>
<P>
   In Clifton-Morenci, a handful found homes, and a few were given
away as ``gifts,'' but the social climate prevented a generally
positive outcome. Most of the New York orphans reboarded their
train and were sent back for re-distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by a strike and a devastating flood in 1905 _ events
coincidenta lly repeated in 1983 _ the residents of Clifton-Morenci
were left with wounds slow to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose academic specialty is women, families and labor
issues, discovered the orphan saga while reading histories of labor
disputes, in which the actions of Phelps Dodge are well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there were kids in this piqued my interest,''
Gordon said while vacationing in Portland., Ore., and on leave from
UW to teach at New York University. ``I came to understand the
story more and more as I went along ... I thought it was an amazing
story.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was intrigued by the racial aspect of a story that
involved not Blacks and Whites but ``Anglos,'' as she calls them in
the book, and ``Mexicans,'' as Mexican-Americans were known at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon began her research in 1994 and finished the book in 1998.
She made three trips to Clifton-Morenci during that time to
interview elderly residents and glean a sense of what the
communities were like 90 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Not all residents welcomed her inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Festering wounds had reopened during the strike of 1983, when
the communities once again split along ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The strike destroyed once-thriving Clifton, Gordon said. Phelps
Dodge fired its protesters and replaced them with strike-breakers.
The town's young people moved away. Senior workers retired. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ANGRY COMMUNITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when Gordon arrived with pen in hand, some
residents refused to be interviewed. Even when she explained that
her interest was the 1905 orphan incident, conversations invariably
returned to the 1983 strike and the pain it had caused.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some people opened up. One of Gordon's best sources was
the venerable Al Fernandez, a former mayor of Clifton and renowned
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to talk and had great stories,'' Gordon said of the
man who died in December at age 98.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, Catholic Church officials, eager to expose what they
believed had been an episode of anti-Catholic bigotry, made church
archives readily available.
</P>
<P>
   And in Phoenix, Gordon found a historian's pot of gold: complete
transcripts from a state Supreme Court trial whose verdict had
upheld taking the orphans from their Mexican foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, even the attorneys for the Foundling Hospital
had ``concede'' that Mexican homes were inferior to those of Anglos
and probably unsuitable for White children.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexicans had been called as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Gordon pieced together the strange story. When the
train from New York pulled into the Clifton station on the evening
of Oct. 1, 1904, and unloaded its cargo of 40 weary children, Anglo
residents took notice.
</P>
<P>
   Where had these children come from, and where were they going?
</P>
<P>
   To their dismay, they discovered that the youngsters were
heading for their new homes. Mexican homes.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated both by prejudice and a sincere sense of concern for
motherless children, a group of Anglos, mostly women, began to
protest the placeme nt of the orphans. They and their husbands,
many armed with rifles, threatened Father Mandin, the sisters, the
placement officer, the bishop from Tucson and Mexican parents who
had the audacity to take the children into their homes and hearts.
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HUMAN MERCHANDISE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anglos demanded that they be given the ``babies''as they fought
over the human merchandise like bargains at a rummage sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was upsetting to me,'' Gordon said of that chapter in her
research.
</P>
<P>
   With courts as high as the U.S. Supreme Court siding with the
vigilantes, the nuns eventually were forced to back down. One rainy
night, the Mexican families were ordered to turn over the children
to waiting Anglos. Fifteen of the orphans went to Anglo homes in
Clifton and Morenci. One child was sent to a Los Angeles family as
a ``gift'' from one of the law-enforcement officers. The rest were
returned to New York and found homes in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   No Mexican family was allowed to keep a child.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said she believes that Phelps Dodge helped foster the
prejudice that divided Mexicans from Anglos. Looking at blueprints
of company housing, she found that ``Americans'' had been assigned
homes with running water and flushing toilets, while the Mexicans'
accommodations were more primitive. The copper company rationalized
the disparity, she said, by asserting that Mexicans were used to
such conditions and aspired to nothing more. In truth, Mexicans
were upwardly mobile and sought parity with their Anglo neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Subjugating the Mexicans became a self-fulfilling prophecy as
poverty equated with inferiority and, in the case of the orphans,
immorality. Anglos hurled slurs at the foster parents, accusing
them of keeping dirty homes (untrue), being prostitutes (untrue)
and being prone to drink (Anglos ran the saloons).
</P>
<P>
   Although bigotry against minority laborers reared its head in
other pa rts of the country - Chinese workers often were vilified
on the West Coast - ``it became more deeply entrenched'' in
Clifton-Morenci, Gordon said.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MISGUIDED INTENTIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is not entirely unsympathetic to the Anglo women who took
back the orphans. Given the tenor of the times, they truly believed
that Anglo children belonged in Anglo homes and needed to be
``rescued '' from the clutches of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't always know their own motives,'' Gordon
speculates.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the officials of the New York Foundling Hospital
might not have fully understood the racial implications of their
proposal or exactly what the term ``Mexican'' meant. They knew the
Southwesterners as ``Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Gordon fault the nuns who buckled at the threat of
a well -aimed Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect them to be heroes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction'' could be used in
high school and university history courses, its target audience is
a broad one, Gordon said. Anyone interested in history or in the
``true crime'' genre will find it absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said her book, already in its second printing, has
received good reviews from critics, and she finds that rewarding,
but she added that her favo rite reviews have come from former
residents of Clifton-Morenci.
</P>
<P>
   In their letters, she said, they tell her, ``You got it just
right.'' &QL;

 &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE: www.dailynewspix.com
</P>
<P>
   The photo archive of the New York Daily News includes several
free features, including a gallery that showcases famous photos
taken over the years, many wit strong historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   From the main site, click on Photo Gallery, and you'll reach a
screen with `Greatest Hits'' and `New York Noir.'' The Greatest
Hits section includes a number of notable Daily News photos,
including the well-known Charles Hoff picture of the Hindenburg
zeppelin ablaze after exploding at Lakehurst, N.J., i 1937, plus
the obligatory duck-and-cover photo from a 1960s atomic bomb drill
and a portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono. There is also a Rosie
the Riveter photo from the World War II era, during which women
entered factories to replace men who were fighting overseas; a
photo of David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam killer, being led into
police headquarters; and poet Allen Ginsberg reading his work in
Washington Square Park.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Noir section is devoted to crime photos, including
the picture of Ruth Snyder being executed in the electric chair at
Sing Sing prison, the aftermath of the assassination of mobster
Albert Anastasia and several other graphic street crime photos.
</P>
<P>
   The site also features a portfolio work from Evy Mages, a Daily
News photographer who was named the New York Press Photographers
Association Photographer of the Year. There are several other
features, including a search engine for guests and members and a
link to the Daily News Web site (www.nydailynews.com). &QL;

 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ARCHAEOLOGY'S DIG'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying to drag your kids away from those dreaded Pok mon cards?
Want to trick them into learning something? Then Dig, a bi-monthly
published by the Archaeological Institute of America, is for you.
It's archaeology for kids, chock full of interesting articles,
games, puzzles and cartoons, all based on ancient cultures and
discovery. Written in a straightforward, accessible style, the
magazine actually tries to make learning fun. Don't let the board
of education hear about this. Lead story, about the great pyramids
of Egypt, does a fine job explaining why the pyramids are such an
amazing feat of engineering (no slide rules, pocket protectors or
the Internet back in those days). Of course, it goes a little over
the top in quoting Napoleon, in the original French, remarking on
the pyramids. There is another good piece on how archaeologists
date artifacts, explaining how different items are found on
different levels of a dig, and how carbon-14 dating is used.
Another interesting piece trie s to determine whether Hercules
really lived, or is just a creation of Greek mythology and Michael
Eisner. Can you dig it?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BIOGRAPHY'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's cover story profiles Paul Newman, salad dressing
entrepreneur and part-time actor. Naturally, the story is a fawning
piece of fluff, but the pictures are cool, stretching from Newman's
high school yearbook photo to studio shots of him in Cool Hand
Luke, The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Color
of Money, for which he won an Oscar. The story starts out talking
about how amusing Newman is, but none of the jokes he tells are
very funny. But he does, the author slyly notes, still have those
same blue eyes. Let's hope so. In the way of actual history, there
is a decent piece on John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil,
the mammoth monopoly that was broken up by a trust-busting Teddy
Roosevelt and turned into most of the gas stations you see on
corners today. The story also notes that Rockefeller turned
philanthropist in his later years, giving millions to education,
health care, churches and orphanages. Bully. In the Masters of the
Stunningly Obvious section, there's a story noting that movie star
Cameron Diaz is quite fetching. Bully, bully. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lead story examines the hullabaloo around the Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (MAP for short), a NASA project that will catalog
microwave photons to answer the largest questions of the universe:
how old it is, how it will end, whether space is really infinite
and where exactly did I leave my car keys? The mission is a
follow-up to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) that found the
faint afterglow of the Big Bang. If it survives its testing, and
launch, MAP will use its sophisticated equipment to recreate ``the
universe's baby picture.'' Another article notes that chimpanzees
speak in dialects, invent odd grooming styles and drum better than
most kids in marching bands, meaning they are closer to humans than
previously thought. And their TV shows are better than prime time,
too. In the category of Tediously Pointless Pursuits, a group of
climbers clambered up Mount Everest to stick a global positioning
device on top, to finally, once and for all, get its exact
elevation. And they got it. Plus or minus 7 feet. Doh!  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``ROLLING STONE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cover story checks in on the Red Hot Chili Peppers, noting that
Flea and the boys are back on their game with the release of
``Californication,'' which the mag calls ``their finest sustained
work ever.'' Piece holds that the Chili Peppers have evolved from
half-naked out-of-control young turks to half-naked elder
statesmen, after 17 years and seven albums. Article's funniest line
points out that the Chili Peppers ``have had so many guitarists _
seven _ they could hold a reunion barbecue for them every summer.''
There is also a well-written piece on Levon Helm, drummer for The
Band (``The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,'' ``Up On Cripple
Creek''), who is recovering from throat cancer and revisiting the
Delta blues and daughter Amy. In a Q&AMP;A, Latino heartthrob Marc
Anthony admits that he used to get sick to his stomach at the idea
of performing. Now he's engaged to a former Miss Universe. Go
figure. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Susan Merrell (HarperCollins, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel is built on a provocative idea but suffers in the
execution. Chris and Deborah Latham and their 3-year-old daughter
are the perfect family when they adopt an orphaned toddler from
Romania, but their dreams of a happy foursome are destroyed by
troubles from their new son's past. Because he was neglected as a
baby, Michael grows into a brutal boy _ his adoptive father calls
him ``amoral,'' incapable of love or socialization. By the time he
starts kindergarten, he is a danger to his classmates. Deborah's
efforts to help him and her determination to keep him in the family
even as he chips away a t her marriage are heart-rending.
Unfortunately, our sympathy for Michael is strained _ at times, he
is nothing less than demonic. Merrell also adds a distra cting
subplot about Chris Latham's past that culminates in a long scene
during which he and Deborah seem to forget that they've left
Michael at home, attacking his tutor. The book could do with less
plot and a defter touch with the lit tle boy at its heart.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``BEREFT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jane Bernstein (North Point, $24) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One evening in 1966, an Arizona State University student named
Laura Bernstein was stabbed six times as she was locking up her
bicycle behind the Casa Loma Hotel in Tempe. Later the same night,
17-year-old Jane Bernstein was in ed in her family's house in New
Jersey when she heard the telephone ring in her parents' bedroom.
Like a voyeur, she sneaked to their door and pressed her ear to it.
``Are you sure? Are you positive?'' she heard her mother say. Then
her mother hung up and said, ``Our baby is dead.'' In 1989, Jane
Bernstein came to Phoenix to see the place where her sister was
murdered for no reason, and for the next five years, she thought of
little else. This is her memoir, the story of a woman's troubled
life in the shadow of her sister's death, equal parts obsession and
avoidance. She writes of the murderer, a man named David Mumbaugh,
who died in prison in 1993. She was sad for him, she says _ ``not
sorry for him, but sad at the way this had turned out for all of
us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``FAIR BALL'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Bob Costas (Broadway, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The oft-quoted Jacques Barzun line goes, ``Whoever wants to know
the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball.'' Bob
Costas is not convinced. ``All I can say, really, is that Jacques
Barzun scares me a little bit,'' he writes. Costas is not the
baseball romantic he's often made out to be. He's a Bull Durham guy
who never liked that other Kevin Costner movie about the gam e. And
he's here to remind you that on Opening Day 2000, the sport began
its seventh season as a dysfunctional operation, that fans were
``gamely hanging on out of loyalty, memory and sheer faith, long
after baseball itself had ceased to care much about any of that.''
He offers a cogent analysis of what went wrong and what might make
it right, and he hopes people have the will to read it. As he
points out, if Bobby Thomson's home run happened today, here's how
Russ Hodges would call it: ``The Giants win the pennant!! The
Giants win the pennant!! The Dodgers get the wild card!! The
Dodgers get the wild card!!''Isn't that exciting? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``AMERICAN POETRY: THE TWENTIETH CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &UR; (Library of America, $35 each) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is Dorothy Parker on Alfred Lord Tennyson: ``Should heaven
send me any son,/ I hope he's not like tennyson./ I'd rather have
him play a fiddle/ Than rise and bow and speak an idyll.'' We never
miss a chance to quote her, even when she's among more quotable
company. We also were happy to find Don Marquis here with archy and
mehitabel _ every collection of poetry needs a cockroach in it,
just to keep it honest. These are the first two volumes in a
four-volume set and include work written by poets born before 1914.
Organized by the poets' birth dates, there are multiple
contributions from the big guns _ Robert Frost, William Carlos
Williams, Carl Sandburg, Ezra Pound, e.e. cummings _ and surprise
showings by people such as Joe Hill, Ma Rainey, Cole Porter, Edith
Wharton, Bessie Smith and Tennessee Williams. They begin with Henry
Adams and end with May Swenson, and it's a long, pleasant journey
between.  &QL;

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The United States is largely to blame for the
suffering of Afghan women under the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
   It was U.S. action that brought the Taliban to power, and the
Taliban could be removed if the United States and the United
Nations had the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opinions of activists working to help the women.
Since the Taliban militia captured Kabul in 1996, girls have been
prevented from attending school. Women lost their jobs as doctors,
lawyers, teachers and government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women are under virtual house arrest, prohibited from leaving
their homes unless they're accompanied by a male relative. This
rule is especially hard on the 300,000 wid ows in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When women do go outside, they must be covered from head to toe
with a shroud with only a small piece of mesh over the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They can be beaten for showing an ankle. They lack health care
because male doctors are forbidden from treating women patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, activists lobbied for sup port of Afghan women at
Feminist Expo 2000, an international gather ing of women's rights
advocates in Baltimore that drew about 6,000 women and men from
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the convention was Zieba Shorish-Shamley,
director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in
Afghanistan. She criticizes the United States for aban doning
Afghanistan after the Soviets ended their occupation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Russia withdrew, the U.S. lost interest, and that's the
time we needed the U.S. the most,'' Shorish-Shamley said ``That's
when foreign, neighboring countries (such as Paki stan), each with
their own interest, moved in and started supporting different
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   She's angry that the CIA supported the rebels during Soviet
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban _ Pakistan trained it; Saudi Arabia financed it;
and the U.S. blessed it,''Shorish-Stamley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cash, arms, food and medicine for the rebels were channeled from
the United States through the Pakistani intelligence service, said
Philip Smith, director of research and analysis for a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Public Policy Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staff director for the Congressional Task Force on Af
ghanist an from 1988 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We more or less deferred to them (Pakistani intelligence), and
that was a big mistake,'' Smith said. ``U.S. policy changed
dramatically when bombs went off (at U.S. embassies in 1998) in Dar
es Salaam as well as Nairobi. At that point, I think policymakers
smelled the coffee. Prior to that, they often looked the other way
when fundamentalists were seizing control of Afghani stan.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States blamed Osama Bin Laden for the embassy
bombings and retaliated by bombing what it said was a chemical
factory in the Sudan and three training camps of Bin Laden's in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Clinton administration is prepared to bomb Afghanistan
over Bin Laden, why don't we start pushing the international
community (on behalf of Afghan women)?? asked T. Kuman, an
executive with Amnesty international.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the U.S. and other countries put pressure on the
three countries that recognize the Taliban _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has become more interested in Afghanistan
because of the oil and gas in former Soviet republics,
Shorish-Shamley said.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Unocal joined a consortium with oil companies
from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the idea of building a pipeline
from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan to Pakistan. Unocal dropped
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, activist and wife of comedian Jay Leno, wants the
United States to pressure Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make it clear to our governments that for the rest of their
lives, every time they look in the rear-view mirror, they'll see
us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, governments and busi nesses should pressure the
Taliban the way they pressured South Africa to end racial
apartheid, said Deb Ellis, author of the soon-to-be-pub lished book
``Women of the Afghan War.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate, who asks to be identified only as Sajeda, is
angry at the U.S. government for getting involved during the Soviet
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Afghan people fought the British (gaining its independence
in 1919). Afghanistan could have de feated the Russians without the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   She also feels betrayed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.N. can send peacekeepers to East Timor to pave the
way for ademocratic election, why can't they do it in Afghanistan?
They say, `We must be invited by the government,' but since there
is no government in Afghanistan, that's just an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hassina Sherjan-Samad, founder of Children's Voice,
traveled to Kabul, where, escorted by the Taliban, she visited
classrooms, filled only with boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person with me asked one of the boys if there were any
differences between men and women. This boy, about 12 or 15, said,
`Women have 9 million brain cells, and men have 15 million brain
cells.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked, `How do you know?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Physics proved it.' This is what they teach.'' Reach

 &HT;    BRITISH COURT HANDS HOLOCAUST AUTHOR VICTORY
 &HT;    (850&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt on Tuesday
said she had no illusions that her resounding court victory over
maverick historical writer David Irving will have much influence
with Holocaust deniers and other extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not who I'm writing for,'' Lipstadt told a packed
news conference at a London hotel after the verdict was delivered.
``It's to convince the people who might be influenced by people
like David Irving.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books won a nearly complete
victory over Irving, who had sued them for libel over
characterizations of him in Lipstadt's 1994 book ``Denying the
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Lipstadt described Irving as a dangerous leader of
the movement to minimize the Holocaust. She portrayed him as a
false academic who manipulates history to support his extremist
political views. During the trial, her attorneys described Irving
as dishonest and deeply anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that this portrayal, while damaging to Irving,
was substantiated by evidence presented during the three-month
trial.
</P>
<P>
   While it was argued that the case did not amount to a test of
the accuracy of the traditional account of the Holocaust, the case
turned on historical evidence and the testimony of experts.
</P>
<P>
   By demonstrating that the weight of historical record
overwhelmingly supports accepted understandings of the Holocaust,
Lipstadt's lawyers showed that Irving's misrepresentations in books
and speeches must have been deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   In a 66-page, detailed ruling, Justice Charles Gray assailed
Irving for his 30-year record of attacking long-held accounts of
the Holocaust, which Irving often has dismissed as fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the evidence showed that Irving ``persistently and
deliberately manipulated historical evidence'' and that he
portrayed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in a favorable light that is
unsupportable by the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture of Irving which emerges from the evidence of his
extra-curricular activities revealed him to be a right-wing
pro-Nazi polemicist,'' said Gray, who read much of his ruling in a
calm, even voice. ``It appears to me to be incontrovertible that
Irving qualifies as a Holocaust denier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has he denied the existence of gas chambers at
Auschwitz and asserted that no Jew was gassed there, he has done so
on frequent occasions and sometimes in the most offensive terms,''
said the judge, wearing a periwig and robes.
</P>
<P>
   The trial featured the testimony of several highly respected
historians who presented reams of documentation about the Nazi
campaign to exterminate the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my conclusion that no objective, fair-minded historian
would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at
Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to
kill hundreds of thousands of Jews,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt said her victory might help stem the tide of historical
revision at a time when the ranks of people who remember the
Holocaust is dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon there won't be people to tell the story in the
first-person singular,'' she said. ``That's why I think today's
judgment is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever steam they may have built up, I hope was dissipated
by this judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving contended that Lipstadt's portrayal was false and cost
him his lucrative career as a historical writer and lecturer. He
also said that he has been exposed to scorn and perhaps personal
danger because of Lipstadt's work.
</P>
<P>
   Irving depicted himself as an unconventional researcher who is
simply challenging conventional wisdom. Seeing himself as a David
battling a Goliath, Irving has argued that he is the victim of an
international Jewish conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Although he waffled somewhat during the trial, Irving maintained
for years that he didn't believe the Nazis killed as many 6 million
Jews in a systematic extermination effort. However, he accepts that
the Nazis were responsible for the deaths of many Jews, maybe a
million, most of whom died from malnutrition, disease or by firing
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he contended the scope of the Holocaust has been
overblown by Jews seeking to boost reparations payments from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Irving sat silently, staring straight ahead as the judge read
the ruling. He was in shirt-sleeves because he was hit by an egg as
he entered the court house.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ruling, Irving told reporters that he would be a
winner regardless of the outcome. ``My reputation is bound to be
enhanced because of my ability to stand up to the experts _ to take
them all on single-handed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's decision to sue turned out to be catastrophic for him,
however. Not only did Gray say that the evidence supported the
book's depiction of Irving, he also said it is likely that the
English author will be asked to pay US$3.2 million in court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Gray also rejected Irving's request for an appeal. He
nevertheless advised him that he was welcome to take his case to
the court of appeals anyway.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Lipstadt singled out Emory
University for standing by her through the five-year ordeal.
``Emory has been exceptionally supportive in many ways,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Emory President William M. Chace said the
university ``celebrates Deborah Lipstadt's victory in this case as
a victory for free inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish Committee also applauded the verdict.
Members of the Atlanta chapter were in the courtroom throughout the
trial. ``We were witnesses to the truth, lending our emotional
support to Dr. Deborah Lipstadt, a revered member of our Atlanta
community,'' said Sherry Frank, the committee's Southeast area
director. ``David Irving's distortion of historical facts and
despicable hatred of Jews received full light of inspection in this
courtroom. Justice, truth and free speech prevail.''

   Lipstadt never testified during the trial. She said this was the
course advised by her attorneys. ``They thought the book spoke for
itself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While she believes the case was an important moment in her
struggle against Holocaust deniers, she said that it was a conflict
she would have happily avoided. ``This has wreaked havoc on my
life,'' she said. ``There are books I haven't written, articles I
haven't written and students I've neglected.''

<P>
   But she said it was worth it. ``The most moving moment in the
trial was when I walked out of the court and was enveloped by
Holocaust survivors,'' she said, nearly breaking into tears.
``Survivors who said, 'Thank you.'''

 &HT;    (850&AMP;ADD)

<P>
   LONDON _ Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt on Tuesday
said she had no illusions that her resounding court victory over
maverick historical writer David Irving will have much influence
with Holocaust deniers and other extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not who I'm writing for,'' Lipstadt told a packed
news conference at a London hotel after the verdict was delivered.
``It's to convince the people who might be influenced by people
like David Irving.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books won a nearly complete
victory over Irving, who had sued them for libel over
characterizations of him in Lipstadt's 1994 book ``Denying the
Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Lipstadt described Irving as a dangerous leader of
the movement to minimize the Holocaust. She portrayed him as a
false academic who manipulates history to support his extremist
political views. During the trial, her attorneys described Irving
as dishonest and deeply anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that this portrayal, while damaging to Irving,
was substantiated by evidence presented during the three-month
trial.
</P>
<P>
   While it was argued that the case did not amount to a test of
the accuracy of the traditional account of the Holocaust, the case
turned on historical evidence and the testimony of experts.
</P>
<P>
   By demonstrating that the weight of historical record
overwhelmingly supports accepted understandings of the Holocaust,
Lipstadt's lawyers showed that Irving's misrepresentations in books
and speeches must have been deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   In a 66-page, detailed ruling, Justice Charles Gray assailed
Irving for his 30-year record of attacking long-held accounts of
the Holocaust, which Irving often has dismissed as fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the evidence showed that Irving ``persistently and
deliberately manipulated historical evidence'' and that he
portrayed Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in a favorable light that is
unsupportable by the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture of Irving which emerges from the evidence of his
extra-curricular activities revealed him to be a right-wing
pro-Nazi polemicist,'' said Gray, who read much of his ruling in a
calm, even voice. ``It appears to me to be incontrovertible that
Irving qualifies as a Holocaust denier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only has he denied the existence of gas chambers at
Auschwitz and asserted that no Jew was gassed there, he has done so
on frequent occasions and sometimes in the most offensive terms,''
said the judge, wearing a periwig and robes.
</P>
<P>
   The trial featured the testimony of several highly respected
historians who presented reams of documentation about the Nazi
campaign to exterminate the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my conclusion that no objective, fair-minded historian
would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at
Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to
kill hundreds of thousands of Jews,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt said her victory might help stem the tide of historical
revision at a time when the ranks of people who remember the
Holocaust is dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon there won't be people to tell the story in the
first-person singular,'' she said. ``That's why I think today's
judgment is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever steam they may have built up, I hope was dissipated
by this judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving contended that Lipstadt's portrayal was false and cost
him his lucrative career as a historical writer and lecturer. He
also said that he has been exposed to scorn and perhaps personal
danger because of Lipstadt's work.
</P>
<P>
   Irving depicted himself as an unconventional researcher who is
simply challenging conventional wisdom. Seeing himself as a David
battling a Goliath, Irving has argued that he is the victim of an
international Jewish conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Although he waffled somewhat during the trial, Irving maintained
for years that he didn't believe the Nazis killed as many 6 million
Jews in a systematic extermination effort. However, he accepts that
the Nazis were responsible for the deaths of many Jews, maybe a
million, most of whom died from malnutrition, disease or by firing
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he contended the scope of the Holocaust has been
overblown by Jews seeking to boost reparations payments from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Irving sat silently, staring straight ahead as the judge read
the ruling. He was in shirt-sleeves because he was hit by an egg as
he entered the court house.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ruling, Irving told reporters that he would be a
winner regardless of the outcome. ``My reputation is bound to be
enhanced because of my ability to stand up to the experts _ to take
them all on single-handed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's decision to sue turned out to be catastrophic for him,
however. Not only did Gray say that the evidence supported the
book's depiction of Irving, he also said it is likely that the
English author will be asked to pay US$3.2 million in court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Gray also rejected Irving's request for an appeal. He
nevertheless advised him that he was welcome to take his case to
the court of appeals anyway.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Lipstadt singled out Emory
University for standing by her through the five-year ordeal.
``Emory has been exceptionally supportive in many ways,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Emory President William M. Chace said the
university ``celebrates Deborah Lipstadt's victory in this case as
a victory for free inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish Committee also applauded the verdict.
Members of the Atlanta chapter were in the courtroom throughout the
trial. ``We were witnesses to the truth, lending our emotional
support to Dr. Deborah Lipstadt, a revered member of our Atlanta
community,'' said Sherry Frank, the committee's Southeast area
director. ``David Irving's distortion of historical facts and
despicable hatred of Jews received full light of inspection in this
courtroom. Justice, truth and free speech prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt never testified during the trial. She said this was the
course advised by her attorneys. ``They thought the book spoke for
itself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While she believes the case was an important moment in her
struggle against Holocaust deniers, she said that it was a conflict
she would have happily avoided. ``This has wreaked havoc on my
life,'' she said. ``There are books I haven't written, articles I
haven't written and students I've neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said it was worth it. ``The most moving moment in the
trial was when I walked out of the court and was enveloped by
Holocaust survivors,'' she said, nearly breaking into tears.
``Survivors who said, 'Thank you.'''

<P>
   D'HANIS, Texas _ Joel Curtis was baffled. The traps he hangs in
his pecan orchard to determine how much pesticide to spray usually
snare between 80 and 100 moths each. But the numbers last spring
were down to only a handful.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis thought the warm, dry winter might have killed the
destructive insects. He eventually would entertain another
possibility after he and his son Jeff noticed a large, dark mass
swirling one evening over the nearby Seco Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just about dark, and I said, `Look at the
blackbirds,''' Curtis said recently. But he and his son reflected
that blackbirds don't usually arrive until the fall. ``And we
looked and looked, and Jeff said, `That's not blackbirds. That's
bats.'''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that bats made their home in the narrow foot-deep
crevices under the eastbound and westbound highway bridges of U.S.
90 and a parallel railroad bridge near the Curtis farm, which is
west of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed into the dark spaces between concrete beams, the bats
are small and hard to see, but their presence is impossible to
overlook.
</P>
<P>
   The ground is covered with linear mounds of pungent guano, and
the bats' squeaky chatter is audible even over the steady rumble of
trucks and cars traveling overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Gotham City of Highway 90,'' Joel Curtis said as
the mammals congregated overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Sams, an agricultural consultant who specializes in pest
management, believes the insect-eating bats are keeping Curtis'
pecans from being assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Merlin Tuttle, founder and executive director of Bat
Conservation International, an Austin-based educational group,
estimates the D'Hanis bat colony is bigger than the 1.5 million
bats that inhabit the Congress Avenue bridge in Austin, the largest
urban bat colony in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle told a public health conference last month that there
were some 2 million bats in D'Hanis.
</P>
<P>
   In that lecture, Tuttle described the results of new research on
the immense agricultural impact of Texas' 100 million Mexican
free-tailed bats. These are the most common of the state's 33 bat
species, and the predominant species found in the Austin and
D'Hanis colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they found is that the bats were flying down night after
night to eat crop pests that come out of agricultural areas near
San Antonio,'' Tuttle said. ``Each spring _ and this is very little
known _ there are literally billions of the most costly farm pests
in America that migrate into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican free-tailed bats fly as high as two miles into the
air to intercept egg-laying female moths that carry hundreds of
eggs each, Tuttle said. If one bat eats just 20 moths in a single
night, Tuttle said, it is as effective as a farmer paying $32 to
spray 2 acres of cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle said irrational fear by humans of the winged mammals has
led to the destruction of large colonies in caves and mines in
Mexico and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very lucky here,'' he said.

   CHEFS (New York) _ Chefs have gone from being essentially
blue-collar workers to true professionals, as much in demand as

   COLE-ORGANIC-FARM (Washington, Va.) _ Sunrise at Sunnyside Farm
is greeted by a ritual that startles the uninitiated. Workers
advance upon windowless structures on wheels scattered around the
539 acres and lower the sides, releasing thousands of peeping
chickens eager for a good day's work at what they do best. Eating
bugs. David Cole, venture capitalist, philanthropist and organic
farmer, uses these coops on wheels to move his chickens where the
pecking is needed most. The mobile units are just one of many
labor-saving methods he employs on the organic farm he started five
years ago in the middle of Rappahannock County, home to the very
rich who have made their money elsewhere and to farmers who barely
make a living. By Marian Burros.

across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, thousands of the
company's employees will be staying up late to watch them on TV and
scanning the next morning's newspapers to root for them. That, Home
Depot's executives say, is precisely the reason the company has
spent several million dollars hiring dozens more Olympic athletes

&HT;     FATHER OF CRASH VICTIM QUESTIONS SAFETY OF MARINE AIRCRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The father of a Marine killed in last weekend's
crash of an MV-22 Osprey said his son complained two months before
the accident that the tilt-rotor aircraft was ``fragile'' and
unsafe to fly.
</P>
<P>
   In what would be their final conversation, William D. Nelson
said his son, Staff Sgt. William Bryan Nelson, described the Osprey
as a problem-plagued craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he told me, it was so fragile every time they took it up
and each time they brought it back (it) had all kinds of problems,
all kinds of parts, things that went wrong that wasn't really
imaginable,'' Nelson said in a telephone interview from his home in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't think it was safe to fly, and that's all he
told me,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft crashed Saturday at an airport 30 miles northwest
of Tucson, Ariz., killing 19 Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps and the manufacturers of the aircraft, Bell
Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth, Texas, and Boeing Co. in Ridley
Park, Pa., said the Osprey was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Helicopter Textron spokesman Bob Leder noted the Osprey had
logged more than 4,000 hours in the air since making its first
flight in March 1989. He said the craft, which can take off and
hover like a helicopter but fly like a plane, had passed extensive
testing and ``performed extraordinarily well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no indication from anywhere that there's a fundamental
flaw in the aircraft,'' Leder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the word fragile could have entered into
the lexicon in describing the Osprey,'' a Marine Corps spokesman,
Capt. Pete Mitchell, said in response to Nelson's comments.
</P>
<P>
   But some congressional supporters of the Osprey, among them Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, expressed concern about reports of
problems with the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison and Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas, called for an
exhaustive investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family members of the fallen Marines deserve a thorough
investigation of the accident, and Marines everywhere need
assurances that the MV-22 is an airworthy aircraft,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we must be sure what happened before they go forward
with any further training or testing operations,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the third Osprey accident in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Two crew members safely ejected when an Osprey crashed at
Boeing's Flight Test Development Center in Wilmington, Del., on
June 11, 1991. Another V-22 fell into waters off Quantico, Va., on
July 20, 1992, killing seven. A pair of badly wired gyros was
blamed for the first crash, while mechanical failure was found to
have triggered a fire that disabled an engine in the second
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines have ordered 360 Ospreys to be delivered over a
decade at a price of $44 million each. The Air Force Special
Operations Command has bought 50 V-22s, while the Navy wants a
fleet of 48.
</P>
<P>
   Faster and able to carry more than the CH-46 ``Sea Knight''
helicopter now used by the Marines, the Osprey is able to hold 24
combat-ready soldiers, hover and land like a helicopter and post
cruising speeds of 325 mph.

child disappears. Truth? Illusion? What happened to the baby? As
usual, Albee leaves it to the audience, except to say, yes, there
was a real baby. When the play was first presented at the Almeida
Theater in London in 1998, as directed by Howard Davies, the

SAUDI ARABIA TO EASE RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Anxious to demonstrate a new economic openness
that could help its bid to join the World Trade Organization and to
expand its private sector, Saudi Arabia announced a new law Tuesday
that will permit foreigners to own their investments and property
in the kingdom without a Saudi partner.
</P>
<P>
   The law, approved by King Fahd on Monday, also promises to
strengthen judicial protection for investments, foster greater
public disclosure in financial dealings and lower corporate taxes
on foreign companies with profits exceeding 100,000 rials (about
$26,600) a year, the official Saudi Press Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The easing of restrictions on foreign investors has been under
discussion for some time but intensified in the last six months,
after the king told his country that it could not ignore the trend
toward globalization and free markets. The new investment code is
also supported by Crown Prince Abdullah, a powerful figure who has
taken on a wider role in the country's affairs from his ailing
brother Fahd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law aims to improve the investment environment in the
kingdom, remove existing obstacles, improve efficiency and ensure
flexibility,'' said Hashem Yamani, the industry and electricity
minister, in a statement carried by the Saudi news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Yamani's ministry now licenses most direct foreign investment,
but investors in projects related to other areas have sometimes had
to apply to multiple ministries.
</P>
<P>
   The new law would set up a single agency to consider investment
projects and reduce bureaucratic delays. The agency would be
required to act within 30 days on proposals from foreigners, who
would also gain the right to appeal its decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For more than four years, Saudi Arabia has been negotiating for
entry into the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based group
that sets the standards for global commerce. Membership in the
organization greatly enhances a nation's ability to export goods
and services. The Saudi application for membership has been
hindered by the country's laws, regulations and traditions that
favor Saudis, impose high tariffs and subsidize some exports like
petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, foreign investors in the insular Gulf kingdom needed
a Saudi national as a partner to do business _ first as a sponsor
in order to obtain a work visa and then as a majority partner in
any project. Foreigners were allowed to hold a maximum stake in any
business of just 49 percent and could not own property, engage in
distribution or internal commerce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Acting as a paid sponsor for foreigners, who must relinquish
their passports to the sponsor while in the country, has been a
common method for members of the large extended royal family to
earn extra income.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, most Gulf countries have searched for ways
to diversify their economies and wean themselves from near-total
dependence on oil revenue, a quest that took on new urgency when
world oil prices plummeted a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At enormous cost, for example, Saudi Arabia became a major wheat
exporter by investing in agriculture as part of a plan to become
self-sufficient in food. But up to 85 percent of its export
earnings and about 40 percent of its gross domestic product still
comes from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment now is centered on oil-related industries
like petrochemicals, and Saudi Arabia is expected to maintain its
government monopoly on oil exploration and development. But
representatives of 10 international oil companies have been invited
to Riyadh later this month to discuss proposals for investing in
other areas of the oil industry.

<P>
   Most companies have discovered that the dynamics of the Internet
are different from those of the traditional business environment.
But many have not realized just how different they are, and how
much change may be involved in blending them.
</P>
<P>
   The collision and integration of the traditional and online
worlds create a new dynamic of contrary expectations. In this new
world, things are not as they appear, and they're certainly not an
extension of the past. In fact, they often are exactly the opposite
of what one would expect.
</P>
<P>
   I call this impact of the Net ``the 180-degree effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The most famous early example was Netscape's giving away its
browser, which was then its key product. That challenged the
assumption that the core product should be what people pay for. It
stood the notion of ``value'' on its head. Value was no longer
measured by revenue from base product, but by market share and
speed of product introduction.
</P>
<P>
   What does the 180-degree effect look like in the Net Future?
</P>
<P>
   -- Customers are charged less for delivery of several pounds of
groceries ordered online than for an ounce of paper delivered
overnight by the same delivery company.
</P>
<P>
   -- Real-time stock quotes, formerly a core asset for Wall Street
brokers, become available to all through the Net.

<P>
   -- America Online not long ago paid content providers to supply
information to its network. Now it's the other way around. Content
providers offer hefty fees to be featured on AOL. The company even
became the acquirer of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   -- Customers used to simply buy the product. Now, in true
180-degree fashion, customers are providing the product.
Amazon.com, which began by supplying a large inventory to its
customers, is now letting customers supply the inventory. Anyone
can list an item for sale in Amazon's zSHOPS; the seller is
responsible for shipping. And like eBay and other sites, Amazon.com
runs online auctions.
</P>
<P>
   With so many opportunities, many companies have to decide which
businesses they are not in, rather than which businesses to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   The 180-degree effect will increasingly affect how companies
need to develop their approach to E-Business and how to blend their
traditional and online operations.
</P>
<P>
   How should a company use the 180-degree effect to advantage?
First, by starting to think that way. When looking at how to move
its business into the Net environment, a company should think about
what it would do in a ``normal'' world. What would the business
plan look like? Put all the elements on paper -- every assumption
and every projection, five years out.
</P>
<P>
   Then -- and this is the hard part -- challenge every single
assumption. What if the entire pricing strategy were exactly
reversed? What if a competitor was not one of the company's
traditional competitors, but from a different industry altogether?
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question that arises from this change involves the
entire value chain of the company. When considering the impact of
the Net, a true E-Business thinks about product conception,
manufacturing, distribution and consumption. But it also needs to
think about what would happen if that entire chain were subject to
the 180-degree effect. What if the process were flipped end-to-end,
so that the value chain is driven by the customer rather than by
the company?
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the consumer truly being in charge of the
process, using mechanisms such as real-time feedback and enhanced
information distribution, is probably one of the most powerful
business notions brought about by the Netting of the world. It
involves much more than lip service or a mission statement with
platitudes about ``the customer coming first.'' It requires both
action and attitude to take a hard look at whether some fairly
dramatic changes are needed to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   For some companies, that, too, may feel like a 180-degree
effect.

   Most companies have discovered that the dynamics of the Internet
are different from those of the traditional business environment.
But many have not realized just how different they are, and how
much change may be involved in blending them.
</P>
<P>
   The collision and integration of the traditional and online
worlds create a new dynamic of contrary expectations. In this new
world, things are not as they appear, and they're certainly not an
extension of the past. In fact, they often are exactly the opposite
of what one would expect.
</P>
<P>
   I call this impact of the Net ``the 180-degree effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The most famous early example was Netscape's giving away its
browser, which was then its key product. That challenged the
assumption that the core product should be what people pay for. It
stood the notion of ``value'' on its head. Value was no longer
measured by revenue from base product, but by market share and
speed of product introduction.
</P>
<P>
   What does the 180-degree effect look like in the Net Future?
</P>
<P>
   -- Customers are charged less for delivery of several pounds of
groceries ordered online than for an ounce of paper delivered
overnight by the same delivery company.
</P>
<P>
   -- Real-time stock quotes, formerly a core asset for Wall Street
brokers, become available to all through the Net.
</P>
<P>
   -- America Online not long ago paid content providers to supply
information to its network. Now it's the other way around. Content
providers offer hefty fees to be featured on AOL. The company even
became the acquirer of Time Warner.
</P>

   CHEFS (New York) _ Chefs have gone from being essentially
blue-collar workers to true professionals, as much in demand as

   COLE-ORGANIC-FARM (Washington, Va.) _ Sunrise at Sunnyside Farm
is greeted by a ritual that startles the uninitiated. Workers
advance upon windowless structures on wheels scattered around the
539 acres and lower the sides, releasing thousands of peeping
chickens eager for a good day's work at what they do best. Eating
bugs. David Cole, venture capitalist, philanthropist and organic
farmer, uses these coops on wheels to move his chickens where the
pecking is needed most. The mobile units are just one of many
labor-saving methods he employs on the organic farm he started five
years ago in the middle of Rappahannock County, home to the very

bedeviled by two strangers, an older man and woman. Eventually the
child disappears. Truth? Illusion? What happened to the baby? As

was a real baby. When the play was first presented at the Almeida
Theater in London in 1998, as directed by Howard Davies, the

<P>
   I had just arrived in Madrid for a welcome cocktail party after
a long day in Stockholm -- a board meeting and a speech followed by
a long flight. And I had spent the night before in a plane from New
York to Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   So when Jorge Mata, CEO of MyAlert.com, offered to do a demo of
his wireless portal, my heart sank. You know the drill: Find a
quiet place, a power source, open up the laptop and power up. The
whole thing takes half an hour and can put you to sleep when you're
wide awake, let alone when you're about to keel over.
</P>
<P>
   But before I could register any lack of enthusiasm, Mata had
pulled a cell phone out of his pocket and was well into the demo.
``You want to know who's winning the Grand Prix?'' he asked,
misreading my expression entirely, but never mind. It turned out to
be someone I had never heard of, but Mata was already buying me a
T-shirt with the driver's name on it. A couple of clicks is all it
took.
</P>
<P>
   Then we went on to more familiar territory -- high-tech stock
quotes. Online trading isn't available quite yet, but just wait!
</P>
<P>
   The demo illustrated the compelling nature of wireless
applications, and the reason that Europe's Internet use -- and
e-commerce in particular -- is likely to explode this year.
Wireless is so much easier to use, it's local, it's ubiquitous ...
and millions of people are already comfortable with the devices.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, for example, 2 million people got cell phones last
(Christmas) quarter, for a total base of 16 million; that compares
with 10 million PCs and about 3.5 million Net users.
</P>
<P>
   Mata got started as a telecom engineer for AT&AMP;T Bell
Laboratories, and then ran McKinsey's multimedia and telecom
consultancy in Madrid. From there he moved on to manage an Internet
banking project at Banco Santander, Spain's most innovative bank on
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he was vice president of services in Europe for
Broadvision, the supplier of e-business application tools. But, he
says, ``I thought personalization should go a step beyond (PC and
Web site tools) to the most popular device in Europe, the cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created MyAlert.com in May 99 -- with BroadVision founder
Pehong Chen as an angel investor. The idea was to push the wireless
and the personalization. ... Anything that works with e-commerce
you should be able to do on wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   What's exciting, he notes, is that the wireless networks know
where their users are; they are not using global positioning
systems (GPS), but rather triangulating users' locations within 300
meters.
</P>
<P>
   That's tremendously useful -- as long as it's done with the
user's knowledge and consent.
</P>
<P>
   Applications include everything from local restaurant and
entertainment suggestions, to traffic advice or notifications that
you'd better leave for your flight because the plane takes off in
90 minutes and you are 45 minutes away. (Alternatively and perhaps
more likely, it can tell you to relax if your flight is running
late.)
</P>
<P>
   You can get an alert that your favorite singer will be in town
and you can buy a ticket to the show online, or you can get an
alert that the CD you were looking for is available at a price that
might interest you.
</P>
<P>
   MyAlert.com now has about 120,000 direct users in Spain, France,
Italy and Germany, who receive alerts via the SMS (Short Message
Service), much cheaper than a regular cell-phone call. Besides,
service is typically free for the users -- sponsored by advertisers
and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very exciting, of course, and I want mine in the US,
too! But it raises some interesting questions (in addition to
privacy,). First of all, there's more to the Internet than
e-commerce and transactions. Wireless access lacks something --
namely, rich data. The kinds of navigation/visualization tools that
make the Web easy to navigate can't do their stuff; users are
likely to get a single limited answer to any query rather than a
sense of all the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Will wireless reduce the richness of the Net and turn it into a
sterile place where only transactions, actions and alerts count?
Are the pundits right, that the Net limits the richness of
communication and turns us into a series of transactions rather
than subtly textured human beings?
</P>
<P>
   Probably that's a tendency, and one that people will fight the
way they always do -- by using other, richer media as well, and by
using their cell phones for realtime voice-to-voice conversations
even as they are driving, walking or riding toward those rich,
nuanced physical encounters with other people that they have
arranged with short, wireless messages.
</P>
<P>
   But wireless poses another social/political issue in Europe:
Just as cable operators in the United States may have undue control
over Internet access for many millions of customers, so do the
wireless operators in Europe threaten to limit people's access to
any but their own services. Imagine Minitel -- the French state
monopoly that had a lock on e-commerce until recently -- in the
hands of private business.
</P>
<P>
   When users get a single answer to a question, who chooses the
specific answers they get? Is it the cell-phone company? An
advertiser (the highest bidder)? or who? Users -- and regulators --
should make sure they know the answer.

make the Web easy to navigate can't do their stuff; users are
likely to get a single limited answer to any query rather than a
sense of all the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Will wireless reduce the richness of the Net and turn it into a
sterile place where only transactions, actions and alerts count?
Are the pundits right, that the Net limits the richness of
communication and turns us into a series of transactions rather
than subtly textured human beings?
</P>
<P>
   Probably that's a tendency, and one that people will fight the
way they always do -- by using other, richer media as well, and by
using their cell phones for realtime voice-to-voice conversations
even as they are driving, walking or riding toward those rich,
nuanced physical encounters with other people that they have
arranged with short, wireless messages.
</P>
<P>
   But wireless poses another social/political issue in Europe:
Just as cable operators in the United States may have undue control
over Internet access for many millions of customers, so do the
wireless operators in Europe threaten to limit people's access to
any but their own services. Imagine Minitel -- the French state
monopoly that had a lock on e-commerce until recently -- in the
hands of private business.
</P>
<P>
   When users get a single answer to a question, who chooses the
specific answers they get? Is it the cell-phone company? An
advertiser (the highest bidder)? or who? Users -- and regulators --
should make sure they know the answer.

THE COLUMN: TANDOORI IN A FLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two ways to think of tandoori chicken. Strictly
defined, it is chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and cooked in
a tandoor, a clay oven that is most often used to bake bread. But
you can also think of it as chicken in a yogurt and spice sauce
that is simply grilled or broiled.
</P>
<P>
   In much tandoori-style cooking, the yogurt is used not only as a
flavoring but as a tenderizer. But today's chicken needs no
tenderizing. To make a quick, really easy tandoori chicken, start
with a boneless, skinless breast. You can assemble the marinade in
less time than it takes to preheat the broiler or grill.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken breasts sit in the yogurt mixture for as little as
five minutes, and it doesn't make a whole lot of difference if you
allow them to sit longer. A soak of about an hour allowed a little
more of the flavor to permeate the flesh, but after six hours the
chicken began to turn mushy.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant flavors in most tandoori marinades are garlic,
ginger and coriander, although cumin, cardamom, turmeric and other
typically Indian spices are sometimes added. Paprika adds a little
heat as well as the traditional red color. Lime juice accentuates
and freshens the acidity of the yogurt, and a garnish of minced
cilantro adds color.
</P>
<P>
   The yogurt mixture is so creamy and delicious that I like to
double the quantity and broil the chicken so I can use the cooked
sauce and meat drippings to top cooked rice. If you don't make rice
or prefer to grill halve the quantities for the yogurt and spices
below.
</P>
<P>
   FAST CHICKEN TANDOORI
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups yogurt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   Juice of a lime
</P>
<P>
   Salt and ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds chicken breasts
</P>
<P>
   Minced cilantro for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat broiler or grill. Combine yogurt, ginger, garlic,
paprika, coriander, half the lime juice and salt and pepper to
taste in a large bowl. If chicken breasts are whole, cut them in
half. Dredge chicken in yogurt mixture and marinate 5 to 60
minutes, as time allows.
</P>
<P>
   2. If you're broiling, line a baking sheet with aluminum foil
for easier cleanup. To broil, put chicken breasts on pan, underside
facing up; reserve any marinade that does not cling to the breasts.
Broil 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Turn chicken and
spoon remaining marinade over. Broil on smooth side another 3 to 4
minutes, or until lightly browned. Garnish, add remaining lime
juice over chicken and serve, spooning the cooked marinade over the
meat and, if you're serving it, over some rice.
</P>
<P>
   3. If you're grilling, simply grill 3 to 4 minutes a side, or
until chicken browns and is cooked through, brushing with the
marinade from time to time. Garnish, add lime and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

A CORNUCOPIA OF SEDER WINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the wide range of kosher wines available these days,
choosing bottles for the Passover seder should be no more difficult
than picking wines for Thanksgiving. Come to think of it, that may
be a problem, since the annual Thanksgiving selection seems to
paralyze many people.
</P>
<P>
   So first things first: relax. Choosing the right wine merits no
more agonizing than achieving featherweight matzo balls. Of course,
you may enjoy the wines recommended here more than others.
</P>
<P>
   A seder is a dinner party, and the usual guidelines apply: for
large groups, consider less-expensive bottles and offer both red
and white. For smaller groups, you may decide to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   Kosher wines can be as expensive as any other category.
Laurent-Perrier, a very good Champagne house, offers a kosher
bottle for around $50, and you can spend $25 to $50 for a cabernet
sauvignon from Herzog, the fine-wine label of Baron Herzog, a big
kosher producer.
</P>
<P>
   You can offer a progression of wines if you like, beginning with
a dry white like the Beckett's Flat semillon from Australia, made
from the same grape as dry white Bordeaux. Follow with a riesling
or a Barbera d'Asti and then a cabernet sauvignon. Finish with a
sweet wine, and not necessarily one of those sticky Concord grape
wines to which many Jews cling sentimentally, but a fine sweet wine
that makes a delicious dessert like the Gan Eden late-harvest
gewurztraminer.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a wine kosher? There is no strict agreement on this
point, though in general kosher wine must be made with equipment
used exclusively for kosher wines and handled only by observant
Jews who use only kosher ingredients. Many kosher wines are
flash-pasteurized _ heated briefly and then brought back to normal
temperature _ although, again, people disagree on whether this is
necessary and how it affects the wines.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that these wines, called mevushal, can be handled by
the general public and remain kosher. Yet not all kosher wines are
mevushal, and it's only occasionally clear from the label whether a
wine is or is not. Regardless, these wines are good first and
kosher second.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's Flat, Semillon, Margaret River, Australia, 1999, $26
</P>
<P>
   A zesty dry wine with appealingly fruity aromas and citrus
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Gan Eden, Late Harvest Gewurztraminer (umlaut over u), Monterey
County, 1997 $12.50
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully balanced sweet wine with classic floral aroma. and
honeyed fruit flavor. A great value.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog Special Reserve, Cabernet Sauvignon, Alexander Valley,
1997 $26
</P>
<P>
   Rich and concentrated yet soft and easy to drink, with aromas of
plum, cassis and menthol.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Herzog, Chenin Blanc, Clarksburg, 1999 $7
</P>
<P>
   Slightly sweet yet bright and refreshing, with peach and grassy
aromas and citrus flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Hagafen, Johannisberg Riesling, Napa Valley, 1999 $14
</P>
<P>
   Slightly sweet and almost dry with peach and lemon flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Bartenura, Barbera d'Asti, 1998 $8
</P>
<P>
   Almost purple, grapey but dry and nicely acidic. Pleasant and
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various
Manhattan wine shops.

RICE PUDDING FROM FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  This is the seventh of eight columns by Christian Delouvrier, the
executive chef at Lespinasse in Manhattan. They are being written
with Melissa Clark. 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a child, I would spend Sundays in my grandmother's
kitchen in Toulouse, watching her prepare dinner on a coal-burning
stove. In fact, seeing her take command of those meals was one of
my first inspirations to become a cook.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the delicious dishes she made, one of our favorites was a
dessert she called riz au lait. Although I usually translate it as
rice pudding, that term doesn't really describe her marvelous
confection.
</P>
<P>
   Made without eggs, her dessert did not firm up like a typical
custard-based pudding. Instead, she kept it soft and soupy, cooking
the rice with plenty of milk and sugar until it swelled and
fattened, hardly resisting the tongue when you ate it. The sauce
was creamy, gently flavored with vanilla and a bay leaf. Nourishing
and plain-looking, it was still, in its way, a sophisticated and
subtle creation.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother spent hours and hours simmering the rice. She
left it all morning long on one side of her hot cast-iron stove,
which kept the mixture at the right temperature, just below a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Since she was usually nearby preparing the rest of the meal, she
often stirred and checked the rice, adding cold milk if the mixture
got too hot or too dry. Slowly, the rice drank up most of the
liquid, absorbing its sweet flavor along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this method is quite impractical for a restaurant
kitchen and for most cooks at home, too. So my pastry chef, Chris
Broberg, and I adapted it.
</P>
<P>
   First we blanch the rice with the bay leaf to begin the cooking
and rid the rice of excess starch. Then we transfer the rice and
bay leaf to a baking dish, adding milk, sugar and a vanilla bean,
and half submerge the baking dish in hot water. A sheet of
parchment is set directly on top of the rice and left there while
it bakes.
</P>
<P>
   The water bath keeps the rice from cooking too quickly, while
the parchment holds the moisture in, ensuring that the rice plumps
up before the liquid evaporates. The rice still has to bake for two
hours, but you don't have to stir or even watch over it at all.
</P>
<P>
   As the rice cooks, the parchment paper catches the steam and
rises slightly, turning brown. If you let the parchment rest on the
rice after pulling it from the oven, the brown color (which is
really just caramelized milk on the surface) bleeds into the milky
white pudding. So to keep the color pristine, peel the paper off
the rice as soon as it comes out of the oven.
</P>
<P>
   MARIE LOUISE'S RICE PUDDING
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 2{ hours
</P>
<P>
   { cup long-grain rice
</P>
<P>
   1 very small bay leaf or { large bay leaf, preferably fresh
</P>
<P>
   1 quart milk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   { vanilla bean, split in half crosswise
</P>
<P>
   { cup creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Put rice and bay leaf in a small
saucepan, and add 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, then immediately
drain rice and transfer rice and bay leaf to an 8-inch-square
baking pan, and stir in the milk, { cup sugar and vanilla bean.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit inside pan, and place
it directly on top of rice mixture. Place pan inside a larger
baking pan and fill larger pan with enough very hot water to reach
halfway up sides of small pan. Bake rice until it is very tender
and much (but not all) of the liquid is absorbed, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, prepare caramel syrup. In a small saucepan over
medium-high heat, combine remaining sugar with 2 tablespoons water.
Cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Raise heat to high, and let
mixture cook without stirring until it caramelizes and turns a very
deep amber, about 7 minutes. Carefully add one-third cup water (it
will sputter). Simmer caramel, stirring, until mixture is smooth.
Set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   4. As soon as rice comes out of oven, peel off parchment paper.
Transfer pan to a rack to cool. Pluck out vanilla bean and bay
leaf.
</P>
<P>
   5. Using a whisk or an electric mixer, beat creme fraiche until
it holds soft peaks. Fold it into cooled rice mixture. Serve rice
pudding in bowls with a drizzle of caramel syrup on top.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

UNION CITY, N.J.: THE CUBAN-AMERICAN HEARTLAND, NORTHERN VERSION 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. _ Eyes wide with rage, their voices raw from
shouting, the graying Cuban exiles marched through the streets last
week carrying posters of Elian Gonzalez, votive candles and
American or Cuban flags. Some wept as they chanted ``Libertad para
Elian'' while others nearly hissed as they offered unkind words for
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly Cuban-born, a number of them former political prisoners,
the 200 or so demonstrators had come from across the New York
metropolitan area to add their voices to the louder, more potent
outcry from their compatriots in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways it was a predictable scene in an unpredictable
place. The protest was not in Miami, but in this densely populated
blue-collar city just across the Hudson from Manhattan, which along
with the other towns of Hudson County is home to the biggest bloc
of Cuban immigrants outside Dade County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than the stereotypical scene of Cuban unanimity, life
in Union City is a window onto the twists, complications and
ambiguities of the Cuban-American experience as it plays out in
``La Zona Norte,'' as Cuban-Americans call the New York
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban immigrants here, for the most part, favor keeping Elian
Gonzalez in the United States, much as their countrymen in Miami
do. But the Cuban population here tends to be more liberal than in
Miami. It is not clustered in an insulated enclave, and is
undergoing suburbanization much like any other ethnic group. And
Union City, which once was dominated by Germans, the Irish and
Italians, became overwhelmingly Cuban for a while, but Cuban
migration and the arrival of new immigrants from elsewhere in Latin
American have significantly cut the Cuban numbers here.
</P>
<P>
   In short, its history is a microcosm of the pull between
assimilation and cultural identity that is the story of the
immigrant experience in America. So even the Cubans who settled
here, then took off for the green suburbs nearby, still return to
Bergenline Avenue on weekends for cups of thick, strong Cuban
coffee, staples like guava paste and yucca or the politically
charged banter that fills the Union City Cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, there's nothing I can't buy in my local
supermarket, but I still come here to shop anyway,'' said Vivian
Ortiz, 39, an insurance adjuster who grew up off Bergenline Avenue
but now lives in suburban Ridgefield. ``It's silly, but I can't get
this place out of my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban roots of Union City can be traced to Lyda and Manuel
Rodriguez, a newlywed couple from the central Cuban town of
Fomento. They were the first Cubans in the area, arriving in 1948,
and when news of their success took hold in Fomento and others soon
followed, many of them finding jobs in the area's embroidery mills.
``When we arrived, everyone was German or Italian,'' Mrs. Rodriguez
said in a telephone interview from her home in Tampa, Fla. ``But
soon enough, that changed.'' By the early 1960's, when it became
clear that Castro had embraced communism, the trickle of Cuban
immigration became a flood.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Miami were alarmed by the surge and pushed federal
authorities to help relocate some of the refugees elsewhere. With
an abundance of manufacturing jobs and a solid Cuban presence,
Union City and nearby towns received many of them. Today, the
largest group of Cubans in Hudson County are from rural Fomento,
unlike Miami, where Havana residents tended to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Albio Sires, 49, the mayor of West New York, whose family
arrived here when he was 11, remembers being the only
Spanish-speaking student in school. By the time he got to high
school in 1967, he said, Cubans were a majority in West New York.
``It must have been very difficult for the Irish and the
Italians,'' he said. ``One day they woke up and they were living in
a Cuban town.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to their views on Castro, there is very little to
distinguish Cubans from Florida and New Jersey. Among the two dozen
people on Bergenline Avenue who spoke about Elian Gonzalez, nearly
all of them thought he should remain in the United States, even if
it meant separating him from his father.
</P>
<P>
   While their antipathy toward Castro rivals that of their
countrymen in Miami, New Jersey's Cubans tend to be less
conservative on social issues and nearly every Cuban-American
official in the state, from Rep. Robert Menendez to the mayors of
Union City and West New York, are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   So when it comes to other issues, like affirmative action,
public assistance and civil liberties, the two communities are
often far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Martinez-Fernandez, chairman of Rutgers University's
department of Puerto Rican and Hispanic Caribbean studies, said
that although Cuban immigrants dominate the Miami political
landscape, in New Jersey they have always had to form political
alliances with other ethnic groups. That, he said, has helped make
them more liberal. ``They have never been able to call the shots
like their brethren in South Florida so their politics are not as
conservative or rabidly Cuba-centered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's proximity to Havana also adds fuel to its impassioned
political climate, one that becomes more inflamed each time a Cuban
refugee turns up on a Florida beach. ``Cuban balseros are not
likely to wash up on the Jersey Shore,'' he said, using the word
for refugees who arrive on rafts.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are only 85,000 Cubans in Hudson County, most
elected officials agree that their political heft far outweighs
their numbers. After Italians, they are the largest group of
foreign-born residents in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubans are one of the most influential groups in the state
because they are so united in purpose, so willing to get involved
and because they vote in numbers disproportionate to their size,''
said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who is a darling of Cuban
exiles and well known in Washington for his hard-line stance
against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, though Cuban refugees are widely credited with
revitalizing a place that had clearly seen better days, ``Havana on
the Hudson,'' as Union City is sometimes called, is beginning to
feel less and less Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   Like the European immigrants who settled here before them, they
are leaving town for suburbs to the north and west. On Bergenline
Avenue, where more than 90 percent of the businesses were once
Cuban-owned, grocery stores and restaurants are more likely to be
run by Colombians, Ecuadoreans, Peruvians and Dominicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who can afford a house in Bergen County these days
seems to be moving,'' said Yolanda Prieto, a sociology professor at
Ramapo College who is writing a book about the area's Cuban
community. ``Still, even though they are leaving Union City in
droves, they aren't going very far from Bergenline Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that only 20 percent of Union City's 60,000
residents are Cuban, down from 80 percent in 1970, but the city is
still the symbolic heart of New Jersey's exile community and a
center for anti-Castro activity. Dozens of cultural clubs,
congregations, business groups and political organizations are
based here, as is a branch of the politically influential Cuban
American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And there are still two bus companies that provide direct
service to Miami, one of them named, appropriately enough, Omnibus
La Cubana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like an umbilical cord,'' said Marian Cordova,
the manager of the competing bus line, Astro Eastern, which makes
the trip in 30 hours. But in a sign of the times, she said, fewer
and fewer Cubans are filling the seats. ``Our average passenger
used to be an elderly Cuban visiting family in Miami,'' she said.
``Now they're usually South or Central American, and they're going
to Miami to explore job opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisandro Perez, a sociologist at Florida International
University, said many of the 300,000 who settled in other parts of
the country have been heading south. Dade County now contains 63
percent of the nation's Cubans, he said, up from 42 percent in
1970. ``Miami has become a vacuum sucking Cubans from other
places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the migration is not a one-way street. Union City's mayor,
Raul Garcia, 36, who was born in Cuba but grew up here, said he was
beginning to see a new trend _ many of the childhood friends who
left town after college have been returning, especially to the posh
condominiums sprouting along the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some of it is nostalgia, but look how close we are to
Manhattan,'' he said, sitting at his desk, a small cigar humidor at
his back. ``I think we'll become chic, sort of a Cuban Hoboken.''

FOR CHAMPAGNE, AGE MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the repeal of Prohibition, the ``21'' Club had
little use for its acclaimed secret cellar. With everyone drinking
openly once again, the old hideaway where tout New York had whiled
away the so-called dry years was turned into a wine cave.
</P>
<P>
   When Mario Ricci, the famous sommelier of ``21,'' first took me
through the old speakeasy, its chief attraction, aside from
nostalgia, was the wine that the club's best customers had stored
there. Ricci was particularly proud of the Champagne that prominent
fathers had laid down in anticipation of their daughters' weddings
15, 20 or 25 years hence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But isn't most Champagne meant to be drunk soon after it's
sold?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Ricci said, ``but tell that to a new father.''
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry has done a thorough job of convincing its
clientele that old is better than young. A lot of aged and very
undrinkable wine is sold these days at very high prices. From time
to time, old wines prove to be very good indeed, but far less often
than gullible buyers think.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne is a special case. It is good when it is young, it is
good when it is old. In fact, it is almost two different wines. The
Champagne houses insist that they make it to be drunk when it is
released. Better than 95 percent of the 200 million to 300 million
bottles turned out every year are consumed within a week or two
after their purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But Champagne definitely ages well. It's just not to everyone's
taste or pocketbook when it does.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a remarkable auction of older Champagnes took
place in London. Among the wines sold were Pol Roger from 1892,
1914, 1921 and 1934; a 1907 from Heidsieck &AMP; Co.; Krug from 1947,
1949, 1959 and 1961; and Veuve Clicquot from 1937 and 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stevenson, a British wine writer, sampled many of the
Champagnes before the sale. He concluded that the Pol Roger 1892
and 1914, the Heidseick 1907, and a Moet &AMP; Chandon 1921 were four
of the five greatest wines in the auction, whereas a number of
wines from the 1980s and 1970s were rejected as being past their
peak.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he added, each wine selected for auction was ``in
exceptional condition'' and could still be ``appreciated as
Champagne, which means complete with fruit and fizz, no matter how
old.''
</P>
<P>
   I've had my share of old Champagne, the 1911 and the 1914
Bollinger, with Christian Bizot when he was running that house, and
various bottles from the 1920s and 1930s. But _ and this is a big
but _ every one of those wines, like the wines in the London
auction, came straight from the cellars of the Champagne houses
that made them.
</P>
<P>
   All true Champagne has at least some age before it's sold.
Nonvintage Champagne must be aged for at least a year in the bottle
before it is released for sale, and the bottling cannot take place
until at least Jan. 1 of the year following the harvest. Vintage
Champagne cannot be sold until three years after the harvest.
Actually, most big firms age their nonvintage Champagnes for two to
three years and their vintage for three to five.
</P>
<P>
   Special bottlings, like Bollinger's R.D., may be held in the
cellars for a decade or more. R.D. stands for recently disgorged.
Disgorgement is one of the final steps in making Champagne, in
which the sediment is removed from each bottle before it receives
its dosage, or sweetening, and its final cork.
</P>
<P>
   The sediment, or lees, is composed of dead cells of the yeast
that originally caused the wine to ferment. The lees add to the
wine's body and age. The 1985 R.D., released in 1997, was disgorged
after 11 years on the lees; the 1981 was released late last year
after 18 years on the lees.
</P>
<P>
   These wines are available on special order. So are older Krugs
and some Pol Rogers _ not including the 1914 Pol Roger, which was
disgorged in 1944, 30 years after it had first been bottled and is
apparently still in excellent condition.
</P>
<P>
   All these wines have been aged by the people who made them,
though. Enthusiasts with temperature-controlled cellars can age
their own Champagne. Some Champagne fans believe that the long
pre-disgorgement aging should be followed by a long
post-disgorgement aging. A wine that is high in acidity, even after
being disgorged, could probably do with another decade of aging,
these Champagne fanatics insist.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but keep in mind that these practices have nothing
to do with that bottle of Dom Perignon you stashed away in a hall
closet five years ago. It might be OK; it could also be dead as a
doornail. Champagne, real Champagne, is fine wine and must be cared
for like any fine still wine.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, drinking old Champagne is a connoisseur's game, and
the Champagne makers are the last to encourage it. In the Champagne
country east of Paris, they like their bubbles fresh and lively.
With good reason: there is as much to say for the vivaciousness of
a newly released good Champagne as there is for an old mellow one.
</P>
<P>
   As an aperitif, which is the way most of us drink Champagne, its
liveliness and elegance give a lift to the party, and its sharp
acidity clears the palate for the meal to come. And compared with
good Bordeaux and Burgundy, the price of young Champagne is quite
reasonable. An extra bottle or two won't seriously lighten anyone's
wallet.

`PINK MOON' SHINES BRIGHTLY ON VOLKSWAGEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the name of the song in the current Volkswagen Cabrio
commercial in which teens are driving to a party in a convertible
Cabrio at night?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.G., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: That's ``Pink Moon'' by Nick Drake, and it's included on a
1992 CD re-release of the ``Pink Moon'' album he recorded 20 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Volkswagen commercial began airing, the album has
returned to the bestseller charts _ it's currently in the Top 50 of
all music sold by Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which Volkswagen calls ``Milky Way,'' also has its
admirers. ``The `Milky Way' commercial is so beautiful, so honest
in ways that supersede the very purpose of advertising that it
makes me want to cry like a baby at its grand statement,'' Joey
Sweeney writes in Philadelphia Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy ``Pink Moon'' online and find out about 11 other
Volkswagen commercials at the company's Web site: www.vw.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which state is the ``Buckeye State''?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.L., Wyckoff, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ohio, which got that name from the Ohio Buckeye tree that
grows primarily in the Mississippi and Ohio Valley regions.
</P>
<P>
   The nickname was popularized by the 1840 presidential campaign
of William Henry Harrison of Ohio, who adopted a buckeye log cabin
and canes as his symbols.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of informally calling its athletic teams
``Buckeyes,'' Ohio State University officially adopted the name in
1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the trees and their nuts are of little practical
use,'' an Ohio State history states. ``The wood does not burn well,
the bark has an unpleasant odor, and the bitter nut meat is mildly
toxic. Still, the tree has grit. It grows where others cannot, is
difficult to kill, and adapts to its circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the 1960s animated series ``Mighty Heroes'' available on
video?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.O.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Toon Tracker, a mail-order source for hard-to-find cartoons,
sells a 90-minute video containing 12 episodes of the series for
$25.
</P>
<P>
   For ordering information, write to Toon Tracker, Box 143,
Rochester, WI 53167, or visit the Web site
toontracker.hypermart.net.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Mighty Heroes,'' created by animator Ralph Bakshi, were
Cuckoo Man, Diaper Man, Rope Man, Strong Man and Tornado Man.
Bakshi later directed the animated films ``Fritz the Ca,t''
``Wizards'' and ``Lord of the Rings.''

PLOTTING THE MYSTERIOUS FLIGHT OF SNOWY OWLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eliminates photo)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WILSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The owl, white-faced and yellow-eyed, silently watches a raft
of black ducks floating in the saltmarsh off the windswept Duxbury
Beach. With a few pumps of her enormous wings, the owl sets upon
the surprised flock, grabs an unlucky victim with powerful taloned
feet and carries it skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner is served.
</P>
<P>
   Snowy owls, masters of the Arctic tundra, have long made
Massachusetts their winter home, coming down from the frigid, dark
polar regions for the abundant food in New England. Here, these
ghost-white birds leave an indelible impression on all who see
them, whether they're snatching ducks in Duxbury or patrolling for
rats on the grasslands at Logan Airport in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, precisely because the birds nest across a vast, largely
inaccessible region from Siberia to Northern Europe, scientists
know far less about snowy owls than they do about other great birds
of prey like the bald eagle and peregrine falcon. A population
estimate is hard to come by, and efforts to study the birds in
their winter quarters have raised as many questions as they answer:
for no apparent reason, their numbers in Boston fluctuate widely
from dozens in some winters to none at all in others.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers hope that the duck hunter in Duxbury and five
other owls will help them solve the mysteries of the snowy owls,
from their population trend to the forces that determine their
nomadic wanderings. With transmitters strapped to their backs,
these birds will be tracked by satellite over the next 1 to 2
years, allowing scientists to know where they go, where they hunt,
and perhaps even how they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about them excites me,'' said Denver Holt, founder
of the Owl Research Institute in Charlo, Montana, and one of two
key researchers behind the transmitter project. ``Do snowy owls
wander randomly or do they know . . . they can go somewhere else if
they find no (food in one area). Will we see any predictable
movement patterns over time?''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials say the transmitters will greatly speed
up scientific progress in understanding the owls, allowing
conservation officials to confront potential threats such as heavy
metal pollution recently discovered in the Arctic or the legal
hunting of owls in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our learning curve is going as fast as the technology will let
us,'' said Thomas French, assistant director of the Massachusetts
Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Birders and owl researchers know that many snowy owls spend the
winter somewhere in a swath that starts in the Pacific Northwest
and extends eastward through the Canadian prairie Provinces,
northern tier states and Great Lakes and New England. What's hard
to predict is where and when the owls will congregate in the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike migratory birds that follow the same paths to the same
places year after year, snowy owls follow no obvious pattern.
Researchers who apply identification bands to the owls at Logan
Airport, led by Norman Smith of Massachusetts Audubon's Blue Hills
Trailside Museum, have caught as many as 43 snowy owls in a season
and as few as zero.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, ornithologists know by observation and examining
regurgitated owl pellets what snowy owls eat and how they spend
their time while wintering in New England. But the researchers can
only shrug if you ask them where the snowy owls go in April and
May. They don't know what route the birds take or where they're
going. They don't even know whether the birds prefer to nest near
an ample supply of lemmings _ the birds' main food source _ or
whether the owls are loyal to the same nest year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking animals by attaching satellite transmitters has been an
important research tool since the 1980s. The ``charismatic
megafauna'' of the Arctic _ caribou, grizzly and polar bears, musk
ox and whales _ have been tracked and retracked. Even smaller fauna
such as geese and ducks have been extensively studied. But, until
now, snowy owls, the most nomadic and unpredictable of all the
North American owls, have been overlooked, in part because they
have no political constituency, such as a hunters' advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith of Audubon and Holt of the Owl Research Institute
have been studying snowy owls for years with Smith studying them on
the New England wintering grounds and Holt prying into their summer
nesting areas around Barrow, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Holt have affixed transmitters to six snowy owls. Holt
captured his snowy owls (two males and a female) last July on the
nesting grounds in Alaska. Smith netted his owls (two females and a
male) at Logan Airport, releasing them on Duxbury Beach over the
past three months.
</P>
<P>
   The transmitter weighs little more than an ounce and is held to
the bird's back by Teflon straps across the animal's chest that the
owls seem to barely notice. Dental floss and glue join the straps
at cross points so the transmitters don't slip or chafe.
</P>
<P>
   Microcomputers inside the transmitters send a periodic signal to
any one of four National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
satellites in low polar orbits. Initially, the transmitter signals
for eight hours every 200 hours _ though the frequency of signals
will increase at key times _ and staff at the Snake River Raptor
Refuge in Idaho gather the data and e-mail each researcher with
updates.
</P>
<P>
   Already, just a few weeks after their release, the Massachusetts
birds are behaving in unexpected ways, to the delight of the
researchers. One owl, a male, had already travelled 250 miles to
the northwest at last satellite check-in, reaching an area just
west of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The two other owls, both caught more recently at Logan and
released at Duxbury Beach, are still in the state. The female is
hanging out near Sandy Neck in Barnstable, while the other male
headed north to George's Island and then Hull.
</P>
<P>
   These three animals may serve as a living rebuttal to the
once-conventional wisdom about the owls that come to New England.
Researchers once believed that they came here in high numbers
mainly when the supply of lemmings and other food sources in the
north was low, leaving these birds both desperate for a meal and
with a poor chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific literature says these birds (in Massachusetts)
supposedly aren't going to make it back to the Arctic. The
literature says that these birds come here to die. But we've had
birds that have returned to the Arctic (based on banding
returns),'' said Smith, noting that one bird is already well on his
way home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What stimulates these birds to move? No one has a clue and we
wouldn't have a clue to where these owls are without the
transmitters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some 4,500 miles from Boston on the other side of the
continent, three other snowy owls, released in the Barrow area last
July, are also moving in ways that surprise the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Two owls have left Alaska altogether, crossed frozen areas of
the Chukchi Sea, flown south of the Arctic Circle past St. Lawrence
Island in the Bering Sea and across to the Siberian peninsula
Chukotskiy Poluostrov, nearly 700 miles from Barrow.
</P>
<P>
   The Owl Research Institute's third tagged bird, a male, presents
a mystery. The transmitters relay temperature. This bird's pack is
cold and has not moved since mid-December. That means that either
the owl has died or the transmitter has fallen from the bird.
</P>
<P>
   Although the snowy owls are not listed as threatened or
endangered, that reflects ignorance as much as studies of the
species' good health. For instance, snowy owls may face more human
predators than records suggest: the owls are hunted legally in four
game management areas in Alaska, as long as the birds are eaten or
used for clothing, and the Inuit in Canada shoot an unknown number
of snowy owls. In addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that large
numbers of snowy owls may be trapped for food in remote areas of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Holt hope to attach more transmitters to snowy
owls in the winters ahead. Smith has funding both from an anonymous
donor and a small grant from the Nuttall Ornithological Club at
Harvard University to tag more owls. Holt looks to a five-year
horizon and support from foundations and private donors to fund his
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take many years to unravel this,'' said Holt.

 &HT;    Chairs for charity
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, April 13.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Metro Atlanta Furniture Bank no longer simply
cherishes its future. It's accessorizing it, too.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit organization, which provides furniture to the
needy, is sponsoring its sixth annual fund-raiser in which local
and national artists and interior designers take an unfinished
chair frame and get really creative. The chairs are then auctioned
at a gala.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new twist, organizers of Chairish the Future are adding
tables, lamps, mirrors and other decorative items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to broaden the appeal of the event and make it as
accessible to as many people as we can while giving our artists the
opportunity to stretch their creativity,'' said J.Ed Marston, the
furniture bank's assistant director.
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's national participants will be Maya Lin,
designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. The artist
is donating a chaise she designed for Knoll. Other designers and
manufacturers include Dakota Jackson, Bernhardt and Lowenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Marston expects the event to feature some 100 chairs, many of
which were designed from a basic frame donated by Shelby Williams
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most Atlantans, I'm very fortunate to have a nice,
well-furnished home, a job and the ability to care for myself, and
I consider myself lucky,'' said Joe Urban, an artist who
participates each year. ``Unfortunately, there are too many people
in this city who are struggling just to provide shelter for
themselves and their children. I'm excited that my art can help
these people make their homes more livable.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's auction and gala raised more than $35,000. ``It blew
everything before it out of the water,'' Marston said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairs will be on display at Lenox Square mall, in Atlanta,
on April 22-29, during which silent bids can be made. Final bids
will be accepted during an April 30 gala and live auction at
Maggiano's Little Italy restaurant.

 &HT;    Sharing treasured gifts keeps connections alive
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, April 13.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many fine gardeners stand firm on the grand tradition
of sharing plants. My mother, for example, used to say with great
conviction: ``Plants should not be bought; they should only be
shared. Or pinched.'' (As in her telling a friend, ``Honey, that
plant sure is pretty, but it could stand a pinching. I'll do it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Each time Mother got a pinch, or a whole plant, she started
growing a relationship that always reminded her of the giver. Gift
plants in her home and garden spoke volumes about the people and
times she'd known and loved. So it goes for us all: Pass-along
plants act as connective tissue binding present, past and future.
</P>
<P>
   While shared plants certainly deserve the attention we give
them, they are not alone in enriching our connections. A good many
gardening gifts have been passed along to me, including a watering
can, a shovel, a trowel and fork. A reference book. Each one has _
and tells _stories.
</P>
<P>
   The watering can belonged to the late Celestine Sibley. I don't
know how old it is, but it is a work of art. Great form and
function. Designed for plain utility, but also with
unself-conscious style and elegance, the metal can has aged to a
lovely gray. Wavy, raised markings decorate one side. They look
like old-fashioned plants to me.
</P>
<P>
   The long-spouted can was given to me by Celestine's
granddaughter, Celestine Sibley Fleming, who writes and gardens and
lives with joy and passion, talents reflecting those of the
beloved, departed family matriarch whose name she shares. Noting
the quarter-century friendship I had with Celestine, Sibley said of
the metal treasure, ``I know my grandmother would want you to have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A treasure of words and pictures came through the mail, a gift
from newspaper colleague Rheta Grimsley Johnson. Rheta, a soulful
writer who has more frequent-driving miles than any scribe I know,
found the book ``at the bottom of a box in a junk store in
Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   What a find it is, this hefty volume, ``The Practical Book of
Outdoor Flowers'' by Richardson Wright, published in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   His wisdom and wit show up early, reminding me, philosophically,
of one of Rheta's gardening-writing heroes, Henry Mitchell, and of
Celestine: ``It is unwise to make a garden your master. Enjoy your
gardening. Have a sense of humor about it. It is not the whole of
life; it is a necessary part of a full life.''
</P>
<P>
   Verna Blackstock, Decatur gardener and cook extraordinaire,
would agree. She shared part of her full gardening life with me _
the cast-aluminum trowel and fork for scratching in the dirt and
unearthing weeds. ``Maybe you can use these up on your mountain,''
Verna said, knowing I needed all the help I could get with that
rocky top in Fannin County.
</P>
<P>
   And the shovel. It belonged to my father, who for decades used
the sharp-edged tool with a 4-foot handle to dig in his Meridian,
Miss., garden. Until, finally, he could garden no more. And live no
more.
</P>
<P>
   I continued to press the shovel into service until last year,
when it finally gave out, its handle breaking during a dig. The top
of the handle, well-crafted wood and metal, remains art, like the
watering can.
</P>
<P>
   That can continues to serve. Its first job in my garden was to
water a chinaberry tree, one of several Celestine and I got as
gifts (along with a sumptuous meal) from friend Britt Flowers in
Newnan, Ga., several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, my pass-along chinaberry is blooming this year, for the
first time. Celestine would enjoy that.

   Southern Living Landscape Book
</P>
<P>
   Edited By Steve Binder. Oxmoor House. $24.95. 416 pages.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Overview: Count this one among the must-haves for your
library. This book has the goods on stunning garden makeovers,
step-by-step techniques for creating landscape plans and expert
advice on plants, structures and layout. There's even a local
connection: Atlanta landscape architect Bill Stewart's magnificant
back yard is one of the dozens featured.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Not-to-miss sections: ``Planning With Purpose,''
``Understanding Your Site,'' ``Principles of Landscape Design'' and
``Designing Your Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recommended for: Anyone who gardens, or wants to. Would make a
good housewarming gift.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bottom line: This one's a keeper. The pictures alone provide
loads of info.
</P>

   Wildflowers of Georgia
</P>
<P>
   By Hugh and Carol Nourse. University of Georgia Press. $29.95.
83 pages.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Overview: More of a picture book than a tomb with a lot of
text. And with 85 of the most beautiful photographs imaginable _
that's just fine. ``This book is a photographic celebration of the
diversity and beauty of Georgia's wildflowers. It is not a
systematic treatment; these are just some of the best photographs
we have made during our eight-year odyssey around the state,''
write the Nourses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Not to miss sections: The entire book is a
</P>
<P>
   visual delight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recommended for: Wildflower lovers, nature lovers, hikers _
anyone who is wise enough to appreciate the beauty of the outdoors.
Schoolteachers should get a copy of this one; it's never too early
to teach young ones about Georgia's plant life.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bottom line: These pictures are worth several hundred words
and at least $29.95.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Inspiration, Decoration: Starting Points for Stylish Rooms
</P>
<P>
   By Judith Wilson. Simon &AMP; Schuster. $35. 160 pages.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Overview: ``Starting points'' is an apt description of this
book. It has eight major topics to peruse; the chapters on color,
fabric and natural light were most useful. Least effective were
radiant space, minimal dimension and travel. ``Colors demand an
instant and personal response from every individual. Once a color
is introduced onto walls or into furnishings, it automatically
becomes a focal point.'' This isn't hot-off-the-press news, but it
provides a good point to ponder. Some good hands-on information.
Nice chatty writing style.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Not to miss sections: Excellent photo-
</P>
<P>
   graphs throughout.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recommended for: People who already know what they want in a
home but likes to see how the other half lives. Also, a good
starting point for someone who doesn't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bottom line: A decent investment, if you've got $35 to spare.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Soft on Microsoft
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The consulting firm founded by Ralph Reed, former leader of the
Christian Coalition, apologized Tuesday for encouraging ``a small
number of individuals'' to express their views about the Microsoft
case to George W. Bush, and said it would halt the contacts.
Century Strategies was never ``retained for the purpose of
influencing Governor Bush'' and was hired before Reed began working
for Bush's campaign, the firm said, adding that although Reed is a
senior consultant to the Bush campaign, he has never asked the
candidate to take a position on the government's antitrust case
against Microsoft. The firm did, however, admit to encouraging
citizens ``to express their views to presidential candidates of
both parties,'' including Bush. All this came after The New York
Times reported that Microsoft hired Reed more than a year ago to
get Bush to support the Microsoft position if he wins in November.
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer told The Associated Press Tuesday that
Reed ``never talked to the governor about Microsoft. There's been
no personal lobbying.''

   OHIO _ CROSSROADS OF CAMPAIGNING
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore drew a diverse crowd of kids in blue jeans and adults in
business suits to a town meeting at Vandalia-Butler High School in
Vandalia, Ohio, a Dayton suburb. Tuesday, Ohioans got a double dose
of presidential campaigning. Gore visited classes and ate lunch
with students in Columbus as part of his pledge to spend a day at a
school every week or two during the campaign. He spent the night
before at the home of a teacher and her family. George W. Bush, was
unveiling his ``New Prosperity Initiative'' in Cleveland: a $42
billion plan to give the working poor credits for health insurance
and rental vouchers for home down payments. He also plans to offer
tax credits for banks that match the savings deposits of poor
people.
</P>
<P>
   RUNOFFS IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats were vying in Texas Tuesday for the right to run
against Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in November, while two
Republicans sought the nomination for retiring GOP Rep. Bill
Archer's seat. In the Senate race, retired military lawyer Gene
Kelly, who lost six previous statewide races, and Charles Gandy, a
former one-term state representative, emerged from a field of five
Democrats in the March 14 primary. Hutchison will be the heavy
favorite in November. Oilman Peter Wareing and state Rep. John
Culberson vied in a Republican runoff for Archer's seat.
</P>
<P>
   RUDY AND THE LIBERALS
</P>
<P>
   Third parties in New York have always had an influential
following in New York, and state Liberal Party chief Ray Harding
says Republican Rudy Giuliani is seeking the party's endorsement in
his Senate race. Harding said the party's policy committee would
meet May 6 to interview Giuliani and other candidates. But state
Conservative Party chief Michael Long said that Giuliani ``would be
shutting the door to possible Conservative Party backing'' it he
went after the Liberals' nod. Giuliani would use Liberal Party
support, according to the New York Daily News, to try to blunt
Hillary Rodham Clinton's criticism that he's ``out of step'' with
moderate New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   RUDY AND THE LADIES WHO LUNCH
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani began a series of statewide ``Women for Rudy''
lunches to reinforce his support among Republican female voters, a
group that has largely remained loyal as polls show that his
reaction to the fatal shooting of Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed
black man, has caused a drop in his support among men. At the
Women's National Republican Club in midtown Manhattan, Giuliani
received a hero's welcome from 250 guests, many of whom said they
felt better off because of the mayor's fight against crime and his
economic policies. Today, Giuliani has slated a ``Women for Rudy''
lunch in Rochester and a ``women's town hall meeting'' in Buffalo.
On Thursday, Giuliani is to attend a ``women for Rudy'' lunch in
Mineola, on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   OK TO TALK ABOUT ELIAN IN OHIO, BUT MAYBE NOT IN FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to win the hearts of a roomful of undecided voters in
Ohio, Al Gore broke his recent silence and shared his views on the
custody dispute over Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban refugee.
Gore said the Elian's relatives should be allowed to try to work
out among themselves the escalating custody dispute over the boy:
``With tensions as high as they are and with both sides trying to
figure out a way to come to a resolution, I think that we need to
encourage the talks between the family members themselves. Let the
entire family, including the Florida relatives, talk with one
another without people from the U.S. government or the Cuban
government or lawyers on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW POLL HAS BUSH BUSTING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has pulled slightly ahead of Al Gore, 50 percent
to 41 percent, in a new CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. Eight percent
had no opinion, and 1 percent chose ``other.'' A poll taken March
30-April 2 had Bush and Gore in a statistical tie, 46 percent to 45
percent. The poll has a 3 percentage point margin of error. In a
hypothetical race with the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan, according
to the poll, Buchanan takes a tiny slice of voters from Bush, who
drops to 48 percent, with Gore still at 42 percent and Buchanan
with 4 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   SO, WILL IT BE COHEN FOR V.P.?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton favors Defense Secretary William Cohen as Al
Gore's running mate, according to the Christian Science Monitor.
The newspaper said that was revealed by ``friends of the president
who have had conversations with him in recent days.'' Clinton, the
Monitor reported, ``sees Cohen, a Republican, as a ticket-sharer
that would give Gore the help he needs to win ... among moderate
Republicans and independents'' _ and that ``Gore knows Clinton has
one of the country's best political minds.''
</P>
<P>
   SOME GAYS STILL FEELING LEFT OUT
</P>
<P>
   During his hard-fought primary campaign when he was seeking the
support of conservatives, George W. Bush refused to meet with gay
Republicans or representatives of the 11,000-member Log Cabin
Republicans. Now, Bush's first-ever meeting with gay Republicans
may bolster his ``compassionate conservative'' image, but it has
has irked Log Cabin leaders. Bush's invitation-only meeting
Thursday in Austin, Texas, is to be with 13 gay Republicans,
including rank-and-file Log Cabin Republican members. Among those
not invited were leaders of the Log Cabin organization, which had
endorsed John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   CAUTION: TEXAS MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   Texas has had one of the nation's worst public health records
for decades. More than a quarter of its citizens have no health
insurance; it ranks near the top in the nation in rates of AIDS,
diabetes, tuberculosis and teenage pregnancy _ and near the bottom
in immunizations, mammograms and access to physicians. Since George
W. Bush became governor in 1995, he has not made health a priority,
his aides acknowledge, or made a speech on the subject. In 1999,
his administration fought unsuccessfully to limit access to the new
federal Children's Health Insurance Program in 1999. But with
health care near the top of the political agenda, The New York
Times reports that Bush is planning to start discussing health
issues soon, possibly as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S ALL ABOUT CONTROL
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush began taking control of the Republican National
Committee by naming a former Texas party chairman, Fred Meyer, head
of the RNC Victory 2000 campaign. Meyer chaired the Texas GOP from
1988 to 1994, helping it reverse years of Democratic rule, and was
a senior adviser in Texas Sen. Phil Gramm's failed 1996
presidential campaign. Bush campaign officials noted that Meyer is
close to John McCain. Bush also moved his campaign political
director, Maria Cino, to the RNC, where she will be a deputy for
political and congressional relations. And Jeanne Johnson Phillips,
one of Bush's original Texas fund-raisers, will be RNC deputy
chairman for finance.
</P>
<P>
   GORE'S MOM GETS HER BACHELOR'S
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's mother, 88 and frail, returned Monday to the club _
then men's only _ where she was thrown out in 1971. Shortly after
that, the club opened its dining room to women. Her son saluted her
there for teaching ``through quiet dignity and deliberation one
woman can make all the difference.'' Pauline LaFon Gore was at the
Nashville City Club to receive an honorary bachelor of arts degree
from Union University, a private Baptist school in West Tennessee,
where a scholarship was established in her name. She was to have
traveled to the university campus in Jackson to receive her degree,
but because of her health the event was moved to the club in
Nashville where she was ousted as a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   THE UNFRIENDLY SKIES
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before last week's Senate primary in Pennsylvania,
according to Roll Call and the Washington Times, Democratic Rep.
Ron Klink and Republican Sen. Rick Santorum found themselves
sitting directly across the aisle from one another on a commercial
flight from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. The news outlets reported
that the flight attendant recognized Klink, a four-term House
member and former TV newscaster, and wished him well in his Senate
challenge to Santorum, then asked him for an autograph. Santorum
apparently isn't as recognizable. ``Nary a word on the flight was
exchanged between the House member and the senator,'' Roll Call
said.

   For almost 80 years, first in Russia and then in America, Dora
Solganik of Cleveland has been performing the gefilte fish ritual
for Passover: schlepping to the fish market, choosing the best fish
``by the look in its eyes,'' and transforming it into the
quintessential Seder dish.
</P>

   Using a wooden bowl and a half-moon-shaped chopper, she cuts up
the fish with onions, crying a little, chopping a little, until her
mix is just the right consistency. Then she molds it into oblong
patties. Every year she makes 25 pounds, and this year, her 94th,
is no different. Solganik, though, is increasingly the exception.
</P>
<P>
   More and more people have been turning to commercially prepared
frozen loaves of ground fish, sometimes even spiked with almonds
and raisins or jalapenos. These new, more American flavors are
rapidly replacing the classic, fishy-tasting blends, made from
carp, whitefish and pike, and the smooth texture indicates they
have never felt the blade of a hand chopper.
</P>
<P>
   One company, A&AMP;B Famous Gefilte Fish in Monsey, N.Y., boasts
that its blend is ``the way Grandma made it ... such gefilte fish
with so little effort.'' The emphasis is on efficiency and
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Gefilte fish became a Passover staple because of a suggestion in
the Talmud to eat fish. Since cooking on the Sabbath is prohibited,
the fish balls were cooked in advance and served cold. Eventually
gefilte fish became the Eastern European first course for holiday
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything Jewish, gefilte fish (literally ``filled fish'')
has had quite a journey. Eve Jochnowitz, a culinary ethnographer in
New York, said: ``The first ancestors of gefilte fish came from
France in the late Middle Ages, where a couple of the oldest
cookery manuscripts include stuffed fish mixtures with almonds and
saffron.''
</P>
<P>
   The mixture was always stuffed back into the skin and baked in a
crust or poached, with leftover filling formed into patties,
covered with fish skin and simmered in the same pot. Later, the
artful but laborious stuffing step was discarded and the patties
became the gefilte fish eaten today.
</P>
<P>
   Until the new wave of gefilte innovations, the last great change
was fish in the jar, in World War II. Now frozen loaves are taking
over. Brooklyn shops like Ossie's Fish in Borough Park and Raskin's
in Crown Heights create their own mix of whitefish, pike, carrots
and onions.
</P>
<P>
   Among those adventurous enough to make gefilte fish at home, the
latest version comes from immigrants from the former Soviet Union,
who grew up with authentic gefilte fish, stuffed back into the
skin.
</P>
<P>
   Anya Kushner, the cook at Primorski restaurant in Brighton
Beach, Brooklyn, makes gefilte fish year-round from a recipe she
learned growing up in Odessa. First she sautes onions, then grinds
them with carp and whitefish and mixes in egg and seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Although her mother boned the fish, then sewed the skins
together to encase the stuffing, Kushner simply places a few long
sheets of skin on a piece of aluminum foil, fills them with the
chopped fish mixture, then covers it with more skin and encloses
the whole ``fish'' in the foil. She simmers it in a broth colored
red with beets. The result has the look of a whole fish without the
mess.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kushner and other Russians insist that the gefilte fish
mix should be at least 75 percent carp, others prefer at least 50
percent whitefish. But a bigger debate is over horseradish, the
traditional accompaniment for the Passover dish and the symbol of
slavery when the Jews were in Egypt under the pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's indispensable for taste and to clear nasal
passages at this springtime festival, when pollen is in the air;
others liken it to tomato sauce on good ravioli _ all it does is
cover up the flavor. No matter. Along with gefilte fish, red or
white horseradish is as essential to Passover as matzo and four
cups of wine. &QL;

<P>
   New York has plenty of good commercial gefilte fish and real
horseradish. Some stores, as noted below, also sell frozen gefilte
fish. Here are a few favorite sources: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ELI'S MANHATTAN, 1411 Third Avenue, (212) 717-8100, and ELI'S
VINEGAR FACTORY, 431 East 91st Street, (212) 987-0885, sell the
best I have tasted: their traditional premium, made with matzo meal
and flecks of carrot. It is sold by the pint (two pieces) at both
stores, at $12. Traditional gefilte fish is $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   CITARELLA, 1313 Third Avenue and 2135 Broadway, (212) 874-0383,
sells plump full-flavored gefilte made in the traditional torpedo
shape from whitefish, pike, a little sugar, egg and onions. Each
weighs six ounces; $6.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   OSSIE'S FISH MARKET, 1314 50th Street, Borough Park, Brooklyn,
(718) 436-4100, has authentic fresh gefilte fish mix for $5.50 a
pound; frozen gefilte fish comes in rolls in several flavors:
classic, salmon, lemon-dill, almond-raisin, jalapeno, Cajun and
horseradish, $6 each to serve six. All are kosher. Although the
flavors are unusual, the texture of the frozen logs is too rubbery
for my taste. Delivers to Manhattan daily.
</P>
<P>
   RASKIN'S FISH MARKET, 320 Kingston Avenue, Brooklyn, (718)
756-9521, is a very traditional kosher fish market using live carp
for fresh gefilte fish, $4.50 a pound, and ready-made 22-ounce logs
_ sweet and nonsweet _ made with whitefish, pike and mullet for
$4.49 a pound. A traditionalist, I prefer their frozen logs to any
others because they seem to have more texture, with flecks of
carrot for color. Delivery to Manhattan available.
</P>
<P>
   RUSS &AMP; DAUGHTERS, 179 East Houston Street, (212) 475-4880 or
(800) 787-7229, makes fresh gefilte fish, although a little sweet
for my taste, from salmon and whitefish, matzo meal, eggs, onions,
white pepper and fresh dill. It costs $2.49 by the ball and $7.96
by the loaf. Overnight delivery available.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND AVENUE DELI, 156 Second Avenue, (212) 677-0606, makes
very soft patties from whitefish and pike, with matzo meal and
large carrots, very close to homemade. Each is $7, with overnight
shipping available. It also sells strong red horseradish for $5 a
pint.
</P>
<P>
   GUSS'S LOWER EAST SIDE PICKLES, 35 Essex Street, (212) 254-4477,
(800) 252-4877, is certified kosher, with a tradition of
hand-grated red and white horseradish since 1910. An eight-ounce
jar is $7, with overnight shipping available.
</P>
<P>
   MOTHER-IN-LAW'S RUSSIAN GOURMET HORSERADISH, distributed by
Royal Baltic, is so called because it is so hot it might drive away
a mother-in-law. An 8.8-ounce jar, white or red, is $2.59; (718)
385-8300 for stores. &QL;

PARSLEY VARIETIES  
 TASTES OF HUNGARY  
 GOGGLES FOR ONION-CHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Dining)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is there any difference between curly parsley and flat-leaf
(Italian) parsley, other than appearance? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is an important difference: taste.
</P>
<P>
   Curly parsley, with its ruffled leaves, makes an attractive
garnish, but generally has little flavor. Flat-leaf parsley,
preferred by most chefs, has a much more intense taste.
</P>
<P>
   If a recipe doesn't specify which kind of parsley to use, you
may choose either one, though the flat-leaf type will add more
pizazz. However, recipes whose flavor relies on parsley, like a
parsley pesto, will usually call specifically for the flat-leaf
variety. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Having just returned from Budapest, I'd like to know where to
find Hungarian specialties, like paprika sauce or goulash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The Yorkville Packing House in Manhattan, 1560 Second Avenue
(81st Street; (212) 628-5147), sells an array of Hungarian
specialties, including an authentic Hungarian goulash and paprika
sauce. It also has a mail-order service, and there is a Web site
for Hungarian specialties:
http://members.aol.com/HungImprts/Ottos.htm &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any truth to the old wives' tale about burning a
candle next to you as you chop onions to stop your eyes from
tearing?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Unfortunately, there's not. When onions are cut and their
cell structure disturbed, allicin, a volatile substance that
irritates the eyes, is released. Burning a candle does nothing to
diminish the effect of allicin. But, there are other ways to make
chopping onions a less tearful experience.
</P>
<P>
   The first is rather impractical: cutting onions under cold
running water. The water will wash away the allicin before it can
irritate your eyes. However, not only is this somewhat dangerous as
the knife can slip, it will also produce a flavorless, water-logged
onion.
</P>
<P>
   A more convenient method is to chill the onion before cutting
it. The cold will reduce the volatility of the allicin, though
you'll have to chop quickly before the onion warms up.
</P>
<P>
   The last method is probably the most effective, and is the
method I use. As anyone with contact lenses or glasses knows,
creating a barrier between your eyes and the onion vapors works
wonders. If you have perfect vision, you can try wearing sunglasses
(only if your kitchen is very bright and the lenses not too dark)
or investing in a pair of goggles. The kinds sold at hardware
stores are inexpensive, and one pair will fit every onion-chopping
member of your household. &QL; 
 &QL;

SLATTERY RESIGNS AS MANAGER OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank P. Slattery V, who had a phenomenal first year as a
manager of the PBHG New Opportunities Fund but then stumbled over
the past month amid market turbulence, resigned Tuesday and said he
would pursue other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Slattery, who goes by the nickname Quint, joined PBHG in 1998,
after two years at Merrill Lynch, which he joined after graduating
from Princeton University. He began running the New Opportunities
Fund in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Slattery, 27, did not return a telephone call seeking comment on
his departure, which was announced by the company.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ended March 31, the New Opportunities Fund
showed a total return of 533 percent, more than twice the return of
any other mutual fund with assets of at least $30 million,
according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But while the fund had been very volatile for its entire life,
that volatility had increased in March, as the fast-growing
technology stocks that he specialized in came under selling
pressure on some days.
</P>
<P>
   During its first year, the worst period for the fund came last
summer, when it lost 15.2 percent of its value over a period of
slightly under a month. But since the fund peaked March 9, it has
suffered dramatic swings. At its low April 4, it was down 42.1
percent from the peak. It had fluctuated since then, but was still
down 38.5 percent from the peak through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Slattery's strategy called for putting about 80 percent of the
fund's money into the 30 fastest growing companies, and holding
them no matter how high their price rose. The remaining 20 percent
of the fund was used for quick investments, often trying to
anticipate what stocks would get hot, and then selling them after
they had gained a dollar or two.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Slattery said that during the first
year of the fund's existence, it had shown gains of at least 1,000
percent on three stocks: MicroStrategy, SDL Inc. and Infospace.
Each of them peaked in March and has fallen substantially since
then. Through mid-afternoon Tuesday, they were down 33 percent, 53
percent and 85 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Slattery grew up in Villanova, Pa., the son of a leasing company
executive. ``I've been around finance all my life,'' he said last
week.

DALLAS-FORT WORTH RADIO STATION LATEST TO SAY GOODBYE TO `EARL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks aren't the only ones saying goodbye to Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-Fort Worth country station KSCS/96.3, one of only two
major country stations left in the north Texas area, has joined
about a dozen other stations around the nation in opting to pass on
playing ``Goodbye Earl,'' the latest single from the phenomenally
popular Dallas-bred trio.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy started to simmer when ``Earl'' was released on
the band's second disc, the Grammy-winning ``Fly,'' last Aug. 31;
now, more than six months later, it's boiled over because ``Earl''
is in release as a single and is being played in rotation on radio
stations. It's caused one of the biggest flaps in country music
since Garth Brooks' eyebrow-raising video for ``Papa Loved Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' video depicted a truck driver plowing his truck through
a wall of a motel, where, supposedly, his wife was cheating on him.
Violence was more implied than real, though; the song isn't
blatantly violent, and you don't see anyone get hurt in the video.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Chicks' ``Earl'' is about revenge. Two women,
Mary Anne and Wanda, conspire to murder Earl, Wanda's abusive
husband. But the lyrics are far more graphic. A sample:
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked out a plan/And it didn't take them long to
decide/That Earl had to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Chicks condoning violence, or trying to shed light on
abuse?
</P>
<P>
   Let the debate begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our listeners don't wanna hear it,'' says Dean James,
operations manager and program director for KSCS. ``We played it
for a few days, and we got a ton of negative reactions. People were
saying it promotes violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction was overwhelming. This is gonna sound like a
corporate cop-out, but we're gonna do what the majority of our
listeners want us to do, and our listeners are telling us that they
don't want to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda O'Brien, assistant program director at KSCS, says another
reason the station is declining to air it is because it contradicts
its anti-violence campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had raised nearly $200,000 for Project Safe in Dallas,
and the whole point of this place is to teach people how to deal
with their anger,'' she says. ``How do you explain that one week
you're raising money for an organization like this, and the next
week, you're playing a song from the Dixie Chicks that's like, `Oh,
we poisoned Earl.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a different story over at Dallas' WOLF/105.3 FM (The Wolf),
a competing country station that plays ``Earl'' up to seven times a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most requested records we've had, and it has
been since it came out,'' says Smokey Rivers, the station's
assistant program director. ``We haven't had the negative calls and
e-mails. Our audience is younger and I think they understand that
the Chicks are trying to convey a message in a tongue-in-cheek
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence in music has been present from the earliest country
songs to heavy metal to, most recently, hip-hop. Although the
overwhelming majority of the 150 country stations in the United
States are playing the song, the Chicks are touching a nerve with
``Earl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference is, the Dixie Chicks are singing about
violence in a very funny, tongue-in-cheek way, '' says Phyllis
Stark, Nashville bureau chief for magazines Billboard and Country
Airplay Monitor. ``They may be the only ones who can get away with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, this may be a case of new band, old story.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen was attacked for writing about two teens on a
shooting spree in his song ``Nebraska.'' A Johnny Cash video for
``Adelia'' found the Man in Black killing and burying a lover. And
two local bands, the Toadies and Old 97's, have dodged their share
of bullets for writing songs peppered with violent images _ the
Toadies for ``Possum Kingdom'' (the infamous chorus: ``Do you wanna
die?'') and the Old 97's for ``The Other Shoe,'' in which singer
Rhett Miller sings of a husband who kills his cheating wife and her
lover.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Earl's'' a little different: The music is upbeat, lacking
the tension of any of the aforementioned songs; most of the track's
lyrics are laced with humor; and the ``Goodbyyyye Earllll'' chorus,
well, it's downright infectious. It's difficult, in other words,
not to sing along.
</P>
<P>
   That was the whole point, according to Chick Emily Robison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a serious subject and did it in a way that makes it a
little bit easier to listen to,'' Robison said in a prepared
statement. ``Sometimes songs get so serious that they make people
very uncomfortable. `Earl' is meant to be lighthearted and fun, and
if in the process it brings a serious subject to the forefront,
then that's great. We're not promoting murder, and we even say that
in a disclaimer on our album.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based National Coalition Against Domestic Violence
agrees. The organization recently released a statement applauding
the Chicks for ``Earl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject matter of the song is far too often a reality for
battered women,'' NCADV executive director Rita Smith said in the
statement. ``The NCADV wishes to express their gratitude to the
Dixie Chicks for raising public awareness'' of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Some stations have opted to supply phone numbers for the NCADV
and other violence prevention hot lines before or after ``Earl'' is
played.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stations that are afraid of it aren't even giving it that
opportunity,'' says Stark of Billboard and Country Airplay Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a station's listeners really do have a problem with it,
obviously they shouldn't be playing it,'' she says. ``But rampant
political correctness has made some programmers afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as KSCS is vowing not to play it, The Wolf is promising to
keep on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the talk of country music right now. So we're gonna latch
onto it,'' says Rivers of The Wolf. ``When was the last time you've
done a story on a country song that's gotten this much attention?''

outraged survivors of Nazi death camps by challenging the scope of

racist by a High Court judge. Irving sued the American scholar

Tuesday that would make it harder for law enforcement authorities
to confiscate property before they actually bring criminal charges
in narcotics and other cases. The White House is expected to
announce that Clinton would sign the legislation, a compromise
measure approved unanimously by a voice vote of the House of
Representatives. The new law, which was approved by the Senate
three weeks ago, will add significant new safeguards that will make
it more difficult for prosecutors to seize homes, cars and other

   BUSH-POVERTY (Dateline to kum) _ In the third speech designed to
support his claim to being a ``new kind of Republican,'' George W.
Bush outlined a plan Tuesday to give the working poor tax credits
for health insurance and rental vouchers for home down payments. He
also said he plans to offer tax credits for banks that match the
savings deposits of poor people. The $42 billion plan expands on

   WASHINGTON _ To deal with the shortage of skilled workers caused
by rapid technological change, businesses must join with schools to
create a system that integrates work and training for both new and
older employees, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, if we are to remain pre-eminent in transforming
knowledge into economic value, the U.S. system of higher education
must remain the world's leader in generating scientific and
technological breakthrough and in preparing workers to meet the
evolving demands for skilled labor,'' Greenspan told more than 200
government officials, corporate leaders and educators at the
Department of Labor National Skills Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' Greenspan said, ``the pressure to enlarge the pool
of skilled workers also requires that we strengthen the significant
contributions of other types of training and educational programs,
especially those with lesser skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five thousand technology jobs this year won't be filled
as a result of the skills shortage, said Steve Guengerich, whose
Austin-based Knowbility.org provides education and employment
opportunities in information technology for youth and adults with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The country's educational system is responsible for the shortage
of skilled workers, said Ray Marshall, a University of Texas at
Austin professor and former labor secretary. He said high school
graduates in Singapore, for example, have more math and science
skills needed for a technical entry-level position than their
American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore and other technologically advanced countries, unlike
the United States, have standards that define what students should
know before they graduate from high school, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries, ``the student and the teacher become allies
in meeting those standards,'' he explained. ``In American schools,
the teacher and the student become enemies because the student has
to learn only what the teacher wants him to learn. We don't know
what high school students know when they graduate, but with
standards we do.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Texas has made a lot of progress because ``we started developing
standards,'' Marshall added. He said former Gov. Mark White
implemented a system of standards and Gov. George W. Bush, when he
took office, continued the system.
</P>
<P>
   Guengerich agreed that Bush had taken significant steps in
reforming public education in the state. The standards system has
greatly improved the reading and math skills of students coming out
of high school in Texas, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go, but I think we are improving. That's
because we have a system of standards and measurement,'' said
Marshall, UT's chair of economic and public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The skills summit, held on the Howard University campus, was
convened by Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ghosts who have taken up residence at the Royale
Theater are a restless lot, filled with a crackling, questing
vitality rarely found even among the living. As embodied with
disquieting fierceness by Philip Bosco, Blair Brown and Michael
Cumpsty in ``Copenhagen,'' the endlessly fascinating new play by
Michael Frayn that opened Tuesday night, these spectral presences
just won't stop haunting one another with their questions and
revisions and caveats.
</P>
<P>
   Give them the courtesy of your full attention, and you'll find
them taking possession of your own imagination as well, probably
raising your blood pressure in the process. And who would ever have
thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about
atomic physics would be such electrifying companions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Copenhagen,'' a critical and (more surprisingly) popular hit
when it opened in London at the Royal National Theater in 1998, is
nominally about a subject with all the sex appeal of a frozen
flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the venerable Danish physicist
Niels Bohr (Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Cumpsty), his former
pupil and a German, during which no one to this day knows exactly
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   What was said or, equally important, not said takes on increased
significance when you consider the possible stakes: the success of
a German project led by Heisenberg. That project was the
development of atomic weapons, something in which Bohr would later
have a hand as a member of the legendary team at Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking that this means that ``Copenhagen,'' which
has been directed with surgical exactitude by Michael Blakemore, is
a tale of international intrigue, you're on the wrong tangent.
There's tension aplenty in the drama, which allows Heisenberg, Bohr
and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (Brown), to reunite after their deaths
to sort out what may or may not have happened on that September
evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the work's tenacious grip has little to do with
straightforward plot, the essentials of which are laid out early
on, or the solving of questions that are ultimately unanswerable.
</P>
<P>
   Frayn, best known here as the author of the blissful backstage
farce ``Noises Off,'' turns the encounter among the three
characters into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration
of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, to the
fate of the world in the atomic age, to the ways that friendships
go sour; from the theories of complementarity and uncertainty to
the eternal ambiguity of human motives and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressively, Frayn _ with a logic that keeps moving in
variously widening and converging circles for which Blakemore finds
wonderfully theatrical equivalents _ shows how every one of these
elements is bound to, and reflects, the others. The result is the
most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas in many a year and a
work of art that humanizes physics in a way no other has done. And
as fine as the play was in London, it has in crossing the Atlantic
turned from a work of slightly chilly elegance into something of a
fierier vigor.
</P>
<P>
   As Margrethe keeps insisting, everything under discussion, from
politics to the loftiest scientific abstractions, is finally also
personal. In a wonderful speech in the second act, Bohr speaks of
how 20th-century physics restored man to the center of the
universe, of how Albert Einstein demonstrated that ``measurement is
not an impersonal event that occurs with universal impartiality''
but ``a human act, carried out from a specific point of view in
time and space.''
</P>
<P>
   The unknowability of people, even to themselves, has long been a
concern of Frayn's, evident in both his plays (``Benefactors'') and
novels (including the recent, sparkling ``Headlong''). Here he
widens the perimeters to a cosmic level _ if man is the measure of
the universe, then nothing is really quantifiable _ without ever
getting lost in the stars.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a play to see after two martinis; it demands your
thorough concentration. But this critic, who barely squeaked
through a college course known as ``Physics for Poets,'' was moved
to tears not of frustration but of wondering comprehension. Frayn
and Blakemore lead you through the permutations and
interpenetrations of the different versions of what happened on
that one night, and the events that shaped and came out of it, with
care and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an aspect of grand theatrical hokum to
``Copenhagen'' that, in another context, might be hard to take.
This is a play, after all, that asks you to accept a trio of
aggravated phantoms who say things like: ``So why did he do it? Now
no one can be hurt, no one can be betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the hokum both grounds and enlivens the esoterica of the
scientific explanations. It's like combining strong, seemingly
incompatible spices in cooking: using one, as it turns out, lets
you get away with using the other, and they wind up bringing out
hidden notes in each other's flavors.
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit I had doubts when I heard ``Copenhagen'' was being
restaged in New York with an American cast. The actors I saw in
London (David Burke, Sara Kestelman and Matthew Marsh) lent an
exquisite (and utterly un-American) crispness to their performances
in which the enunciation of every word seemed to harbor several
layers of meaning. It was an approach that brought out the play's
poetry and its intellectual gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Working within what is essentially the same set _ a ravishingly
pristine laboratory in limbo, designed by Peter J. Davison and
eloquently lighted by Mark Henderson and Michael Lincoln _ Bosco,
Brown and Cumpsty have introduced their own element of uncertainty
into ``Copenhagen,'' and it pays off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their English counterparts, they appear to be starting
less from the play's language than the feelings behind it. As a
consequence there's a deeper heat to the relationships portrayed
here and a more wrenching sense of personal loss throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Initially it seems as if the performers might not pull it off.
Wearing professorial vagueness like an old sweater, Bosco is the
only one who seems to have found a fully shaped character to play.
Brown and Cumpsty at first register as self-consciously theatrical.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening proceeds, however, with the characters brushing
against one another in different combinations, the resulting
friction causes each to emerge more clearly, and by the end you
feel you have to come to know them all from the inside out, rather
than the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalent, fervid father-son relationship of the two men;
the mixture of sharp marital protectiveness and subliminal
resentment of Margrethe; the dizzying swings between hotly debated
historical abstractions and sad recollections of personal details
that evoke a lifetime of attrition: Bosco, Brown and Cumpsty summon
all this with a passion that scalds.
</P>
<P>
   They also transmit the spirit of ravenous curiosity in the face
of doubt that shapes ``Copenhagen.'' Skepticism may be a dominant
note here: no, we can't ever know exactly who we are or why we do
what we do; yes, we all exist in a state of contingency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet how much more interesting life is as a consequence. Definite
knowledge may be unattainable in ``Copenhagen.'' On the other hand,
aren't you familiar with that sensation of letdown that comes when
you arrive at the end of a mystery novel? In the world of
``Copenhagen,'' no such anticlimaxes are possible. The thrill of
the chase is infinite.

NEW YORK: to read.

<P>
   But Yogi Berra's observation _ it's too crowded; nobody goes
there anymore _ holds true for advertisers: some shy away from the
fat magazines. Gene DeWitt, the chief executive of Optimedia
International (U.S.), an advertising services agency in New York,
said that if advertisers could not get highly trafficked pages in a
packed mag`zine, they might skip that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the business category, we'll discuss Forbes, Fortune and
Business Week and advertisers will say, `Forget about Business
Week, it's too cluttered,''' he said. (Business Week's ad pages
have risen by 28 percent over last year.) ``And in some issues of
Vogue, if you can't get a good spot, you may say to yourself, `Why
would I want to be in there?' They won't drop the magazine
altogether, but a guaranteed position is required.''
</P>
<P>
   Does more advertising mean more articles? Not necessarily. Most
of the obese magazines stray from the norm for the average ratio of
advertising to editorial content, as measured by the Magazine
Publishers of America. The trade group reported last year that the
average ratio for American consumer magazines was 49.4 percent
advertising to 50.6 editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair's March issue was 66 percent advertising; the
February/March Bride's _ with a whopping 1,180 pages of ads, said
Nina Lawrence, the publisher of Bride's _ was 93 percent
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Cona of In Style said that he is careful to monitor the ratio of
advertising to editorial pages, keeping it to an average of about
47 percent editorial to about 53 percent advertising. But the April
issue of In Style had 337 pages of advertising and 235 pages of
editorial content, or about 41 percent editorial to 59 percent
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The March issue of Vogue had 177 pages of editorial and 389
pages of advertising, or about 31 percent to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All that advertising can complicate production. In Style has
grown so big in recent months, there have been delays in getting
the magazine to newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only bind 7,500 copies of In Style per hour, as
opposed to most magazines, where you can bind 11,000 copies per
hour,'' Cona said. ``As you slow down that process, you can have
delivery problems to wholesalers, which gets them out late on the
newsstand, which costs you sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of trucking the magazines has also risen. When In Style
was first published in 1995, 20 magazines fit into one bundle. Now,
only five do. Cona has had to hire extra drivers and trucks and has
also had to buy bigger, deeper newsstand racks _ but of course all
the cost is offset by the surging advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, there are worse problems to have in this world,'' Cona
said. ``As long as it thuds, it's good.'' He said that he is always
gratified when Don Logan, the chief executive of Time Inc., which
publishes In Style, calls to see the early copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drops it on his desk and he listens,'' Cona said. ``And the
louder the thud, the happier he is.''

<P>
   She wears a pink sweater set, pearls and navy pumps. She lives
in a 24-room Victorian mansion with a porch swing, blue willow
china and a Labrador retriever. She plays tennis, rides horses and
belongs to a prayer group. Her office is decorated with a tea set
and a ceramic stallion.
</P>
<P>
   She is Libby Pataki, first lady of New York state, and she knows
how easy she is to typecast. ``Yeah, I'm Waspy,'' she said the
other day, laughing at the admission. ``But not that kind of
Waspy.''
</P>
<P>
   The misconceptions come easily. Mrs. Pataki, 49, is the third of
six children of Col. Henry C. Rowland, an Army officer and diplomat
who had oversight of American military cemeteries in Europe. Her
childhood was spent overseas, in exotic ports of call. Her mother
is French. Sounds pretty snazzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a well-traveled, interesting childhood,'' Mrs. Pataki
agreed. ``But privileged? Well-heeled? No way.'' Again she burst
out laughing, her vivacity a contrast to her husband's phlegmatic
nature. He is said to be a charmer in private, but who would know?
</P>
<P>
   Money was tight, Mrs. Pataki said, especially after her father
retired from the diplomatic corps and had four children in college
simultaneously. She left Clark University in Worcester, Mass.,
after her freshman year to earn enough money to return later. There
was never a summer she did not work, she said, as a waitress or a
mother's helper.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first of her four children was born, there were six
years of glamorous employment, in the personnel department at
Warner Communications and running the international trading
operation at Paine Webber. But Mrs. Pataki saw quickly that her
husband, a lawyer, had political dreams that could not be realized
without a stay-at-home wife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children understand that they have to share their father,''
Mrs. Pataki said. (The children are Emily, 21; Ted, 18; Allison,
15; and George Owen, 12.) ``But there is nothing in the rule book
that says they have to share their mother. One of us gone is bad
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki began his climb in northern Westchester County, as
Peekskill's $6,000-a-year part-time mayor. Mrs. Pataki left the
fast track, living with her in-laws and running the produce stand
at the Pataki family farm, where her husband was raised and her
late father-in-law tended the orchard and vegetable plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Stew Leonard's we're talking about,'' Mrs. Pataki
said, conjuring a picture of herself as a lanky young woman in work
clothes, a baby on each hip, bagging apples and squash.
</P>
<P>
   The farm stand is gone now, and the first lady's widowed
mother-in-law lives with the Patakis in Garrison, in Putnam County,
halfway between the State Capitol and the governor's office in New
York City. Pataki so loves the setting, where eagles soar past the
bedroom window and he can hike the Hudson Highlands, that he tries
to make the 90-minute trip home each night.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting life in the Governor's Mansion was Mrs. Pataki's most
high-profile moment as first lady. ``I think it's very important
for my kids to see me cooking dinner or George cutting a hedge,''
she said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   She has no regrets. ``You have to keep your personal life at the
forefront,'' she said. ``That's what you have left when all this
other stuff is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pataki manages to say this without sounding smug, yet there
is an implied criticism of other first ladies. Could she be
thinking about Hillary Rodham Clinton? Donna Hanover, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's wife? She will not say.
</P>
<P>
   The same polite superiority surfaces when she talks of choosing
which ceremonial events to attend, distinguishing between ``splash
and substance.'' She never goes anywhere ``just to drink
Champagne,'' Mrs. Pataki said, sounding a bit like the junior high
school goody-goody.
</P>
<P>
   The events she chooses to attend, she said, are those that are
enriching for her children. There was the opening of the new
planetarium, which gave George Owen and a few of his friends a
chance to see the exhibit without waiting in line. Or the American
Film Institute gala for Ken Burns, who made a documentary about the
women's rights movement with seed money from a state commission
headed by Mrs. Pataki. It was a mother-daughter affair, and the
first lady took Emily, a junior at Yale, who is recovering from
reconstructive wrist surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, convened by the governor in 1998 for the 150th
anniversary of the first women's rights convention at Seneca Falls,
is Mrs. Pataki's proudest accomplishment as first lady. It produced
literature, maps and historical markers about the feminist movement
in New York state. It seems likely that a $125 million museum
proposed by the commission will be built in Battery Park City.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pataki's desk in the state office suite in New York City is
covered with architectural renderings. Her pride is evident. But
she is prouder that she runs her life ``in an orderly, mature
fashion'' that puts her children first. Of course, a parent is
there in an emergency, as the governor was on the day of Emily's
hand surgery, when he canceled a trip to visit Bill Gates. But Mrs.
Pataki puts the bar lower.
</P>
<P>
   Why, just the other morning, she said, Allison announced
unexpectedly that it was the opening day of softball season. Would
her mother be there and would she bring snacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sweet feeling for a mom to be able to do that,'' Mrs.
Pataki said. She cleared her calendar and baked cookies.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In five years in New York, Richard Farnabe built up a
stellar resume. He started as a cook at Daniel, moved to Jean
Georges and eventually was promoted to executive chef at Mercer
Kitchen. Last year, he was hired away to cook at the Myriad Group's
Berkeley Bar and Grill. Shortly afterward, Tommy Hilfiger's
secretary came in to ask if he would like to cook for her boss.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he was approached by David Rabin, who was
opening a restaurant and needed a chef. Rabin also had a headhunter
seeking prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Farnabe came out on top. He took both jobs, cooking during the
day at Hilfiger's offices and at night at Rabin's Lotus, opening
next month. He had made himself marketable and played his cards
right, just like any young lawyer or investment banker trying to
get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Farnabe's path represents just what has happened in the
restaurant world in recent years. Chefs have gone from being
essentially blue collar workers to true professionals, as much in
demand as athletes. Top players, like Daniel Boulud, Jean-Georges
Vongerichten and Alice Waters, have become brand names, and their
proteges, like Farnabe, use those brands as springboards.
</P>
<P>
   The vibrant economy has only accelerated the shift, with
restaurants opening seemingly by the second _ more than 250
restaurants opened last year in New York City, according to the
Zagat Survey _ and with an American public that has more money and
the ambition to eat well. Cooks who have beefed up their resumes
are more in demand than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they are being lured away from these brand name
restaurants to cook in private homes, where the work is less
grueling and they can command higher salaries. At the same time,
competition among restaurants to find and keep good cooks is
intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most difficult labor market in any
restaurateur's memory,'' said Dennis Lombardi, an analyst at
Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based food-service consulting company.
``We used to have an ample supply of skilled and motivated
employees. Now, we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting chefs' jobs used to be an informal process, driven
largely by word of mouth. But now it is like any other highly
evolved profession: there are headhunters and agents to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them say I'm their secret weapon,'' said Alfred
Ehrlich, the owner of the Kitchen Maestro, an executive-chef search
and consulting concern in New York City, speaking of restaurants.
``And they don't want others to know about me.'' Ehrlich recently
helped Patricia Yeo, the former chef de cuisine at Hawthorne Lane
in San Francisco, become the chef at AZ, a restaurant opening in
Chelsea next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich, who was once a cook at La Reserve and worked in the
wholesale division of Gourmet Garage, is well connected in the
restaurant business. About a year and a half ago, after helping a
number of chefs and restaurateurs find cooks as a favor, he decided
to make a business of it. Some restaurants hire him for a single
deal, paying him a percentage of the chef's first-year salary. But
others, who want protection in the transient restaurant world, put
him on a retainer, so that if the chef he finds leaves, he can
search for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   For Jack's Fifth, for instance, he found Herb Wilson to fill the
chef's position. But Wilson stayed for just a few months. Ehrlich
may soon have to find someone new.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's obviously a need,'' he said. ``Every day I get faxes
from people _ wish lists _ from chefs.'' Both restaurants and chefs
come to him.
</P>
<P>
   He is the reason Sam Hazen became the chef at Rue 57. Ehrlich
heard that Hazen had left Tavern on the Green, and he knew that
Marc Packer, a restaurateur opening Rue 57, was looking for a chef.
He made the match for Packer.
</P>
<P>
   Often, headhunting means poaching cooks from restaurants and
trading them like athletes. Phillip Alfus, an owner of the Alfus
Group, a Manhattan-based search firm, has found chefs for Tavern on
the Green and the Russian Tea Room. He won't steal from friends
like Daniel Boulud and Charlie Trotter, but ``outside of that
group,'' he said, ``everybody is fair game to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Yard, the pastry chef at Spago Beverly Hills, has had
headhunters take pastry chefs away from her. One went to the
Ritz-Carlton on Maui, another to Patina in Los Angeles. Laurent
Manrique, the chef at Campton Place in San Francisco, recently had
a cook lured away.
</P>
<P>
   An oral agreement is the traditional way to retain staff.
Restaurants like the Union Square Cafe and Chez Panisse in
Berkeley, Calif., offer cooks benefits that are standard in other
professions: medical insurance, for example, and paid vacations.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't always offer what wealthy families hiring private
chefs can. Gilbert Pilgram, the chef at Chez Panisse, had three of
his line cooks leave last year, hired away by families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I wasn't frustrated when it happened,'' Pilgram
said. ``Chez has an appeal. And people with money wanted to hire
senior cooks to be their private chefs.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Sherman was one of them. She had cooked at Chez Panisse
for seven years, working nine-hour days producing about 100 meals,
when she left to work for a family. Now, she works about seven
hours a day, cooking just dinner. The family she works for is well
traveled and knowledgeable about food _ and is familiar with Chez
Panisse and its bragging power. ``They definitely get some mileage
out of that, for sure,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Dickey was another. She works for a family in the Bay Area.
She gets to shop at the farmers' market, cooks just four days a
week, makes twice as much money and, she said, finally has the
energy to think about other things. ``Restaurants can really suck
the life out of you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman and a third Chez Panisse cook found their jobs through
Cindy Race and her partner, Susan Flynn, who three years ago
started Four Star Private Chefs, a placement agency in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Race became a private chef herself five years ago, after 17
years in restaurants. It changed her life, she said. ``I was
finally able to drive a car from this decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Most private chefs interviewed for this article said they were
earning at least twice what they made in restaurants and were
working about a third fewer hours. In New York City, salaries for
full-time private chefs hired through agencies start at about
$55,000 a year, said Keith Greenhouse, an owner of the Pavillion
Agency in Manhattan. They can go up to as much as $130,000.
Salaries are comparable in Los Angeles, but lower in San Francisco,
starting at around $45,000 for dinner only, Race said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the median hourly wage for a restaurant cook in New
York City, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was $9.95
an hour, or $22,880 a year. And many cooks have hefty cooking
school loans to repay.
</P>
<P>
   The math is not difficult to do.
</P>
<P>
   With the influx of new money in places like New York City and
Silicon Valley, demand is booming. Steve Kelley, director of career
services at Peter Kump's New York Cooking School, said he gets
calls for private chefs all the time, most recently from young
couples with children. He has placed about a dozen chefs in the
last six months, including one with David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Race also has a busy phone line. ``And I have an unlisted
phone number and I'm not in the yellow pages,'' she said. Many of
her clients are couples in their '30s and '40s, looking for full-
or part-time cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming a big status symbol,'' said Christian Paier, the
owner of Private Chefs Inc., an agency in Beverly Hills. ``It's
like having a personal trainer. Now, anyone who can afford it wants
to have their own chef.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of these families want just any chef. They want names _
brands, if you will _ that they can rely on. Race had a client who
wanted a cook who had worked for Nobu. Greenhouse had one who
wanted a cook from Bouley. Both found them.
</P>
<P>
   Clients are getting younger and younger, said Jo Lynne Lockley,
the owner of the Chefs' Professional Agency in San Francisco; many
are in their early '30s. And they want young chefs. ``These people
hiring someone who had been an executive chef would seem like
hiring their grandfather,'' she said. What they are getting is
talent in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Kelley of Peter Kump's placed a cook with a family in
Southampton, N.Y., the cook was offered jobs by two guests. Now, he
cooks for the three families.
</P>
<P>
   These part-time arrangements, agencies say, are becoming
increasingly popular. Which is no surprise: it is much less
expensive than eating in a restaurant, which in places like New
York can easily cost $30 a person. For $200 to $250 a week, said
Robin Kellner, the owner of the Robin Kellner Agency, a family can
have three dinners prepared by an experienced cook.
</P>
<P>
   James Rafferty left a position as the chef at Boughalem in
Greenwich Village to become a private chef for a magazine publisher
in New York City. Having Bouley on his resume, he thinks, helped
him get the job.
</P>
<P>
   He cooks lunch and dinner for the publisher five days a week and
travels with him occasionally. When he goes to his house in Idaho,
Rafferty goes, too. And he snowboards in between meals. The stress
at his new job, he said, is a fraction of what it was at Boughalem.
</P>
<P>
   He used to work 12-hour days, finishing at midnight, and was
plagued with staff problems and tight costs. Now, he works
seven-hour days, can experiment with different styles of cooking
and has an unlimited food budget. He also gets to have dinner with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He got the job through Greenhouse at Pavillion. A few years ago,
Greenhouse also arranged a job for Franklin Becker as a private
chef for Ronald O. Perelman, the chairman of Revlon. Becker went
into it after working at a club, and catering, he said, simply to
save money. In less than two years, he did that, but there was more
to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped shape me,'' Becker said, ``as an individual and as a
cook.''
</P>
<P>
   And it provided the perfect stepping stone, which is why many
cooks do it.
</P>
<P>
   Becker parlayed his stint with Perelman into a job as the
executive chef at Local, an ambitious restaurant in Midtown
Manhattan. If he had stayed in that little-known club, he might
still be there.

 &HT;    NORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR PRESSES SENATE FOR FLOOD AID
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After meeting with White House officials, Gov. Jim
Hunt urged Senate leaders Tuesday to act on a bill that includes
more than $300 million in hurricane relief for North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are on the verge of going out of business, Hunt said.
``They are considering right now whether or not they have to give
up, quit farming and sell their equipment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get the funds, Hunt sent a letter Tuesday to
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who with other GOP
leaders has postponed action on a $12.6 billion emergency spending
package for the current fiscal year that includes the disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans say the bill is bloated and that Congress
should deal with much of the spending, including flood relief, as
part of the normal appropriations process for fiscal 2001, which
starts Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said the agriculture and housing needs in flood-ravaged
areas are urgent and cannot wait for several months. More than
87,000 North Carolinians have applied for federal aid, more than
8,000 are still living in temporary trailers, and several thousand
others are living with family and friends, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many are older people who lost everything, Hunt said. ``It is
the saddest thing in the world. Those people need help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said that the senator
``is uniquely aware of the plight in North Carolina,'' and believes
the best way to deliver the aid is through the regular spending
process.
</P>
<P>
   The money could be available as soon as early summer if the
first spending bill is put ``on the fast track,'' Czwartacki said.
Last fiscal year, the first appropriations bill was signed into law
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.6 billion emergency spending bill is controversial for
reasons other than its size. It includes $2.1 billion for
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and $1.7 billion for drug
intervention in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have lobbied against U.S. involvement in Colombia's
bloody civil war amid concerns about human rights violations and
drug trafficking by military and paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lott and other leaders decided to indefinitely
postpone scheduled committee votes on the overall spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The action prompted a response from President Clinton, who said
in a statement that he was ``very disappointed that Senator Lott
plans to deny prompt consideration of the urgent and essential
needs ... including helping victims of Hurricane Floyd.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter Tuesday, Hunt asked the majority leader to allow a
Senate vote on the supplemental bill ``as urgently as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your leadership now in expediting congressional approval of
supplemental funding is critical for victims of this storm,'' the
letter says. ``It will help us make the necessary progress to get
people back in safe, permanent housing and to help our communities
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergency spending package, which was approved by the House,
includes $81 million for tobacco farmers, $68 million for home
buyouts, $43 million for road repairs, $41 million for rental
housing and assistance, $12 million for a new Armed Forces Reserve
Center in Greenville, and $1.5 million for a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers study on raising the dike on the Tar River in the
historic town of Princeville in Edgecombe County.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has sent nearly $2 billion in disaster
aid to North Carolina, but much of it was delayed for weeks last
fall in a budget fight between Congress and the White House. In
addition, the state legislature has provided $836 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said he is grateful to Lott for the federal aid that the
state received last year and is hoping Congress will finish the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that he (Lott) cares about the people in North
Carolina, but we need help. We need it now,'' he said.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if I told you someone had unearthed footage from a 1962
conversation between President John F. Kennedy and Paul Newman _
would you be interested in seeing something like that?
</P>
<P>
   Me too. The most powerful man in the world and one of the most
popular young movie stars of his generation could be talking about
the weather or the color of each other's ties and it would still be
a fascinating eavesdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's zoom forward to the year 2000. Instead of a
hypothetical situation, this time around we've got the real thing _
a conversation between the reigning president and the hottest young
male star in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Clinton and Leo DiCaprio. Together again for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio recently visited Clinton at the White House as part of
an ABC News special about Earth Day, that magical time when
environmentalists all over the world gather in public places and
leave behind piles of litter to be cleaned up by other people.
(Just kidding, environmentalists!) DiCaprio is chairing the
national Earth Day celebration, which is why he was at the White
House and not downing shots of tequila with 6-foot models in the
VIP room of some trendy club.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was for Clinton to take DiCaprio on a tour of the White
House, maybe show him the recycling bin for the Diet Coke cans. But
when the president and the actor sat down for something akin to a
real interview, journalists at ABC and elsewhere started hurling
themselves to the ground and howling in protest about this horrible
besmirching of their hallowed profession.
</P>
<P>
   I know. I'm giggling too, and I'm a card-carrying, multimedia
member of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the 15-minute interview, ABC News president David
Westin must have felt as if he was taking on more water than the
captain of the ``Titanic.'' Staffers in his division were
reportedly outraged that some mere actor had talked to Clinton with
an ABC News crew recording the moment.
</P>
<P>
   (Funny. I was more offended when ABC's legendary Barbara Walters
practically laid a wreath at the feet of John and Patsy Ramsey when
she interviewed them about the murder of their daughter. But I
guess it's easier and safer to protest ``Gilbert Grape'' boy than a
rollover by the grande dame.)
</P>
<P>
   Westin sent an e-mail to his disgruntled staff. It read, in
part:
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not send DiCaprio to interview the president. No one is
that stupid ... it's quite possible we'll use none of the
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on Westin, are you nuts? You've got video of DiCaprio
hanging with Clinton and you might just leave it in the vault? No
one is that stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Westin also wrote: ``All roles of journalists must be played by
journalists (duh!).''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, that's Westin's ``duh!'', not mine. Good to know the
president of ABC News is up on the ``Buffy'' lingo.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from ABC weren't the only ones stewing and fuming
about Leo's ``get'' with the prez. From a Scripps-Howard editorial:
</P>
<P>
   ``For all we know, DiCaprio handled his time with the prez just
fine, but that's not the issue. The point is that journalists are
practiced at getting to the heart of public policies without
letting too much unchallenged, self-serving folderol in the
backdoor, and when a network turns to untrained celebrities
instead, it is announcing that what it cares most about is amusing
all the folks out there, not getting at the truth of things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are not amused _ and should not be _ are the
journalists that take their calling seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh please.
</P>
<P>
   Do these media snobs seriously think the public can't
distinguish between a Leonardo DiCaprio and a Ted Koppel? What an
incredible insult to the news-consuming viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would expect DiCaprio to back Clinton against the ropes
with furious, unrelenting queries about serious matters, for crying
out loud. Nor would any fair-minded individual think ABC News had
lost any credibility because of this silly, harmless media event,
whether it's labeled an ``interview,'' a ``walk-through,'' a
``sit-down'' or a freakin' toga party.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that while ABC News employees and other
sanctimonious journalists were getting their credentials in a bunch
over Leo and Billy, nobody seemed to question what the hell Diane
Sawyer and her bosses were thinking when they exploited little
Elian Gonzalez on national TV. (At one point, Sawyer took off her
shoes and literally stood on her head. What, no barking like a
seal?)
</P>
<P>
   I guess when a movie star talks to the president, it's an
outrage. But when a TV superstar interviews a confused, 6-year-old
boy who only months ago saw his mother drown _ that's journalism.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Is it all right if I don't eat it all?'' Benjamin
Lebert asked in a small, polite voice, staring down at the thick
slab of filet mignon he had ordered at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse
in Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Lebert is 18, a slight, sweet-faced boy, partly paralyzed on his
left side from deprivation of oxygen at birth. His first novel,
``Crazy,'' written when he was 16, has been a runaway best seller
in his native Germany. There are 200,000 copies in print; the
rights have been sold in 26 countries. This month ``Crazy'' is
being published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   German critics have called Lebert an heir to Guenter Grass. Der
Spiegel praised ``Crazy'' as ``a thoroughly amazing and wonderful
book.'' Stern magazine wrote: ``No one has ever been so right-on in
expressing the drama of being young. A sensation.'' A Publisher's
Weekly review prepared before the book's publication in the United
States was more muted in its praise, calling the book ``slim but
entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is all quite overwhelming. ``I have a car driving me
here,'' Lebert said, speaking English fairly well. ``It's unreal
for an 18-year-old person, like it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebert looks younger than his years. Today he is dressed in a
T-shirt from the musical ``Jekyll and Hyde'' with a sweater
underneath, jeans, work boots and a leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy'' is about a teen-ager not unlike Lebert himself; in
fact, the central character's first name is Ben. He too is
paralyzed on one side, and, having been kicked out of four schools,
has been sent to a boarding school so he can raise his math score
to something like a passing grade.
</P>
<P>
   On the fictional Ben's first day at the school, called the
Castle Neuseelen (Lebert is a Kafka fan), he makes his standard
introduction in the hope of forestalling the usual stares and
teasing of classmates: ``Hi folks, my name is Benjamin Lebert, I'm
16, and I'm a cripple, just so you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The character can't play sports, but he loves books,
particularly the writing of Ernest Hemingway. He is affectionately
tolerant of his father's taste for rock 'n' roll. ``My father loves
it, has for centuries,'' he says. ``He likes the Rolling Stones _
they're a rock group from way back. Every time they're on tour, he
takes me. He hopes I'll like the music. I don't, but I still have a
terrific time. I'm happy for my father, because he's happy, and I'm
happy that we're being happy together.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately upon arriving at the school, Ben hooks up
with Janosch, the leader of a group that includes Troy, whose
parents are dead; Florian, ``a k a Girl,'' and ``Fat Felix.'' There
is also Malen, Janosch's girlfriend, on whom Ben develops a crush.
</P>
<P>
   The friends play pranks, including pretending to the school sex
counselor that they are gay. When it comes time to raid the girls'
dorm, Janosch has to carry Ben on his back because he can't keep up
with the other boys. Ben finally loses his virginity in the girls'
bathroom, but not with Malen. Eventually the group takes off for a
strip club in Munich. Ben, still failing miserably at math, gets
thrown out of school. But he departs having made some very good
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Lebert said using his own name for the central character was ``a
terrible mistake'' and that ``I will never do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The feelings are all true,'' he said. ``But basically, it's
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebert comes from a writing background. He was born in the
southwestern town of Freiburg. His father, Andreas, was the editor
of the magazine section of the Munich newspaper Sueddeutsche
Zeitung and now develops new products for media companies.
Benjamin's mother, Jutta, is a homeopathist. He has an older
sister, Liza. Andreas Lebert, who was present at his son's birth,
said that Benjamin was born with his umbilical cord around his
neck, which probably caused the oxygen deprivation that resulted in
his partial paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Lebert was unable to participate in sports and
was tormented by others because of his handicap. His parents
separated. He found refuge with his grandfathers, both now
deceased. One, Norbert Lebert, was a novelist, and his other
grandfather, Bruno Schnee, was a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   They were ``my personal heroes,'' said Lebert. ``Every time
things were hard at home, I went to my grandfathers.'' He dedicated
``Crazy'' to them.
</P>
<P>
   Lebert said he had always had difficulty with his studies. ``My
teachers always said: `How could you be so stupid?' I'm the baddest
student there's ever been in math or physics.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he began making up short stories even before he could
write. They were mostly ``bloody stories, horror stories,'' he
said.``I told them to my parents, that they should write it down. I
was very proud.'' One Christmas, when he was 9, his parents typed
50 pages of ``The Shadow Murderer,'' a novel he had written, and
made it into a book for him. At 12 he wrote a 150-page novel about
a home for handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader, he likes Jack London in particular, and says
that ``without Salinger `Crazy' would never have existed.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 15, an article he wrote for a teen-agers' magazine
about a day in his life was spotted by another writer, Maxim
Biller, who sent it to Kerstin Gleba, an editor at a Cologne
publishing house, Kiepenheuer &AMP; Witsch. Gleba specializes in trade
paperbacks ``by young authors,'' she said, ``though not as young as
Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gleba saw the article, she called him and asked if he
thought he could write a book, Lebert said. He said he wasn't sure
but would give it a try. He wrote 20 pages and sent them to Gleba,
who said she found the manuscript ``too ambitious'' and ``too
literary''.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Do it with more humor,''' Lebert recalled. ``I
wrote with too much humor. They said, `No, try it again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The young author was reluctant to show his work to his father.
``He's very critical and knows a lot about writing,'' Lebert said.
``Some days I wish he would be a carpenter.'' Andreas Lebert said
that the two had ``sort of agreed we won't work together on this,''
adding, ``Because I'm his father, it's hard to be an editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lebert had a third draft, a 105-page manuscript. Then
his father asked to read it. ``I will always remember'' his
reaction,'' the young man said. ``He said, `It's a nice novel.'''
</P>
<P>
   This time Gleba liked it too, and within three days of
publication, the book sold 10,000 copies. Lebert has encountered
something of a backlash because of his success. Some people
asserted that his father had helped him with the writing. ``Some
said it was because I'm a cripple,'' he said. ``That's very hard
for me. That's just mean. I was always teased because of my
handicap. Even after my success, because of my handicap, they say
bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebert may have achieved literary success, but he still hasn't
graduated from high school. He lives with his mother in Munich,
though he has used the money from his book to rent a small
apartment in which to write. Girlfriends? ``I had a girlfriend, one
time,'' he said with an emphasis on the ``had.''
</P>
<P>
   What about another novel? ``First, I have to live,'' said
Lebert. ``I cannot write a novel without living.''

former human resources manager at Coke and the trip's chief
organizer. Jones conceived the trip to pressure the company into
settling the racial discrimination lawsuit quickly. (Unger, Atlanta

older workers, Greenspan told a job skills conference. (Turay, Cox

   NETTAX-SENATORS _ WASHINGTON _ The top Republican leaders in
Congress plan an event Wednesday intended to establish the GOP as
the party standing steadfast against taxes on the Internet. But
behind the scenes, several Republican officials and business
leaders are trying to build a bipartisan coalition against a bill
that would extend a moratorium on new Internet taxes, including
sales taxes, until 2006. They say the bill, expected to clear the
Senate Commerce Committee this week, could erode the tax base for
state and local governments, forcing them to either boost income
and property taxes or turn to Washington for more federal grants
funded by income taxes. (Geewax, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

   w/COKE-BUS _The bus ``ride for justice'' to Coca-Cola's annual
shareholders meeting in Delaware will involve fewer people than
originally planned. ``We will have two buses instead of three
because there's less volume than we thought,'' said Larry Jones, a
former human resources manager at Coke and the trip's chief
organizer. Jones conceived the trip to pressure the company into
settling the racial discrimination lawsuit quickly. (Unger, Atlanta

older workers, Greenspan told a job skills conference. (Turay, Cox

   NETTAX-SENATORS _ WASHINGTON _ The top Republican leaders in
Congress plan an event Wednesday intended to establish the GOP as
the party standing steadfast against taxes on the Internet. But
behind the scenes, several Republican officials and business
leaders are trying to build a bipartisan coalition against a bill
that would extend a moratorium on new Internet taxes, including
sales taxes, until 2006. They say the bill, expected to clear the
Senate Commerce Committee this week, could erode the tax base for
state and local governments, forcing them to either boost income
and property taxes or turn to Washington for more federal grants
funded by income taxes. (Geewax, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

`THE SPECIALIST': EICHMANN TRIAL 40 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new documentary, ``The Specialist,'' comes at an interesting
time in the culture. The producer and director, Eyal Sivan, has
compiled and assembled black-and-white footage of the trial of the
SS officer and war criminal Adolf Eichmann, and his film is the
grimmest possible precursor to the occasionally frivolous ``Court
TV,'' which plays on the current fascination with watching the
judicial process grind exceedingly slow, and exceedingly fine.
</P>
<P>
   This year brings the 40th anniversary of Eichmann's capture; the
trial opened in Jerusalem a year later, in 1961. ``The Specialist''
is an amazing document, if only for the spectacle of watching
Eichmann, seated in a glass box with two armed guards, take in the
trial. The box exaggerates Eichmann's own natural remove, and as he
primly cleans his eyeglasses, it is hard to separate his demeanor
from his appearance: the sharp features, the thin, almost lipless
mouth that suggests the horrifying stereotype of dispassionate
cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Sivan and his co-writer, Rony Brauman, have sifted through 350
hours of tape shot by the American documentary filmmaker Leo T.
Hurwitz, who was commissioned to film the trial, and found the most
dramatic footage. A scene in which the courtroom is darkened and
film evidence of atrocities is projected is both low-key and
unsettling. Reflections of those atrocities play across Eichmann's
box, and he stares ahead in detachment, peering through the
shadows, as the images are described by the prosecutor: ``A dead
man on an electrified fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann emerges as a different kind of ``Specialist'': the
title refers to his self-proclaimed ``expertise'' at
``emigration.'' His attempts to explain his position _ he calls
himself ``weak and powerless'' and actually utters the line ``I'll
simply obey orders,'' which might seem worthy of a laugh if it
weren't so repugnant _ are delivered in the same deadpan he uses
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Sivan's editor, Audrey Maurion, must deserve some credit as
well. The ``Specialist'' filmmaking team shows the prosecutors, led
by the cool Israeli attorney general, Gideon Hausner, whose
expression is bemused contempt whenever Eichmann speaks, make their
case with a startling lack of courtroom theatrics. As the horrors
pile up, their dignity in the face of Eichmann's cold lies seems
admirable, even as roiling stereo effects thunder on the soundtrack
to create an aural current of discord. There is enough drama here
that ``The Specialist'' doesn't require any extra emphasis.
(Another minor quibble: the subtitles are sometimes hard to see
against the black-and-white background.)
</P>
<P>
   When Hausner, addressing the judges, says that Eichmann ``was
born human but lived like a beast in the jungle'' and proves this
truth, point by point, the movie succeeds on much quieter _ and
more frightening _ terms.
</P>

 &HT;    CLINTON SENDS EVERGLADES BILL TO CONGRESS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting the stage for a congressional fight over
the scope and purpose of the proposed $7.8 billion, 25-year
Everglades restoration plan, the Clinton administration has sent
its version of the bill to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislative language would implement the plan
submitted last July by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to re-plumb
the South Florida water system in order to save the endangered
Everglades ecosystem and meet the water needs of the region's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Davis, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for
civil works, called the bill, submitted late Monday, ``a balanced
approach.'' He said it guarantees that existing water users will
continue receiving water in roughly the same proportions as they do
now, while preserving the primary focus of the project to restore
federally owned environmental areas, including Everglades National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to reach into that 70 percent (of water) that
goes into the urban and agricultural areas and take that away, but
we're also not going to reach into that 30 percent'' that goes for
environmental purposes, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure a proper balance in water usage between the competing
interests of the parks, agriculture and development, the bill calls
for a two-year process of identifying how much water each group
receives.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of the army would head that process, but would
need agreement from the secretary of the interior, who has
responsibility for the parks. Other federal and state agencies
would be consulted, but would not have authority to determine how
much water would be available to the parks. The two secretaries
also would determine how clean the water would be and when it would
be available.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have expressed some concern over the question of
who would decide how much water would be available to the competing
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a project which, in all senses of the word, is an
equal marriage'' between the federal and state governments, said
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. ``How that balance is struck will be a key
part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham joked that if an agreement can be worked out on sharing
authority between the state and federal governments, the
participants would be sent to the Middle East and Northern Ireland
to resolve those interminable conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Estenoz, director of South Florida programs for the
World Wildlife Fund, said environmentalists will insist that the
parks and the ecosystems receive top priority in the restoration
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American taxpayers need to be assure that they're going to
get what they pay for,'' Estenoz said. ``The primary purpose of the
Everglades restoration is the restoration of the Everglades. It's
critical that the American people, if they're going to contribute
$4 billion in this project ... be assured that the benefits
proposed to be delivered actually are delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leary, associate director for natural resources of the
administration's Council on Environmental Quality, said he felt the
proper balance was assured because there were three safeguards over
allocation of water:
</P>
<P>
   _ The process by which the federal secretaries will set overall
goals for water distribution throughout the restoration effort.
</P>
<P>
   _ A requirement that each of the 68 different projects in the
restoration effort be approved, with individual regulations for
each project.
</P>
<P>
   _ The filing of joint reports to Congress every five years from
the secretary of the army and the secretary of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional action on the bill is expected as part of the
biennial Water Resources Development Act. The bill authorizes the
restoration project and $69 million in pilot projects to begin when
feasible. The cost would be shared equally by the federal
government and by state and local agencies. It also authorizes 10
``critical projects'' for a total of $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most controversial provisions is a $100 million,
10-year program of ``adaptive assessment'' of the project to
determine which new or expanded technologies work best in the
restoration effort.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the bill faces serious challenges, but has strong
support from a united Florida delegation and key lawmakers
including Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., chairman of the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee, and Rep. Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio, chairman of the House Interior appropriations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers, such as Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio,
chairman of the subcommittee that reviews the Corps' projects, have
questioned whether the Corps is moving too quickly on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican from Fort Lauderdale, sent a
warning to Florida legislators who have questioned the federal
commitment and role in the restoration project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need, in Florida, to get our signals straight,'' Shaw said,
adding that ``unfortunately, when somebody get critical of what is
going on ... that is the word that gets back up here. We need to
put those fires out before they become a blaze.''

`MR. PHILLIPS:' OBSESSIVE, COMPULSIVE AND UNEMPLOYED 
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his masterpiece ``Ikiru,'' the Japanese director Akira
Kurosawa follows a faceless civil servant who, having learned that
he is dying of cancer, searches for meaning in a phantasmagoric
urban landscape. This 1952 film was a moral existentialist drama
about the loneliness of the long-distance bureaucrat who finds
redemption by helping victims of bureaucratic indifference.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurosawa classic is brought to mind by John Lanchester's
sardonic new novel, ``Mr. Phillips,'' a story set in contemporary
Britain, another island nation. The talented Lanchester's main
character, Victor Phillips, an accountant for a large bureaucratic
firm, has been fired from his job. Afraid to tell his wife and two
sons of his disaster, he wanders through London, his tie knotted
and his briefcase in hand, doing a sad imitation of what had been
his life.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Kurosawa's civil servant, this emotionally desiccated
nonhero fails to create much meaning; indeed, in his godless,
mechanized world of petty preoccupations there doesn't seem to be
much possibility of meaning at all, except perhaps in Lanchester's
own mordantly witty way of describing his character's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Lanchester is the author of the wickedly entertaining ``Debt to
Pleasure,'' which was a sort of murder confession in the form of a
literate cookbook. His new novel, while more deeply engaged in the
themes of hopelessness and repressed despair, is recognizably in
the Lanchester style. It has the originality of its voice, the
mocking lightheartedness of ``The Debt to Pleasure.'' There is much
to admire and enjoy in the new book, especially the hilarious
emotional detachment of its main character and the wickedly
off-center quality of its asides.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lanchester's novel is a brilliant semi-success, the kind
of semi-success that could only be wrought by a man of an engaging,
probing sort of intellect. Phillips' problem as a character is
suggestive of the ``Mr. Phillips'' problem as a novel. With one or
two welcome exceptions _ including a bank robbery near the end that
almost redeems the book all by itself _ the events within are
entirely inside the feckless accountant's mind. The main
characteristic of that mind is emotional avoidance, an idiot-savant
obliviousness that is grimly funny to encounter at first but that
begins eventually to wear out its welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has eliminated actual events from his life so that his
experience almost entirely consists of sexual fantasies of a
transgressive nature and compulsive attempts to describe the world
arithmetically. He wakes up next to his wife in the morning still
experiencing the priapic residue of some dream involving his former
secretary or his former boss' secretary. When he rides the train to
London, he sees a man looking at a photograph of a naked woman in a
tabloid newspaper and immediately calculates, on the basis of the
number of newspapers that publish such pictures, ``the number of
British women happy to take their clothes off for money per
annum.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has formally correct but intimacy-free relationships
with his sons and his wife. Life for him is going through the
correct motions, but not much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Staying away from home all day so he won't have to tell his wife
about his unemployment, Phillips observes the passing London scene
with a kind of resigned fastidiousness. He is painfully conscious
of industrial and human effluents. He reflects on the pervasiveness
of masturbation. ``Probably even the queen does it,'' he decides.
He is the kind of person who thinks about killing himself by
jumping off a bridge, but the thought is hijacked by his compulsive
statistical analyses8 he muses on the heights of different London
bridges and on the acceleration of falling bjects and calculates
how fast a suicide jumper would be going from each when he hit the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beachy head, another popular spot, 535 feet, 5.6 seconds,
close to terminal velocity,'' he thinks. ``Severn Bridge, another
classic, 200 feet, 3.6 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his aimlessness, there is something admirable about
Phillips. He has no pretensions. He does not sink into self-pity.
His observations have an aesthetic, unillusioned sharpness to them.
He suspects that he lacks something most other men have: ``the
carapace which grows or solidifies around them as they get older,
and which involves an increasing lack of uncertainty about, or
interest in, anything they don't already know.'' Phillips is
curious and uncertain: he sees everything even if he hasn't done
much in his life.
</P>
<P>
   The differ%nce, in other words, between Phillips and other men
is that he is aware of his own particular soulessness in the more
general soulessness of contemporary, rationalized, commodified
existence. He sees a television personality who has excited
libidinous thoughts in him before and he notes that she is walking
out of a shop with a package labeled ``Chez Guevara'' under her
arm.
</P>
<P>
   That play on the revolutionary's name is a marvelous dig at what
the journalist David Brooks has been calling ``bohemian
bourgeois.'' The world Phillips inhabits is one in which his son
has a book on his shelf called ``Hitler Wins: Management Skills of
Germany's Greatest Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   This is funny in its absurdist way, too, as is Phillips' habit
of stopping in midstride to calculate over three pages or so the
amount of time spent in an average life doing nothing at all: ``a
weighted average of 16.375 percent, or 2.62 hourC, or 2 hours and
37 minutes, per day of, broadly speaking, free or nothing time.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an intellectual richness as Lanchester uses Phillips to
make his own understated but caustic commentary on the modern
sensibility, but not every incident in the novel rises to the level
of the best of its moments. That is what makes ``Mr. Phillips''
only a semi-success, that and the toll that the relentless exposure
to Phillip's anesthetized existence eventually takes. Unlike
``Ikiru,'' in which there is a moral resolution, Lanchester's
sensibility allows for no redemptive event. There is a great
honesty in that _ an unsentimental trueness _ and yet ``Mr.
Phillips'' remains a story about a life in which nothing happens,
and nothing happening, even as cleverly wrought as it is here, does
not generate much narrative force.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow over the mountains of northern New England will
gradually end as low pressure moves into the Canadian Maritimes. In
the wake of the low pressure, another day of unseasonable chill
will cover the Great Lakes and Northeast, despite ample sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   In the Southern states, from Texas to the Atlantic coast, a
front will be the focus of showers and some thunderstorms.
Recurrent heavy rain will raise the risk of flash flooding over
parts of central and northern Texas as moisture-laden air from the
Gulf of Mexico is forced to rise over cooler air to the north. Some
of the showers will reach the lower Mississippi Valley late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonable warmth will cover most of the West. Increasing
southwesterly breezes will draw the warmth into the Plains by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: LAST FROST
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent bout with wintry chill and snow, the growing
season will soon begin in the Northeast. From mid-April to late
May, most of the Northeast typically has its last frost of the
spring. But, there can be dramatic variations in frost dates over
very short distances. The heat generated in cities can account for
up to 30 days' difference between the date of the last urban and
the last suburban frost. Nearby bodies of water can also help
prevent frost. Moreover, since cold air is heavier than warm air,
chill collects in lowlands on calm spring mornings, making valleys
more susceptible to frost than hillsides.

SLAIN JOURNALIST REMEMBERED AS GOVERNMENT LEVIES MORE MEDIA FINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ As hundreds of people remembered a slain
journalist Tuesday, a man executed on the street a year ago as NATO
bombs were falling, the Yugoslav authorities stepped up their
campaign to intimidate and impoverish the independent press.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who came Tuesday to honor the journalist, Slavko
Curuvija, were not great fans when he was alive. But his death has
transformed him into a martyr figure he himself would probably not
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija, a publisher who had once been close to President
Slobodan Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, had turned
against the regime. He was assassinated gangland-style on Orthodox
Easter Sunday a year ago as he walked with his wife. His killing
was understood to be a message to the independent press that overt
criticism would not be tolerated during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as a plaque was unveiled on the street where he was
killed and ceremonies were held at his grave and at a downtown
media center, he was praised as having died for defending press
freedom and refusing to publish under wartime censorship. Nothing
was said of his former relationship to the ruling couple or his
role in the early 1980s as a political analyst for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was a chance for opposition politicians and
journalists to show solidarity as the government continues a war of
nerves and court cases against the press.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the weekly magazine Vreme and its two top editors were
fined 350,000 dinars _ about $8,750 at the black market rate of
exchange _ in a suit brought by the culture minister for a February
article that said he arranged the firing of a theater director.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that Vreme, a magazine of opinion with a
circulation under 20,000, had been fined under Yugoslavia's
restrictive Public Information Law, passed in October 1998. The
first victim of the law had been Curuvjia and his magazine,
Evropljanin. Neither the magazine nor his successful tabloid
newspaper, Dnevni Telegraf, survived him.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Studio B, the Belgrade television station that is the
political opposition's main voice, was fined about $7,500 after a
suit by a police official. The station's editor, Dragan
Kojadinovic, was fined half that amount, the maximum under the law,
for which he is personally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But Kojadinovic said neither fine will be paid. ``The government
can now do whatever they want, but we will defend our rights,'' he
said. The ruling could add fuel to an opposition rally planned for
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 law enables the government to indict, prosecute,
convict and fine a newspaper or television station within 48 hours
for violating a long list of rules. Equipment or bank accounts can
be seized if the fines are not paid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the conflict over Kosovo, the Belgrade authorities have
stepped up their use of the law and applied it more broadly to
radio and television stations, particularly those in the more than
30 cities and towns controlled by the opposition. The government
has also started confiscating transmitters and other equipment
belonging to stations that do not pay broadcast fees.
</P>
<P>
   The intention is to drain the independent media of funds _
though some of the fines have been paid by foreign supporters like
George Soros _ and to use fear to induce self-censorship, with
local and federal elections expected this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   In the towns of Kraljevo and Nis, government actions have
brought public protests. In Kraljevo, after fees were paid,
transmission equipment was returned.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also accused the independent media of
supporting the NATO countries that bombed Yugoslavia and want to
replace Milosevic. Journalists are being called traitors and
``Gestapo underlings'' by the Serbian information minister,
Aleksandar Vucic, a member of the nationalist Radical Party. The
party leader, Vojislav Seselj, accused journalists of causing the
assassination of Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic in February.
</P>
<P>
   But Goran Svilanovic, president of Civic Alliance, an opposition
party, said the regime has another intention _ to point up the
opposition's inability to defend the press that generally supports
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic shows his muscles,'' Svilanovic said Tuesday. ``He's
showing that he can do these things to the media and that we cannot
protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   The regime has also used the courts to take over control of a
popular evening tabloid newspaper, Vecernje Novosti, and the
independent radio station B-92, now reborn under the wing of Studio
B as B2-92. The government has repeatedly brought successful court
cases against the newspapers Danas and Glas Javnosti; financial
cases against ABC Grafika, the Glas Javnosti publisher; and rolled
back small price increases for papers like the popular tabloid
Blic, making it much more difficult to cover the costs of
increasingly scarce and expensive newsprint.
</P>
<P>
   Officials deny that there is any campaign to muzzle the press.
The federal information minister, Goran Matic, said last week that
every station had to pay the broadcast fees it owes, as in any
other country. ``Stories about closing down media are lies and
manipulation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, at a commemoration for Curuvija, a former spokesman for
Milosevic, Aleksandar Tijanic, said that Curuvija had ``paid the
full price for his words and his thoughts'' and that all Serbs
should consider how brave they had been since the murder. In a
country where ``politicians and criminals work the same stage,'' he
said, the fact that Curuvija lies in the ground ``does not mean
that he is dead and that we are alive.''

 &HT;    SOME REPUBLICANS CALL FOR CAUTION ON INTERNET TAX BAN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The top Republican leaders in Congress plan an
event Wednesday intended to establish the GOP as the party standing
steadfastly against sales taxes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, several Republican officials and business
leaders are trying to build a bipartisan coalition to oppose a
five-year extension of a moratorium on new Internet taxes,
including sales taxes on out-of-state purchases.
</P>
<P>
   They say such a lengthy ban would erode the tax base for state
and local governments, forcing them either to boost income and
property taxes or turn to Washington for more grants.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, is emerging as the leader of
Republican legislators fighting the tax ban.
</P>
<P>
   State officials will ``come here with their hat in hand and
their tin cup out'' if sales tax revenue falls, Voinovich warned
last week at a news conference organized by an ally, Utah's
Republican Gov. Michael Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich and Leavitt want Congress to extend the moratorium,
now set to expire in 2001, only by another year or two, just long
enough for states to simplify sales tax rules and rates. Once
streamlined, taxes should be collected by all retailers, whether
operating in a store, by mail, by telephone or on line, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to force online merchants to collect sales taxes could
cause Ohio alone to lose $2.5 billion by 2002, Voinovich said
Tuesday. Many senators have been ``shortsighted'' about what such a
loss might do to local services, such as police and fire
protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they had any idea the impact sales tax have on
states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich appears out of step with GOP leaders, who
Wednesday will accept an ``anti-tax'' report from Gov. James
Gilmore, R-Va., chairman of the Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was charged by Congress with making
recommendations on Internet tax policy. When it failed to reach the
prescribed ``supermajority'' of 13 votes to make a formal
recommendation, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told
Gilmore that Congress would accept a ``report'' based on a simple
majority.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 11-8, the panel approved a plan to keep the tax
moratorium until 2006 and provide tax exemptions for certain
Internet-based businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Lott and the top GOP leaders in the House, Speaker
Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas,
are expected to accept the report from Gilmore with glowing praise.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, in a speech Monday at the Information Technology
Association of America's national convention in Chicago, said ``the
Congress, under Republican leadership, will vote to extend the
moratorium on Internet taxes.'' He added: ``The party that believes
in more taxation is the Democrat Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Senate Commerce Committe Chairman John McCain,
R-Ariz., will hold a hearing on extending the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Prem, a partner with the accounting firm of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche, said that if the moratorium lasts until 2006, online
retailers probably will never collect the same sales taxes as
traditional retailers. ``The longer the status quo lasts, the
harder it will be to make changes later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich, a former governor of Ohio and mayor of Cleveland,
has been working with another former governor, Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., to build a bipartisan support for the extension of sales
tax collection duties into cyberspace. They were joined last month
by 10 other senators of both parties who signed a letter to Gilmore
saying: ``We strongly urge that the commission recommend support
for a 'level playing field' for all retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who signed was Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican from
Washington, home to the leading Internet retailer, Amazon.com.
While that company might benefit from avoiding tax collection
duties, the state derives about 59 percent of its revenues from
sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many business leaders also are siding with Voinovich and Graham,
including executives from traditional retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Parrish, a lobbyist for Tandy/RadioShack, said he believes
lawmakers will tone down their rhetoric as they become more engaged
in the tax debate. ``It would be unfortunate if this became
partisan, because it's too darned important for that,'' he said.

<P>
   Meadow may be going off to college, but she's still Daddy's
little Mafia princess. The second season finale of ``The Sopranos''
(to be repeated Wednesday night at 9 and Saturday night at 12:15 on
HBO) may have focused on the death of Big Pussy, who had spent the
season wearing a wire for the FBI and weeping in Tony Soprano's
bathroom about his betrayal. ``You were like a brother to me,''
Paulie Walnuts said, before he and Tony and Silvio shot Pussy and
dumped him in the ocean. (They made sure they removed his diamond
horseshoe-shaped pinkie ring first.)
</P>
<P>
   But while Pussy's family treachery drove much of the season's
plot, this year it became even more apparent that ``The Sopranos''
is as much about about social class, upward mobility and
all-American assimilation as it is about mob hits. Meadow, the
Sopranos' smart and spoiled high school senior daughter, is the
pivotal figure in that theme, the character poised to cross class
lines and escape the Sopranos' tacky, violent world.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the season finale, Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) is
embarrassed when she comes home with friends just as her father is
led away in handcuffs by the FBI. Her mother, Carmela, explains:
``Your father means well. He's given his life for you, for your
brother, for us.'' And Meadow seems to understand. ``This is who
Dad is _ my friends don't judge me,'' she says, and she'll drop any
friends who do. Though she has not announced where she will go to
college, in a quick dream scene Tony hears her choose Columbia.
This tension goes to the heart of ``The Sopranos.'' How will Meadow
reconcile the upscale life she and her family want for her, with
her background of gauche relatives and mob loyalty?
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Meadow was ever the most important character
in the series. One of the great achievements of ``The Sopranos'' is
that it weaves in trenchant social themes subtly, through realistic
characters and stories that keep the audience irresistibly
involved. Meadow was simply one of many elements in a rich season.
</P>
<P>
   Since new episodes began in January, ``The Sopranos'' was more
watched and, it seemed, more talked about than ever. Much of the
conversation involved wondering why this year wasn't measuring up
to last. A male colleague complained there wasn't enough of Tony's
mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand). A female colleague said Carmela had
gone haywire. (Edie Falco played her as perfectly as ever, but
Carmela did seem all over the place, uncharacteristically
threatening another woman into writing a college recommendation for
Meadow, and flirting with a handsome house painter who came to
redecorate the powder room.) The reasons were different, but
everyone had an opinion. Even my brother-in-law's golfing partner
sent a message: ``Tell your sister-in-law if she writes about `The
Sopranos' again I know what's wrong this season. Too many new
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one stopped watching or talking or complaining, which
simply proves how ``The Sopranos'' has raised the standard for
television, or at least for itself. However uneven, this season the
series remained surprising, daring, psychologically astute.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't perfect. There were far too many dream sequences in
the finale, including one in which Tony and his shrink (Lorraine
Bracco) make love on her desk. That's the kind of cheap trick the
networks fall back on. (Will and Grace kissed in an NBC promo but
it was all a dream!)
</P>
<P>
   Yet the season was also filled with high points. The
next-to-last episode, in which Tony's sister Janice (Aida Turturro)
shoots her fiance, the vicious Richie Aprile (David Proval), was
stronger and more surprising than the finale. Richie, after all,
had been holding a gun to  &UR; her &LR;  head during sex, and a sex-related
killing seemed all too likely. But throughout the season, the
series never made the obvious move. Even in the end, the whacking
of Pussy (Vincent Pastore) had the weight of inevitability rather
than an air of the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   There were other surprises that simultaneously deepened the
characters and kept the plot exploding. Christopher (Michael
Imperioli) was shot; no one is really guaranteed a long life except
Tony, the star. Christopher then had to choose between two
aspirations: Hollywood dreams and being a made man.
</P>
<P>
   And Tony became even more visibly a killer, shooting one of the
young men who had shot Christopher, even as the bloodied victim
squirmed and cried for his mommy. James Gandolfini's ability to
sink into the complex character of Tony and reveal him, without a
trace of overt acting, remains a wonder.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   However violent, though, the series always comes back to the
Sopranos' personal family dynamics, depicted with startling
crispness. These are the scenes that allow audiences to sympathize
with such corrupt characters, and the moments between Meadow and
her father continue to be among the truest. She is just old enough
to challenge Tony's life and career. Remember, it was Meadow who
asked point-blank last season if he was in the Mafia, in what may
be the best episode yet, when Tony took her to visit colleges and
garroted an informer along the way.
</P>
<P>
   One of this year's most powerful episodes was also about this
fraught, loving father-daughter relationship. Tony gave Meadow a
car that belonged to one of her friends, Eric, which he had taken
because Eric's father owed Tony money. It was a gesture of extreme
control, as Tony pushed his criminal life in Meadow's face and
obstinately refused to understand why she was upset. It was the mob
version of a father's not wanting his little girl to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Tony's children are touchstones. This year his
pre-adolescent son, Anthony Jr. (Robert Iler), had a terrific and
witty existential crisis. He was drawn to the works of Nietzsche,
which he pronounced ``Neech.'' His pronunciation was corrected, not
by his father, of course, but by the son of another mobster, part
of Anthony Jr. and Meadow's better-educated generation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the humor of ``The Sopranos'' comes from the gaudy
trappings of their lives, Tony with his gold bracelet and Carmela,
packed this season into too-tight pants. When Tony's men started
running a stock brokerage, the joke was seeing goons in a Wall
Street setting. Even while those details are exploited for their
humor they are immensely revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Just as last season ended with Tony, Carmela and the children
gathered around a table, toasting the supreme importance of family,
this season ends with a montage that starts at Meadow's high school
graduation party. It includes a snapshot taken of Tony, Carmela,
Anthony Jr. and Meadow in her cap and gown: a picture of bourgeois,
upwardly mobile American values. It ends with a close-up of Tony
lighting a cigar, a sinister look on his face, followed by an image
of the ocean, where Pussy (Tony had dreamed he was a talking fish)
now sleeps. That smooth continuity from one family to another
continues to make ``The Sopranos'' the best series on television.
What is the future of such a family? Where do they fit into
American society, a society whose viewers have embraced them so
vigorously?
</P>
<P>
   Repeats will begin in June and the third season sometime next
year, creating withdrawal pangs even for people who don't usually
watch television. HBO's ``Sopranos'' Web site
(www.hbo.com/sopranos) is a poor substitute, but it has its amusing
aspects. It includes the winner of this year's favorite-line
contest, voted on by viewers. Because the series' language is
uncensored, last year's winner cannot be printed in its entirety. A
polite version has Anthony Jr. complaining when he learns that
Livia isn't coming to his birthday party, ``What, no ziti now?''
This year's winner is an almost entirely unprintable line from
Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese) telling where federal marshals are
in relation to his anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   How could voters have overlooked the line from the poker
episode, in which Frank Sinatra Jr., playing himself, was called
``chairboy of the board''? Or an even more gleeful line that
perfectly captures both the family dynamics and the clever style of
the season. Tony puts his murdering sister on a bus to Seattle and
says, with a wry delivery only Gandolfini could manage, ``All in
all, though, I'd say it was a pretty good visit.''

 &HT;    SOME REPUBLICANS CALL FOR CAUTION ON INTERNET TAX BAN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The top Republican leaders in Congress plan an
event Wednesday intended to establish the GOP as the party standing
steadfastly against sales taxes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, several Republican officials and business
leaders are trying to build a bipartisan coalition to oppose a
five-year extension of a moratorium on new Internet taxes,
including sales taxes on out-of-state purchases.
</P>
<P>
   They say such a lengthy ban would erode the tax base for state
and local governments, forcing them either to boost income and
property taxes or turn to Washington for more grants.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, is emerging as the leader of
Republican legislators fighting the tax ban.
</P>
<P>
   State officials will ``come here with their hat in hand and
their tin cup out'' if sales tax revenue falls, Voinovich warned
last week at a news conference organized by an ally, Utah's
Republican Gov. Michael Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich and Leavitt want Congress to extend the moratorium,
now set to expire in 2001, only by another year or two, just long
enough for states to simplify sales tax rules and rates. Once
streamlined, taxes should be collected by all retailers, whether
operating in a store, by mail, by telephone or on line, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to force online merchants to collect sales taxes could
cause Ohio alone to lose $2.5 billion by 2002, Voinovich said
Tuesday. Many senators have been ``shortsighted'' about what such a
loss might do to local services, such as police and fire
protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they had any idea the impact sales tax have on
states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich appears out of step with GOP leaders, who
Wednesday will accept an ``anti-tax'' report from Gov. James
Gilmore, R-Va., chairman of the Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was charged by Congress with making
recommendations on Internet tax policy. When it failed to reach the
prescribed ``supermajority'' of 13 votes to make a formal
recommendation, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told
Gilmore that Congress would accept a ``report'' based on a simple
majority.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 11-8, the panel approved a plan to keep the tax
moratorium until 2006 and provide tax exemptions for certain
Internet-based businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Lott and the top GOP leaders in the House, Speaker
Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas,
are expected to accept the report from Gilmore with glowing praise.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, in a speech Monday at the Information Technology
Association of America's national convention in Chicago, said ``the
Congress, under Republican leadership, will vote to extend the
moratorium on Internet taxes.'' He added: ``The party that believes
in more taxation is the Democrat Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Senate Commerce Committe Chairman John McCain,
R-Ariz., will hold a hearing on extending the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Prem, a partner with the accounting firm of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche, said that if the moratorium lasts until 2006, online
retailers probably will never collect the same sales taxes as
traditional retailers. ``The longer the status quo lasts, the
harder it will be to make changes later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich, a former governor of Ohio and mayor of Cleveland,
has been working with another former governor, Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., to build a bipartisan support for the extension of sales
tax collection duties into cyberspace. They were joined last month
by 10 other senators of both parties who signed a letter to Gilmore
saying: ``We strongly urge that the commission recommend support
for a 'level playing field' for all retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who signed was Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican from
Washington, home to the leading Internet retailer, Amazon.com.
While that company might benefit from avoiding tax collection
duties, the state derives about 59 percent of its revenues from
sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many business leaders also are siding with Voinovich and Graham,
including executives from traditional retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Parrish, a lobbyist for Tandy/RadioShack, said he believes
lawmakers will tone down their rhetoric as they become more engaged
in the tax debate. ``It would be unfortunate if this became
partisan, because it's too darned important for that,'' he said.

JUST A BOY CAUGHT IN A WHIRLWIND  
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday April 11) 
By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retired Judge Rex Sater can get quite passionate talking about
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he yells at his TV and admits news reports send him
into a ``blind rage.'' But his opinion on where the little boy
belongs is simple and uncluttered: Elian should be with his father.
In Sater's mind it's a simple custody case, having nothing to do
with how awful Cuba is versus how wonderful America is. Take away
the political grandstanding, ideological tug of war, media circus
and bureaucratic dithering and it's a regular family law decision.
</P>
<P>
   Father had joint custody; kid goes back to the father.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonoma County Superior Court judge revolutionized the way
child custody and divorce matters were settled in California. In
the 1980s he began forcing disputing parents to sit together to try
to work something out - meet and confer in legalese terms - before
asking him to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Once the two agreed, Sater made sure neither parent wiggled from
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Once a mother took a child to Europe, stashed the child with
relatives and briefly returned to California. Sater charged her
with contempt of court, put her in jail and told her she'd get out
once the child arrived at San Francisco International Airport and
was met by the father.
</P>
<P>
   The way Sater sees it, the mother of Elian was breaking the
agreement with Elian's father by taking Elian out of Cuba. Had she
lived she might have kept the father from ever seeing his child
again.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week authorities caught up with a California divorced
mother who three years ago took her son from his father, moved to
Sweden, changed their names, moved on to Spain and then Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Sater says there are thousands of kids around the United States
hiding with a parent who has grabbed them from the other. ``It's a
cruel thing to do to a child,'' he says, ``to just go off and
vanish.'' It's also not tolerated by courts who immediately issue
an order to bring the child back when the offending parent is
found.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Elian's isn't an everyday story. There are plots and
subplots and relatives and advocates all over the place. However,
if you take away presidential politics and Virgin Mary sightings,
you can almost see through the cotton candy haze to a familiar
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Florida relatives are like the weekend parent. The
eternal fun parent, desperate to prove love and devotion. In Miami,
Elian lives in a world of baby rabbits one day, water slides the
next, slick new shoes and a cell phone. You wonder if this child
ever goes to school. Every photo shows him with a new toy and being
hugged and kissed by relatives.
</P>
<P>
   This is the world of the weekend father or mother, the parent
who for understandable but not necessarily healthy reasons, tries
to court a child with excess.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is often employed by desperate parents who think
that the way to a child's heart is through best seats at the ball
game, all-you-can-eat chili dogs and staying up past bedtime,
unlike the boring routine over at their other house. In the average
divorce scenario, the boring parent, whose task is to keep the kid
in clean socks and get him to school during the week, resents
losing the popularity contest to the weekend parent.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced parents and their relatives compete for the kids. They
do it out of love and fear and resentment, along with the often
honest conviction that they are the better parent and don't approve
of the second household.
</P>
<P>
   Kids can become tiny tyrants when they are the object of
competition. Usually this ends when the weekend parent gets tired
of puppet shows. Child says to Dad, ``What are we doing this
weekend?'' and he says, ``Nothing special. We're staying home and
mowing the lawn.'' The child, accustomed to privilege, wails but
finally adjusts and learns to make do with just Dad.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say that a child can never have too many
people to love him.
</P>
<P>
   Divorced parents say this a lot, trying to make themselves feel
better about their child going back and forth between two houses
and eventually new step-families. In Elian's case, however, there
are almost too many people loving him.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer bodyguards and the near-hysterical devotees who
beg for a chance to touch his hand must be scary to a little kid.
The angry human chain link outside his house would give anyone
nightmares. Yet, the passions of his Miami family seem sincere and
heartfelt. They've made sacrifices to become Americans and have
obviously come to cherish this little boy. It would be wrenching to
give up a beloved child to a place you don't believe in. But the
same could be said of Elian's only living parent.
</P>
<P>
   Following Judge Sater's strategy, now that Elian's father is in
the U.S., maybe he and the Miami relatives can do the adult thing
and allow Elian to go back, not just to Cuba, but to being a little
boy again.

MOB JUSTICE RAGES IN CAMBODIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ What most unnerved Olivier de Bernon as
he faced a violent mob not long ago was the sight of a group of
Buddhist monks in their bright orange robes, laughing and pointing
at him.
</P>
<P>
   De Bernon, a French historian, had come across the crowd as it
was kicking and punching a young man accused of stealing a
motorbike. Without stopping to think, de Bernon stepped into the
crowd, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was already down and they were still beating him,'' de
Bernon said. ``At the beginning I had one leg shaking, a mixture of
fear and anger. I was so upset. I was so upset. I knew at once that
it was a lynching. They wanted to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a word being spoken, the crowd fell back at the sight of
the determined foreigner. And then, for the next two hours until an
ambulance arrived, de Bernon stood over the unconscious young man,
face to face with the crowd, a dozen passive police officers and
the group of giggling monks, who had not taken part in the attack
but found de Bernon's behavior so unusual as to be amusing.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of mob justice, often abetted by police officers who
say they find the lynchings and beatings a short-cut around the
vagaries of the courts, has become an epidemic in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of mob killings in the past year is one of many signs
of the failure of a justice system that the United Nations tried to
put in place here nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Critics both within and outside Cambodia say that the courts are
incompetent, politically subservient and thoroughly corrupt and
that well-connected people can commit the worst of crimes with
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has led most experts to agree that Cambodian courts
are unfit to conduct a fair and professional tribunal for the men
who led the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979, when more than 1 million
people lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When their guerrilla movement collapsed in the past two years,
most of the Khmer Rouge leaders retired, unchallenged, to quiet
lives in Phnom Penh and elsewhere. They include five former members
of the Khmer Rouge standing committee, prime defendants in any
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which has proposed an international court,
has reached an impasse with Prime Minister Hun Sen, who insists
that Cambodian prosecutors and judges dominate any tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   As this dispute continues, the spread of mob killings _ and the
number of ordinary Cambodians who support them _ offers its own
verdict on the quality of the judicial system: the lynchings have
become known as ``people's courts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `instant justice,''' said a foreign diplomat with long
experience here. ```Since there is no justice, I'll do it myself.'
And the police are often present and encourage people to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the fragility or even the nonexistence of any form of
a just system at any level. I think it also shows the frustration
of the people and the brutality of this culture, still. This is a
way to kill people very similar to the way the Khmer Rouge did it.
You don't need a gun; you can do it more cheaply.''
</P>
<P>
   Most discouraging to those who want to reform the justice system
is that many Cambodians seem not to see the difference between the
workings of a court system and the rule of the mob.
</P>
<P>
   When de Bernon returned to his office in Phnom Penh, where he is
based, he said, his Cambodian staff _ like the monks who had
watched him _ found his behavior peculiar. They tried to educate
him: ``But he was a thief,'' de Bernon recalled them saying.
``People were upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent example of this blind spot in Cambodia's
development is a new campaign by Hun Sen _ at least partly aimed at
impressing foreign critics _ to whip the judiciary into line by
executive fiat.
</P>
<P>
   In what he called an anticorruption campaign, he ordered the
police to re-arrest scores of suspects who were released without
trial or freed before their sentences were complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government respects the independence of the courts,'' the
prime minister said, ``But we cannot allow bad people inside the
court system to act improperly.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of attitude is at the nub of the dispute over a trial
of Khmer Rouge leaders, said Demelza Stubbings, a representative of
the London-based human rights group Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to be in charge of a tribunal of the Khmer
Rouge?'' she asked. ``Is the government going to tell the court to
try them again if it doesn't like the results?''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, experts here say, the outcome of any Cambodian-run
trials would be decided before they start. In what some people see
as a test case, one Khmer Rouge commander was tried last year for
killings committed after the group was driven from power. He was
found guilty; the trial took one day.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of these convictions by fiat is the debilitating
fact of life in Cambodia that people with power, influence or money
almost always go free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phrase `culture of impunity' has become almost a cliche,''
said the New York-based group Human Rights Watch in a recent report
on the justice system. ``The problem ranges from the failure to
prosecute Khmer Rouge leaders to hundreds of more recent unpunished
crimes committed by current government authorities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, their bodyguards, members of the military,
village leaders and their goons, well-connected brothel owners and
anybody with the money to pay for freedom _ rarely are any of these
punished.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been arrested in a grenade attack at an opposition
rally three years ago in which at least 17 people were killed and
more than 100 injured. No one has been arrested in more than 100
political killings that followed Hun Sen's coup in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When soldiers shot dead nine fishermen suspected of stealing
cows, the investigating judge told Human Rights Watch that she had
not taken any action on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about my safety because the case is connected to the
police, local authorities and the military,'' the investigator
explained. ``The police and the commune chief are OK, but the
military might be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if any of these cases were to reach a courtroom, the
administration of justice remains primitive.
</P>
<P>
   Most educated people _ including judges and lawyers _ were
executed during the Khmer Rouge period. Many of the survivors fled
as refugees in the 1980s, when Cambodia was occupied by Vietnam.
Real legal education has only begun here since the United Nations
tried to restore a civil society in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many judges have little or no legal education and
many have not been taught basic principles of justice.
</P>
<P>
   It is a paradox that Hun Sen has formally acknowledged the
inability of the courts to try the Khmer Rouge, while insisting
that they conduct the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people kill robbers in the streets is that they
have no trust in the courts,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   It was into this world of topsy-turvy ``justice'' that de Bernon
stepped the other day. The representative in Cambodia of the French
school of Asian affairs, l'Ecole francaise d'Extreme-Orient, he has
lived in Cambodia for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than two minutes it was clear that nothing would
happen to me,'' he recalled. ``I understood rapidly that none of
them was upset, enraged, angry. They were just giving way to their
bad instinct. Just because I was there I spoiled something, a
self-allowance beyond normal behavior. Physically I was nothing,
but I think I broke a game.''
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, he said, someone from the crowd would
approach the man on the ground and give a little kick or lift his
eyelids with a key to see whether he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood next to him, two hours, and when they came sometimes
to play with the body I interfered, gently, saying nothing,'' de
Bernon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he spoke to a member of the crowd only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I said was to a boy who kicked his head with
his heel,'' he said. ``I had a very bad glance at him and I called
him in Khmer, `You are a chicken with white ears.' A coward.''

   CENSUS _ WASHINGTON _ Census officials appear unlikely to meet
Tuesday's goal of increasing American participation in the
once-a-decade head count. Federal officials do not expect to meet
their target of a 70 percent mail-back rate for census
questionnaires, and may not match the 65 percent rate from 1990,
meaning the 2000 census will continue a 30-year trend of each count
being more expensive and less accurate than the last. (Holmes, Cox

   NETTAX-SENATORS _ WASHINGTON _ The top Republican leaders in
Congress plan an event Wednesday intended to establish the GOP as
the party standing steadfast against taxes on the Internet. But
behind the scenes, several Republican officials and business
leaders are trying to build a bipartisan coalition against a bill
that would extend a moratorium on new Internet taxes, including
sales taxes, until 2006. They say the bill, expected to clear the
Senate Commerce Committee this week, could erode the tax base for
state and local governments, forcing them to either boost income
and property taxes or turn to Washington for more federal grants
funded by income taxes. (Geewax, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

   SCFLAG _ COLUMBIA, S.C. _ State senators will debate for the
first time this year whether to remove the Confederate battle flag
from the top of the South Carolina Capitol. Already, the debate in
South Carolina _ where an NAACP tourism boycott is in effect _ has
taken its toll elsewhere. In Pensacola, Fla., the City of Five
flags, the city manager has removed the battle flag from city
property in favor of the national flag of the Confederacy. City
officials in Jackson, Miss., also removed the Confederate battle
flag from its buildings. Legislators in Mississippi, which uses the
battle emblem in its state flag, have debated whether to remove the
insignia. The emotional debate has seeped into Georgia, where the
SCLC has threatened a tourism boycott of the Peach State if the
General Assembly won't remove the Civil War battle design from the
state flag. South Carolina senators may debate the flag issue until
it reaches a compromise. Set up for debate starting Wednesday in
South Carolina senate. (Manuel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 &HT;    Delta will add Chile service on Nov. 1
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines will start service Nov. 1 between
Atlanta and Santiago, Chile. It is the carrier's latest move in a
2-year-old Latin route expansion that executives say is highly
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago will bring to 12 the number of destinations in Mexico,
Central America and South America that Delta serves from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That's up from four in early 1998, when the airline and its
just-hired chief executive, Leo Mullin, launched a wave of new
Latin routes.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to make Atlanta a new gateway for Latin travel,
offering an alternative to Miami, where American Airlines has the
industry's biggest Latin hub.
</P>
<P>
   Delta remains well behind American and Continental Airlines in
numbers of passengers handled and destinations served, but it makes
more money on its routes, said Jorge Fernandez, Delta's director
for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of profitability, we're No. 1,'' Fernandez said
Tuesday at a conference in Atlanta for Latin journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Delta executives say operating profit margin on Latin routes is
about 15 percent, 3 points higher than Delta's overall margin and
much higher than the Latin margins achieved by American and other
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that Delta has focused on flying to national
business centers rather than tourist destinations and more of its
passengers travel on higher, less-restricted fares.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin acknowledged the Latin expansion suffered early growing
pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first six months were demanding as we worked out snags and
overcame start-up costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the airline's efforts to market Atlanta as a better
connecting point than Miami have taken root.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making that representation and selling that
representation, and the great thing is it happens to be true,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Santiago flights, which are made possible by
an ``open skies'' U.S.-Chile air treaty, Delta also hopes to start
Atlanta-Bogota, Colombia flights this year. But it faces
competition from Continental for flight rights available under the
U.S.-Colombia air treaty, with a decision by the U.S. Department of
Transportation expected by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Delta also wants badly to add Atlanta-Buenos Aires, Argentina
flights, but cannot until pending air treaty issues are resolved
and the DOT awards routes to carriers. Destinations now served by
Delta from Atlanta are three cities in Mexico, two in Brazil and
one each in Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and
Venezuela.

ALBEE TAKES HIS DISAPPEARING BABY TO HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In Edward Albee's new play, ``The Play About the
Baby,'' which opens Wednesday at the Alley Theater, a young married
couple have a baby and soon find themselves bedeviled by two
strangers, an older man and woman. Eventually the child disappears.
Truth? Illusion? What happened to the baby? As usual, Albee leaves
it to the audience, except to say, yes, there was a real baby.
</P>
<P>
   When the play was first presented at the Almeida Theater in
London in 1998, as directed by Howard Davies, the reviews were
sharply divided. After a possible New York production was
postponed, Albee decided to do it at the Alley, a familiar regional
theater that allows him complete artistic freedom. He cast the play
with American actors, including Marian Seldes and Earle Hyman as
the older couple. Both have worked with him before, Seldes most
recently in ``Three Tall Women,'' Hyman in 1980 in ``The Lady From
Dubuque.''
</P>
<P>
   Albee is directing the play himself. During rehearsals, when the
director wanted to cut a page and a half of dialogue as
``self-indulgent,'' the playwright raised no objection. ``I spoke
to him,'' said the director. ``He trusts me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then Albee has been restudying the play, cutting lines and
adding others, balancing a need for clarification against a wish to
retain a certain level of ambiguity. At the first preview, on
Friday night, some lines were missed and the voice of a prompter
was heard. On Saturday the performance was tighter, but there were
still rough edges, especially in the second act.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a passageway leading to the stage, unseen by the
actors or the audience, the playwright watched and made mental
notes. Was the audience following the story? Did the actors have
the right spontaneity? In the original script, the evening ended
with a coda. An oversize, puppetlike baby crawled on stage, an
attempt at a coup de theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Davies had excised the scene from the London production, and now
Albee has restored it, with a Houston actress inside the puppet.
But in previews doubts remained. Did the audience realize that this
baby was a metaphor? Was it confusing?
</P>
<P>
   While expressing his appreciation of Davies for ``teaching me a
lot about the play,'' Albee is trying to place his authorial
imprint on the production. Describing differences from the London
version, he said, ``It's an American play, being done in America,
by American actors.'' The older actors are also older by a
generation, with Seldes and Hyman assuming the roles created by
Frances de la Tour and Alan Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston production is less naturalistic. In London the play
took place in a sparsely furnished loftlike space that could have
been the young couple's apartment. In Albee's version, the setting
is bright, almost bare _ two modular chairs and a bench simulating
a stage, or what he calls ``a presentational space.'' At various
times the actors address the audience directly: they are performers
and the play is, as intended, at least partly a vaudeville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not A Couple,'' Albee said of the older pair. ``They
just have a job to do.'' And that job? Albee smiled and with some
reluctance said, ``My subject is the compromises we make and the
lies we tell ourselves because living on the edge is too dangerous.
The play is about how much pain and loss we can take, and when we
can take it.'' He paused and said in an aside: ``A rollicking
comedy about how much pain and loss we can take, he said,
laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he quoted a pivotal section from the play: ``Our reality is
determined by our need'' and ``The greater the need rules the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the origin of the play, Albee said there was a direct
connection to ``The Lady From Dubuque.'' Both plays share that
central theme of ``how we determine our own reality.'' In both,
there are two mysterious figures imposing themselves on a new
environment.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Play About the Baby,'' the author's sympathies would
seem to be with the young people. As he said, ``When you come to
the end of your life, the most awful thing is to think you haven't
lived. Regret over what we have done is OK, but regret over what we
have failed to do or chosen not to do is unforgivable. And I
suppose that's a theme that runs through all my plays.'' He added,
``That won't stop a lot of people from misunderstanding, from
thinking my themes are all about my being adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was annoyed by interviewers who say: ``Well, Mr.
Albee, you've written another play about a baby. Obviously it
relates to the non-existent baby in `Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?' and the destroyed baby in `The American Dream,' doesn't
it?'' His response is that it doesn't, and that it only perpetuates
a myth.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the young couple in ``The Play About the Baby,''
he said: ``There's an Adam and Eve quality to these kids. So
innocent, so pure'' _ until life comes along and knocks them down,
or, as he said, ``grows them up.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation backstage, Seldes carried the Edenic
comparison one step further. For her the young people are like Adam
and Eve and she and Hyman ``are the snakes,'' insinuating
themselves and then invading the romantic and parental paradise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that the wound that will stay with them forever?'' Seldes
asked. ``That the baby's gone, that people turn away for a moment
and a child falls into a pool and drowns. What is your most beloved
thing in life? Your child.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She drew a personal memory: ``Edward and I were born in the same
year, and the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby was the first major
event outside my life, in the newspaper. I mentioned that to Edward
and he said he had a bow and arrow ready to kill the kidnappers
when they came.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play questions of kidnapping and child abandonment are
raised, and theatergoers may think about related cases in the news
and in other Albee plays. The author would prefer not to.
</P>
<P>
   Several moments in the play refer to the author's own life. At
one point, the older man remembers being host at a party and
standing next to a ``tall older woman.'' Trying to introduce her to
two of his friends, he realizes he has forgotten who she is. One of
his friends says, ``We know your mother, dear.''
</P>
<P>
   That incident and the momentary memory lapse happened to Albee
himself. But, as with all such episodes, it has been transferred to
a fictional character _ and it makes a point about parents and
children.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the themes of the play, Gregory Boyd, the artistic
director of the Alley, widens their relevance. ``It's back to
American subject matter,'' he said: ``pipe dreams, illusions
shattered, as in `The Iceman Cometh,' `Streetcar,' `Death of a
Salesman' _ and `Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'''

   While readying the play for its opening, Albee has also been
teaching playwriting at the University of Houston, as he has for
more than a decade. At his winter home in Florida, before returning
to Houston, he was working on a new play, tentatively titled, ``Who
Is Sylvia?'' It is, he said, tersely, ``about the limits of
tolerance.'' He is eager to return to that work, but for the
present he is preoccupied with ``The Play About the Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Between performances, rehearsals and revisions continue. Sunday,
Albee made a crucial change. He decided to remove that final image
of the larger-than-life baby. In place of it, he wrote new dialogue
for the young couple, trying to end the play on a sadder, more
intimate note. The director and the playwright were in complete
agreement.

ESTEE LAUDER TURNS TO OLDER MODEL TO BECOME ITS `FACE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Hurley, a darling of Hollywood and the official face
of cosmetics company Estee Lauder since 1995, is being bumped from
the spotlight as the primary Lauder spokesmodel. At 34, she's too
old, right? Actually, she's been upstaged by a 54-year-old, Karen
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   A successful model in the 1970s and '80s, Graham appeared on the
cover of Vogue 20 times and served as the Estee Lauder spokesmodel
from 1970 to 1985, before she retired at 40.
</P>
<P>
   Now Estee Lauder has wooed her back for a new campaign,
promoting an eye and face cream line called Resilience Lift,
designed for women over 35. (Hurley will continue to represent
other Lauder products). Says Graham, ``This is not Elizabeth's
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham is one of a growing corps of older models, including
Cindy Crawford (33) and Isabella Rossellini (47), who are extending
their careers past 30, the typical retirement age for most models.
Part of their success stems from demographics. About 53 percent of
American women are 35 years old and older, according to the US
Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Society's attitude toward aging is changing as people live
longer and healthier lives. ``Society is getting rid of traditional
constraints and ideas that older women are just ready for the
garbage heap, that older women aren't sexy or shouldn't look
beautiful,'' says Ruth P. Rubinstein, an associate professor of
sociology at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, models like Graham don't exactly look old. At 5 feet
7, Graham, a green-eyed blonde, weighs just 128 pounds. Her skin
appears smooth, firm, and relatively wrinkle-free. (Graham says she
hasn't had surgery). ``You don't have to be young to be
beautiful,'' Graham says with laughter. ``I think there's beauty at
every age. I can remember my grandmother in her 80s had beauty. . .
. Beauty comes from within.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's secret may be her lifestyle. Since she retired in 1985,
the Mississippi native has shunned the city life, operating a
fly-fishing school in Rosendale, N.Y., with business partner Bert
Darrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout most of my adult life, I've always enjoyed fly
fishing,'' Graham says in her soft Southern accent. ``I always did
my best thinking on the trout trail. There's almost a zen-like
quality. I regain my perspective in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's skills are such that she was hired by ESPN recently to
cohost a fly-fishing show, which will debut in January 2001. ``We
just came back from filming in Patagonia last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham hadn't intended to be a TV host or a fashion model. The
daughter of two accountants, she attended the University of
Mississippi and the Sorbonne in Paris in the mid-1960s, with the
goal of becoming a high school French teacher.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Graham moved to New York to look for a job.
She was shopping at Bonwit Teller one afternoon in 1969 when she
began chatting with a woman while walking down the back stairs.
``When we got to the street, she handed me her card,'' Graham
recalls. ``She said, `My name is Eileen Ford. I have the best
modeling agency in the world. Please call me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Graham hesitated. ``I was afraid my parents would be very
disappointed. In those days, daughters were not always given a full
college education. We were encouraged to go to secretarial
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Graham did call Ford, and her success was immediate.
Photographer Irving Penn pushed Vogue editors Diana Vreeland and
Grace Mirabella to use her. From 1970 to 1975, Graham landed on the
cover 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   She also began working frequently for Estee Lauder. ``I started
being known in the business as the Estee Lauder girl,'' she
recalls. ``I was getting so identified with them that I was losing
money from other companies.'' So Graham requested a contract, a
bold move back then when contracts were unheard of. Her gamble paid
off. Estee Lauder agreed to sign Graham initially for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Her lifestyle was far from glamorous. There were no limousines,
no Hollywood-style parties, no paparazzi. ``Models weren't
celebrities then,'' she says. ``I would leave my apartment, catch a
taxi, and go to the studio. I'd put my own makeup on, they'd shoot,
and I'd go back home. . . It was a very quiet life.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham retired at 40 because, she says, ``I had made up my mind
years prior that I was going to stop when I was on top. I wanted to
leave on my own accord. I didn't want to be phased out or asked to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   When Estee Lauder called in 1998, she was thrilled. ``Now,
models are celebrities,'' she says. ``They're making tons of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I had this flash of terror. . . I said, `You must not
realize how old I am.' But Estee Lauder said they wanted to show
that women nowadays are active and vital, just like me. I said,
`You promise I don't have to look young and perfect?' They said,
`No, we don't want you to look perfect. That's the point.' ''

DISSAPOINTING AVONEX SALES TRIM BIOGEN SHARE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biogen Inc. shares plunged $12 to a 52-week low of $53 Tuesday
after the company's reported that sales of Avonex, its multiple
sclerosis drug, were lower than Wall Street analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   Investor reaction led to a dramatic sell-off which reached a
fever pitch as nearly 20 million Biogen shares were traded _ five
times its average daily volume in recent months. Barely 7 1/2 weeks
ago, Biogen shares reached a record high of $129 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic drop was so severe that it helped fuel a 3.8
percent drop in the Nasdaq Biotechnology index.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of new investors in biotech stocks and seeing
Biogen slip slightly has cast a pall over the industry,'' said Eric
T. Schmidt, biotechnology analyst at SG Cowen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said the skittishness comes just before major biotech
companies such as Amgen Inc., Genentech Inc., and Millennium
Pharmaceuticals Inc. report their quarterly financial results.
Genentech shares dropped $21 to close at $135.50 while Millennium's
stock fell $15.50 to $134. Amgen stock rose 25 cents to $59.135.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Biogen reported Avonex revenues of $174.6 million for
the first quarter, a 33 percent increase over the first quarter of
1998. The jump came largely from the addition of 2,000 new
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts, however, were looking for $180 million
in Avonex revenue and upward of 3,000 new users for the first three
months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look shows that Avonex sales during the first three
months of this year rose only 1.5 percent over 1999's fourth
quarter _ a factor Schmidt claims was ``idiosyncratic.'' He and
other analysts said Biogen's results were partly due to retail
buyers stocking up on Avonex at the end of last year due to
concerns over a possible year 2000 computer glitch. A second factor
was increased competition in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A Biogen spokeswoman said the Cambridge, Mass. company had no
comment on its stock movements.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen's lower first-quarter results prompted Schmidt to reduce
his sales estimate for Avonex to $792 million for the entire year,
down from $825 million. Last year Avonex revenues were $621 million
and $395 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonas V. Alsenas, the biotech analyst at ING Barings LLC,
said Biogen could easily make up the Avonex revenue shortfall in
the second and third quarter.

EXILES DOUBT FATHER'S SINCERITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ They don't believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez says he wants to return to Cuba with his
son, Elian, and they call him a puppet. Gonzalez says he is
speaking from the heart, and they insist he's been brainwashed. No
matter what Gonzalez says -- unless he comes out with much of the
Cuban exile community wants to hear, that he wants to stay in the
United States -- they will accuse him of deceiving himself and
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I believe him? Unfortunately, no, because I know all too
well the pressure he is under,'' said Lourdes D'Kendall, a local
radio commentator who has a 6-year-old of her own. ``He is on free
soil, but he is not a free man. He is still under Fidel Castro's
thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   To many of the Cubans who boarded airplanes, boats and rickety
rafts to make their way to Florida and freedom, it is unfathomable
that any father would choose a communist dictatorship over
democracy for his son. They simply cannot accept the decisions
Gonzalez is making for his family.
</P>
<P>
   But even the exiles adamantly opposed to returning Elian to Cuba
say they can easily imagine what lies behind his choice: fear of
economic retaliation and fear of worse than that. Many of them know
first-hand the need to lie, or to shade the truth, in order to
spare family and friends still in Cuba punishment for acts in which
they had no say. Cuba, after all, is a country where political
opponents are imprisoned, where dissidents sometimes disappear
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Cubans in exile, like those from Czechoslovakia or
Poland or whoever is living under a totalitarian regime, know that
even though you are on free soil you can still be hurt,'' said Luis
Aguilar Leon, a Cuba scholar and historian at the University of
Miami. ``You have friends, maybe family, who can suffer. Anyone in
high school in Cuba knows this.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gonzalez awaits his son in Washington, where he arrived
last week, Elian's grandmothers remain in Cuba. So do the friends
who have spoken highly of Gonzalez's parenting skills, even as
unsubstantiated rumors of alleged abusive episodes spread through
an exile community eager for any reason to discredit his claims.
</P>
<P>
   To exiles, the fact that he has family still in Cuba is evidence
enough that even when Gonzalez stepped before a bank of microphones
in Washington he could not speak openly. To them, it proves that he
is not free to defect even as he lives stays with his wife and
their infant son in a Cuban official's residence where diplomatic
immunity has been suspended for the duration of his visit. That,
they say, must be why he has not asked any of his visitors, US Rep.
James McGovern (D-Mass.) among them, for help in obtaining
political asylum and, instead, has pressed them to help his family,
once reunited with Elian, to return to Cuba intact.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he has told US Attorney General Janet Reno, who is
scheduled to meet Wednesday in Miami with Elian's relatives and
exile community leaders to try to resolve the custody standoff, is
what he has had to tell her, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional view is that people fake their feelings to
survive. . .,'' said Jaime Suchlicki, director of the Institute for
Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami. ``If
the father were to defect, it would be a major defeat for Castro.
He's a very vindictive guy so Elian's father would fear that kind
of thing. He would know that Fidel would not accept this laying
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But the signs that Gonzalez is not being upfront go deeper, at
least for the exiles who demonstrate daily outside the house where
Elian has been living with the great uncle now fighting for custody
of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   They note that Gonzalez appears to have known that his former
wife was fleeing Cuba with Elian. They mention that he did not
immediately fly to Miami upon learning of Elian's Thanksgiving Day
rescue after his mother drowned -- indicating, in their opinion,
that Castro has orchestrated Gonzalez' actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody believes the father,'' said Rene Martinez, a bank
teller attending the candlelight prayer vigil that brought out
thousands of Cuban-Americans Monday night. ``A lot of us have lived
under Castro and under his dictatorship. They pull so many strings
it's like they can turn you into a puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Florida-born Annamaria Hernandez, who represents artists
and musicians and whose parents fled Cuba, ``We don't believe him
because we know how the Castro government and the dictatorship
regime works. It's obvious that we haven't gotten the truth. It's
all a show.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, many exiles say, is not only occurring in Miami, where
Elian's relatives refuse to cede custody, and in Washington, where
federal officials have so far been unable to persuade them to hand
over the boy. It is, they say, also taking place in Cuba, where
little Elian has become a powerful symbol to the communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Often sneering, sometimes shouting, exiles point out that
Gonzalez has incentives to return that go beyond the safety of his
relatives still in Cuba. His house has been freshly painted. He now
has a TV or two, luxuries most impoverished Cubans are unable to
afford. He is all but guaranteed a standard of living out of reach
of ordinary Cubans and out of his reach before Elian came to
symbolize communist solidarity. Who, they ask, bought him the dark
suit he has been wearing and the leather dress shoes?
</P>
<P>
   As Luis Aguilar Leon put it, ``A totalitarian government is in a
distant way like the mafia: You say what we want you to say and
we'll give you things; if you don't, we'll make things very
unpleasant. It's a dual power that he has over Elian's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, of course, Gonzalez has maintained that he wants his
son and he wants him to live in Cuba. In an open letter to US
Senate leaders, published in Cuba last month, he urged legislators
to reject any attempt to grant him and his son permanent residency
status. His Washington attorney, Gregory B. Craig, has repeatedly
said that the Gonzalez family has no intention of defecting during
their stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Scripted words all, Cuban exiles claim, ones they recognize
almost instinctively.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else are we supposed to believe?'' asked Rene Iturrey, a
real estate broker who has made almost daily pilgrimmages to the
great uncle's house in Little Havana. ``When are we going to know
if he is speaking the truth? Will we ever know?''

CANADA TO CONSIDER ENDANGERED-SPECIES LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Long criticized for its failure to protect rare
wildlife, Canada Tuesday introduced its first federal endangered
species legislation, more than a quarter-century after the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Minister David Anderson said the long-awaited
bill, if passed by the House of Commons, will impose stiff
penalties on corporations and private landowners that kill
endangered species or destroy their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing species today at a much faster rate, and that is
due to human activity,'' Anderson told Parliament in Ottawa, the
capital. ``We must turn this trend around and ensure species will
not become extinct or endangered in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Most controversially, the law would imposes fines of up to
$700,000 or jail terms for executives of companies that harm
endangered animals or plants. Mining and logging are highly
important sectors of the Canadian economy, and the bill has been
fought by natural resources companies, which enjoy far greater
political clout in Canada than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For all the government rhetoric surrounding the bill _ years in
the making, and still likely to undergo modification in Parliament
_ leading environmental organizations criticized it as too lenient
and riddled with loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a strong bill, and on the whole we're quite
disappointed,'' said Gregory Hamara, spokesman for the World
Wildlife Fund Canada. ``Canada is still falling far short of
endangered species laws in the US and even Mexico. We're behind
nearly every country in the Western world on this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the environmentalist view, the most glaring problem with the
proposed law is its failure to provide consistent and uniform
protection for the 340 species at risk in Canada. These species
include the beluga whale, swift fox, burrowing owl, piping plover,
and northern cricket frog, as well as such plant species as the
pink coreopis of southwestern Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 70,000 species of animals and plants exist in Canada,
many found nowhere else on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The bill applies only to federally-owned lands, not provincial
lands or private land. An in a gigantic exemption, federal lands
north of 60 degrees latitude _ a gigantic swath encompassing more
than a third of the entire country _ will not come under the law,
an apparent sop to aboriginal people who claim a ``traditional''
right to hunt any creature they please.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't give broad protection to species or, most
critically, to their habitats,'' said Rita Morbida, biodiversity
coordinator for the Sierra Club of Canada. ``It's a step forward,
but a timid little step. It leaves too much to the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics were especially unhappy that the bill leaves it to
cabinet ministers, not scientists, to determine what species of
flora and fauna will receive protection under the law, more or less
on a case-by-case basis. Cabinet ministers are the top politicians
who oversee the day-to-day workings of Canada's government under
the direction of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Minister Anderson defended the bill during a news
conference. ``I don't see any better legislation anywhere else in
the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental activists did praise the government for its
approach of seeking common ground behind environmentalists,
industry and private landowners, especially farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is really striving to encourage cooperation,
and trying to defuse confrontation,'' Morbida said. ``But at some
point, you have say `Look, such-and-such a species is endangered,
so you can't kill it in Canada, period.' This bill doesn't even do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson said Canada has no need for such a tough and
uncompromising law as that in the United States, where the
Endangered Species Act has been accused of occasionally going to
extreme lengths to defend a handful of salamanders or obscure fish
against any agricultural or industrial development.
</P>
<P>
   ``An automatic system which allows no involvement of people
whose interests might be affected is clearly unacceptable in a
democracy,'' he said. ``Our legislation is a great deal better than
the American law.''

MORE PARENTS ARE TALKING TO THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT DRUGS, POLL
FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More parents now say they are talking with their children about
illegal drugs than in previous years, but they also harbor doubts
about whether their warnings do much good, according to a
nationwide survey of attitudes released Tuesday on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 800 parents across the country was sponsored by
the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, a coalition of advertising
and public relations specialists trying to make adolescents and
children more aware of the risks of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The full survey is available on the Net at
www.drugfreeamerica.org.
</P>
<P>
   The annual survey found that 57 percent of the parents sampled
in 1999 said they had spoken with their children about drugs at
least four times in the past year, compared with 44 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   And 64 percent of the parents who raised the issue in 1999 felt
that they had done ``thoroughly,'' compared with 52 percent in
1998. More of them also said they had explained how drug use can
affect a child's mind, education and life.
</P>
<P>
   A multimillion-dollar media campaign by the government to
discourage youthful drug use has urged parents to help by
discussing drugs with their children. And recent surveys, like the
Monitoring The Future study released by the University of Michigan
last December, report that adolescent drug use, after rising
sharply since 1992, has leveled off, and even begun to decline
among some younger age groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey released by the Partnership for a Drug-Free
America also reported that many parents felt overwhelmed by the
drug problem and lacked confidence in their ability to dissuade
their children from experimenting with drugs, especially marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty percent of the parents sampled last year said they
believed there was ``nothing I can really do to help the drug
problem,'' a sharp increase from the 23 percent who agreed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of the parents agreed that ``most people will try
marijuana sometimes,'' compared with 65 percent in 1995, the last
year that the question was asked.
</P>
<P>
   And one-third of the parents said that marijuana would be ``very
easy'' for their children to get, compared with 24 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of parents sampled last year said they believed
that ``what I say will have little influence on whether my child
tries marijuana.'' The numbers were even higher for black parents
(40 percent) and of Hispanic parents (43 percent) who were
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard D. Bonnette, president of the partnership, said that
when teen-agers were asked what risks they associated with drugs,
``disappointing their parents'' ranks at the top year after year.
</P>
<P>
   He said that children who learned a lot at home about the risks
of drugs were up to 50 percent less likely to try drugs, according
to data collected by the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``While parents may be overwhelmed by the enormity of the drug
problem,'' Bonnette said, ``we've got to help them understand that
the fight against drugs isn't one massive battle _ it's thousands
of little ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted for the partnership by Audits &AMP; Surveys
Worldwide Inc., has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6
percentage points.

&HT;     RENO PLANS TO TRAVEL TO MIAMI TO END ELIAN SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno will likely travel to
Miami Wednesday to try to end the stalemate over the transfer of
Elian Gonzalez to his father, a Justice Department official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision came as the Department prepared to send a letter
directing Elian's Miami relatives to turn over the 6-year-old boy
at a definite time and place, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Reno would like to meet with federal officials, community leaders
and Elian's Miami relatives. However, the source said Reno's
planned trip would not change the timetable being worked out for
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said no decisions
have been made about precise transfer instructions because
officials were evaluating the advice of three doctors who had seen
the boy's father and the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas
met with Reno here Tuesday and said afterward she was willing to
intervene personally to help resolve the family dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general stated to us that she would be very
willing to meet with Lazaro Gonzalez or any (other) member of the
Gonzalez family in Miami and that she wants to meet with community
leaders in Miami,'' Carollo told reporters gathered in front of the
Justice Department building.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, has cared for the boy
since he was found in the ocean Thanksgiving Day. Elian was one of
three survivors of a shipwreck in which his mother, her boyfriend
and nine others drowned when their boat sank as they were trying to
flee Cuba for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision came hours after the boy's Miami relatives
offered to meet with his Cuban father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, at a
neutral site in South Florida. But the relatives said the proposed
meeting would be a face-to-face family talk, not a handover of
Elian _ something both Juan Gonzalez and the Justice Department
have demanded as a prerequisite for such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have insisted that the boy remain in the
United States until their lawsuit seeking to overturn the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's decision in January to
return him to his father is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Reno won a U.S. District Court ruling affirming the
INS decision.
</P>
<P>
   Reno settled on the transfer plan after conferring with INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner, who had been briefed Tuesday by the
three government-appointed doctors.
</P>
<P>
   These doctors _ two child psychiatrists and a psychologist _
held talks with Lazaro Gonzalez, in Miami Monday. A day earlier,
they met here in Washington with Elian's father, who arrived in the
United States last week to take custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   The experts told Meissner that Lazaro Gonzalez is balking at the
idea of transferring Elian to his father at a neutral site outside
of South Florida, according to the government source.
</P>
<P>
   The family said it was willing to meet Juan Gonzalez at the
Miami area home of Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, a Catholic nun, or
``any other neutral place in South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, O'Laughlin hosted a meeting between Elian and
his grandmothers from Cuba. Later O'Laughlin said she thought the
boy should remain with his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The family's proposal, which came in a letter to one of the
government's psychiatrists, said a private family conference with
Juan Gonzalez could be ``followed almost immediately by a meeting
to include Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   It also demanded assurances that Elian would not be taken from
them during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meeting should take place before any further action is
taken on the part of the INS or the Department of Justice,'' lawyer
Manny Diaz told reporters in Miama. Diaz added that the meeting
should be strictly among family members, with no lawyers or
officials present.
</P>
<P>
   Florman said the government would pass the proposal on to Juan
Gonzalez and that the decision to meet with the family would up to
him and not her department.
</P>
<P>
   She would not comment on whether the father would be willing to
travel to Florida from Bethesda, Md., where he has been staying
with a Cuban diplomat since arriving from Havana last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Miami relatives, pursuing another legal effort in
the nearly 5-month-old custody battle, filed a brief in Florida
Family Court Tuesday morning, asking for a full hearing to bar
Elian's return to Cuba until his father's fitness is considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many, many other issues concerning the best
interests of this child that are important,'' said Eduardo Rasco,
an attorney for the relatives. ``And those issues are never going
to be decided by INS.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief said Juan Miguel Gonzalez ``has engaged in abusive
conduct,'' allegations the attorneys said the federal court never
considered. It said Lazaro Gonzalez intends to prove that Juan
Miguel Gonzalez ``has lost all rights to control his (Elian's)
destiny,'' and that the boy would be subject to ``imminent
indoctrination'' if he returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The father's attorneys have characterized the abuse allegations,
which some relatives have made earlier, as a desperate tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department asked the family court to dismiss the new
request, saying a state judge has no jurisdiction to overrule
federal immigration law.

 &HT;    CLINTON TAKING GUN MESSAGE TO DENVER
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton goes to Denver to press his
national campaign for federal gun controls Wednesday, one day after
the House approved an alternative plan to give $100 million to
states willing to impose mandatory jail terms on armed criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling approaches to the problem of gun violence in America
have set the stage for a heated election-year debate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's line, which he will defend in a two-hour televised
town meeting from Denver, is that federal gun controls should be
tightened.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to attend a rally, sponsored by a Denver
group called Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic (SAFE),
aimed at drumming up support for an upcoming statewide vote on
legislation that would require background checks for purchasers of
firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is bracing for the April 20 anniversary of the tragedy in
nearby Littleton, Colo., where two teenagers took their own lives
after shooting and killing 12 students and a teacher at Columbine
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called for federal laws mandating childproof safety
locks on new handguns, a ban on high-volume ammunition clips, and
background checks on anyone who buys a firearm at a flea market or
gun show.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate narrowly approved those measures last May as part of
a larger juvenile justice bill. The vote was 51-50, with Vice
President Al Gore casting the tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   A companion bill in the House was approved without those
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   A conference committee charged with working up compromise
legislation acceptable to both houses has yet to resolve the
differences.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton went to Annapolis, the capital of Maryland,
to praise that state for passing its own childproof lock law and to
nudge Congress to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in America deserves the protection you have given
Maryland's children,'' Clinton said in remarks to Gov. Parris
Glendening and state legislators. ``And only Congress can provide
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a jab at the Republican-controlled Congress and that party's
standard-bearer, presidential hopeful George W. Bush, Clinton said
the majority on Capitol Hill were thwarting the wishes of the
majority of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth,'' said Clinton, ``the people are ahead of most of
the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   From the floor of the House, the Republicans fired back,
sponsoring a bill to provide $20 million a year, for five years, in
block grant assistance to states that approve mandatory minimum
prison terms for anyone who commits a crime while armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is get-tough legislation,'' said Chris Paulitz, spokesman
for the Republican National Committee. ``This ensures that the
criminals who use guns in crimes actually go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by an overwhelming 358-60 majority vote, with
208 Republicans and 149 Democrats voting for it. Voting against the
bill were 56 Democrats, three Republicans and the body's sole
independent.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart denounced the bill as a
tactic employed by Republicans who want to appear tough on gun
violence but who do not support strengthened gun controls. He said
Democrats who voted for it did so only to avoid being painted as
soft on crime in November, when all House members are up for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats saw a political trap and decided not to fall for
it,'' said Lockhart. ``In reality, what it is is a cruel political
trick on the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart assailed the Republican leadership in Congress for not
taking up Clinton's request for $280 million in funding to hire
1,000 additional prosecutors and 500 additional agents for the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Those resources
are needed, said Lockhart, to increase the prosecution of
gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, said Lockhart, excludes the 44 states that
lack mandatory sentencing laws for criminals with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get enforcement money, people in the courts, people on
the streets right now with the Democratic approach.,'' said
Lockhart. ``There is absolutely no likelihood that tomorrow, 44
states are going to go into their legislature and pass a law to
come into compliance with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lockhart, ``How are kids in those 44 states supposed to
feel when they've seen the Republican alternative? I think they'll
think it's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulitz countered that it is the Democrats that are playing
politics with gun-related violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to say, but the Democratic Party goes into campaign
mode when there's a tragedy, instead of trying to find real
solutions,'' said Paulitz. ``They're using this for a political
tool.''

 &HT;    New Mexico's versatile Urlacher just ready to play
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brian Urlacher might be going through an identity
crisis. Ever since his workout at the scouting combine in March,
NFL scouts have been shaking their heads and wondering what
position he'll play.
</P>
<P>
   Urlacher, who last season was the Mountain West Conference
Player of the Year, played free safety at New Mexico. He also
returned punts and kickoffs and played tight end in the Lobos'
short-yardage offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Urlacher, 6 feet 3 and 258 pounds, is too big to play free
safety in the NFL. Some pro teams like him as a strong safety
because he is an aggressive tackler. Others have him at middle
linebacker because of his size. And still others have him at
outside linebacker because of his speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care where I play,'' Urlacher said. ``I just want to
get drafted the highest I can go. I really don't care where I play.
I just want to get on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Urlacher rarely left the field in college. He led the nation in
tackles as a junior with 178 and had 154 last season. As a senior,
Urlacher caused five fumbles and recovered three, intercepted one
pass, averaged 15.8 yards on punt returns and 26 yards on kickoff
returns. He also scored touchdowns on six of his seven receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a phenomenal athlete,'' said Vinny Cerrato, the
Washington Redskins' director of player personnel. ``He covers
punts, returns punts, breaks up passes _ he even had six touchdown
catches. He loves to play the game. In terms of tackling ability,
he's one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Urlacher is widely regarded as the second-best linebacker in the
draft, behind Penn State's LaVar Arrington. He also might be the
draft's best prospect at defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bears reportedly are eyeing him with the ninth pick.
Chicago needs help at outside linebacker and strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a guy who is 6-3, weighs (258) and runs 4.5 or 4.6
(seconds in the 40-yard dash),'' Bears defensive coordinator Greg
Blache said. ``He played free safety, hits people hard, makes a lot
of plays and is very mature. He's impressive; the guy is a rare
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Urlacher played middle linebacker his first two seasons at New
Mexico. But he moved to strong safety as a junior and eventually
started playing on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew with the team we had this year, the coach was going to
ask me to do a lot,'' Urlacher said. ``In preparation each week,
I'd try to watch an hour of film every day before practice. Then
we'd watch film for two hours after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For conditioning, I tried to run everything as much as I could
because I knew I was going to be on the field a lot. That was the
biggest thing I was worried about toward the end of the game,
getting tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL draft begins Saturday.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by N.Y. Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   ``He shall be hailed as son of God, and they shall call him the
son of the most high'' sounds like a passage from the New Testament
describing Jesus Christ. Yet it comes from a Dead Sea scroll that
scholars say was written a generation before Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   But overlooked for the 50 years since that little-known scroll
was discovered in Qumran's Cave 4 is evidence that the scholars are
wrong and that it -- along with other Dead Sea Scrolls -- could not
have been written until long after the rise of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Son of God'' text, the scroll reads, in part:
``He shall be hailed as son of God, and they shall call him the son
of the most high ... . His kingdom will be an eternal kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Luke's New Testament account of the annunciation, the angel
Gabriel told Mary: ``He will be great, and will be called the son
of the Most High ... and of His kingdom there will be no end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Son of God text is part of a major Dead Sea Scroll exhibit
that opened in March and runs through June 11 at Chicago's Field
Museum, featuring portions of 15 scrolls along with 80 artifacts
from the Qumran area.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Sea Scrolls supposedly were written by a Jewish sect
over a period that began as early as 200 years before the birth of
Christ and ended early in the first century.
</P>
<P>
   About 68 AD, most scholars believe, the scrolls were stashed in
caves overlooking the Dead Sea where they remained undisturbed
until 1947 when an Arab shepherd boy stumbled upon them.
</P>
<P>
   But questions about their origins remain, and new ones are being
asked about discrepancies in photographs of some scrolls that are
significantly different from one publication to the next.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, several published photos of the Son of God text
contain differences in lettering, margins and other details that
some experts are at a loss to explain. These discrepancies in key
passages raise the possibility that the photos have been doctored.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Bock, professor of New Testament at Dallas Theological
Seminary, who considers the Son of God text to be ``one of the most
important texts for New Testament studies found (at Qumran),''
expressed alarm after studying the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what is being circulated evidences significant differences
between supposedly similar passages, then all photos, microfilms,
microfiches, and all published material (about this text) have to
be disregarded, and someone with excellent credentials must look at
this text and see what is really going on,'' Bock said. ``There is
(reason) here for questions to be raised and a need for answers to
be given.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bock was not the first to notice that words were
added by scroll scholars to the modern transcriptions and
translations that are not present or properly noted in the original
Son of God text.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am speaking very conservatively now, but, at best, it is
very sloppy scholarship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a Jewish paleographer called it ``immoral and
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Baumgarten, a member of the Dead Sea Scrolls team and
a professor at Baltimore Hebrew University, minimized the apparent
discrepancies, saying the scholars involved in transcribing and
translating the text made judgment calls based on their expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fraud,'' Baumgarten said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Dead Sea Scroll scholars have used the scrolls to
support an increasingly popular view that there was little
originality in the divine claims by the carpenter from Nazareth --
claims that led to his crucifixion and became the cornerstone of
Christianity itself.
</P>
<P>
   But University of Chicago scholar John Collins goes farther than
most in discussing the titles ``Son of God'' and ``Son of the Most
High'' that appear in the Son of God text scroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is overwhelmingly probable that Luke borrowed these titles,
either from this text or from a common tradition to identify Jesus
as the messiah,'' Collins writes in his 1997 book, ``Apocalypticism
in the Dead Sea Scrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   John Walvoord, chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary, said
the implications of Collins' statement are profound because he
``implies that Luke's gospel is not divinely inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dead Sea Scrolls are right and the Bible is wrong? How do
they know this?'' Walvoord asked.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians and Jews, questions about the significance and
dating of the scrolls are as important as the Bible itself.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that the Son of God text and other Dead Sea Scrolls are
ancient, scroll scholars have convinced publishers of Christian
Bibles to make hundreds of changes to some recent editions of the
Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   But the Son of God text contains long-ignored Hebrew letters,
vowel marks and tiny letters that did not come into use until after
600 AD.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who have seen the vowels cannot explain their presence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some are now confirming that the styles of several
Hebrew letters in the Son of God text are more modern than
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the writing that came from the early Aramaic
alphabet compared to today, a few of those letters are closer to
the modern than they are to the ancient,'' said Rabbi Martin
Rubenstein, a leading Philadelphia rabbi. ``You don't have to be a
scholar to see the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as important as the physical evidence attesting to the
scroll's age are the ideas it contains and the way they are
expressed.
</P>
<P>
   For any Jewish scribe before Christ to have described a man --
even the coming messiah -- as immortal, divine and the son of God
would have been far beyond the bounds of Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that a Jew of that time didn't write this,''
said Rabbi Kenneth Weiss of El Paso, Texas. ``It's not a Jewish way
to refer to a messiah, and I don't believe a Jewish source would
ever use that phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Friedman, director of Feinstein Center for
American-Jewish History at Philadelphia's Temple University, was
shocked to hear that a document like the Son of God text was found
among the Dead Sea Scrolls at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable!'' he said. ``If this is real ... Jesus has
been authenticated. If it's a BC document, it announces in strict,
clear-cut terms the arrival of the messiah. But if it's after, it's
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Also disagreeing with the views of established scroll scholars
is Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the former president of that institution,
who said he does ``not think the Son of God text was written before
the time of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanoch Guy, professor of Hebrew and coordinator of Hebrew
Studies at Temple University in Philadelphia agrees that ``the
language is absolutely Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this is a Christian text,'' Guy said of
the Son of God text.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the scrolls are a national treasure to Israel and the
basis for changes being made in the Old Testament of some Christian
Bibles, publishers of Jewish Bibles are reluctant to make the same
changes, even though the scrolls are thought to be the oldest
existing copies of Jewish holy texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are really leaving the (Bible) as is,'' said
Helaine Denenberg, editorial assistant with the Jewish Publication
Society, North America's foremost publisher of Jewish Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews are even more adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrolls are not from mainstream Judaism, but from an
extremist sect,'' said Rabbi Yehoshua Kaganoff of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the existence of the Son of God text was known only
to a handful of scholars. But in the mid-1990s, the entire text was
published, revealing striking New Testament themes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to describing a divine messiah, the text also echoes
the New Testament description of Jesus' return and of the end
times:
</P>
<P>
   ``One nation shall trample on another nation ... (Then) his
kingdom (shall be) an everlasting kingdom ... He shall judge the
earth in righteousness, and everyone shall have peace ... and every
nation will submit to Him.'' (Parentheses represent reconstructed
passages.)
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to portray the Son of God text as a
pre-Christian document, some scroll scholars theorize that it
referred to a figure who lived a century or more before the birth
of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence -- so hard to explain, so easy to overlook --
repeatedly suggests that the writer of the scroll was aware of New
Testament theology, of Jesus and of the end of the world that he
described.

<P>
   ``He shall be hailed as son of God, and they shall call him the
son of the most high'' sounds like a passage from the New Testament
describing Jesus Christ. Yet it comes from a Dead Sea scroll that
scholars say was written a generation before Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   But overlooked for the 50 years since that little-known scroll
was discovered in Qumran's Cave 4 is evidence that the scholars are
wrong and that it -- along with other Dead Sea Scrolls -- could not
have been written until long after the rise of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Son of God'' text, the scroll reads, in part:
``He shall be hailed as son of God, and they shall call him the son
of the most high ... . His kingdom will be an eternal kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In Luke's New Testament account of the annunciation, the angel
Gabriel told Mary: ``He will be great, and will be called the son
of the Most High ... and of His kingdom there will be no end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Son of God text is part of a major Dead Sea Scroll exhibit
that opened in March and runs through June 11 at Chicago's Field
Museum, featuring portions of 15 scrolls along with 80 artifacts
from the Qumran area.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Sea Scrolls supposedly were written by a Jewish sect
over a period that began as early as 200 years before the birth of
Christ and ended early in the first century.
</P>
<P>
   About 68 AD, most scholars believe, the scrolls were stashed in
caves overlooking the Dead Sea where they remained undisturbed
until 1947 when an Arab shepherd boy stumbled upon them.
</P>
<P>
   But questions about their origins remain, and new ones are being
asked about discrepancies in photographs of some scrolls that are
significantly different from one publication to the next.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, several published photos of the Son of God text
contain differences in lettering, margins and other details that
some experts are at a loss to explain. These discrepancies in key
passages raise the possibility that the photos have been doctored.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Bock, professor of New Testament at Dallas Theological
Seminary, who considers the Son of God text to be ``one of the most
important texts for New Testament studies found (at Qumran),''
expressed alarm after studying the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what is being circulated evidences significant differences
between supposedly similar passages, then all photos, microfilms,
microfiches, and all published material (about this text) have to
be disregarded, and someone with excellent credentials must look at
this text and see what is really going on,'' Bock said. ``There is
(reason) here for questions to be raised and a need for answers to
be given.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bock was not the first to notice that words were
added by scroll scholars to the modern transcriptions and
translations that are not present or properly noted in the original
Son of God text.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am speaking very conservatively now, but, at best, it is
very sloppy scholarship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a Jewish paleographer called it ``immoral and
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Baumgarten, a member of the Dead Sea Scrolls team and
a professor at Baltimore Hebrew University, minimized the apparent
discrepancies, saying the scholars involved in transcribing and
translating the text made judgment calls based on their expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fraud,'' Baumgarten said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Dead Sea Scroll scholars have used the scrolls to
support an increasingly popular view that there was little
originality in the divine claims by the carpenter from Nazareth --
claims that led to his crucifixion and became the cornerstone of
Christianity itself.
</P>
<P>
   But University of Chicago scholar John Collins goes farther than
most in discussing the titles ``Son of God'' and ``Son of the Most
High'' that appear in the Son of God text scroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is overwhelmingly probable that Luke borrowed these titles,
either from this text or from a common tradition to identify Jesus
as the messiah,'' Collins writes in his 1997 book, ``Apocalypticism
in the Dead Sea Scrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   John Walvoord, chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary, said
the implications of Collins' statement are profound because he
``implies that Luke's gospel is not divinely inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dead Sea Scrolls are right and the Bible is wrong? How do
they know this?'' Walvoord asked.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians and Jews, questions about the significance and
dating of the scrolls are as important as the Bible itself.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that the Son of God text and other Dead Sea Scrolls are
ancient, scroll scholars have convinced publishers of Christian
Bibles to make hundreds of changes to some recent editions of the
Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   But the Son of God text contains long-ignored Hebrew letters,
vowel marks and tiny letters that did not come into use until after
600 AD.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who have seen the vowels cannot explain their presence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some are now confirming that the styles of several
Hebrew letters in the Son of God text are more modern than
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the writing that came from the early Aramaic
alphabet compared to today, a few of those letters are closer to
the modern than they are to the ancient,'' said Rabbi Martin
Rubenstein, a leading Philadelphia rabbi. ``You don't have to be a
scholar to see the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as important as the physical evidence attesting to the
scroll's age are the ideas it contains and the way they are
expressed.
</P>
<P>
   For any Jewish scribe before Christ to have described a man --
even the coming messiah -- as immortal, divine and the son of God
would have been far beyond the bounds of Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that a Jew of that time didn't write this,''
said Rabbi Kenneth Weiss of El Paso, Texas. ``It's not a Jewish way
to refer to a messiah, and I don't believe a Jewish source would
ever use that phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Friedman, director of Feinstein Center for
American-Jewish History at Philadelphia's Temple University, was
shocked to hear that a document like the Son of God text was found
among the Dead Sea Scrolls at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable!'' he said. ``If this is real ... Jesus has
been authenticated. If it's a BC document, it announces in strict,
clear-cut terms the arrival of the messiah. But if it's after, it's
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Also disagreeing with the views of established scroll scholars
is Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the former president of that institution,
who said he does ``not think the Son of God text was written before
the time of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanoch Guy, professor of Hebrew and coordinator of Hebrew
Studies at Temple University in Philadelphia agrees that ``the
language is absolutely Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this is a Christian text,'' Guy said of
the Son of God text.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the scrolls are a national treasure to Israel and the
basis for changes being made in the Old Testament of some Christian
Bibles, publishers of Jewish Bibles are reluctant to make the same
changes, even though the scrolls are thought to be the oldest
existing copies of Jewish holy texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are really leaving the (Bible) as is,'' said
Helaine Denenberg, editorial assistant with the Jewish Publication
Society, North America's foremost publisher of Jewish Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews are even more adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrolls are not from mainstream Judaism, but from an
extremist sect,'' said Rabbi Yehoshua Kaganoff of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the existence of the Son of God text was known only
to a handful of scholars. But in the mid-1990s, the entire text was
published, revealing striking New Testament themes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to describing a divine messiah, the text also echoes
the New Testament description of Jesus' return and of the end
times:
</P>
<P>
   ``One nation shall trample on another nation ... (Then) his
kingdom (shall be) an everlasting kingdom ... He shall judge the
earth in righteousness, and everyone shall have peace ... and every
nation will submit to Him.'' (Parentheses represent reconstructed
passages.)
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to portray the Son of God text as a
pre-Christian document, some scroll scholars theorize that it
referred to a figure who lived a century or more before the birth
of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence -- so hard to explain, so easy to overlook --
repeatedly suggests that the writer of the scroll was aware of New
Testament theology, of Jesus and of the end of the world that he
described.

 &HT;    Baylor optimistic Cubs can be better
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ If ever there were a no-win situation, this is it. The
team Don Baylor chose to manage, over the Brewers and Angels, has
losing down to an art form.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs haven't won a World Series since 1908 and haven't won a
postseason series in 10 October trips since. And they don't have
any reason to expect much different this season, especially with
the new talent pumped into National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be our final team,'' Baylor said. ``It's
going to get better with a healthy Kerry Wood and a healthy Ismael
Valdes.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has been mocked by Pete Rose for calling the Cubs rich in
tradition, beaten down by a 3-6 start and worn out by a whirlwind
offseason and a season-opening road trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa is hitting just .171. The Cubs pitching staff has a
6.09 ERA. The lineup is hitting only .229. They have lost three
games in the 11th inning and committed nine errors in the first
nine games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs got their first sign of hope Monday afternoon
against the Braves, the team Baylor spent his yearlong managing
hiatus with as the hitting coach. A four-run ninth-inning rally and
a 4-3 victory gave Baylor reason to believe.
</P>
<P>
   During batting practice Monday, one of the many faithful but
realistic Cub fans held up a poster modeled after the Wrigley Field
sign that read, ``Maybe this millennium?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 38,655 attendees on Monday stayed through 39-degree
cold and snow and were there at the end of the game to holler
through the breezeways of Wrigley Field as they left. Their shouts
echoed in the hallway leading up to the Braves clubhouse and made
it sound as if their team had just won a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a challenge to get people to think it can be
different here,'' Baylor said. ``I've noticed that when they lose,
they expect to lose, like, `What's going to happen wrong again.'
I'm trying to get us away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was talking about the players. And he knows how to change
attitudes. That's what he did with the Rockies in taking an
expansion team to the playoffs in its third season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's similar,'' Baylor said. ``Some of the frustrations are
the same. Pitching is the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are still old and their pitching is still weak. But
they got better defensively up the middle with the additions of
shortstop Ricky Gutierrez and second baseman Eric Young. And they
have hope ahead for the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Wood is shooting for May to make his return from ligament
transplant surgery, and Valdes, who is recovering from shoulder
tendinitis, also will return.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor already has started putting his mark on this team. He
issued a challenge to the home-run slugging Sosa to be a more
complete player and set stricter guidelines about dress code and
player conduct. So far, the Cubs are buying into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Baylor) is a good man,'' first baseman Mark Grace said. ``I
just wish we were playing better for him.''

&HT;     SENATOR SAYS MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN IS LIKELY THIS
YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare recipients have a ``very good'' chance of
seeing Congress add coverage of prescription drugs to their
benefits this year, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said at a news
conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was joined by Sens. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., in pressing for the passage of the measure before Congress
adjourns this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The substantive and political stars are lining up,'' Smith
said, referring to the pressure older voters are exerting on
politicians during this election year. ``The chances are very good
that we can make this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Senate and House passed budget plans
that would spend about $1.8 trillion for fiscal 2001. Lawmakers
from both houses are trying to work out a compromise budget, which
they hope to finish by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Each house would set aside $40 billion over five years for
prescription drugs to recipients of Medicare, the government's
health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. But further
action is needed to make sure the money for the drugs is actually
allocated.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate plan, if the allocation is not approved by the
Finance Committee by Sept. 1, lawmakers can take it directly to the
Senate floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the one provision that does assure action
this year on a specific benefit program for seniors,'' Snowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden, one of the Senate-House conferees, said they are expected
to decide by Thursday whether to accept the Senate timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Thursday we'll be able to tell who in the United States
Congress is serious about actually getting a prescription drug
benefit to older people in a timely way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and some members of Congress have opposed
granting a prescription drug benefit separately, without first
overhauling Medicare itself. Clinton's health policy adviser, Chris
Jennings, said the administration's ``strong preference is to
(include the drug benefit) in the context of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snowe-Widen-Smith plan gives Congress an incentive to make
reforms in the next several years while ensuring that senior
citizens receive drug benefits right away, according to Snowe.
Their plan calls for $20 billion in drug coverage for three years
and another $20 billion beyond that if restructuring of the
fiscally ailing Medicare program is enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we should penalize senior citizens in this
country for Congress' inability'' to agree on reform now, Snowe
said.

 &HT;    Fewer than expected to `ride for justice' to Coke meeting
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The bus ``ride for justice'' to Coca-Cola's annual
shareholders meeting in Delaware will involve fewer people than
originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have two buses instead of three because there's less
volume than we thought,'' said Larry Jones, a former human
resources manager at Coca-Cola and the trip's chief organizer.
Jones planned the trip to pressure the company into settling the
racial discrimination lawsuit quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the 1,300 mile, five-day round trip from Atlanta to
Wilmington, Del., was too long of a commitment for some former and
current employees.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 people have signed up so far, and Jones expects the
number to climb to about 100 before the buses leave on Saturday.
The two buses, each holding about 55 passengers, are scheduled to
stop for rallies in three cities before reaching the shareholders
meeting April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said $36,000 has been raised so far to pay for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the minimum amount of money needed to pay for the
hotel rooms and buses,'' he said.

   ASSET-FORFEITURE (Washington) _ Following years of complaints of
abusive government conduct, Congress completed legislation Tuesday
that would make it harder for law enforcement authorities to
confiscate property before they actually bring criminal charges in
narcotics and other cases. The White House is expected to announce
that Clinton would sign the legislation, a compromise measure
approved unanimously by a voice vote of the House of
Representatives. The new law, which was approved by the Senate
three weeks ago, will add significant new safeguards that will make
it more difficult for prosecutors to seize homes, cars and other
property before trials begin. But it also expands the government's
authority to confiscate property after convictions. By Stephen
Labaton.

   BUSH-POVERTY (Cleveland, Ohio) _ In the third speech designed to
support his claim to being a ``new kind of Republican,'' George W.
Bush outlined a plan Tuesday to give the working poor tax credits
for health insurance and rental vouchers for home down payments. He
also said he plans to offer tax credits for banks that match the
savings deposits of poor people. The $42 billion plan expands on
tax-cut and education proposals previously offered by the
all-but-official Republican presidential nominee and continues his
outreach to independents and moderate Democratic voters by talking
about subjects often ignored by Republican candidates. By Alison
Mitchell.

   U.N.-NAP-GUIDE (United Nations) _ Diplomacy is an exhausting
business, with all those late dinners followed by pre-breakfast
e-mail rockets from foreign ministries in distant time zones. So
where to catch a midday nap? At the United Nations Secretariat, a
building made mostly of glass, there would seem to be no place to
hide. Wrong! says Alain Dejammet, who has just returned to Paris
after four years as France's ambassador to the United Nations.
Wandering the corridors between Security Council sessions and
countless other meetings that force diplomats to leave their
comfortable missions for the austerity of United Nations
headquarters, Dejammet was _ unknown to anyone, including other
French diplomats _ conducting a secret survey. He has now
``published'' (in a computer print run of at least one copy) a
guide to napping, ``Dormir aux Nations Unies,'' in French, of
course, and with a Gallic love for detail that marks the Michelin
guides. By Barbara Crossette.

   MICROSOFT-LOBBY (Washington) _ Ralph Reed, a senior consultant
to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign, decided Tuesday
that it did not look good if his company also lobbied Bush on
behalf of the Microsoft Corp. Hours after it was disclosed that the
software giant had quietly hired Reed's firm, Century Strategies,
Reed's company put out a statement both expressing regrets and
attempting to clarify the arrangement with Microsoft, which is in
the midst of anti-trust litigation brought by the government. By
Joel Brinkley.

CMGI, NOVELL, SUN PLAN UNIT TO NETWORK DATA CENTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CMGI Inc. is joining with Novell Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc.
to enter the growing market for services that speed data delivery
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The new enterprise could make CMGI a significant competitor to
Akamai Technologies Inc., now the leader in Internet
content-delivery services. But officials of both CMGI and Akamai
also said the two companies could end up as business partners
rather than rivals.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, Novell, and Sun will invest $40 million to create a new
company called CMGion, which is to begin operations early next
year. CMGion plans to build a network of 60 Internet data centers
scattered around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to be able to reach a significant part of the
world's population with these data centers,'' said CMGI chairman
David Wetherell, who will be CMGion's interim chief executive. CMGI
will own 82 percent of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   These centers will use Novell's directory services software to
provide personalized data services to millions of users. Sun,
meanwhile, will provide massive Internet computers powered by its
Solaris operating system.
</P>
<P>
   CMGion's customers will be Internet service providers that serve
individual consumers, or major corporations that want to speed
delivery of Internet data to customers, business allies or
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Like Akamai, CMGion will use special software to automatically
store Internet information on computers that are close to the
people using the data. For example, if a user in China frequently
visits the Novell Web site, a copy of the site would be stored at a
data center in China. This would speed the delivery of the data,
becase the Chinese user wouldn't have to get the information
directly from a Novell Web site in the Unuted States.
</P>
<P>
   CMGion will go beyond Akamai's current offerings, by adding a
large dose of personalization. With Novell's directory software, it
will be possible for a CMGion user to log on anywhere in the world,
and instantly get complete access to his network services. ``It
allows you to have a very different and much more powerful Internet
experience,'' said Novell chief executive Eric Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   With one sign on, the system might log someone into his
corporate network and his favorite public Internet services,
deliver his e-mail, list his voice mail messages and tell him
whether a package has been delivered. Since the data is stored in
the network of CMGion data centers, it would be available anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   If the CMGion system catches on, it'll be a major success for
Novell, which hopes to make its software the worldwide standard for
network directory services. The company's chief rival in that
market is Microsoft Corp., whose Active Directory system is part of
its Windows 2000 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But success for CMGion could also mean trouble for Akamai, which
became an industry darling last year by signing up dozens of major
Web sites for its data delivery technology. ``I would say that it
is a direct challenge to Akamai,'' said Michael Sheridan, the
Novell vice president of strategic businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai chief executive George Conrades said he wasn't so sure.
``I think there's plenty of opportunities for partnership,'' said
Conrades, noting that CMGI's Wetherell had contacted him about the
possibility of the two firms working together. Wetherell confirmed
that discussions have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Conrades said that for now, CMGion is just an
idea, while Akamai is a going concern. ``I think there's a big
difference between an announcement and doing what we do,'' Conrades
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors may not be as sanguine. Akamai stock soared as
high as $345.50 since the firm went public last October. Tuesday,
Akamai stock plunged $25.56 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, to $107.75,
a loss of over 19 percent for the day. Conrades blamed market
volatility, rather than the CMGion announcement, for the stock's
poor showing.

CHECHEN WAR BLAMED FOR INCREASE IN DRAFT DODGING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The number of young men who have dodged the draft has
soared since fighting broke out in Chechnya, leaving the Russian
military without enough new conscripts, a senior general said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of draft dodgers increased by almost 50 percent
last fall,'' said Col. Gen. Vladislav Putilin, the chief of the
mobilization department of the Russian General Staff. ``For the
first time in four years, the armed forces will experience a
shortage of manpower.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has long had difficulty attracting
qualified personnel. Low pay, hazing and service in an institution
that is no longer revered by much of the society have prompted many
men to shun the military.
</P>
<P>
   But the war in Chechnya, which has led to the deaths of more
than 2,000 Russian soldiers and more than 6,000 wounded, seems to
have turned draft-avoidance into a semilegitimate national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is so severe that the Russian military has relaxed
its standards for military service in Chechnya. In September, the
government decreed that soldiers had to have served at least a year
before they could be dispatched to Chechnya. Now, the requirement
is six months.
</P>
<P>
   With so many Russians using student deferments, the educational
level of the Russian military has also fallen. About 30 percent of
Russian draftees have not finished the ninth grade. In contrast, 90
percent of recruits in the United States' all-volunteer military
have high-school diplomas. The result seems to be that the soldiers
sent to Chechnya may be greener, less literate and more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Boris Yeltsin had vowed to create an
all-volunteer military by this year. But the government has done
virtually nothing to advance that goal. The military needs to draft
192,000 men between 18 and 27 years old this spring to meet its
overall quota. So many Russians have claimed deferments that the
armed forces will have to process about 1 million young men to try
to meet this target.
</P>
<P>
   Educational deferments are a definite way to avoid army service.
So are health problems. And when all else fails, young men simply
refuse to show up when summoned for military service. Putilin said
49,000 men dodged the draft last fall, just under a fifth of the
number eventually conscripted.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is starkly evident in the Moscow region, where the
military expects to draft only 5,500 young men. ``I regret to say
that our big industrial centers and regions produce more than 60
percent of the draft dodgers,'' Putilin said. ``These are Moscow,
St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod and the Krasnoyarsk Territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, in fact, 88 percent of people eligible in the
St. Petersburg region were deferred.
</P>
<P>
   The use of deferments, loopholes and outright bribes to the
draft board has led to a manifest sense of unfairness. The poor,
less well-connected and least educated shoulder an increasingly
large share of the burden.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although a relative lull in the Chechen war has set in during
recent days, the ongoing conflict is still putting heavy pressure
on the military to conscript new soldiers. About 90,000 soldiers
and Interior Ministry troops are now in Chechnya, and Tuesday the
military said many of the troops were trying to fortify the borders
of the breakaway republic fearing a rebel resurgence as spring
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to encourage soldiers to join the cause, the
military counts every day spent fighting in Chechnya as two days of
military service. That means many soldiers are nearing the end of
their tours of duty, prompting the need for more and more
conscripts.

SOUTH KOREANS HOPE FOR REUNIONS WITH RELATIVES IN NORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ When Park Byoung-gul heard the news Monday
that the presidents of North and South Korea would soon meet for
the first time, he had little use for the speculation over the
politics behind the diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for the hale old retiree who fled North Korea as a
young man and has never returned, there was a single preoccupation:
learning the fate of the family he left behind, and, if a detente
between the divided countries allows it, to see them at least once
before he dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain the joy that I felt in hearing the news of the
summit,'' said Park. ``In the past, I never thought there was any
point to it, but I've come to register today because I am 73 years
old, and with this news I felt I must hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran of the Korean War, who left his native North and
ended up fighting for the South, spoke at the entrance to a
government office where Koreans seeking to investigate the fate of
their relatives in the North have been encouraged to register for
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the South Korean government, 1.2 million people who
were alive when the two countries went to war in 1950 still have
families in North Korea. And suddenly today, although interest in
the family reunion support program has existed all along, there was
real excitement for many over the possibility of a meeting for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents would probably be over 100 years old now, so I must
assume they are no longer living,'' said Park. ``But even if I
can't see them, it would mean the world to me to hear from my
sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans of Park's generation often tell visitors that
nothing in an outsider's experience could completely compare with
the trauma of separation that tens of thousands of people here have
felt. Unlike Germans, for example, whose country was also divided
by the Cold War, for almost all of the last half century South
Koreans have been unable to visit their relatives and were also
blocked by the North from exchanging letters or telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, as North Korea's economic situation has
grown more desperate, the barriers to communication have eased ever
so slightly _ in part, it seems, so the North Korean police,
soldiers and postal agents can skim off money sent to relatives by
South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A flourishing unofficial trade in family meetings has recently
sprung up in the region that borders China. South Koreans often pay
thousands of dollars to middlemen in China and North Korea to
arrange reunions. Some of these, South Koreans say, are brief and
tearful encounters on islands in the Yalu River, where aging
Southerners often learn of the death or disappearance of loved
ones. Other meetings are with North Koreans who have fled to China
but are stuck there in a legal limbo because Beijing generally
denies North Korean exiles political asylum status, treating them
as illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, President Kim Dae-jung sought to lower the expectations
surrounding the news of a summit meeting. He warned during a
Cabinet meeting that ``the national issues, which have been
divisive for a half century, cannot be resolved overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to priorities he laid out in a speech in Berlin last
month, Kim said that ``at the summit meeting, we will discuss the
four points, and I believe we can come to agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Berlin speech, Kim proposed government-to-government
assistance, the reunion of families separated during the Korean
War, dialogue between the North and South Korean governments and a
renunciation of the state of war that remains in force on the
Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of tension and unpredictable behavior in the North have
taught South Koreans to be anything but over-optimistic about a
change in relations. But still, in a country where ancestors, clan
and regional origins, and family matter far more than in most, the
fact that the South has listed family reunification as a top
priority for the June talks has given hope to many.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the first generation after the separation, and our
dream now is to meet our relatives again before we die,'' said Lee
Yeon-bin, 66, who also came to the government's Separated Families
Office to inquire about relatives. ``I didn't sleep last night for
excitement about this. I would have to put the chances of anything
coming out of this at only 30 percent, but when you have been
waiting for decades, that seems like a lot.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lee explained that her family had been considered wealthy
landowners in North Korea and declared ``enemies of the state.'' As
they fled to the South, she said, her one brother was arrested and
taken away.
</P>
<P>
   As people of North Korean descent gathered at the Separated
Families office Tuesday, they exchanged stories and expressions of
pain and doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left North Korea when I was 6 years old,'' said Woo Song-ja,
59, who carried her baby grand-daughter strapped on her back. ``All
of my ancestors must have died by now. Of course I want to find any
surviving relatives, but do you think we will be able to recognize
each other?''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, Kwan Young-jeo, 71, told of how her younger
sister managed to escape to China in 1997, crossing the frozen Yalu
River. At enormous expense, Kwan has visited her three times since
then, each time paying substantial sums to middlemen. Her obsession
now is to find her older sister who is still in North Korea,
although she confesses she does not know if she is alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that she has been through terrible hardship,'' she said
of the remaining sister. ``It is my duty to find out if she has
survived, and if so, to help her.'' &QL;

   UNITED NATIONS _ Diplomacy is an exhausting business, with all
those late dinners followed by pre-breakfast e-mail rockets from
foreign ministries in distant time zones. So where to catch a
midday nap? At the U.N. Secretariat, a building made mostly of
glass, there would seem to be no place to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong! says Alain Dejammet, who has just returned to Paris after
four years as France's ambassador to the United Nations. Wandering
the corridors between Security Council sessions and countless other
meetings that force diplomats to leave their comfortable missions
for the austerity of U. N. headquarters, Dejammet was _ unknown to
anyone, including most other French diplomats _ conducting a secret
survey.
</P>
<P>
   He has now ``published'' (in a computer print run of at least
one copy) a guide to napping, ``Dormir aux Nations Unies,'' in
French, of course, and with a Gallic love for detail that marks the
Michelin guides. Dejammet, a diplomat known by his peers for his
quiet wit and unadvertised artistic talents, enjoyed roaming the
streets of New York with his camera at night, photographing the
moody city while most people were asleep in their beds.
</P>
<P>
   He brought this discerning eye to more prosaic places, it now
appears. The corridor between the Security Council and the
Trusteeship Council, for instance. Who would have thought that the
patina of its aging armchairs, reflecting 50 years of snooze,
``only adds to its charm.'' Moreover, the carpeted corridor is ``in
constant shadow, whatever hour of the day.'' The only drawback is
the disruptive comings and goings of young first secretaries. And
chairs are hard to come by during meetings of the Commission on
Sustainable Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dormir'' ranks 12 mostly cozy and largely dark corners (one of
them across 46th Street at the European Union offices) using four
criteria: comfort, lighting, serenity and frequency of use. The
ratings, on a scale of 1 to 20 points, are then averaged for an
overall rank. There are five categories, complete with symbols:
</P>
<P>
   !!! A deconseiller (not advised).
</P>
<P>
   X Convenable (decent).
</P>
<P>
   XX Agreable (pleasant).
</P>
<P>
   XXX Tres agreable (very nice).
</P>
<P>
   XXXX Exceptionnel.
</P>
<P>
   Dejammet, who first shared his guide with the Paris newspaper Le
Monde, gives a perfect 20 (and four stars) to only one place, the
French delegation's private office in the Secretariat, screened at
all hours against outsiders and, in any case, almost impossible to
find at the end of a maze of corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volunteers, armed with all the necessary baggage (thermos
bottles, a bunch of keys) have left long ago to find the `petit
bureau' of the French delegation at the United Nations and never
came back,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other places come close. One (17 points, three stars)
is the U.N. periodicals library, which, he says, ``gives the
impression of an abandoned monastery.'' The other is a dismal
lobby-cafe near the upper gallery entrance to the General Assembly
(18 points, three stars) where ``the Secretariat has taken the wise
decision to abandon all lighting.'' The chairs aren't great here,
but sleepers can rest their heads on tables otherwise used for
discreet poker games.
</P>
<P>
   Dejammet dismisses the usual haunts for nappers, including the
Delegates' Lounge, which can be noisy and full of supplicants, and
the ground floor lobby, ``a vast linoleumed space between the
broken escalators, the elevators reserved for the 38th floor and
the way to paradise that leads to the periodicals reading room.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings were pretty much confirmed on a recent warm
afternoon after lunch, although a few habitues had not even made it
to the dark corridor beside the Security Council but were dozing in
plain view in the second-floor lobby overlooking the Japanese peace
bell. Although the infamous Delegates' Lounge was indeed noisy,
neither the cacophony nor the espresso were potent enough to save
one junior diplomat from nodding off on a sofa while some of his
colleagues worked the free computers and phones.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Future editions of the guide might want to enlarge on the
drawbacks to the ground floor lobby, where a frenzy of art shows
enlivened by receptions has pretty well rattled the calm. Sleeping
here is getting tricky, because when there are no exhibitions or
the shows are being put up or taken down, there are blood drives,
craft shows, international buffet fund-raisers or staff elections.
Some days, they move out all the soft chairs. (Tuesday afternoon,
however, three people were fast asleep by 1:45. A snob might say
they were international civil servants, not diplomats, since there
were no attache cases in sight.)
</P>
<P>
   Two spots are branded with three exclamation points, a warning
to steer clear. One is the Indonesian Lounge, with banquettes
``that were once white,'' where envoys plead their cases with other
diplomats before meetings of the budget committee, an atmosphere
Dejammet finds too much like multiple church confessionals. The
other no-go area is the Meditation Room, which he rates as a
Chagall-blue ``Draculesque crypt'' humming with the multilingual
mantras of tourists and the squeaking of their sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote to Dejammet's guide suggests that it is intended to
be interactive, soliciting feedback from others with tips to share.
If he prints out more than one copy, the guide could be a
sensational best seller here. But will it ever get to the U.N.
bookshop?

CLINTON TAKES GUN-CONTROL EFFORT TO THE STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Wadhamf is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unable to persuade Congress to pass gun-control
legislation, President Clinton is taking his campaign to the
states, urging them to impose safety latches, background checks,
and other restrictions on gun use.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis of state gun-related legislation shows that
Clinton's success has been spotty, at best. And the governor of
Colorado, where Clinton is traveling Wednesday, doesn't think the
president's appearance will help in passing a gun-control
referendum, said Dick Wadhamf, spokesman for Colorado Governor Bill
Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's visit politicizes the Columbine tragedy,''
said Wadhamf, referring to the school shooting last April 20.
``What President Clinton wants to do is to come to Colorado for a
political rally to draw attention to his effort to influence the
Republicans in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadhamf said Owens, a Republican, would have preferred that
Clinton come to his state next week, for one of the memorials
marking the first anniversary of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, once an adamant foe of gun control, backs passage of a
state referendum that would require background checks of people who
buy weapons at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   But ``President Clinton has some very high negatives'' in
Colorado voter polls, Wadhamf said. ``The fact is, his presence
might actually hurt the initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been invited to ``a slew'' of Columbine memorials
next week, but decided to attend Wednesday's rally ``so this type
of tragedy won't happen again,'' said White House spokesman Jake
Siewert. ``The president's not running for anything. But he can
focus on issues that affect the American family.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few states, Clinton and gun-control advocates have had some
success in passing restrictions, according to the Arlington,
Va.-based firm StateScape, which tracks state legislation. But foes
of gun control have been far more successful, keeping anti-gun
legislation stalled in committee and passing legislation that
protects the industry, said John Grant, a StateScape legislative
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun-control people are not getting what they want,'' Grant
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the gun-control side, California last year passed a series of
gun restrictions. Massachusetts recently instituted restrictions on
new handguns sold in the state, requiring them to have tamper-proof
serial numbers, trigger locks, and other safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   But the Massachusetts rules were not imposed by legislation.
Attorney General Thomas Reilly was able to regulate the guns
without legislative approval, instead using the state's consumer
protection law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Tuesday traveled to Annapolis, Md., to attend the
signing ceremony for the Responsible Gun Safety Act of 2000, which
imposes new safety requirements on firearms sold in Marlyland. It
was the first time the president has attended a signing for a state
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the United States Congress is paying attention to
this event today,'' Clinton said after Maryland Governor Parris
Glendening signed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But in many more states, it has been the National Rifle
Association that has been winning over legislatures. The group and
their supporters have been overwhelmingly successful in getting
laws passed that prohibit cities from suing gun manufacturers
without the consent of their state legislatures, which tend to be
more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the laws go further in the area of tort reform,
protecting gun makers from lawsuits that would hold them liable for
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is critical because it goes straight to the
heart of the gun maker's business: the ability to sell weapons. It
also puts a crimp in a strategy employed by gun-control advocates
to force firearms manufacturers to adopt safety restrictions
voluntarily, or else face a lengthy, expensive court battle.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing cities to sue manufacturers ``sets a very bad
precedent'' that could encourage other such lawsuits against a
range of industries, said NRA spokesman James D. Manown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've closed the City Hall door to gun-control advocates,''
said Joe Sudbay, political director of Handgun Control Inc., based
in Washington. ``Now they're trying to close the courthouse doors
to the cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 14 states passed such ``lawsuit pre-emption'' laws last
year; Utah adopted the law in March; Virginia and Kentucky adopted
the rule this month, and in two states _ Colorado and Idaho _ the
bill is awaiting the governor's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Wadhamf said Owens had not yet decided whether he would sign the
Colorado bill.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous other states, bills imposing background checks,
minimum age requirements, and even prohibiting the sale of
ammunition to intoxicated people are languishing in committee,
Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado initiative arose because the legislature refused to
pass some gun restrictions Owens pushed after the Columbine
massacre. That is typical in a state where there is not a large
urban population, Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   But gun-control advocates insist that where legislatures
disappoint them, the people will come through for gun restrictions.
``Just put it on a ballot,'' Sudbay said, ``and we'll win.''

 &HT;    CLINTON TAKING GUN MESSAGE TO DENVER
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton goes to Denver to press his
national campaign for federal gun controls Wednesday, one day after
the House approved an alternative plan to give $100 million to
states willing to impose mandatory jail terms on armed criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling approaches to the problem of gun violence in America
have set the stage for a heated election-year debate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's line, which he will defend in a two-hour televised
town meeting from Denver, is that federal gun controls should be
tightened.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to attend a rally, sponsored by a Denver
group called Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic (SAFE),
aimed at drumming up support for an upcoming statewide vote on
legislation that would require background checks for purchasers of
firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is bracing for the April 20 anniversary of the tragedy in
nearby Littleton, Colo., where two teenagers took their own lives
after shooting and killing 12 students and a teacher at Columbine
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called for federal laws mandating childproof safety
locks on new handguns, a ban on high-volume ammunition clips, and
background checks on anyone who buys a firearm at a flea market or
gun show.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate narrowly approved those measures last May as part of
a larger juvenile justice bill. The vote was 51-50, with Vice
President Al Gore casting the tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   A companion bill in the House was approved without those
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   A conference committee charged with working up compromise
legislation acceptable to both houses has yet to resolve the
differences.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton went to Annapolis, the capital of Maryland,
to praise that state for passing its own childproof lock law and to
nudge Congress to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in America deserves the protection you have given
Maryland's children,'' Clinton said in remarks to Gov. Parris
Glendening and state legislators. ``And only Congress can provide
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a jab at the Republican-controlled Congress and that party's
standard-bearer, presidential hopeful George W. Bush, Clinton said
the majority on Capitol Hill were thwarting the wishes of the
majority of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth,'' said Clinton, ``the people are ahead of most of
the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   From the floor of the House, the Republicans fired back,
sponsoring a bill to provide $20 million a year, for five years, in
block grant assistance to states that approve mandatory minimum
prison terms for anyone who commits a crime while armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is get-tough legislation,'' said Chris Paulitz, spokesman
for the Republican National Committee. ``This ensures that the
criminals who use guns in crimes actually go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by an overwhelming 358-60 majority vote, with
208 Republicans and 149 Democrats voting for it. Voting against the
bill were 56 Democrats, three Republicans and the body's sole
independent.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart denounced the bill as a
tactic employed by Republicans who want to appear tough on gun
violence but who do not support strengthened gun controls. He said
Democrats who voted for it did so only to avoid being painted as
soft on crime in November, when all House members are up for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats saw a political trap and decided not to fall for
it,'' said Lockhart. ``In reality, what it is is a cruel political
trick on the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart assailed the Republican leadership in Congress for not
taking up Clinton's request for $280 million in funding to hire
1,000 additional prosecutors and 500 additional agents for the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Those resources
are needed, said Lockhart, to increase the prosecution of
gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, said Lockhart, excludes the 44 states that
lack mandatory sentencing laws for criminals with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get enforcement money, people in the courts, people on
the streets right now with the Democratic approach.,'' said
Lockhart. ``There is absolutely no likelihood that tomorrow, 44
states are going to go into their legislature and pass a law to
come into compliance with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lockhart, ``How are kids in those 44 states supposed to
feel when they've seen the Republican alternative? I think they'll
think it's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulitz countered that it is the Democrats that are playing
politics with gun-related violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to say, but the Democratic Party goes into campaign
mode when there's a tragedy, instead of trying to find real
solutions,'' said Paulitz. ``They're using this for a political
tool.''

 &HT;    HEALTH LEADERS CALL FOR GLOBAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES PUSH
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the face of spreading epidemics of HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis and malaria in much of the developing world, health
experts Tuesday called on Congress to fund new ``windows of
opportunity'' against infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta international health expert William Foege, World Health
Organization director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland and others
called on the Senate Appropriations Committee to sharply increase
appropriations to support global health initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Foege, an adviser to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
which last year announced a $750 million grant to help protect poor
children around the world against disease, told the committee the
elimination of smallpox and the pending eradication of polio are
``a harbinger of what is to come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has never had so much power to improve the health of
children everywhere,'' said Foege, a professor of international
health at Emory University. ``The United States, because of its
science base, its experience in immunization programs and its
monetary and public health resources, will be key to realization of
that dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., announced at the committee hearing
that he would introduce a ``Global Health Act of 2000,'' which
would double the approximately $1 billion a year the United States
currently spends on health-related foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   And the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the group
that will receive the bulk of the Gates Foundation grant, issued a
report calling on world governments to spend an additional $350
million a year to extend infant vaccination programs among the
world's poorest babies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 million of the 130 million children born ever year do
not receive basic immunization, the alliance report stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This immunization gap represents a devastating toll on the
world's population,'' the report said. ``Every year, there are 3
million unnecessary premature deaths, because too many children
have not bee given the vaccine that could have saved their lives.''

A WOMAN OF INDEPENDENT MEANS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not how you scheme your way into millions.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fiorentino, who co-stars with the legendary Paul Newman in
the low-budget, independently produced caper comedy ``Where the
Money Is,'' is well aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The title of my autobiography should be `Not Where the Money
Is,' or 'Where the Money Isn't,''' the joke-loving actress says
with a deep, hearty laugh. ``But independents are where the good
roles are.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's reason enough for Fiorentino _ who has indeed been
part of one of the biggest commercial hits of all time, albeit one
that totally reflected her zonky/edgy sense of humor _ to eschew
the Hollywood star track for modest films that fulfill her
artistically.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that, perhaps even more than her widely seen work
in ``Men in Black,'' the actress is most identified with one of the
1990s' most celebrated indie productions, ``The Last Seduction,''
in which she updated the femme fatale movie archetype to a
character of unbelievably amoral, unfettered greed.
</P>
<P>
   And now, in ``Where the Money Is,'' she's typically making fun
of that mantis-from-hell image. Fiorentino plays Carol, a
nursing-home attendant in a small Oregon town, married to her high
school sweetheart Wayne (Dermot Mulroney) and a bit concerned that
her life is slipping away into abject nothingness.
</P>
<P>
   But then she gets a new patient from the nearby prison, the
infamously clever bank robber Henry Manning (Newman). Immobilized
by a severe stroke, he's supposed to be warehoused at the old
folks' facility until a bed is freed up at the penitentiary's
overcrowded clinic. But Carol half-suspects, half-wishes that the
catatonic criminal has something cooking in that supposedly
flatlined brain _ and that it could be her ticket out of
Nowheresville, if she could just get Henry to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ('Seduction's') Bridget Gregory had not been a monster and
had been more human, she might have been Carol Ann McKay,'' the
Philadelphia-born Fiorentino says in her distinctive,
hickory-and-caramel voice. ``I kind of see her as the B-side,
almost a prequel to Bridget. But she's more compassionate. She has
a heart; so she's more rounded, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiorentino stops short of declaring Carol more like the true
Linda. But that doesn't mean she couldn't relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that Carol suffers from an enormous amount of
boredom,'' adds Fiorentino, a never-married 40-year-old from a
domestically overachieving family of eight kids. ``That's the
reason why she does what she does in the film, for sure.

   ``I have no boredom in my life, I have to be honest. I come from
a big family, I live in New York, and there's never a moment when
I'm bored; there's always something interesting happening. But it
was a simple role to understand. I just think about what my life
would have been like had I not been lucky enough to become an
actor. It was very easy for me to identify because I know a lot of
girls like her.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Fiorentino's low tolerance for boredom that got her into
acting in the first place. On a pre-law track at a Catholic women's
college, she quickly learned that she couldn't stand lectures. And
although she had contempt for what she considered the
intellectually lightweight business of playacting, too, she did
find drama more interesting and excelled in a few school plays. One
of the college's advisers, impressed by her performance, suggested
that she think about the stage instead of law school.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted into New York's prestigious Circle-in-the-Square
Performing Workshop, Fiorentino _ yes _ got bored and quit after
six months. But by then she'd nailed her first movie job, in the
wrestling film ``Vision Quest.''
</P>
<P>
   The career progressed in fits and starts from there. There was
challenging work for admired filmmakers (Martin Scorsese's ``After
Hours,'' Alan Rudolph's ``The Moderns'') and a lot of pictures
that, as Fiorentino likes to joke, can always be found on
late-night cable and in convenience store video bins. The
iconic/commercial one-two punch of ``Seduction'' and ``Men in
Black'' has made her pretty recognizable in recent years, but it's
still tough to dodge big studio bombs like ``Jade,''
``Unforgettable'' and the recent ``What Planet Are You From?''
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat emblematic that Fiorentino's most notable hit
since ``MiB'' was last year's scruffy, controversial ``Dogma,'' in
which she played God's chosen abortion worker.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this shifting fortune, Fiorentino has developed
an ability to pretty much swing with anything. And that's had a
very positive impact on her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She almost has an animal instinct, creatively,'' notes ``Money
Is'' director Marek Kanievska, for whom she'll be playing famed
artist Georgia O'Keeffe in the upcoming ``Til the End of Time.''
``Linda tries something and it's usually spot-on. But if it isn't,
I can give her a very brief note and, using what she's already done
as a springboard, within two or three takes it's there. There's a
lot of excitement in working with an actor who's that immediate.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-possessed actress is also good at sizing up situations
quickly, knowing what to take seriously and what not to. This came
in handy opposite a screen legend like Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treated him with respect because he's my elder, and my
parents taught me well,'' Fiorentino says. ``But I didn't think of
him as Paul Newman or as a special person, and I think that's why
we became friends. I just treated him like an actor and a person,
someone that I had to work with. And I think that it shows; I mean,
if I thought that I was working with some god, I wouldn't have been
able to interact and feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that everything was perfect, even in the
most sensitive scene. There was some frustration, Fiorentino
laughingly admits, doing the mostly improvised lap dance, in which
Carol tries her darnedest to get some kind of reaction out of
unmoving Henry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never, ever flinched,'' she says with exaggerated
indignation. ``I was completely insulted! I thought that I'd lost
my touch, I gave him everything that I have. At the end of the day,
Paul apologized for not being more responsive. He said, 'I don't
want you to take it personally, I was just doing my job.'''
</P>
<P>
   We'll next be seeing Fiorentino in the Irish gangster drama
``Ordinary Decent Criminal'' opposite another imposing presence,
this year's best actor Oscar winner Kevin Spacey. But he's an old
friend from the New York theater scene, and she describes working
with the intense actor as ``a blast. All we did was laugh on the
set all day long. It was very difficult to get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the impression that enjoying herself and those around
her is probably the top item on Linda Fiorentino's work list. While
she's looking forward to reteaming with Will Smith for a
yet-unscheduled ``Men in Black'' sequel, the actress figures she
might as well make the best of not being where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell, when you look at a film like 'Where the Money
Is,' that we all liked each other,'' she says. ``It's a brutal
experience, independent filmmaking, because there's not a lot of
money in the budget. So you'd better like the people you're working
with, 'cause you're going to be with them for 18 hours a day.''

   ATLANTA _ Nathan Davis did nothing to leave his mark on the
field in his brief career with the Atlanta Falcons. But he will be
on the minds of team officials, nonetheless, when the NFL draft
begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With no first-round pick, Falcons coach Dan Reeves concedes that
his team probably will scrap the best-available-player approach and
instead draft to fill a need in the 37th spot.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is the Falcons' biggest draft flop since Reeves was hired
in 1997. The former Indiana University defensive tackle, a ``need
pick,'' dressed for two games that season and did not make a
tackle. He quit on the first day of training camp in 1998, tried to
rejoin the team, and was waived. In his senior season at Indiana,
Davis suffered a serious and documented tear of a tendon in his
pelvis. The injury kept him from working out when he joined the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It became an excuse for a player whose weight ballooned while
his work ethic and will to compete disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the Falcons' scouting department, which underwent
change in 1997, suggested that Davis was worth a fourth-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had seen some of the warning flags with Nathan Davis, we
never would have taken him,'' Reeves said. ``Our research wasn't as
good as it should have been. What you saw (on film) were flashes of
a guy who made some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' director of college player personnel, Reed Johnson,
has a slightly different memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Need is an ominous word,'' Johnson said. ``With Nathan Davis,
there was a need factor there. There were hints of what would
happen, although I don't think anyone could have anticipated
someone being so not willing to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like watching a baby throw a tantrum. I had to leave
the field twice; I couldn't watch.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 draft, the Falcons appear to need the most on the
offensive line and at running back, where four players are
rehabilitating knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the draft is perhaps deepest in offensive
linemen. Reeves on Tuesday described linemen as ``the most
important part of your offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson mentioned several top offensive linemen who could be
available _ Todd Wade (6 feet 7 3/4, 325 pounds) of Mississippi,
Marvel Smith (6-4 7/8, 320) of Arizona State, Michael Thompson (6-4
1/2, 305) of Tennessee State.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include Adrian Klemm (6-4, 308) of Hawaii
and Darnell Alford (6-4, 355) of Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves declined to confirm his team's greatest needs, but he
conceded that his team's strategy Saturday probably will be a
little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your needs always influence the best-player-available
(theory),'' Reeves said. ``At some point in the draft, and it
usually comes pretty early, you go past the best player available.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, with where we're going in the draft, that's
where you start looking for the best player available at a position
of need. Of course, you never want to pass up a player, regardless
of position, if you think he's sure to play and be a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some top running backs who figure to be available in the second
round, and even in the third, are J.R. Redmond (5-11 1/2, 210) of
Arizona, Travis Prentice (5-11 1/2, 220) of Miami-Ohio, Sammy
Morris (5-1 3/4, 222) of Texas Tech, Reuben Droughns (5-11 1/4,
210) of Oregon, Doug Chapman (5-10, 210) of Marshall and Curtis
Keaton (5-10, 214) of James Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a bunch of players at different positions bunched
in a group (on the draft board),'' Reeves said, ``you'd better not
pass on a player you're sure about, even if he's rated lower,
rather than take a (higher-rated) player you have questions about.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think you should ever pass on a really good
running back.''

NOMINEE WOULD BE FIRST FEMALE SUPREME COURT JUDGE IN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ New Hampshire's first female governor Tuesday
nominated a Superior Court judge who would be the first female
member of the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Jeanne Shaheen called her nominee, Linda Dalianis, ``a
judge of unassailable integrity and character.'' New Hampshire is
one of only a handful of states never to have appointed a woman to
its highest court: it is the last state in New England to do so.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, Dalianis is confirmed by New Hampshire's
five-member Executive Council, she will join a state Supreme Court
frozen in the headlights of oncoming investigations by the state's
Judicial Conduct Committee and its 400-member House.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancy she has been nominated to fill was created by the
March 31 resignation of W. Stephen Thayer. A report by the state's
attorney general said Thayer tried to influence his fellow justices
in cases including his own divorce, from which he had recused
himself. Thayer resigned rather than face possible criminal
indictment on those charges.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's investigation also faulted Chief Justice
David Brock and fellow justices for routinely commenting upon cases
from which they had disqualified themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution directing the House Judiciary Committee to
investigate whether Brock and perhaps other Supreme Court justices
should be impeached was drafted Tuesday afternoon. The resolution
is set to be debated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dalianis, 51, declined to discuss the past practices of the high
court. But she did say that if she disqualifies herself from a
case, she stays out completely. The Attorney General has said the
court allowed an environment in which some justices continued to
influence cases in which they had disqualified themselves because
of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this point my personal approach to recusal has been if
there is any legitimate reason for me to be out of the case then I
am out of it period and I would expect to continue that policy in
the future,'' Dalianis said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dalianis will be Shaheen's second high-court appointment this
year. Earlier, the governor chose fellow Democrat Joseph Nadeau, a
longtime family friend and chief justice of the Superior Court
system, to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice William Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Delianis was confirmed to her current position _ replacing
Nadeau as Superior Court chief justice _ less than one month ago.
``I think I will be an asterisk in the history books on that job,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Shaheen's political opponents applauded her choice
of Dalianis. ``Needless to say I have been critical of the governor
on many accounts, but I want to give credit where credit is due,''
said former US Senator Gordon Humphrey, who plans to formally
announce his candidacy for governor later this month. ``This is an
excellent nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Placing two new members on the court should help rebuild public
confidence in the battered institution, said New Hampshire Bar
Association President George Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think that is a substantial infusion of new
energy and new judicial philosophies into the mix of the Supreme
Court and that any taint if you will that is left over from the
procedures and issues raised by the attorney general's office will
certainly be lessened by the advent of these two judges,'' Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dalianis, a Nashua resident, described herself as a ``registered
independent.'' Her husband, Griffin Dalianis, is a psychotherapist
and Republican state representative.
</P>
<P>
   Her appointment would mean the high court would comprise two
Republicans, two Democrats and an independent.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Suffolk University Law School, Dalianis became the
state's first female superior court justice when she took her seat
in 1980. As for joining the Supreme Court, she said, ``This is
something I have hoped for for a long time.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Question: In a presidential campaign, what is the
difference between pandering to some special interest, considered
bad, and merely making a smart political move, considered good?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It's pandering when the targeted pitch doesn't work and
smart politics when it does.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush took
controversial policy positions recently, clearly aimed at buttering
up a specific, potentially powerful audience.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's astonishing stand was out of step with his party and
rang so hollow that he promptly dropped a few points in the polls.
Voters have yet to register any reaction to Bush's latest ploy, but
he may well get away with it because it is consistent with his
overall pro-business philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been trying to explain the inexplicable ever since he
broke with President Clinton over the fate of Elian Gonzalez. The
president, Attorney General Janet Reno and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service insist that the little boy belongs with his
father, who lives in Cuba and shows every sign of intending to
return there. But Gore called on Congress to pass a special bill to
give father and son permanent resident status here while a family
court decides Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
   That aligned Gore with the conservative anti-communist crowd,
usually Republican, in opposition to the view of most Democratic
leaders and a majority of Americans that Elian should be sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's position was aimed at the group that feels most deeply
about Elian, the Cuban-Americans in Miami who have sheltered him
since he survived a shipwreck in which his mother drowned. We're
talking votes here, a concentrated batch of votes in Florida where
Gore is playing catch-up to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But this is dubious politics. Cuban Americans make up only 7
percent of the Florida electorate, and most other voters in the
state support sending Elian home. And Gore is now stuck with a
strong, unmistakable panderer's odor. It will take great gobs of
perfumed rhetoric to blow it away in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, was also busily catering to one particular
constituency this week. His target was the technology world
centered in California, a state in which he currently trails Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He spread the word that he did not approve of the Justice
Department's antitrust suit against Microsoft, the computer
software giant accused of malicious business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand on the side of innovation, not litigation,'' Bush said
pointedly. And in case Microsoft's Bill Gates and his buddies
missed the message, Bush advisers slyly suggested that a Bush
administration would drop the suit that threatens to break up the
company's monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters have also made private overtures to Gates and
other Microsoft officials to encourage the firm to beef up its
political contributions to the GOP. They have been steadily
increasing since the Justice Department filed suit. A Microsoft
executive sits on the Bush finance steering committee. Since 1997,
top company employees have coughed up $1.8 million in political
contributions, the majority of which has gone to the Republicans in
the form of unregulated ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been careful not to comment on the merits of the
Justice Department suit, but he doesn't have to be specific. He has
done everything but paint a picture for Microsoft. And while his
position is certainly self-serving, it looks more like politics as
usual than a demagogic appeal to raw emotions.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush has consistently sided with business interests
over those of consumers and environmentalists. His philosophy is
similar to that of Calvin Coolidge, who once declared, ``The
business of America is business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has little sympathy for federal regulators who try to
protect the public against predatory industry practices. Or for
trial lawyers who persuade juries to levy substantial judgments
against industries and institutions that knowingly or maliciously
harm clients, patients or consumers.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush is being consistent in preferring to leave a monopoly
intact rather than forcing it to compete fairly in the marketplace.
His position is wrong and harmful to the public interest, but he
has a philosophical basis for holding it.
</P>
<P>
   The full politics of this complicated case is unlikely to play
out until well after the election. A Newsweek poll this week showed
that a third of those surveyed supported the antitrust decision
against Microsoft and a third disagreed with it. Not everyone
understood what it was really all about.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short run Bush reinforced his pro-business
credentials and probably raised more money for his campaign. And he
stopped short of promising Gates a Cabinet post. Now THAT would be
pandering.

   Going Out Blazing
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating that it is not just a critical favorite but an
out-and-out hit television show, ``The Sopranos'' reached a new
ratings high for its season finale Sunday night, pulling in more
viewers than any other original entertainment program in the
history of HBO.
</P>
<P>
   With a rating of 17.6 in homes that receive HBO, ``The
Sopranos'' surpassed its previous high, a 16.2 for this season's
first episode. HBO's executives said that translated to about 9
million viewers, which beat the network's previous high of 6.9
million for the movie ``If These Walls Could Talk.'' Only the
biggest boxing matches have ever pulled in more viewers for HBO.
</P>
<P>
   To put this achievement in context, ``The Sopranos'' had more
viewers Sunday night than last week's episodes of ``Ally McBeal''
on Fox, ``Sabrina'' on ABC, the Sunday Night Movie ``My Fellow
Americans'' on NBC, ``Smackdown'' on UPN and ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' on WB. More to the point, it beat three episodes of
``Falcone,'' the CBS mob drama.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Sopranos'' was only available in a quarter of the 100
million homes that the major networks reach.
</P>
<P>
   The huge rating for the finale underscores the hunger among HBO
viewers for ``The Sopranos,'' a hunger that now will go unfulfilled
for almost a year. HBO executives reaffirmed Tuesday that the show
would not start up again in January as it has in its first two
seasons, but would be delayed until March.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison to ``Falcone'' is surely not what CBS is looking
for, but given the similar plot lines, it is inevitable. Despite
being what he called ``pretty disappointed'' in the showing of
``Falcone'' last week, Les Moonves, the CBS president, said he
still held out hopes for the series because it had fared better on
Friday and Saturday nights, and ``if we picked it up for next
season it would probably go onto one of those nights.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ratings results from Monday for ``Falcone'' were not
encouraging; it was beaten by both ``Once and Again'' on ABC and
``Third Watch'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moonves was happy with one bit of ratings news from
Sunday night. The experiment in live drama, ``Fail Safe'' was, as
Moonves branded it, ``a solid success.'' The show finished 13th
overall in the weekly ratings, 19th among young adult viewers, a
very good showing for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said, ``We're surely going to be doing more live
drama.'' He has a new version of ``On Golden Pond'' set for next
fall and said he would ideally like to have a live drama each fall
and spring.

   New Plots for Champs
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling has undergone its
second makeover in seven months. It was shown in its new
incarnation on TNT on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The uninitiated who may have clicked upon TNT's ``Monday Nitro''
on their way to some other program wouldn't have noticed anything
so different. After all, sweaty, heavy men growling, snarling and
bleeding all over each other is to be expected from a wrestling
program.
</P>
<P>
   But those who regularly watch the show saw an epic, scripted
battle between the old guard wrestlers who have presided over the
show's ratings decline and a new team charged with reviving it. All
plotlines that had been running through the prior months were
dropped entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The new story line may have delighted longtime fans _ especially
when head writer Vince Russo took a white Humvee to Hulk Hogan's
limousine _ but it represents a real problem for Turner.
</P>
<P>
   As Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation continues to
capture the attention of young male viewers everywhere _ witness
the success this year of the UPN network, which is owed in large
part to its Thursday night WWF show _ Turner is watching his own
wrestling fortunes fade. Once it was the leading wrestling league.
Now the WCW does much worse than the WWF During the week ending
April 2, the WWF's 10 p.m. Monday wrestling program on the USA
network was the highest-rated show in all of cable, watched by 7.7
million people, according to Nielsen Media Research data. The WCW's
``Monday Nitro'' on the other hand, ranked No. 7, viewed by 3.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   The show's decline in ratings represents the loss of millions of
dollars, Turner Broadcasting executives concede. The league had
hired two top WWF writers in September, Vince Russo and his
partner, Ed Ferrara, to turn things around. At the same time, a WCW
executive vice president, Eric Bischoff, who led it to No. 1 in the
ratings before seeing it lose steam, was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The new writers brought heavier scripting to the WCW program,
along with more vulgarity and sexual innuendo. But the ratings
continued to plunge. Russo was forced out, and Ferraro was demoted.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest effort to revive the show, Russo has been brought
back, along with Bischoff. Proving just how much the league's
future means to Turner, Turner Entertainment President Brad Siegel
is spending a couple of days per week in the WCW offices in Smyrna,
Ga. Siegel said that just as the WWF revived itself after running
second to the WCW through most of the 1990s, his league will stage
a comeback, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're down in the ratings and we need to refocus our
business and refocus our storylines,'' he said. ``Somebody's got to
do the work right now, and I'd just assume it be me.''
</P>
<P>
   By midday Tuesday, it appeared the new approach had met with
some success. Preliminary figures showed the show's ratings were up
about 20 percent from its season average, though they remained far
below those of the W.W.F. program.

   The Gun Debate
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw and NBC will take on the roiling question of gun
control in a series of programs on MSNBC and NBC on Wednesday and
Wednesday night. At 3 p.m. on MSNBC, Brokaw will moderate a town
hall meeting in Denver, beginning with an interview with President
Clinton, who will be attending the meeting. Portions of the
interview will be played on Brokaw's ``Nightly News'' Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   That town hall meeting will also be replayed on MSNBC at 10 p.m.
followed at 11 by a second town hall meeting, also moderated by
Brokaw. That one will include the Colorado governor, Bill Owens,
and numerous advocates and opponents of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The connecting point is the shooting tragedy at Columbine high
school, which is nearing its first anniversary. ``Colorado has
become ground zero in the gun debate,'' Brokaw said in a telephone
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that his own background, growing up in the West where
boys learned to use guns with their fathers in a ``male ethos''
that continues today, has helped shape his own view that the gun
control debate has become too polarized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the middle on this issue has been heard,'' he
said. Brokaw, who still spends vacations at his ranch in Montana,
said, ``I live among gun owners,'' adding that many of them have
``totally the right attitude'' about how they should be used and
regulated.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had sold off his own collection of hunting rifles in
1968. ``I was raising daughters,'' he said, ``and I was
particularly troubled by what happened to Robert Kennedy and Martin
Luther King.''

</P>
<P>
   VIRGIN-SUICIDES-FILM (Undated) _ In ``The Virgin Suicides,'' the
dreamy first feature film written and directed by Sofia Coppola,
five sisters, ages 13 to 17, who live in a leafy Michigan suburb in
the 1970s inexplicably and matter-of-factly kill themselves. Their
story, an unsolved mystery laced with lust, obsession, longing,
fantasies and gilded memories, is recounted 25 years after by a
neighborhood boy, now a rueful adult, who worshiped Therese, Mary,
Bonnie, Lux and Cecilia Lisbon from afar. Adapted from Jeffrey
Eugenides's lyrical 1993 novel, the movie might have been a
prurient wander through the bedrooms of its lovely nymphs, an
exploitative riff on teenage angst, or a cautionary drama _ think
``Five American Beauties, Interrupted'' _ with an earnest social
message. But what Coppola has made of it is a haunting metaphysical
celebration with the aura of a myth. By Graham Fuller.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SISKEL-EBERT-FILMS (Undated) _ Watching ``Siskel and Ebert at
the Movies'' was a bit like being fed intravenously: you never
tasted anything, but eventually you felt a kind of ghostly
satiation. The show's appeal derived less from its film snippets
and critical insights than from the banter between the cheery,
chubby Roger Ebert and the diffident Gene Siskel, a dour presence
with the silhouette of a roll-on deodorant. As a team, these two
Chicago newspapermen lacked the easy rapport of, say, Hope and
Crosby, or the bittersweet camaraderie of Laurel and Hardy. What
they shared was a chafing testiness _ a novelty among TV co-hosts.
Siskel died at the age of 53 in February 1999. Since then, his
chair has been warmed by the rumps of reviewers drawn from a
defective Gene pool. Sessions have tended to play out like first
dates: guest critics seem more intent on pleasing Ebert than on
engaging him. By Franz Lidz. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK-FILMS (Undated) _ Stanley Kubrick's death last spring,
followed by the release of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' revived a
long-running argument among critics and fans about whether Kubrick
was one of the most important contemporary filmmakers or merely
among the most self-important _ an avatar of cinematic perfection
or a cold, detached perfectionist. The debate shows no signs of
ending any time soon. Last month, Vanity Fair published a long,
passionate defense of Kubrick, and in particular of his widely
unloved last work, by his friend and sometime collaborator Michael
Herr. And beginning Friday, Film Forum will provide fuel for many
nights of heated cafe-table contention as it mounts a three-week
retrospective of the director's work. By A.O. Scott. &QL;

<P>
   SILVERS-DANCE (New York) _ Sally Silvers calls herself a dancer
and a choreographer, but by many conventional measures she
resembles neither. She has never succeeded at an audition, or
joined a professional dance company, or started a troupe of her
own. Even so, Silvers exerts a palpable force within the downtown
dance scene, both as a performer of striking intensity and as a
creator of wildly original movement. Her newest piece, ``Storming
Heaven,'' will have its premiere on April 26 at the Kitchen.
Inspired partly by Luigi Nono, who was Italy's leading postwar
avant-garde composer, it chronicles a series of revolutions from
the Paris Commune of 1871 to the Zapatista rebellion that began six
years ago in Chiapas, Mexico. By Christopher Reardon. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   REAL-THING-THEATER (London) _ ``The Real Thing,'' which won
Jeremy Irons a Tony Award for best actor in 1984, is back on
Broadway this season, opening Monday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater
in Manhattan. The acclaimed revival originated last summer at the
Donmar Warehouse here and later transferred to a commercial run in
the West End. By Matt Wolf. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JACOBI-THEATER (Undated) _ The truth about Derek Jacobi, one of
the most emotionally potent British classical actors of his
generation, is that he has never known how to take a bow. He
loathes being singled out for approval. To him it is a degrading
spectacle, a charade. In fact, his aversion proved so vexing to his
mentor, Laurence Olivier, that one day, after a performance of the
Peter Shaffer play ``Black Comedy,'' Olivier took his protege aside
and offered a fatherly reprimand. ``He said,'' Jacobi recalled,
```If you have pretensions of being a leading actor you must learn
how to take a curtain call.''' Audiences at ``Uncle Vanya,'' the
new Roundabout Theater Company production in which Jacobi makes his
first Broadway appearance in more than a decade, will easily spot
him during the curtain call: he's the one looking as if he'd rather
be doing his taxes. By Peter Marks. WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-SOUNDS (Windhoek, Namibia) _ Every composer, conductor,
musicologist and critic ought to be forced to spend time in places
like West Africa. The shrinkage of stature would both alarm and
instruct them. By day there is the overwhelming silence of the
bush. At night one hears the community and the competition. Lions
moan in tall grass; hippopotamuses grunt in bursts of three as they
come from the water to feed on the rushes around you; baboons
engage in high-decibel argument. Each is saying to the bush, ``I am
here, and this is who I am.'' Anyone pondering the meaning of art
might give a listen to the birds and animals of the Okovanggo
Basin. The sounds they make are both warning and welcome, but
mostly they are acts of self-expression and thus self-preservation.

   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-FIDELITY-FILM (Undated) _ These days, everyone assumes that
the serious music fan is an arrested adolescent. Nick Hornby's 1995
novel, ``High Fidelity,'' captured the paralyzed mental state of
smart males whose emotional lives revolve around cultural product,
not people. Now his characters have been made into Hollywood
archetypes by the director Stephen Frears and the actor John
Cusack. By Ann Powers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALTERNATIVE-COUNTRY (Undated) _ As Nashville, the music machine,
has become bigger and blander, Nashville the city _ along with its
kindred planet in Austin, Texas _ has become the center of an
increasingly diverse and intriguing array of American music rooted
in country with strains of folk, rock, bluegrass, rockabilly and
blues. At various times called Americana, alternative country, No
Depression or insurgent country, it's really too loose and untidy a
mongrel, or pack of vaguely allied mongrels, to fit into any real
niche _ certainly not the niche played on country radio. It's so
amorphous that No Depression magazine, the most clued-in
publication following the music, describes itself as ``the
alternative country (whatever that is) bimonthly.'' By Peter
Applebome. WITH PHOTO. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROCK-FILMS (New York) _ A few weeks ago at the Pioneer Theater
in Manhattan, the director Amos Poe introduced ``The Blank
Generation,'' his rough-hewn documentary of early punk rock shows,
shot on 16-mm film in 1976 and rarely seen since. But the program
of rare punk and new wave films being shown at the theater,
including several weeks of the intimate, sometimes amazing series
called ``Nightclubbing,'' shot at CBGB (the Dealey Plaza of punk
rock) and other New York clubs from 1975 to 1980, substantiate
Poe's showy claim for the era. (The series will end on May 24.) By

DOCTORS OVERDIAGNOSING TO HELP PATIENTS GET INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEAH R. GARNETT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a stunning communal confession, nearly 40 percent of
physicians queried in a random survey admitted that, in the last
year, they deceived insurance companies to help patients get needed
care.
</P>
<P>
   The deceptions included exaggerating the severity of patients'
conditions; changing billing diagnoses; and reporting signs or
symptoms that patients did not actually have.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics came to light after researchers mailed surveys to
1,124 practicing US physicians in 1998; of those, 720 replied and
39 percent said they ``sometimes'' employed one or more of these
deceptive practices to secure insurance coverage for their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a physician, I can tell you that this is a widespread
practice, but it is not part of any systematic effort to defraud
insurance companies,'' said one of the study's co-authors, Dr. Ira
B. Wilson, a New England Medical Center internist and assistant
professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study appears in the current Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling aspect of the results is that they document,
possibly for the first time, what doctors are doing in their day to
day practices, said Wilson. Within the profession, fudging
insurance company forms to ensure that patients are reimbursed is
anything but a secret. It is simply the ``daily struggle'' doctors
face, said Wilson, in an age when cost-cutting is king. Indeed, the
authors predict that: ``As pressures to control health care costs
increase, it is likely that manipulating reimbursement systems will
increase in parallel.''
</P>
<P>
   In statistical models comparing the physicians who used
manipulative practices to those who ``rarely'' or ``never'' did,
the researchers found that the manipulaters: believe that ``gaming
the system'' is necessary to provide high-quality care in today's
marketplace; receive more requests from patients to deceive
insurers; feel pressed for time during patient visits; and have
more than 25 percent of patients covered by Medicaid. The authors
say the latter could be due to physicians' desire to benefit
patients, themselves or both, as Medicaid reimbursement rates are
often lower than those of commercial payers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the authors point out that their findings suggest that
financial self-interest was not a major motivating factor for
doctors who fudged reimbursement forms. In the most common
situations, such as getting patients into the hospital, doctors
were not in a position to profit from their actions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the authors write, physicians who experienced recent
financial losses in their practices did not report altering
insurance forms at any greater rate than others.
</P>
<P>
   HMO officials said the study showed people are getting benefits
for which they have not paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who pay for that are everybody else who's paying
for the premiums,'' Dr. Charles M. Cutler, chief medical officer
for the American Association of Health Plans told the Associated
Press. Cutler said the practice, if continued, would cause health
care costs to rise even faster.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson, the Tufts, co-author, said he does not believe the
study is about ``good guys and bad guys.'' ``This is not a story
about physicians and big bad insurance companies. It's a story
about how all of the actors _ the patients, physicians and payers
need to move closer together and have an open and agreed upon
social dialogue'' about what criteria should be used to ensure fair
access to care, be it tests, medications, or hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   How might this be accomplished? Insurance companies, for
example, might stop their unstated, but widely believed practice of
rationing care by routinely denying coverage for certain procedures
but then paying for them after doctors file appeals ``knowing that
time and other constraints will prevent some appeals,'' wrote the
authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, doctors are not reimbursed for their
time,'' said Dr. Matthew K. Wynia, the study's lead author and
assistant vice president of the Institute for Ethics, an
independent research arm of the American Medical Association, which
funded the study. ``Many physicians tell me, `there's no way I
could appeal everything I think ought to be appealed; I'd spend all
day on the phone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Patients could contribute to solving the problem by putting less
pressure on doctors to perform tests or prescribe drugs that
doctors feel are unnecessary, said Wynia. Yet blaming patients is
the last thing Wynia and Wilson said they want to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, utilization review systems by insurers should be ``more
user friendly, quicker, more patient friendly and less punitive to
physicians,'' said Wynia. Physicians are often marked as
``troublemakers'' by insurers, and can be fired, if they
continually appeal the companies' decisions.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed about how their study might be used to change the
system so doctors don't have to be reduced to cheating, both
authors indicated that there must be some kind of formal process or
forum in which doctors and patients are more fully involved in the
an insurer's decision-making process. ``If patients and physicans
were involved in those decisions at the outset, there might be a
better buy-in,'' said Wynia.
</P>
<P>
   And patients and doctors would be more likely to ``buy in'' if
they were privy to the process that went into deciding why a
particular insurance company, for example, will pay for eight
tablets of Viagra a month, said Wynia. ``What's the process and the
rationale? If patients and doctors can turn to a rationale and
accept it, that's fine. If they say we need to appeal this; there
should be a legitimate process of appeal.''

   UNTRENDY-ART (New York) _ ``Greater New York,'' at P.S. 1
Contemporary Art Center, the newly annexed Queens outpost of the
Museum of Modern Art, is a spirited affair that rounds up enough
youngish artists (146 in all) to start a day camp. The 2000
Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art, despite its
broader, cross-the-country sweep, is similarly well-stocked with
unfamiliar names; its (97) artists do not include Jasper Johns,
Brice Marden or any other sacred cows. The latest art-world trend

<P>
   EXIT-ART-CENTER (New York) _ Some art centers are born with
well-defined missions in mind and sizable budgets to help make
their most ambitious programming dreams come true. Others are
fueled more by can-do spirit and make-do inventiveness. In New
York, some seemingly well-financed places flounder or disappear
even after presenting good, memorable shows. And then there are the
offbeat, sometimes more impulsive art outposts that pop up and,
despite the odds, hang on for years and unexpectedly become
important, even treasured institutions. Exit Art/The First World is
one such irascible survivor. Now, with a retrospective exhibition
titled ``The End: An Independent Vision of Contemporary Culture,
1982-2000,'' the nonprofit arts center, which has become an

   GREEN-ARCHITECTURE-SHOW (New York) _ ``Ten Shades of Green,''

lining up for this Green parade. Especially if non-attendance were

&HT;     SAN FRANCISO AND LOS ANGELES FEUD OVER AIDS MONEY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Nancy Pelosi vowed Tuesday to preserve San
Francisco's $35 million federal AIDS funding despite efforts in
Congress to redistribute some of the money to other areas where the
epidemic is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said San Francisco stands to lose about $8 million in
funding from the Ryan White Care program that provides care and
medication for people with HIV and AIDS unless Congress continues
to provide the city with a special exception to the funding
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply can't afford to have an increase in the unmet
needs'' of people with HIV and AIDS, Pelosi said, adding: ``The Bay
Area would be hit very hard by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco, said the move to
eliminate special treatment for San Francisco ``is something we
have to fight'' to ensure that ``the city does not have a
disruption in service.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles advocates for people with HIV and AIDS have combed
Capitol Hill recently urging lawmakers to kill an exception that
maintains federal AIDS funding level for San Francisco. They argue
that the exception provides San Francisco with a disproportionate
share of available funds at the expense of other cities and they
want the money dispersed to places such as Los Angeles with newer
waves of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying is heating up as Congress prepares to extend the
Ryan White Care Act for five more years. This program, begun in
1991, empowers the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to
pay for care and medication for people who aren't poor or sick
enough to receive Medicaid, but who don't have private insurance.
The Ryan White program is named after the hemophiliac teenager from
Kokomo, Ind., who contracted the disease through tainted blood and
died in 1990 at age 19. The program serves about a half million
people each year and, since 1991, has distributed $6.4 billion to
states and local governments for local use.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Senate Health, Labor and Human Services
Committee is expected to complete its draft of the new Ryan White
Care Act.
</P>
<P>
   Charles L. Henry, director of the office of AIDS Programs and
Policy for the Los Angeles County Department of Health, said the
exception for San Francisco is unfair because it ``keeps resources
in jurisdictions that have been historically impacted at the
expense of jurisdictions that are increasingly impacted.''
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates by the federal Centers for Disease
Control, Los Angeles now has 14,078 people living with AIDS,
compared to 7,703 people in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   However, Los Angeles is receiving $34.7 million in Ryan White
funds this fiscal year while San Francisco is getting $35.3
million, according to the federal Health Resources and Services
Administration that runs the program. Henry said that amounts to
$4,000 for each person with AIDS in San Francisco and $2,200 in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big difference,'' Henry said. ``It isn't fair.''
</P>
<P>
   That disparity exists because Congress decided in 1996 _ when it
updated the Ryan White program _ to maintain funding levels for San
Francisco even though the updated law changed the funding formula
that would otherwise have cut San Francisco's share.
</P>
<P>
   The new Ryan White formula was no longer based on a city's
cumulative number of AIDS cases over the years or on the ratio of
AIDS patients per capita.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Congress declared that funds should be distributed on
the basis of the total number of people living with AIDS in the
city. Under that formula, cities like San Francisco where the
disease had spread earlier in the epidemic would have received less
money. Congress approved the San Francisco exception to freeze its
funding so that the city's AIDS programs wouldn't be decimated by
the new formula. It's this San Francisco exception that is under
attack now.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi wants to add language that would freeze San Francisco's
share of the money at within 2 percent of the current $35.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that this is something that we have to fight
and can't settle for anything less than the 2 percent,'' Pelosi
said. ``We never fought in our fight for AIDS treatment, prevention
and research in any parochial way. It's hard to understand why
those of us who have been fighting the hardest should have our city
take a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi added that it's ``hard to understand why Los Angeles is
lobbying so hard against San Francisco, when it is the state that
would be the big loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said if the San Francisco exception were dropped, Los
Angeles would gain $500,000 in federal AIDS money, but the state of
California would suffer a net loss of about $7 million. Pelosi is
working with Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., to resolve the
impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfathomable and unthinkable that we would even have to
settle for this,'' Pelosi said. ``This is unfortunate that this is
happening within our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., an obstetrician, is pushing
legislation that would cut San Francisco's funding level by 10
percent a year over each of the next five years, allowing it to be
almost cut in half by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said the funding battle ``is about fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should one city be given a special advantage in terms of
federal AIDS funding over every other city in America? Is the
single mother living with HIV in inner city Baltimore not entitled
to the same care as a person living with AIDS in San
Francisco?``Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who recently urged a
crowd of Los Angeles AIDS activists outside her office to stop
fighting for a cut in San Francisco's funding, said having the two
cities pitted against each other ``does not make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to get together and try to work it out,''
Feinstein said. ``I've asked them to sit down and work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., noted that funding formulas
``always cause fights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that San Francisco can keep doing what
they are doing'' for people with AIDS and HIV, Boxer said. ``But we
also need to make sure Los Angeles has what it needs. My own view
is we need more money.''

RHUBARB: SPRING'S HOT NEW DISH

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few days ago I had a Bellini made with rhubarb.
Then I came across dark chocolates from Richart with a rhubarb and
ginger filling. And lately, I've noticed that rhubarb is being
served with foie gras everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Since I love rhubarb, it's a pleasure to find it suddenly
showing up in such elegant company. It's also a surprising
turnaround for this vegetable that masquerades as a fruit and is
often merely pie filling.
</P>
<P>
   Rhubarb can be a challenge. It has such an aggressive nature
that it needs to be sweet-talked into being palatable. Yet it is so
vibrant a harbinger of spring that chefs are willing to exploit it
in new and unusual ways. Next month, Union Square Cafe is even
staging a whole meal built on rhubarb: rhubarb muffins, rhubarb
soup, rhubarb chutney with roast duck and rhubarb compote to top
tapioca pudding.
</P>
<P>
   The event _ a breakfast, despite the menu _ is timed to coincide
with an abundance of locally grown rhubarb at the nearby
Greenmarket and other produce stands. Although rhubarb is
sporadically available year round, what most markets carry
out-of-season is usually a relatively delicate hothouse variety,
often imported from Holland. Those who know their rhubarb prefer
the field-grown kind available from mid-April through June, because
the flavor and color are more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Rhubarb is classically paired with strawberries, in a seasonal
symbiosis of tart and sweet that results from a somewhat
simultaneous harvest. The combination, well sugared, softens the
rhubarb enough that even children may be persuaded to try it.
</P>
<P>
   But rhubarb, which looks for all the world like celery sheathed
in scarlet satin, is capable of far more than homespun pies,
crumbles and crisps. Its natural acidity makes it a superb foil for
rich roast pork or duck confit, for prosciutto and as a sauce for
succulent fish like salmon, arctic char or shad. At Firebird in the
theater district, it is paired with buttery chicken Kiev. But its
most stylish partner in New York this season is foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need the sweetness and sour of rhubarb against the fat of
the foie gras,'' said Paul Sale, the chef at Icon in midtown, who
sears the foie gras and wraps it in phyllo with rhubarb compote and
caramelized onion. ``In winter, we used cranberries and apples with
foie gras, but for spring, we switched to rhubarb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Tesar at the new restaurant Vine in the financial district
and Joseph Fortunato at Quantum 56 in the Drake Swissotel in
midtown are also pairing rhubarb and foie gras. ``I use honey to
cut the tartness of rhubarb. It's great with the richness of foie
gras,'' Fortunato said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhubarb is usually simmered or stewed, but Michel Nischan at
Heartbeat in midtown glazes it with honey before briefly roasting
it. He then includes it in a fennel and onion salad to serve with
sea scallops or on its own with grapefruit and goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Although rhubarb can be baked as long as an hour in a pie or
cobbler and still hold its shape, stewing should be at low heat and
brief. Overcooking renders it almost slimy. Stewed rhubarb is
excellent with ice cream; the puree is easily turned into sorbet.
Along with strawberries, raspberries are delicious with rhubarb,
and intensify the color. Ginger and orange enhance the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh rhubarb can also be cut up, blanched for a couple of
minutes in boiling water to set the color and then frozen to ensure
a year-round supply for baking.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its sugar dependency, rhubarb has been stymied somewhat
by an image as a slightly poisonous plant. The leaves can be toxic
_ not, as usually thought, because of oxalic acid, but from a still
unidentified toxin, said Harold McGee, a food scientist, in ``On
Food and Cooking'' (Collier Books, 1984). The leaves should never
be eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Rhubarb, which is actually related to celery, comes from
northern China and Siberia. The name is thought to derive from Rha,
once a name for the Volga River, around which it grew wild. In
China, the roots have been used for nearly 5,000 years for
medicinal purposes. It was also used for its medicinal roots in
Greece and Rome around the time of Christ and in medieval
monasteries in France and England.
</P>
<P>
   By the 17th century, English botanists began to try it as a
food, but it was not until the 19th century that it occurred to
English and American cooks to experiment with the stems in
preserves and pies. Rhubarb is still called pie plant in parts of
this country.
</P>
<P>
   The rhubarb coming into markets now is selling for about $2 a
pound. To get the most from it, select the brightest red stalks you
can find, and slender ones rather than thick ones, so they will be
less fibrous. One chopped stalk will yield about half a cup of
rhubarb. Rhubarb should not be peeled because most of the color is
in the skin. Although the flavor is what counts, it would be a pity
to strip its beautiful ruby tint.
</P>
<P>
   And that color is what makes a rhubarb Bellini so stunning.
Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich, at their new restaurant Esca in
the theater district, are serving the shocking pink aperitif made
with sweetened rhubarb puree and sparkling prosecco. It's a great
moment for rhubarb. Finally, it has the dazzle it deserves.

ACROSS BUENOS AIRES, A TANGO WITH EMPANADAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ It is not that I didn't expect to try
empanadas during a visit to Buenos Aires, but rather that I never
guessed they would become an obsession. I had eaten empanadas,
those crisp, flaky half-moons of pastry puffed with savory meat
fillings, in other parts of Latin America and at home in New York.
I wondered how much better they would be in the country that seems
to have the grandest passion for them.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised me were the intriguing regional variations,
described by the native aficionados I met at the beginning of my
two-week stay in November 1999. Some were devotees of the hotly
spiced Bolivian empanadas, in which a little meat is stretched with
potato, while others lauded the milder fillings favored in Chile.
All raved about the juicy specimens of the Tucuman province in the
northwest semidesert, which is said to have the country's most
refined regional cuisine. And most knew the outposts for the
variations of Salta and San Juan Provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly tempted, my husband and I embarked on an odyssey
through this graceful city, with its broad tree-lined boulevards
and 19th-century Beaux-Arts buildings that recall the elegant
sections of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Following the custom of the Portenos, the cosmopolitan
inhabitants of Buenos Aires, we relied on these hot, hand-held pies
for quick lunches, often downing four or five as a meal, or two or
three as a snack.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, we got some useful background information from Dereck
Foster, the longtime food critic of The Buenos Aires Herald. An
Argentine born to English parents, Foster is working on a book
about empanadas, and he generously parted with details of a few of
his favorite outposts, also pointing out that the word empanada
means ``in dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Empanadas may be baked or fried, but each method requires a
sugarless pie dough. The trimly fit Portenos seem to prefer
empanadas ``al horno,'' baked in the oven, although I agree with
those who insist that frying works best when the fillings are made
of meat. (Any New Yorker who doubts that fried empanadas can be
ethereally light and greaseless will be reassured at the excellent
little Chimichurri Grill on Ninth Avenue.)
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, empanadas are beautifully put together as
appetizers in formal restaurants. But they taste best in the small
bare-bones bakery shops where these pies are made, primarily for
takeout. Most provide narrow counter shelves where diners stand or
perch on high stools; very few shops have really comfortable tables
and chairs. Prices range from about $1 to $1.50 for a
three-and-a-half-bite pie.
</P>
<P>
   We began our search-and-devour mission at El Sanjuanino, in the
high-fashion Recoleta neighborhood. With snug booths, dark wood
paneling and bright tiles, this tavern-cafe provides an easy
entrance into the delights of the empanada, the specialty here
being those from San Juan Province with green olives, hard-cooked
eggs and, it is said, a touch of tomato, although I detected none.
Other standard fillings are pale pink ham with a rich, melting
white cheese and a hint of onion, and choclo, combining the soft
white corn stew humitas with some whole kernels for texture. Here,
as elsewhere, chicken proved dry and banal. On a second visit, we
discovered that Sanjuanino's empanadas are freshest from 6 to 8
p.m., when habitues drop in for a few little pies and a glass of
beer or local wine.
</P>
<P>
   Tucuman called next, and we ventured to the business and
shopping section of Retiro, and to La Querencia, an inviting,
comfortable cafe stylishly done up in black and terra cotta. Beef
for empanadas in Tucuman is diced with a knife _ ``picada a
cuchillo'' _ instead of being ground. That results in a more
toothsome filling. In fact, diners are advised to wrap a napkin
around their wrist to catch the drippings _ a precaution that
proved unnecessary. So was the warning about hot spicing; the
amount of chili is tempered to the gentle palates of the Portenos.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied if not bowled over by that experience, we tried La
Cupertina, our other Tucuman outpost, in a far-flung corner of the
middle-to-lower-class residential section of Old Palermo. It was
worth the trip. The charming bakery-cafe, with its blue and white
decor, lively counter where food is displayed, and comfortable
tables, served one of the two best empanadas that we found. The
shop is run by Tucuman natives, Ramon Torres and his wife, Cecilia
Hermann, who is the very accomplished cook.
</P>
<P>
   Cupertina features the most mouthwatering, beefy baked
empanadas, brightened with minced scallion greens and heady
overtones of cumin and paprika. Other fillings were equally good,
with the zanahoria (carrot) being a local favorite.
</P>
<P>
   On to El Horno, and Bolivia, we thought, wending our way toward
this small, barren shop in a part of Palermo bustling with
bookstores and schools. The shop's focal point is the igloo-shaped
clay and brick oven that is native to Bolivia. It turns out plump,
lightly spiced empanadas that tied Cupertina's for first place.
</P>
<P>
   Two kinds of meat fillings are offered: picante, the spiciest
and juiciest we encountered, and suave, which is more gently
seasoned. Potato and egg pleasantly fleshed out both versions. Even
better were the round turnovers called pukakapas, which combined
onions, soft cheese and fiery red chilies, and the pascualina, or
Easter empanada, stuffed with Swiss chard and chopped egg bound
with a light bechamel sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In the midtown Capital District, we tried our luck at tiny El
Ladrillo, meaning ``the brick'' and referring to the walls and oven
here. The specialty is a house creation: souffleed empanadas, each
a miniature semicircular balloon, with good versions of standard
fillings, most especially one of beef, raisins and olives.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the good news. Not all our searches proved as
rewarding. Empanadas from Salta (at La Justina) and Chile (at Los
Chilenos) were disappointing. La Justina's were bland and tasted of
overheated grease; at Los Chilenos, they were sherbet cold at the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Although we had many delicious and even wonderful empanadas, we
were a little disappointed that the regional differences were not
as marked as we had been lead to expect. A flaw, Foster told us,
brought on by attempts at seasoning to please the common taste.
</P>
<P>
   So what else is new?

 &HT;    Information tech jobs still going unfilled
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than 1.6 million information technology jobs will
be created in the United States this year, but only half of them
will be filled, according to a study released this week looking at
the size and scope of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a lot larger than originally thought, the Information
Technology Association of America study found. Roughly one in 14
U.S. workers makes a living by developing and supporting
information technology for companies. And more of them work in the
South than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show you the enormous change that's taken
place in our economy,'' said Bob Cohen, a senior vice president
with the Arlington, Va.-based trade group. ``This really and truly
is a new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Bridging the Gap: IT Skills for a New Millennium,''
polled 700 IT managers in and outside the IT field.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly a third _ or 3.4 million _ of the nation's 10 million IT
jobs are in the South, making the region home to more information
technology workers than the West, site of the traditional high-tech
havens of Silicon Valley and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the IT industry, most people tend to
think of the Silicon Valley, and their thoughts tend to drift
west,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for IT workers is expected to grow by 310,000 in the
South over the next 12 months, the study said. Still, the Midwest
and West are expected to need more workers than Southern companies
in the time period.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's lopsided supply and demand continues to
underscore the severe need nationwide for people who can develop,
run and maintain everything from computers to web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real concern,'' Cohen said. ``(It affects) the ability
of companies to grow and develop IT solution and use IT for
competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The tight labor market has prompted many companies to pressure
Congress to relax immigration laws to allow more high-tech workers
in from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest job, the study found, is technical support, from
those who repair complex systems to people working on help desks.
Employers will seek to fill 600,000 tech support jobs in the next
year alone. Database developers were second, followed by
programmers and software engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the increased demand for e-business and the Internet,
workers with web experience are now the target of 13 percent of all
IT hiring, the study noted.
</P>
<P>
   As for skills, the traditional thinking has been that people had
to have very specific kinds of training to get jobs. Not so, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one way to get these skills,'' Cohen said. ``There
are a variety of avenues: community college, technical school or
four-year university.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most surprising findings, Cohen noted, was the fact
that 90 percent of all the jobs and 70 percent of all the demand
for IT workers comes from outside IT companies such as the local
bank, insurance company or grocery store.

</P>
<P>
   Adapted from La Cupertina, Buenos Aires
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus 24 to 48 hours' marinating time
</P>
<P>
   1 pound filet mignon, fat trimmed
</P>
<P>
   1 cup finely diced and loosely packed beef suet (5 to 6 ounces)
or very white, firm beef fat, or } cup sunflower or corn oil, or a
half-and-half combination of beef fat and oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup finely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   { to 1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   \ to { teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons sweet paprika, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon hot red chili powder (cayenne or crushed dried red
pepper flakes with seeds), or to taste
</P>
<P>
   { to 1 teaspoon powdered cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 cup finely chopped scallions, green and white portions
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Empanada pastry (see recipe). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Dice beef into [- to \-inch pieces. Place in bowl and cover
with 3 cups boiling water. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes, or until
meat loses its raw, red look. Pour off water and drain meat
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a 1{- to 2-quart heavy saucepan, slowly cook suet or beef
fat until it melts, or heat oil. If using suet or fat, leave in the
browned bits that remain after fat is rendered. Add remaining
ingredients for filling, except scallions, sugar and meat; stir.
Reduce heat and saute, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until onion
softens.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add meat and scallions and stir. Cover and simmer over low
heat for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add one cup boiling
water, cover loosely and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes,
stirring frequently and adding water if needed to prevent
scorching. Cook until beef is tender and water has evaporated,
leaving an oily red liquid that should remain.
</P>
<P>
   4. Adjust seasonings to taste, adding sugar only to offset
excessive bitterness. If more spices are added, simmer gently
another minute or two. Remove from heat, and when filling is cool,
cover and place in refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours so flavor
develops and liquids are absorbed by meat. Remove from refrigerator
30 minutes to 1 hour before filling pastry. Stir to redistribute
spices.
</P>
<P>
   5. Make empanada pastry. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Set out
two shallow pans, preferably jellyroll pans with rims, large enough
to hold 10 to 12 five-inch-long empanadas with an inch of space
between them.
</P>
<P>
   6. Place a rounded tablespoonful of filling in center of each
round. Moisten edges of round with cold water and fold dough in
half, making sure filling does not spread to edges. Press edges
with fork to seal, or pinch into tiny tucks. (Filled, unbaked
empanadas can be frozen for up to two weeks; thaw for two hours
before baking.)
</P>
<P>
   7. Arrange empanadas on pans. Bake in upper third of oven for 10
to 15 minutes, until pale brown. Cool for 3 to 5 minutes, then
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 20 to 24 empanadas.
</P>
<P>
   EMPANADA PASTRY
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 30 minutes, plus 30 minutes' resting time
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   4{ to 5 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   } cup solid vegetable shortening, or 6 ounces beef suet,
margarine or firm white beef fat.
</P>
<P>
   1. Dissolve salt in } cup warm water. Sift 4{ cups flour into
bowl or food processor. Divide vegetable shortening into small
clumps, or cut suet, beef fat or margarine into small pieces; add
to flour. Blend fat and flour until you have a fine meal.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add salted water until mixture forms a ball. If dough is very
sticky, work in flour a tablespoon at a time.
</P>
<P>
   3. Shape dough into a ball and turn onto a lightly floured
surface. Knead vigorously for 10 minutes, or until it is very
smooth and elastic. Reshape into ball, place in a bowl and cover
with towel. Let rest for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. With lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough to [-inch
thickness on lightly floured surface. Cut into rounds with 5-inch
cookie cutter; stack rounds. Cover with towel to prevent drying.
Yield: 20 to 24 pastry rounds.

GOP PUSHES GUN BILL THROUGH HOUSE, A WEEK BEFORE COLUMBINE
ANNIVERSARY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas, S.C., La., Col., Fla., Ohio, Md., N.M., Ind.)  By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conceding vulnerability on a hot campaign issue,
House Republican leaders Tuesday sent to the floor a popular
gun-crime bill, written by Republicans, and passed it so they would
have something to show before next week's anniversary of the fatal
shootings at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers voted 358-60 to send $100 million in block grants to
states that impose mandatory jail sentences for gun crimes. Only
six states would now qualify for the grants, but supporters said
that number would grow. All but three Republicans voted in favor of
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders expressed confidence that Tuesday's vote
would arm rank-and-file members heading home for a two-week recess
on Friday with a wide-ranging gun-control bill opposed by the
National Rifle Association and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the party's anxiety over the issue, House
Republican leaders railroaded the bill to the floor under a
time-saving procedure that bars amendments, even though the measure
had only one hearing and no votes in the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership wanted this bill on the floor because the
Columbine anniversary is coming up next week,'' Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., who sponsored the bill, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, introduced a similar bill in the
Senate on Tuesday that has broad Republican support, but will
probably become a magnet for Democratic amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that Tuesday's
House vote was ``a political trap'' for Democrats and ``a cruel
political trick on the American public'' because it failed to pay
for 500 additional federal agents and 1,000 prosecutors that
President Clinton had called for. But Lockhart stopped short of
threatening a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week, Clinton and other gun-control supporters
plan to use the April 20 anniversary of the Colorado school
shooting to spotlight a months-old stalemate over the stalled
gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to Annapolis, Md., on Tuesday for a bill-signing
ceremony that made Maryland the first state in the country to
require built-in safety locks on handguns and other stringent gun
controls.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton and Rep. Dick Gephardt, of Indiana, the
House Democratic leader, will travel to Colorado to throw their
support behind a state ballot initiative to require that all sales
at gun shows, including those by unlicensed dealers, be subject to
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote came at a time when the Federal Trade Commission
has joined five states in an anti-trust inquiry into whether gun
makers are conspiring against Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest
gun maker, which has agreed to restrict how it makes and
distributes handguns.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders Tuesday defended the gun-crime bill and
their tactics. ``The Republican Congress wants to make sure it is
offering a clear, comprehensive approach to reducing gun crimes at
the same time when President Clinton is offering an approach based
on rhetoric rather than results,'' said Jonathan Baron, a spokesman
for Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House measure, states would qualify for grants if they
agreed to set mandatory minimum five-year sentences for criminals
convicted of using or possessing a gun during a violent crime. The
five-year sentence would be in addition to the sentence provided
for the underlying crime. States would also have to agree to
coordinate with federal prosecutors and law-enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions are patterned after Project Exile, a federal
program started in 1997 in Richmond, Va., by a Clinton-appointed
U.S. attorney. Since then, violent crime in Richmond is down by 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The six states that have adopted similar laws since then are
Virginia, Texas, South Carolina, Louisiana, Colorado and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the House bill added new, unnecessary mandatory
minimum jail terms, and relatively small financial incentives to
states that change their laws.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, for example, calls for $100 million in grants over the
next five years, including $10 million next year and $15 million in
2002. The bill broadly defines how states can use the money to
include police, prosecutors, courts and prison expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., said the grants would cover the
incarceration costs of only half a dozen new inmates. ``Although it
sounds good and makes a good slogan, it's not a good policy,'' said
Scott, who added that other cities in Virginia such as Norfolk and
Virginia Beach had reduced their violent crime rates with Project
Exile-type programs.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents retorted that the program was a proven success. ``It
may not be the gun-control agenda of the left, but it works,'' said
Rep. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., R-Md.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., added, ``If you bring a gun into my
neighborhood, I don't want to see you back. It's time to stop the
revolving door of justice and put these people away.''

A SALUTE TO CLIVE DAVIS, OUSTED AT ARISTA RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Clive Davis, the beleaguered chief executive of
Arista Records, celebrated the 25th anniversary of the label he
founded with performances by some of its best-known acts Monday
night at the Shrine Auditorium here. The ceremony stretched from
three hours to an audience-wearying six so that it could be taped
properly for broadcast May 15 on NBC. Among those performing were
Santana, Sarah McLachlan, Toni Braxton, Puff Daddy, Barry Manilow,
Alan Jackson, Patti Smith and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The event crowned what many in the music business have been
calling the year of Clive Davis. Since it was disclosed in November
that executives at BMG Entertainment, which owns Arista, had
decided to replace 66-year-old Davis when his contract expires in
June with a younger executive, Antonio (L.A.) Reid of the
rhythm-and-blues label Laface, Davis was put in the glare of the
spotlight like no recording executive in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame, one of the few executives to receive the honor with
such fanfare; been the subject of numerous feature articles; turned
his annual pre-Grammy Awards party into a self-tribute, which
culminated with Stevie Wonder comparing him to Jesus; been given a
lifetime achievement award by the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences; and gotten in the last word at the Grammy Awards
after winning the top award for co-producing Carlos Santana's
comeback record.
</P>
<P>
   Now Davis, admired for the mainstream pop taste and hands-on
career guidance that have marked his run at Arista, has enjoyed
another massive tribute. At the Arista birthday party, Dick Clark
introduced a film of highlights from Davis' career, President
Clinton gave testimony to Davis in a letter included in the program
notes, Houston was introduced by a film that began with Davis
announcing her on an old Merv Griffin show, and celebrity
presenters introduced performers with long quotations from Davis as
if he were a pundit on the order of Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that nothing was planned,'' Davis said
in an interview before the show. As for all his awards and honors,
he said, ``I was told that the Grammys voted back in May, and we've
gotten requests for a 25th-anniversary special from networks for
years. Like Fifth Avenue buses, sometimes they all come at once.
And obviously, all these occasions are unrelated to each other, but
I'll take them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Many executives said that Davis was keeping such a high profile
because he was fighting to keep his job, but Davis denied ever
publicly protesting or being on bad terms with his superiors at BMG
and confirmed that he would step down from Arista.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contract ends June 30, and I've gotten tremendous offers,
including one from BMG,'' he said. ``I'm really going to be
weighing these, because it's a major new opportunity and I'm going
to do what makes me happy. It's been the biggest year in our
history _ not just in sales but in profits.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is Davis enjoying so much limelight if the battle for his
job is already over? Several executives at rival labels, some of
whom have been ejected from the companies they ran in similar power
struggles, answered that question on condition of anonymity. One
executive said he admired the ``perseverance and lunatic passion''
with which Davis ran Arista, adding that Davis ``can't let go, and
it's not in his nature not to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding an extra layer of drama to the Arista celebration was
Houston's first television performance since her canceled
performances at the Oscars and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
induction ceremony. Backstage at the ceremony, journalists were far
more interested in Houston's health than in Davis' job.
</P>
<P>
   Houston began on a troubled note: she had difficulty focusing,
tripped on the stage and forgot the lyrics to her hit, ``How Will I
Know.'' But she snapped into sharp focus midway through the set
with a slow-building, highly improvised version of ``I Will Always
Love You'' that brought the exhausted audience to its feet one more
time before the show's finale: the smiling, spectacled Davis
surrounded by Carole King, Melissa Etheridge, Dionne Warwick,
Manilow and dozens of other stars singing ``That's What Friends Are
For.''

   SPONSORS-MOTIVATE (Atlanta) _ When the Olympic Games open in
Australia this summer, about 30 athletes will represent Egypt.
Sixty will make up the contingent from Turkey. And nearly 100 will

will not appear on the the Olympic athletes' uniforms, of course,
and television commentators probably won't even mention the giant
retailer's name. But in cities and towns around North America,
thousands of Home Depot employees will stay up late to root for the
athletes on TV and get up the next morning to devour the accounts
of their exploits in the sports pages. That, it turns out, is the
audience Home Depot executives are trying to reach. When a company

   SPONSORS-MOTIVATE (Atlanta) _ When the Olympic Games open in
Australia this summer, about 30 athletes will represent Egypt.
Sixty will make up the contingent from Turkey. And nearly 100 will
make up the delegation from Home Depot. The company's orange logo
will not appear on the the Olympic athletes' uniforms, of course,
and television commentators probably won't even mention the giant
retailer's name. But in cities and towns around North America,
thousands of Home Depot employees will stay up late to root for the
athletes on TV and get up the next morning to devour the accounts
of their exploits in the sports pages. That, it turns out, is the
audience Home Depot executives are trying to reach. When a company
employs 210,000 people in an industry with one of the highest
turnover rates in the country _ in the midst of one of the tightest
job markets in more than three decades _ it does what it has to do
to hold onto every last one of them. By David Leonhardt.

COMMENTARY: NO TIPPING, PLEASE
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 20 years ago I fell in love, as young social
scientists will, with nonlinearity _ and in particular with the
idea that large effects could have small causes. I was inspired by
the economist Thomas Schelling's classic little 1978 book
``Micromotives and macrobehavior,'' with its illustrative models of
how seemingly trivial individual concerns (such as a mild desire to
have some neighbors similar to yourself) could lead to extreme
social outcomes (such as complete racial segregation). And I
dreamed of a theory of everything _ of fashions and fads, booms and
slumps, economic miracles and social catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   So when I read ``The Tipping Point,'' the new best seller by
Malcolm Gladwell, I sighed for my lost innocence. Gladwell is a
very good writer, but he is also lucky: he has not yet been forced
to confront the sad truth that it is far easier to tell nonlinear
stories than to confirm them, let alone use them as a basis for
action.
</P>
<P>
   For those who haven't yet heard about it, ``The Tipping Point''
_ subtitled ``How little things can make a big difference'' _ has a
pretty good chance of becoming one of those books that, arriving at
just the right moment, reinforce a new public mood. After decades
of disillusionment with social engineering, of backlash against the
Great Society and all that, there is a new mood of social activism
abroad in the land; and Gladwell offers hope that ``tightly
focused, targeted interventions'' might work after all. So his book
might be to the next decade what Michael Harrington's ``The Other
America'' was to the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Gladwell's main idea is an analogy between social movements and
epidemics. With stories that range from the sudden resurgence of
Hush Puppies as fashion footwear to the recent decline in New
York's crime rate, he argues that behavior patterns, like viruses,
can spread from a few individuals through a large population.
(Oddly, he makes no mention of the biologist Richard Dawkins, whose
analogy between ``memes'' _ infectious ideas _ and viruses had, I
thought, itself spread widely even among the literati). And a small
change in the environment, which makes a particular behavior
pattern just a bit more likely to persist in one individual or be
adopted by another, can sometimes cause sudden, large social
change.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that, in some broad and general sense, is certainly
true. And if you have never thought about such things before, it
can be mind-opening. But a word of caution: If you accept
Gladwell's conclusion that the analogy between epidemics and social
change offers ``a reaffirmation of the potential for change and the
power of intelligent action,'' you are likely to be bitterly
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Why do I say this? Because when it comes to the idea that big
events can have small causes, economists _ who ought to have a
simpler problem, because they deal with the cruder emotions _ have
been there and done that, repeatedly, for 60 years or more. And by
and large the theories haven't worked.
</P>
<P>
   For example, surely the spread of the Great Depression from Wall
Street to the world at large was a sort of epidemic; more recently,
the 1997-98 crisis in Asia was almost invariably described with
terms like ``financial contagion.'' Everyone who thinks about it
seriously realizes that such crises must involve some kind of
self-reinforcing process. But the ingenious ``nonlinear business
cycle theory'' that briefly flourished in the 1940s turned out to
be no help in predicting or preventing future recessions. I have a
personal stake in believing that the currency crisis models some of
us devised in the midst of Asia's turmoil will have a better fate;
but history is not on my side.
</P>
<P>
   Another example: Economists once thought that a brief ``big
push,'' perhaps concentrated on a few key sectors, could jump-start
a stagnant economy into rapid modernization. But none of the
deliberate efforts to engineer an economic takeoff delivered on
their promise; when economic miracles like Korea's sudden surge in
the 1960s (or our own recent productivity revolution) occurred,
they have always come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that ``focused, targeted interventions'' aren't
worth trying. But don't count on much success. Little things can
indeed make a big difference; but they're usually not the things
you were watching, or the difference you expected.

   WASHINGTON, Va. _ Sunrise at Sunnyside Farms is greeted by a
ritual that startles the uninitiated. Workers advance upon
windowless structures on wheels that are scattered around the 539
acres and lower the sides, releasing thousands of clucking chickens
eager for a good day's work at what they do best: eating bugs.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, venture capitalist, philanthropist and organic
farmer, uses these coops on wheels _ chicken mobile units, they're
called _ to move his chickens where the pecking is needed most. The
mobile units are just one of many labor-savers he employs on the
organic farm he started in 1995 in the middle of Rappahannock
County, home to the very rich who have made their money elsewhere
and to farmers who barely make a living. Like the cattle, sheep and
goats that keep the pasture trimmed, the chickens take care of
fertilizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Like every aspect of his $11.5 million farm, the mobile units
are state-of-the-art equipment intended to ensure the success of
his experimental farm. Money is no object, and money is not the
only objective.
</P>
<P>
   The farm is not a rich man's hobby. It is a rich man's business,
and Cole, who made his name as president of Internet services at
America Online (and his money in a variety of other computer
technology businesses), predicts confidently that Sunnyside will
turn a profit by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its wagonloads of chickens, the farm has 424 head
of Wagyu cattle (close relatives of the famous Japanese Kobe beef);
60 to 70 varieties of vegetables, herbs and flowers; and 8 to 10
varieties of berries, as well as pear, apple and cherry trees. It
is experimenting with more than 200 kinds of fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important to Cole is Sunnyside's role in promoting
organic farming as economic savior. By helping local growers profit
in an era when independent farms are struggling, he hopes to create
a model for reviving depressed agricultural areas around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of saving a region through organic farming might once
have sounded outlandish. But the demand for organic food nationwide
is greater than the supply, and sales have increased by at least 20
percent annually for several years. Buyers looking for such food _
independently certified to be free of chemical pesticides,
genetically engineered ingredients and antibiotics _ willingly pay
a premium for it.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, 47, calls his system network farming: a large central farm
is the hub, with smaller nearby farms the spokes, their production
marketed through the hub. Sunnyside's system is designed to show
that diversified organic farming, with a mix of vegetables, fruits
and animals, can be profitable while protecting the environment,
not only from tract housing but also from the damage done to it by
traditional farming methods. Such a system would be particularly
useful in helping small organic farmers compete.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is not new. Walnut Acres Organic Farms in
Pennsylvania, which Cole just bought, operates in the same fashion.
But Sunnyside was set up to be an experimental demonstration farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is doing is really rare,'' said Katherine DiMatteo,
executive director of the Organic Trade Association. ``That he has
the ability to have this diversity on his farm makes it unique. It
totally encompasses the breadth of on-farm innovation and research.
He is really taking new and old ideas and combining all that
information into a full farm approach.''
</P>
<P>
   So far three small farms have signed on with Sunnyside, and
conversations with a dozen more farmers are under way. The farm
pays to educate them in converting to organic techniques and
gaining organic certification and gives them access to the
expensive equipment needed to run an organic farm. It also pays
them 20 to 30 percent more than they would get if they were selling
conventional food and, more important, gets their products to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A weakness of a lot of farmers is marketing,'' said Brian
Cramer, the gardener and orchard production manager at Sunnyside.
Selling at farmers' markets or farm stands, with no middlemen, ``is
always preferable,'' he said, ``but some farmers don't want to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some don't have time to do it,'' he said, ``so they leave it
to someone else, and they get taken advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the summer Sunnyside is opening a market in an 1835 building
Cole is restoring in the center of the tiny town of Washington,
Va., less than a block from his most prestigious customer, the Inn
at Little Washington. Its farmers' products will be sold there, at
a farmers' market in Washington, D.C., and to restaurants, the
Fresh Fields natural supermarket chain and an organic wholesaler
who sells up and down the East Coast. There will be more than 30
varieties of tomatoes, 15 different peppers and three dozen kinds
of greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually we could have 8 or 10 spoke farms, and that could
have a tremendous economic impact on the community,'' said Cole,
who has restored the 1720 house on the farm, one of several places
he lives with his wife of 30 years and the youngest of their four
children. (One son works for Sunnyside full time, another during
the summer.)
</P>
<P>
   The original 1,000-acre farm had been in the same family for 276
years. When Cole bought half of it, in 1995, the land had been worn
out by conventional farming. It took two years of intensive working
and enriching the soil for the first earthworms to return, and
Sunnyside was certified organic in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   DiMatteo, of the Organic Trade Association, said she doubts that
aylne has ever started an organic farm from scratch on so grand a
scale, and while she greatly admires what Cole is trying to do, she
is not certain it will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People either go into organic farming gradually or specialize
in one crop while they figure out crop rotations,'' she said.
``Wealthy people do organic farming, but profitability is not what
it's about, and he's setting a goal of a working farm that is
economically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the food industry. It's not like the technology
industry. You can't force nature to perform according to some
bottom-line expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   John Burns, a consultant who was hired by Cole in 1995 but left
after a falling-out two years later, agreed. ``When there is such
an excess amount of capital around,'' he said, ``the solution seems
to be spend more money, get more people and get more equipment, as
opposed to scaling back and concentrating on fewer things. It's the
mentality of his other enterprises: you get enough brain power and
enough people and you can get it solved, and farming isn't that
way. It's the cycle of life and nature; it's not microchip speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole, though, maintains that with enough money and his
successful business experience he can help nature along. For
instance, his recent purchase of Walnut Acres, the oldest organic
food mail order company in the country, provides Sunnyside with
built-in marketing advantages.
</P>
<P>
   He has also scoured the country for the best people in organic
production, like Wes Beall, a cow's version of the horse whisperer:
cattle trust him. To assure a steady supply of loyal farmworkers,
who are recruited from two villages in Mexico, Cole provides
benefits including trips home for two or three months at a time and
401(k) plans, matching the workers' contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Cole has also planted several varieties of dwarf fruit stock to
see which grow best. These varieties, Cramer said, bear more fruit
more quickly, and are easier to pick and to spray with organic pest
controls. Many are heirloom varieties like Roxbury Russet and
Grimes Golden apples and newer varieties like Liberty that are
immune to a serious apple disease called scab.
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyside has its own weather station. It alerts the orchardist
when to expect an outbreak of pests and prepare for it. For
example, it can pinpoint the moment when the Japanese beetle's
larvae are about to emerge. While the commercial grower is bringing
out the pesticides, Cole is sending out the chickens.
</P>
<P>
   The farm uses animals in an intensive grazing rotation, a
technique now being reintroduced into organic agriculture. ``In
order to save human labor we enlist animal labor,'' Cole said, ``by
having them do what they do naturally.'' For a day or two cattle
graze on high grasses in a particular field; when they move on, the
sheep and goats come in for a day to eat everything else. They are
followed by the chickens, which scatter the manure left behind by
the other animals as they eat the weed seeds out of it, at the same
time depositing their own nitrogen-rich manure. (The chickens also
provide eggs for the farm to sell.) Then the rotation begins again.
</P>
<P>
   All of these approaches will be shared at the Sunnyside
Institute, to be built on the farm. It will provide information not
available from federal and state agriculture agencies, which have
spent little time or money studying organic farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever coordinated all this information,'' DiMatteo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole traces his interest in the environment to his childhood in
Hawaii. His family has financed global conservation efforts for 15
years, most recently through the Cole Family Foundation. He chose
Virginia for his experiment because of its climate and its
proximity to one of his homes. He found the farm through his friend
and now neighbor, John Sawhill, president and chief executive of
the environmental group the Nature Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview for ``Dream Makers,'' by Michele Hunt
(Davies-Black Publishing, 1998), Cole said entrepreneurs need to
redefine capital to include not only money but the earth itself and
stop treating it like an unlimited resource. ``Instead of saying
the world is going to hell in a handbasket, you have to say we can
do something about this. We can change our relationship to the
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any rich mogul who comes to town and buys up all the
available land, Cole has his detractors. But even those who have
parted ways over differences of opinion admire what he is trying to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who quit as a consultant, said Cole is ``brilliant.'' But
he added: ``He makes it hard for some people to deal with him,
because you have to do it his way. He wants to do too much too
fast. If I'd had my druthers, I would have managed the farm for
three years without growing a thing, but he wanted to have crops in
18 months.''
</P>
<P>
   In early April, Cole was invited to lecture at the Royal
Institute of International Affairs in London on organic food trends
in the United States. In his speech he described his attempt to
fuse two totally different cultures: the high-powered, fast-paced
world of technology and marketing and a slow-paced place from the
past where success is based on the production yields of organic
farming.
</P>
<P>
   Cole leaves no doubt of his certitude that he can apply the
principles of the Internet, where rewards can come at warp speed
and most problems can be remedied with brain power and capital, to
farming, where even the best-laid plans are subject to the vagaries
of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to do good, and he really sees this as an important
step,'' Burns said. ``And being a leader in a previous industrial
incarnation, he wants to do the same thing in the organic world.
But organic mogul may be an oxymoron.''

 &HT;    RENO MAY TRAVEL TO MIAMI TO MEET WITH FAMILY, AS ELIAN TRANSFER
APPEARS CLOSER
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a bid to bring the long-running saga of 6-year-old
Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez to a swift close, U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno may travel to Miami Wednesday to meet with the boy's
Florida family and local officials to urge their cooperation in
transferring the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno's meetings would not upset the timetable for turning
the boy over, which Justice Department officials said would be sent
to the family in a letter late Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several South Florida television stations cited unnamed sources
saying the family would be ordered to turn the boy over on
Thursday, although federal officials refused to publicly confirm
any dates, times or places.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family still hopes to delay the transfer by first
obtaining a meeting with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, who
_ along with his wife and baby son _ has been living at the home of
a top Cuban diplomat near Washington D.C. since his arrival from
Cuba last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, offered to
meet with Juan Miguel, suggesting the Miami Beach home of Barry
University President Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin as a possible site.
O'Laughlin hosted a brief reunion between Elian and his Cuban
grandmothers in January, but then became a figure of controversy
herself by announcing she felt the boy should remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter released to the media, Lazaro Gonzalez said a
meeting of the family's adults could soon be followed by a reunion
between Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miami family ``would want to be assured that Elian will
be allowed to return to his present home in Miami's Little Havana
neighborhood afterward so that the meeting does not become the
opportunity for his abrupt removal,'' Gonzalez wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That demand made the chances for such a meeting seem dim, as
Juan Miguel Gonzalez has insisted he wants his son turned over to
him with no strings attached. Gonzalez has also said he would not
travel to Miami, or that if he did, it would only be to pick up his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez spent part of the day at the Cuban Interests Section in
Washington, meeting with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not wish to meet with the Miami relatives until he has
Elian in his arms,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown-Campbell, former head
of the National Council of Churches, which has tried for months to
broker the boy's return to his father. ``Once he has his son, then
the adults can work on their relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also refused to meet over the weekend with two Miami
relatives who traveled to Washington in hopes of setting up a
family ``kitchen-table'' conference.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter feelings between the branches of the family probably
weren't helped Tuesday when lawyers for the Miami relatives filed a
brief in a Florida family court alleging Juan Miguel Gonzalez has
abused his son. The brief asked for a hearing on the matter, but
Judge Jennifer Bailey said she was unlikely to grant such a hearing
because she feels federal law supersedes any state jurisdiction in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision to possibly visit Miami came shortly after she
met in her Washington office with Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex
Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who asked her to delay the
boy's transfer for 30 days and help set up a Gonzalez family
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that really should be decided between family
members,'' Penelas said, adding that he felt Miami's Cuban exiles
would respect whatever the family decides. Penelas has done a
dramatic about-face since he blasted federal officials two weeks
ago, warning that they were provoking Miami's exiles with their
insistence on returning Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Reno called the meeting ``productive,'' but again
stressed ``that the transfer of Elian to the care of his father
must move forward without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether Juan Miguel Gonzalez would remain in
the United States if his son is returned to him. He has stated that
he would be willing to remain here until an Atlanta federal appeals
court rules on the Miami relatives' lawsuit, but he has also said
he would prefer to return to Cuba immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta is scheduled to
hear arguments in the case May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's case also drew another flurry of attention in Congress,
with Florida's two senators urging that the hand-over of the boy be
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Connie Mack said he was upset that the
government would turn the boy over before the family had a chance
to work the issue out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is better equipped than Elian's own family to decide what
his future will be,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the House Republican leadership and two Cuban-American
members of Florida's congressional delegation invited Juan Miguel
Gonzalez to meet privately Wednesday in the Capitol. ``We want to
be sure that you are aware of all the options available to you as
you make your decision,'' they wrote in a letter delivered by
representatives of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.

 By GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ On Friday, when Juan Miguel Gonzalez went to school to
pick up his son Elian for the weekend, he was told that Elizabet
Brotons, his ex-wife and the boy's mother, had taken Elian at
midday and had not brought him back in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In his routine as a divorced father, this seemed normal to Juan
Miguel. From the time when he and Elizabet had separated two years
earlier, on the most amicable terms, the boy had lived with his
father and spent every other day at his mother's house. But
Elizabet's door was padlocked over the weekend and on Monday as
well, and Juan Miguel began to make inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   This was how he learned the bad news that was already becoming
common knowledge in the city of Cardenas: Elian's mother had left
with him for Miami, with 12 other people, in an aluminum boat 5 1/2
meters long, with no life preservers and a decrepit motor.
</P>
<P>
   It was Nov. 22, 1999. ``My life ended that day,'' Juan Miguel
said four months later. After their divorce, he and Elizabet had
maintained a relationship that was cordial but rather unusual: They
continued living under the same roof and sharing their dreams in
the same bed, hoping to produce as lovers the child they had not
been able to have as a married couple.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed impossible. Elizabet would conceive but miscarry in
the first four months of pregnancy. After seven miscarriages, the
child they had longed for was born. They had decided on a unique
name for him: Elian, composed of the first three letters of
Elizabet and the last two letters of Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabet was 28 years old when she left with the boy for Miami.
She was an amiable and hard-working chief housekeeper at a hotel in
Varadero. Her father says that at the age of 14 she was already in
love with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and married him when she was 18.
``We were like brother and sister,'' says Juan Miguel, a calm,
deliberate man who works as a cashier.
</P>
<P>
   After their divorce, Juan Miguel and Elizabet continued living
together with their son in Cardenas _ where all the protagonists in
this drama were born, and where they lived _ until she fell in love
with Lazaro Rafael Munero, a neighborhood tough. Juan Miguel
subsequently married Nelsy Carmeta and had a son, who is now 6
months old.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel did not have to waste time finding out where Elian
was, because in the Caribbean everybody knows everything _ ``even
before it happens,'' as one of my informants told me.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that the leader of the adventure was Lazaro
Munero, who had made at least two clandestine trips to the United
States to prepare the way. He had the contacts and nerve to take
along not only Elizabet and her son, but also a younger brother,
his father, who was over 70, and his mother, who was recovering
from a heart attack. Lazaro's partner in the enterprise took his
entire family.
</P>
<P>
   At the last moment, because each of them paid $1,000, three more
people came on board: 22-year-old Arianne Horta, her 5-year-old
daughter, Esthefany, and Nivaldo Vladimir Fernandez, the husband of
one of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   An infallible formula for being well-received as an immigrant in
the United States is to be shipwrecked in her territorial waters.
Cardenas is a good departure point: It is close to Florida, and its
coves are protected by mangrove swamps. Moreover, the regional art
of making small craft for fishing in the nearby Zapata Swamp and
Del Tesoro Lagoon provides raw materials for illegal boats, in
particular the aluminum pipes used for irrigating citrus groves.
</P>
<P>
   People say that Munero must have spent some $200 and an
additional 800 Cuban pesos on the motor and the boat's
construction. The result was a kind of lifeboat, with no roof and
no seats. Three inner tubes were put on board as life preservers
for 14 people. There was no room for more. Before they left, most
of the passengers injected themselves with Gravinol to prevent
seasickness.
</P>
<P>
   It appears they set out on Nov. 20 but had to go back when the
motor broke down. They remained hidden for two days, waiting for it
to be repaired, while Juan Miguel thought his son was already in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   This first emergency convinced Arianne Horta that the risks were
too great for her daughter, and she decided to leave her with her
family, to be brought over later by a safe route. It has been said
that Elian also became aware of the dangers of the crossing and
screamed to be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   They finally set off at dawn on the 22nd, with favorable seas
but a wretched motor. The stories the survivors recounted in the
Florida press after their rescue, and expanded on in phone calls to
their families in Cardenas, revealed terrifying details.
</P>
<P>
   According to them, at midnight on the 22nd, the men in charge
dismounted the hopeless motor and dropped it in the ocean to
lighten the weight. But the unbalanced boat flipped over on its
side, and all the passengers fell into the water. This may have
broken the fragile soldering on the aluminum pipes and caused the
boat to sink.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end, in darkness and an inferno of panic. The older
people who did not know how to swim probably drowned immediately.
The Gravinol, which causes drowsiness, must have worked against
most of them. Arianne and Nivaldo clutched at one inner tube;
Elian, and perhaps his mother, held onto the other. Nobody knows
what happened to the third. Elian can swim, but Elizabet could not,
and she may have let go in her confusion and terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw when Mama got lost in the ocean,'' the boy would later
tell his father on the phone. What is difficult to understand,
though it deserves to be true, is that she had the presence of mind
and the time to give the boy a bottle of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   His information was erroneous, but Juan Miguel had a premonition
of the tragedy. He called his uncle several times _ Lazaro Gonzalez
has lived in Miami for years _ and asked about clandestine arrivals
or recent shipwrecks, but was told nothing.
</P>
<P>
   At last, at dawn on Thursday, Nov. 25, the news broke in a
sequence of events. The body of an older woman was discovered on
the beach by a fisherman. Later, Arianne and Nivaldo were found
alive. Not long afterward a small boy appeared in the water off
Fort Lauderdale, unconscious and badly sunburned, lying across an
inner tube, face up. It was Elian, the last survivor.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard the news, Juan Miguel was determined to speak to
the boy on the phone but did not know where he was. On Nov. 25 a
doctor in Miami called him to ask about Elian's medical history.
Juan Miguel learned to his great joy that Elian himself had given
his father's name in the hospital, and his phone number and address
in Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Juan Miguel talked to Elian. Troubled, but in a
steady voice, Elian told his father he had seen his mother drown.
He also said he had lost his backpack and school uniform, which
Juan Miguel interpreted as a symptom of his disorientation. ``No,
Baby,'' he said. ``Your uniform is here, and I have your backpack
ready for when you come home.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is possible that Elian had had another pack at his
mother's house, or that one had been bought for him so he would not
insist on returning to his house. His fondness for school, as well
as his desire to return to class, were clearly demonstrated a few
days later, when he told his teacher on the telephone, ``Take good
care of my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   From the earliest calls, Juan Miguel realized that someone in
Miami was disrupting his conversations with his son. ``You should
know that from the very beginning they've done everything they
could to sabotage us,'' he told me. ``Sometimes they shout at the
boy while we're talking, or turn the volume all the way up on
television cartoons, or put a candy in his mouth so it's hard to
understand what he's saying.''
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of stratagems were also suffered in person by Raquel
Rodriguez and Marcela Quintant, Elian's grandmothers, during their
turbulent trip to Miami. Their visit with him, scheduled to last
two days, was reduced to 90 minutes, with all kinds of intentional
interruptions, and they said they spent no more than a quarter of
an hour alone with Elian. They returned to Cuba shocked at how much
he had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the same boy,'' they said, saddened by the timidity
of a child they remembered as lively, intelligent, and with a
remarkable talent for drawing. ``We have to save him!''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in Miami seems to care about the harm being done to
Elian's mental health by the cultural uprooting to which he is
being subjected.
</P>
<P>
   At his 6th birthday party, celebrated on Dec. 6 in his Miami
captivity, his hosts took a picture of him wearing a combat helmet,
surrounded by weapons and wrapped in the flag of the United States,
just a short while before a boy of his age in Michigan shot a
classmate to death with a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the real shipwreck of Elian did not take place
on the high seas, but when he set foot on American soil.

 &HT;    RENO MAY TRAVEL TO MIAMI TO MEET WITH FAMILY, AS ELIAN TRANSFER
APPEARS CLOSER
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a bid to bring the long-running saga of 6-year-old
Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez to a swift close, U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno may travel to Miami Wednesday to meet with the boy's
Florida family and local officials to urge their cooperation in
transferring the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno's meetings would not upset the timetable for turning
the boy over, which Justice Department officials said would be sent
to the family in a letter late Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several South Florida television stations cited unnamed sources
saying the family would be ordered to turn the boy over on
Thursday, although federal officials refused to publicly confirm
any dates, times or places.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family still hopes to delay the transfer by first
obtaining a meeting with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, who
_ along with his wife and baby son _ has been living at the home of
a top Cuban diplomat near Washington D.C. since his arrival from
Cuba last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, offered to
meet with Juan Miguel, suggesting the Miami Beach home of Barry
University President Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin as a possible site.
O'Laughlin hosted a brief reunion between Elian and his Cuban
grandmothers in January, but then became a figure of controversy
herself by announcing she felt the boy should remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter released to the media, Lazaro Gonzalez said a
meeting of the family's adults could soon be followed by a reunion
between Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miami family ``would want to be assured that Elian will
be allowed to return to his present home in Miami's Little Havana
neighborhood afterward so that the meeting does not become the
opportunity for his abrupt removal,'' Gonzalez wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That demand made the chances for such a meeting seem dim, as
Juan Miguel Gonzalez has insisted he wants his son turned over to
him with no strings attached. Gonzalez has also said he would not
travel to Miami, or that if he did, it would only be to pick up his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez spent part of the day at the Cuban Interests Section in
Washington, meeting with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not wish to meet with the Miami relatives until he has
Elian in his arms,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown-Campbell, former head
of the National Council of Churches, which has tried for months to
broker the boy's return to his father. ``Once he has his son, then
the adults can work on their relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also refused to meet over the weekend with two Miami
relatives who traveled to Washington in hopes of setting up a
family ``kitchen-table'' conference.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter feelings between the branches of the family probably
weren't helped Tuesday when lawyers for the Miami relatives filed a
brief in a Florida family court alleging Juan Miguel Gonzalez has
abused his son. The brief asked for a hearing on the matter, but
Judge Jennifer Bailey said she was unlikely to grant such a hearing
because she feels federal law supersedes any state jurisdiction in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision to possibly visit Miami came shortly after she
met in her Washington office with Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex
Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who asked her to delay the
boy's transfer for 30 days and help set up a Gonzalez family
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that really should be decided between family
members,'' Penelas said, adding that he felt Miami's Cuban exiles
would respect whatever the family decides. Penelas has done a
dramatic about-face since he blasted federal officials two weeks
ago, warning that they were provoking Miami's exiles with their
insistence on returning Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Reno called the meeting ``productive,'' but again
stressed ``that the transfer of Elian to the care of his father
must move forward without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether Juan Miguel Gonzalez would remain in
the United States if his son is returned to him. He has stated that
he would be willing to remain here until an Atlanta federal appeals
court rules on the Miami relatives' lawsuit, but he has also said
he would prefer to return to Cuba immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta is scheduled to
hear arguments in the case May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's case also drew another flurry of attention in Congress,
with Florida's two senators urging that the hand-over of the boy be
delayed.

<P>
   Republican Sen. Connie Mack said he was upset that the

`JAMES BALDWIN: A SOUL ON FIRE': GLIMPSING BALDWIN ON THE
PRECIPICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By DAVID DeWITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``James Baldwin: A Soul on Fire'' is the best sort of
theatrical biography: the sort that thoroughly entertains.
</P>
<P>
   The New Federal Theater's production of Howard Simon's short
play is funny, thrilling and wise, buoyed by the passionate
performance of Charles Reese in the title role. One minute he's
singing and leading the audience to hand-clapping unity; the next
he's speaking with urgent force on the desperate crisis of civil
rights. Reese even resembles Baldwin, with large eyes that suggest
a singular vision of the human experience.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Soul on Fire,'' Reese has a vehicle worthy of his
performance. Simon's script imagines a 1963 morning before Baldwin
and his colleagues _ the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, the
performer Harry Belafonte and the singer Lena Horne _ will meet
with Robert F. Kennedy, the U.S. attorney general. ``What shall I
wear to meet the man?'' Baldwin coos, echoing the title of one of
his most serious and horrific short stories. It's a disarming
reference because Baldwin is so plainly excited; Kennedy, he says,
``is so manly.''
</P>
<P>
   We see the giddy Baldwin planning his meeting in phone calls
with his collaborators, all performed by Forrest McClendon, who
serves the play well in a range of performance styles as a choral
confidant and force of nature called Ethereal. These exchanges
range from revolutionary dialogue to fey gossip (of Belafonte,
Baldwin tells Hansberry, ``I saw `Jamaica' six times just to see
his chest'').
</P>
<P>
   But the calls are interrupted by a blackmail effort that
imperils Baldwin. The night before, the writer had slept with the
wrong man, a barely literate trick who stole his manuscript and is
holding it for ransom. To retrieve his book, Baldwin must come up
with money and make the payoff himself, instead of meeting with
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a choice between artistry and activism? Between private
life and public life? The dilemma seems to have afflicted the real
Baldwin, who, while creating his fiction, wrestled with the call to
serve the demands of his time and sort out his identity as a gay
man, a black man and an American. It's a great hook for the play.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional crisis leads to a catharsis that isn't as fully
realized as its setup, though the director, Chuck Patterson, powers
it with a theatrical set of images. In one stomach-churning moment,
Reese's Baldwin speaks of his devout hopes for race relations as a
video image of the real Baldwin plays across the stage. The video's
closeups of the quietly dignified Baldwin reveal the haunting roots
of Reese's soaring rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the video, ``A Soul on Fire,'' presented in the
Abrons Art Center at the Henry Street Settlement, is a technically
modest production; a silk bedspread and scarf-covered lamp are the
most telling set pieces. Anita D. Ellis' costumes, however, are
thematically prominent. While the production at first dresses
Ethereal and Baldwin in white, it ends with a black-clad Ethereal
as Huey Newton, banging a drum and giving Baldwin a black power
salute. The moment has a forceful appeal, less a resolution of the
play than a blunt depiction of its conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In about 60 minutes, ``A Soul on Fire'' is of course not a
thorough evocation of Baldwin's life. But with humor, style and raw
emotion, it embraces its chosen territory with enthusiasm. All
stage biographies should be served so well.

 &HT;    Information tech jobs still going unfilled
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than 1.6 million information technology jobs will
be created in the United States this year, but only half of them
will be filled, according to a study released this week looking at
the size and scope of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a lot larger than originally thought, the Information
Technology Association of America study found. Roughly one in 14
U.S. workers makes a living by developing and supporting
information technology for companies. And more of them work in the
South than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show you the enormous change that's taken
place in our economy,'' said Bob Cohen, a senior vice president
with the Arlington, Va.-based trade group. ``This really and truly
is a new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Bridging the Gap: IT Skills for a New Millennium,''
polled 700 IT managers in and outside the IT field.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly a third _ or 3.4 million _ of the nation's 10 million IT
jobs are in the South, making the region home to more information
technology workers than the West, site of the traditional high-tech
havens of Silicon Valley and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the IT industry, most people tend to
think of the Silicon Valley, and their thoughts tend to drift
west,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for IT workers is expected to grow by 310,000 in the
South over the next 12 months, the study said. Still, the Midwest
and West are expected to need more workers than Southern companies
in the time period.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's lopsided supply and demand continues to
underscore the severe need nationwide for people who can develop,
run and maintain everything from computers to web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real concern,'' Cohen said. ``(It affects) the ability
of companies to grow and develop IT solution and use IT for
competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The tight labor market has prompted many companies to pressure
Congress to relax immigration laws to allow more high-tech workers
in from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest job, the study found, is technical support, from
those who repair complex systems to people working on help desks.
Employers will seek to fill 600,000 tech support jobs in the next
year alone. Database developers were second, followed by
programmers and software engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the increased demand for e-business and the Internet,
workers with web experience are now the target of 13 percent of all
IT hiring, the study noted.
</P>
<P>
   As for skills, the traditional thinking has been that people had
to have very specific kinds of training to get jobs. Not so, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one way to get these skills,'' Cohen said. ``There
are a variety of avenues: community college, technical school or
four-year university.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most surprising findings, Cohen noted, was the fact
that 90 percent of all the jobs and 70 percent of all the demand
for IT workers comes from outside IT companies such as the local
bank, insurance company or grocery store.

SEEKING WAYS TO TREAT ASBESTOS DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (With ASBESTOS-MAHANEY and ASBESTOS-HAMMOND)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, patients who contracted asbestosis were told there
was nothing medical science could do for them.
</P>
<P>
   You lingered for years while your lungs scarred over.
Eventually, you suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Harbut, 48, is one of a small group of physicians
who is trying to change the course of asbestos-induced disease. To
do that, he's essentially having to experiment on his own patients.
</P>
<P>
   Although millions of dollars have been poured into asbestos
litigation on all sides, and although companies and unions have
invested countless hours in asbestos screenings, almost no money
has gone into investigating treatments or better ways to manage
asbestos disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, there's an enormous paucity of reliable clinical
data on how to treat asbestosis,'' said Harbut, who is chairman of
the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Section of the American
College of Chest Physicians, and a clinical assistant professor of
medicine at Wayne State University in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, when Harbut was finishing his residency in occupational
medicine at the University of Michigan, physicians were writing off
most asbestos patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still teach you that there's nothing you can do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Harbut, who took his medical training in Poland, where he
helped set up cancer clinics for workers, and who still has an
original Solidarity poster on his office wall, isn't convinced of
that.
</P>
<P>
   Harbut's soft voice and teddy-bear demeanor with patients belie
his indignation at the way many of his patients were exposed to
asbestos in their jobs, and at the lack of resources for new
research into treatments.
</P>
<P>
   As an occupational physician, he used to spend the bulk of his
time doing diagnosis and screening for asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seemed to me a doctor should do more than that,'' he
said. ``So I started aggressively treating (the diseases).''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, for example, he's using a new class of drugs called
``leukotriene blockers'' to treat asbestosis. The drugs originally
were approved for use in treating asthma, and there is no research
on how they work for treatment of asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   But based on the biology of the two diseases, both of which
involve inflammation in the lungs, Harbut figured they might help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they (the new drugs) block inflammatory mediators in
the lung,'' he said. Inflammatory mediators are biological
molecules that help trigger inflammation. When the microscopic,
sliver-like fibers of asbestos lodge in lung cells, they inflame
the tissue, eventually leading to scarring or malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs appear to be helping some patients, Harbut said.
The treatment has improved their diffusing capacity, a sensitive
measure of the ability of air to cross over the lungs, and an
indicator of lung health. Using a combination of leukotriene
blockers and standard bronchodilator medication, Harbut has been
able to get a 20 percent improvement in lung capacity, compared
with about 7 percent improvement from bronchodilators alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients feel better,'' he said. ``We didn't make the scarring
go away, but we made the good tissue work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   This piecemeal approach to new therapies is currently the best
option doctors and their patients have.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of therapies, the options for individuals are pretty
limited,'' said Dr. Drew Brodkin, associate professor of internal
medicine and environmental health at the University of Washington.
``This is truly a disease where prevention is key. Once you've
developed it, there's very little in terms of therapeutics.''
</P>
<P>
   There is anecdotal evidence that some treatments work to help
asbestosis, Brodkin said. ``But nothing's been tried in a
systematic way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because some of the therapies that might be
helpful in combating inflammation also have signficant side
effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steroids and immune-system suppressants, for example, may help.
But they also leave patients vulnerable to infections, which can be
devastating for people with underlying lung problems.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a more fundamental disincentive to doing research
on asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go after a product that company X makes that makes
people sick, then company X goes after you,'' said Harbut, who
believes his phone has been tapped at least twice, and says he has
been hounded by asbestos companies for his testimony in court.
``And nobody sticks up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Early detection is key
</P>
<P>
   Asbestosis is not the only way asbestos kills patients.
Asbestos-caused lung cancer is just as deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos exposure alone results in a fivefold increase in cancer
risk. Cigarette smoking, by comparison, increases cancer risk
approximately tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   When combined, however, asbestos and cigarettes interact
synergistically to increase cancer risk between 50 and 90 times.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope of survival in those cases is early detection,
said Dr. Christine Oliver, assistant clinical professor of medicine
at Harvard Medical School, and a pulmonary and critical medicine
specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the primary means of screening for both asbestosis
and lung cancer was the chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   That's the equivalent of diagnosing someone with cardiac disease
and making treatment decisions using a stethoscope, Harbut said.
``You wouldn't do that in the year 2000. It's irresponsible
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Harbut and other physicians who see large numbers of
asbestos-exposed patients are turning to high-resolution CAT scans,
which are sophisticated radiological scans that look at the lungs
in thin cross-sections at 2 cm intervals. Although high-resolution
CAT scans are about 10 times as expensive as standard chest X-rays
(about $500 compared with $50 for a chest film), they also can find
tumors at earlier stages.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Walker, 63, found that out just in time.
</P>
<P>
   A former heavy equipment operator for Ford Motor Co., Walker
used to dump debris for the company in Detroit. Some of it
contained asbestos, although he didn't know it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   One day, an outside health inspector came to monitor the dust
kicked up by his machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, `Did anybody ever tell you there's a lot of stuff
in it you shouldn't be breathing?''' Murray said. At the time,
Murray was already having trouble with his breathing. Shortly after
that, the company enrolled him in its corporate asbestos-screening
program.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1992 with a clean bill of health from the
company's screening program.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen days later, a high-resolution CAT scan revealed a tumor
on his lung. He and his doctors believed the tumor was
asbestos-related, but Ford rejected his claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `You were OK when you left here,''' Walker recalled
bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next three years, his lungs showed clear signs of
asbestosis. Today, he uses medication to ease his breathing, and
tries not to think about his close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just lucky the cancer hadn't gone anyplace,'' he said.
``I dodged a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   CAT scan disadvantages
</P>
<P>
   But Brodkin says the ultimate value of CAT-scan detection
remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The standard five-year survival rate for lung cancer is about 5
percent. High-resolution CAT scans for detecting tumors caused by
asbestos have been in use for only about the past six years, so
it's too early to know whether their use will improve the survival
rate, Brodkin said.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a downside to their use. Scarred lungs are difficult
to read, even with CAT scans, he said. Scanning for tumors, doctors
may get more false positives, which could lead them to do
unwarranted invasive procedures.
</P>
<P>
   CAT scans have other limitations as well. They don't necessarily
help pick up malignant mesothelioma, an asbestos-induced cancer of
the lining of the lungs or stomach. Mesothelioma is difficult to
detect, and by the time people have symptoms (such as pain in the
chest), the disease is already advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most dismal of prognoses,'' Brodkin said. ``It's
non-treatable and it's fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   High-resolution CAT scans could have another significant
benefit, however. They could lead to earlier diagnosis of
asbestosis, or scarring of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 percent of asbestosis is picked up by the general
medical community, said Dr. Lonnie Joe, president of the Detroit
Medical Society and a pulmonologist at Providence Hospital in
Southfield, Mich. ``As a result, much asbestos disease is
undertreated or not treated at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Early asbestosis diagnosis allows patients to avoid further
asbestos exposure, or other lung irritants, and lets them get
started on regular cancer screening.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional toll
</P>
<P>
   Devastating physical illness isn't the only fallout from
asbestos disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychological and emotional aspects can be as debilitating
as the physical ones,'' said Dr. Bernard Kole, a psychiatrist at
Providence Hospital in Michigan, who sees a large number of
patients with asbestosis and related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``People lose their place in life,'' he said. ``They lose their
stature. They have loss of function, loss of occupational status.
Depression is common.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes their relationship with family and friends. It can
cause social isolation. And the economic burden of it is
tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wolfe is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   He is only 46, but sometimes he feels like an old man. Wolfe
started working for Hitachi near Detroit in 1976. By 1985, he'd
worked his way up to a job in the foundry's ``demag and blast''
area. He loaded parts into steel trays lined with asbestos as part
of a demagnetization process.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people I worked with had emphysema and asthma,'' he
said. ``Most of the people who were old enough to retire died
within two to three years (after retirement.)''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't imagine his own ``retirement'' would come at age 35.
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed with asbestosis in 1986. In 1988, he was barely
able to breathe and was hospitalized for six months. He weighed 186
pounds when he went in. By the time he came out, he weighed 128.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told him he'd need a lung transplant to survive. He's
needed two.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, his breathing is labored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I take a breath, it's like sandpaper on a wooden
block,'' he said. ``It feels like a vise.''
</P>
<P>
   His illness has robbed him of his youth and family life. ``It's
been tough on the kids,'' he said, wiping away tears. ``I couldn't
go anywhere because I was tied to the oxygen tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbut wishes there were something else he could do for Wolfe
and others like him.
</P>
<P>
   He's asked the American Trial Lawyers Association, whose members
represent many patients in claims against asbestos companies, to
set up a fund for the study of improved treatment and diagnosis of
asbestos-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting rich off my patients,'' he said. So far he's
had no response.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, litigation continues to be an occupational
hazard for doctors, such as Harbut, who treat a lot of patients
with asbestos-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Harbut tries not to take on patients involved in lawsuits.
Nevertheless, he gets about 15 subpoenas a week for workers
compensation or legal cases involving his patients.
</P>
<P>
   But Harbut takes it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obligated to stick up for my patients,'' he said. ``That's
my job.''

50 YEARS LATER, PAYING THE PRICE FOR WORKING WITH ASBESTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (With ASBESTOS-TREATMENT and ASBESTOS-MAHANEY)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Asbestos is a patient killer.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the deadly fibers often don't start showing up
for 30 to 40 years after exposure, so the threat may seem remote to
workers and consumers who may be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   But for Richard Hammond, 69, the risk has become reality.
</P>
<P>
   As a young laborer in 1951 and 1952, Hammond worked at a
Portland vermiculite expansion plant that processed ore from the
mine in Libby, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's paying for it. His lung capacity is only half what
it was 11 years ago. He coughs up blood. Several times, his family
has had to call 911 as he gasped for breath. The first time it
happened, ``I literally couldn't get a breath,'' said Hammond. ``It
scared me to death almost.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors attributed quite a bit of it (the heart attack) to
the lungs,'' he said. With scar tissue in about one-third of his
lungs, his heart had to strain to get enough oxygen to his body.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond would never have guessed his job shoveling wheelbarrows
full of vermiculite into hoppers would make him so sick.
</P>
<P>
   The mica-like vermiculite ore was heated and ``popped'' like
popcorn, then used in a variety of products, including insulation,
packing material and acoustical plaster.
</P>
<P>
   But the ore the plant used was contaminated with tremolite, a
particularly lethal form of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   No one was told to wear a respirator, he says, and no one
thought of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Especially not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hammond, better known in Seattle as ``Mama Blue,'' a
longtime Seattle Seahawks fan, used to wash his clothes in a
wringer washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd shake the clothes outside first,'' she said. ``There'd be
a cloud of dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then she's been plagued with ``walking pneumonias'' and
other breathing problems several times a year. Doctors always
attributed it to hair spray from her years of working as a
beautician.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna get checked for asbestosis next time I go to the
doctor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither one of them is letting the threat of asbestos get to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our golden age,'' Patricia joked. ``You're supposed to
do a lot of traveling. I didn't know it was all gonna be through
911.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hammond is more philosophical. ``You've got to die of
something,'' he said with a still-hearty laugh.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors have given him inhalers to help open his airways,
but they say that's about all they can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the heartless part about that asbestos thing,'' he
said. ``There really isn't any treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he and Patricia wait and hope for the best. His
latest round of tests for lung cancer were clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy to hear that,'' she said. ``It gives us a little
breathing room.''

 &HT;    Falcons may reconsider 'best-player-available' theory
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nathan Davis did nothing to leave his mark on the
field in his brief career with the Atlanta Falcons. But he will be
on the minds of team officials, nonetheless, when the NFL draft
begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With no first-round pick, Falcons coach Dan Reeves concedes that
his team probably will scrap the best-available-player approach and
instead draft to fill a need in the 37th spot.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is the Falcons' biggest draft flop since Reeves was hired
in 1997. The former Indiana University defensive tackle, a ``need
pick,'' dressed for two games that season and did not make a
tackle. He quit on the first day of training camp in 1998, tried to
rejoin the team, and was waived. In his senior season at Indiana,
Davis suffered a serious and documented tear of a tendon in his
pelvis. The injury kept him from working out when he joined the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It became an excuse for a player whose weight ballooned while
his work ethic and will to compete disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the Falcons' scouting department, which underwent
change in 1997, suggested that Davis was worth a fourth-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had seen some of the warning flags with Nathan Davis, we
never would have taken him,'' Reeves said. ``Our research wasn't as
good as it should have been. What you saw (on film) were flashes of
a guy who made some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' director of college player personnel, Reed Johnson,
has a slightly different memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Need is an ominous word,'' Johnson said. ``With Nathan Davis,
there was a need factor there. There were hints of what would
happen, although I don't think anyone could have anticipated
someone being so not willing to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like watching a baby throw a tantrum. I had to leave
the field twice; I couldn't watch.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 draft, the Falcons appear to need the most on the
offensive line and at running back, where four players are
rehabilitating knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the draft is perhaps deepest in offensive
linemen. Reeves on Tuesday described linemen as ``the most
important part of your offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson mentioned several top offensive linemen who could be
available _ Todd Wade (6 feet 7 3/4, 325 pounds) of Mississippi,
Marvel Smith (6-4 7/8, 320) of Arizona State, Michael Thompson (6-4
1/2, 305) of Tennessee State.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include Adrian Klemm (6-4, 308) of Hawaii
and Darnell Alford (6-4, 355) of Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves declined to confirm his team's greatest needs, but he
conceded that his team's strategy Saturday probably will be a
little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your needs always influence the best-player-available
(theory),'' Reeves said. ``At some point in the draft, and it
usually comes pretty early, you go past the best player available.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, with where we're going in the draft, that's
where you start looking for the best player available at a position
of need. Of course, you never want to pass up a player, regardless
of position, if you think he's sure to play and be a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some top running backs who figure to be available in the second
round, and even in the third, are J.R. Redmond (5-11 1/2, 210) of
Arizona, Travis Prentice (5-11 1/2, 220) of Miami-Ohio, Sammy
Morris (5-1 3/4, 222) of Texas Tech, Reuben Droughns (5-11 1/4,
210) of Oregon, Doug Chapman (5-10, 210) of Marshall and Curtis
Keaton (5-10, 214) of James Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a bunch of players at different positions bunched
in a group (on the draft board),'' Reeves said, ``you'd better not
pass on a player you're sure about, even if he's rated lower,
rather than take a (higher-rated) player you have questions about.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think you should ever pass on a really good
running back.''

 &HT;    S.C. legislators to begin flag debte
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soren Dresch loves the ripple effect of South Carolina's
Confederate battle flag debate. The bluster's been great for
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd guess sales are up tenfold in the past three months,''
said Dresch, who owns the Ruffin Flag Co. in Crawfordville, Ga.,
between Atlanta and Augusta. ``This has really sparked interest.''
</P>
<P>
   He supplies South Carolina legislators with battle flags.
Lawmakers sell the banners to constituents who request them. The
former human resources major also supplies the Sons of Confederate
Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so far behind in orders it's ridiculous,'' Dresch said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dresch's heart _ not to mention his flags _ will be
aflutter: Leaders in South Carolina's state Senate expect to debate
a bill that would remove the controversial Civil War flag from atop
the Statehouse dome, where it's flown beneath the U.S. and state
flags since 1962. As supporters from both sides fill the Senate
gallery today, the eyes of the old Confederacy from Jackson to
Richmond will be fixed on Columbia looking for a clue what might
come next.
</P>
<P>
   The next full-fledged bouts could be in Georgia and Mississippi,
where there's already been political sparring. Both states use the
battle insignias in their state flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defenders of the flag claim, and I think they may be
right, that this is the camel's nose,'' said John Shelton Reed, a
Southern historian at the University of North Carolina. ``If they
lose this, then the fight moves to somewhere else. So, no
surrender, no retreat is the line they're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the NAACP has tried to remove a plaque of the
Confederate battle flag on a wall at the state Supreme Court
building in Austin. In Alabama, a state legislator is fighting to
remove the slogan ``The Heart of Dixie'' from state license plates.
Last year in Iowa, the state speaker of the House complained to the
transportation department when he saw a battle flag flying at an
interstate work site.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson, Miss., city council last week voted to remove the
state flag, which contains the Confederate battle emblem, from the
council chambers. The next day, angry legislators voted against a
bill that would have helped Jackson fix its storm sewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the opinion of a lot of legislators the city of Jackson
has taken the first step of seceding from the state by banning the
state flag,'' said state Rep. Mark Formby (R-Picayune).
</P>
<P>
   In Pensacola, Fla., city manager Tom Bonfield decided in January
to head off trouble. Nicknamed the ``City of Five Flags,''
Pensacola for years has flown the battle emblem along with the
flags of the U.S., France, Great Britain and Spain. When civil
rights leaders during Super Bowl week in Atlanta began demanding a
change in the Georgia flag, Bonfield ordered Pensacola's battle
flags replaced by the first national flag of the Confederacy, the
so-called Stars and Bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt it was a matter of time before that issue came up
in Pensacola,'' Bonfield said. ``Barely a week goes by before
there's another city that deals with that. So for those cities that
have had some reason to fly a version of the Confederate flag, I
think the South Carolina debate is going to be something to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, there's been hopeful talk of compromise.
State senators begin debate around 11 a.m. today and may stay
through the weekend. If the Senate passes a flag bill, it goes to
the House, which then will be pressed by a fast-approaching
adjournment June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Today's debate will be the first time this year state lawmakers
officially have debated the issue. So far, the public fight over
the blood-red battle emblem marked by a deep blue ``X'' with 13
stars has been fought by marches, protests and
counterdemonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Flag proponents, most of them white, say the insignia represents
the heroic heritage of their Civil War ancestors. Black civil
rights groups, most notably the NAACP, claim the battle design is a
reminder of past oppression.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, the NAACP launched a boycott of South Carolina's
$14.6 billion tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the flag was simply a symbol that was tied exclusively to
the Civil War, then I think the debate might be a lot less
passionate,'' said Jim Cobb, a past president of the Southern
Historical Society and current head of the history department at
the University of Georgia. ``But because the issues there are not
quite as clear as the issue of the flag being the symbol of the
Klan, the American Nazi Party... the banner of the Dixiecrats,
there's just no getting around that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate has come down to almost a question of absolutes.
You either lock heels or give up.''

ASBESTIOSIS VICTIM RUNNING OUT OF MONEY AND TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (With ASBESTOS-TREATMENT and ASBESTOS-HAMMOND)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Wash. _ Bill Mahaney, 82, looks as fit as a jockey at
his morning post in the Quarter Chute Cafe at Emerald Downs
racetrack, south of Seattle. But a hidden killer keeps him from
riding the way he once did.
</P>
<P>
   Mahaney, a longtime horse owner, was diagnosed with asbestosis
in 1988 from decades of working in shipyards and as a lumber-mill
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   He still has the heart for horses, but he doesn't have the lungs
to train them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He watches from the sidelines, giving his hired trainers advice
from decades of equine experience. He can't even walk the horses
himself anymore, something he's done since he was 16 and would
``hot walk'' horses for a nickel to cool them down when Longacres,
the predecessor to Emerald Downs, first opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose your air, and a horse will pull you around,'' he
said. ``You can't lead him. He'll try to stomp on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Horses are Mahaney's first love and second career. A lifelong
sheetmetal worker and later supervisor, Mahaney started 60 years
ago at the Bremerton Navy Yard where he helped remodel destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I covered the boilers with asbestos all over those tin cans,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was killer dust everywhere. Only he didn't know it then.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't see that chair over there for the white dust,''
he said, waving to the seat across from him at the regular table in
the track cafe where he has his breakfast every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never gave us breathers (respirators) or told us anything
about it. This was the late '30s and you didn't dare say much
anyway. You were lucky you had a job.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bremerton, he spent several decades doing sheet-metal work
in lumber mills. He wrapped steam pipes at the mills in asbestos
insulation, working as a mill superintendent all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Today, medication to help ease his breathing runs about $300 a
month, he said. He uses a pump-driven inhaler morning and night,
and a hand-held inhaler throughout the day whenever his chest
constricts and he has to gasp for air. He takes several different
types of pills, including the powerful steroid prednisone, and is
constantly battling side effects from the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Makes me mad, because they (the defense contractors) knew it
would kill us,'' he said. ``But you can't sue the government. I
think the government should have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The asbestos companies have paid some, but the amount that
eventually trickled down to Mahaney wasn't much.
</P>
<P>
   His last settlement was $1,000 from Celotex, an asbestos
company. After attorneys, court fees, and reimbursing the state
industrial board for money it paid him for his illness, he netted
$116.40.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, he figures he's netted less than $15,000 from total
payments of nearly $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawyers _ they're the only ones making any money from
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he's running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   When he could still train horses himself, he could clear $17,000
a year above the $15,000 per year it costs to run a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's got one horse left, ``Krystey's Colleen,'' a
three-year-old he plans to run this year.
</P>
<P>
   He lost another couple of horses to broken legs. One had a
hairline fracture, and after a few seasons tried to make a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``A split won't heal,'' he said. ``She was never the same.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that way with asbestos, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my doctor how I get out of this,'' he said. ``He says,
`You die.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Krystey's Colleen is likely to be his last horse. But he plans
to keep coming down to the track as long as he's able.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for those horses, I'd be dead,'' he said. ``They
keep me breathing.''

THE LATER THE HOUR, THE MORE REFLECTIVE CLINTON GETS
</HEADLINE>
  By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is after hours, away from the White House, that
Bill Clinton loosens up.
</P>
<P>
   With no prepared text, his words flow more freely than during
daylight. One minute, he is talking of Pokemon cards or the best
love song of the last 25 years. The next, how he almost lost his
job as president. He abandons the cautious verbiage he uses from 9
to 5, sometimes lashing out at political opponents with the
ferocity of a behind-in-the-polls candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for instance, has never acknowledged publicly that he
feared he might become the first president in history to be removed
from office _ until, that is, he took the stage of a church in
Louisiana on Saturday night and suggested, in a deeply emotional
way, just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, for a period of time _ a day or two at least _ was some
question about whether I would finish my term,'' Clinton told
members of a Pentecostal church in Alexandria, La., bringing up a
matter he does not typically bring up anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his presidency, Clinton has let his guard down
somewhat in his evening remarks. But in the twilight of his
presidency, with fewer big policy events on his schedule and more
late-night fund-raisers, Clinton's reflective side emerges more
often.
</P>
<P>
   Every presidential speech is recorded and transcribed, even
remarks uttered off the cuff. But the gaggle of reporters tracking
him thins after dark, sometimes to a lonely scribe. And the only
television camera at such moments is often operated by military
personnel collecting footage for the archives.
</P>
<P>
   The settings of Clinton's evening remarks are also more
conducive to casual chatter: the dining room of a big donor, the
back of Air Force One, a remote country church.
</P>
<P>
   And the later the hour, it seems, the looser the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was pushing midnight, White House time, when Clinton took the
stage at the Pentecostals of Alexandria after a rousing performance
of the ``Messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   The president stood alongside a pastor he has known for years
and a group of former drug addicts and convicts who had reassembled
their lives through religion. Clinton said he had cried throughout
the performance, which portrayed the life and death of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of reporters sitting in the balcony, the
president brought up his own ordeal in impromptu remarks. He said
the Rev. Anthony Mangun and his wife had visited him during the
heat of the impeachment furor, dropping off a recording of an
uplifting song and some biblical readings. He said the gifts helped
him get through the tough times.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled that the pastor had told him he was not sure
how the scandal would end, but he vowed to stand by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said: `I know you. You are my friend. We have raised our
children together. I love you. I was here when you were going up.
If the ship starts to sink and other people start to bail out, you
call me. I want to go down with you,''' Clinton said
</P>
<P>
   Then he gave Mangun a bear hug.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the president's remarks, of course, are quite that
touchy-feely. Sometimes, after a long day of policy talk, Clinton
seems to relish speaking of nothing weightier than his favorite
movies. He is known to drop in on reporters in the rear of the
presidential jetliner and make movie recommendations for the
flight. Unlike a commercial airline, which picks the movie,
passengers in each cabin in Air Force One choose from a menu of
more than a dozen films.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent fund-raiser in New York, Clinton seemed proud of the
fact that he was in on one of the current crazes among children _
Pokemon cards. The young son of a political supporter gave him some
cards, which he passed along to a very appreciative nephew.
</P>
<P>
   At another New York gathering, Clinton called ``Evergreen'' the
best love song of the last quarter century after Luther Vandross
sang it for him at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the evening Clinton began his most spirited attacks
to date on the opponents of his wife and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In news conferences, Clinton avoids getting too involved in
Hillary Rodham Clinton's race for a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
But at a recent weekend fund-raiser in Washington, he said his wife
was being targeted by a ``right-wing venom machine'' allied with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way they could win is to convince them that we're the
first cousins of space aliens,'' Clinton told members of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Gore's presumed opponent to
succeed Clinton, has also been the subject of Clinton's needling.
Clinton criticized Bush at a New York fund-raiser for his positions
on abortion, hate crimes legislation and tax cuts. He also
criticized Bush for going to Bob Jones University in South Carolina
and not speaking out against its views on Roman Catholics and
inter-racial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has begun revealing in some talks that he is a betting
man. To make the point that his administration has eliminated
government programs without causing disruption, he has bet members
of audiences in recent speeches _ anywhere from $5 to $10,000 _ to
name three such discontinued programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've eliminated hundreds of programs, and I will give anyone
here the ticket price here, I'll give you your money back if you
can stand up right now and name three of them,'' Clinton said on
Saturday at a $10,000-a-person fund-raiser at a private home
outside New Orleans. ``Any takers?''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has ever collected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides sometimes squirm when he begins free-associating,
nervous that he might be so exhausted or unguarded that he will
unintentionally make news.
</P>
<P>
   Many aides still remember a late-night fund-raiser in Texas in
Clinton's first term in which he ad-libbed about how he had raised
taxes too much in his 1993 budget bill, a comment that prompted a
firestorm among Democrats who had risked their political futures to
back him.
</P>
<P>
   There had to be concern last week when Clinton, visibly
exhausted, began speaking at a fund-raiser in San Francisco after a
grueling 19-hour day.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Garen and Shari Staglin, Napa Valley vintners and
longtime Democratic contributors, the president said, ``I thank the
Staglins for co-hosting this event, and for the wine _ which I
could not resist tasting, even though I have been up since 3 a.m.
your time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he gave what turned out to be a run-of-the-mill, if
somewhat rambling, speech.

REVIVING THE HIGH LIFE, IN THE CHRYSLER BUILDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been 21 years since the last meal was served
here and the last ice-filled glasses clinked to good fortune. Since
then, the Cloud Club in the Chrysler Building, the onetime playroom
of Walter P. Chrysler and his fellow moguls, has been ravaged by
time, neglect, water and vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   But the wide bronze-and-marble staircase is still there and the
view through the arch of the two-story-high window, 67 floors up,
still gazes south over a bustling, energetic city.
</P>
<P>
   So why are restaurateurs not down on their knees in the
building's landmark lobby, begging for the chance to breathe new
life into the Cloud Club?
</P>
<P>
   ``New York doesn't lack for good restaurants,'' said Bernard
Goldberg, whose Gotham Hospitality Group was one of the finalists
in the bidding for the Chrysler Building in 1997. But a private
lunch club there would probably succeed, he added, if much of its
elegance was restored and the room was used at night for wedding
receptions and other private parties.
</P>
<P>
   Tishman Speyer Properties, a co-owner of the Chrysler Building,
said it preferred having a restaurant in that lofty space, but
would not turn down other tenants, including those who would use
the three floors as office space. In the meantime, construction
workers have been toiling in the dust and jumble of the 66th, 67th
and 68th floors, just below the Chrysler Building's stainless steel
pinnacle, trying to undo the effects of years of abandonment on the
Cloud Club's faded glory.
</P>
<P>
   The club opened in July 1930 as a private retreat for male
executives. The Chrysler Building itself had formally opened on May
28 of that year at the northeast corner of 42nd Street and
Lexington Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the building and the club was William Van Alen,
who was born in Brooklyn and graduated from the Ecole des
Beaux-Arts in Paris. Before designing the Chrysler Building, he had
designed the Childs restaurant at 604 Fifth Avenue, at 49th Street,
among other notable buildings. But Van Alen, who died in 1954,
never enjoyed anywhere near the fame of his greatest creation.
</P>
<P>
   For many years the Cloud Club was the outpost for such movers
and shakers as Chrysler; E.F. Hutton; Juan Trippe, the founder of
Pan American World Airways, and Conde Nast, the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The club's elite reputation lasted another four decades, as
evidenced by a roster that as late as 1971 comprised 300 members
from 180 corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Members enjoyed use of the club's amenities: a Tudor-style
paneled lounge, a humidor for cigars from around the world, a
wood-paneled bar and (a necessity during Prohibition) private
locker boxes where members stashed liquor supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The club was known for its black bean soup, Dover sole and
bread-and-butter pudding. It served melons grown on a member's farm
upstate, as well as ``No. 18'' pink grapefruit. Falco Witekamp, an
official with the Florida Department of Citrus, said that No. 18s
were ``huge, huge, huge; more than twice as big as any grapefruit
you're likely to find in a supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chrysler Building began as a speculative venture by
William H. Reynolds, a former New York State senator, the entire
project was bought by Chrysler, who added touches like the
stainless-steel eagle heads that extend from the corners on the
61st floor, and the winged ornaments, on the building's lower
setbacks, that were modeled on the radiator caps of 1920s Chrysler
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought to the project a determination to make it the
world's tallest building, a goal also coveted by the Bank of
Manhattan, which was under construction at the same time at 40 Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler Building, 1,046 feet, won bragging rights, but held
them for only 11 months, until the 1,250-foot Empire State Building
opened on May 1, 1931. (Today the Chrysler Building is 19th
tallest, the Empire State Building 9th, according to the Council on
Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat at Lehigh University.)
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, corporations were leaving the city, and the Cloud
Club faced competition from some three dozen private executive
lunch clubs, including the Sky Club on the 56th floor of the nearby
Pan Am building, to which Trippe had defected in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, four years after the Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Co. acquired the building in a foreclosure proceeding,
the club closed for good. But it has remained a fixture of New York
folklore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard all kinds of rumors, including that Walter
Chrysler's ashes are up there,'' said Valerie Peltier, senior
director of Tishman Speyer Properties.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Jerry I. Speyer, the president of Tishman Speyer, was taken to
the club by his father in the late 1940s and was so infatuated with
the view that he remembers having said at the time, ``I never want
to leave here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Tishman Speyer and the Travelers Group bought
the Chrysler Building for $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   Various attempts in the early 1980s to fill the three floors
with everything from a nightclub to a disco to a lunch club for
bankers foundered, and the slump in office rentals in the early
1990s further discouraged prospects. Today, by contrast, Manhattan
office space is at a premium. So it is hard to argue that the Cloud
Club should continue to stand as a time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   But the restoration of the space has drawn the wrath of the Art
Deco Society of New York, which said last month that Tishman Speyer
had ``substantially destroyed'' the Cloud Club's ``historically
significant interiors.''
</P>
<P>
   Tishman Speyer refused entry to a New York Times photographer,
saying that with the former Cloud Club under construction, pictures
would probably give a misleading impression of the condition of the
rooms. But Peltier said the Art Deco Society's charges were untrue,
and pointed out that the Cloud Club, unlike the Chrysler Building's
facade and lobby, was not a designated landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was little worth restoring when we bought it, except for
the spectacular views,'' she said, ``but we're saving what's of
historical value.''
</P>
<P>
   Tishman Speyer replaced the cracked pane in that large dining
room window. It removed the huge mural of Manhattan painted on
canvas by Gardner Hale, and will soon decide where to donate it. It
left intact a mural, painted directly on a wall, that Peltier
described as ``an oil refinery, with machines and a truck with the
Texaco sign painted on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners also removed from Walter Chrysler's private dining
room on the 67th floor t(e bas-relief figures of auto workers,
including chemists, draftsmen, machinists, painters and, if the
rumors are to be believed, even Chrysler himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We restored them and put them in crates,'' Peltier said, ``and
are awaiting their rebirth in the walkway between the Chrysler
Building and the East Building.'' (The Chrysler Building and the
32-story East Building, formerly the Kent Building, make up what
was recently named the Chrysler Center.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the most ardent fans of the Cloud Club and the Chrysler
Building is Dr. Charles M. Weiss, a dentist who has had offices in
the building for more than 30 years and recently signed a lease for
eight more years. For about a decade, Weiss rented the 56th floor,
which had been Chrysler's oak-paneled office, complete with private
kitchen and bath. Weiss' current floors, 69 and 70, were once
Chrysler's private gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Weiss keeps a scrapbook in his office full of rare
photographs, postcards and articles about the building and the
club. Weiss said many of his patients took cameras with them on
appointments. ``And if they come up here and it's cloudy,'' he
added, ``many of them ask if they can reschedule their appointment
for another day.''

CLINTON TAKES GUN-CONTROL EFFORT TO THE STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Wadhams is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unable to persuade Congress to pass gun-control
legislation, President Clinton is taking his campaign to the
states, urging them to impose safety latches, background checks,
and other restrictions on gun use.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis of state gun-related legislation shows that
Clinton's success has been spotty, at best. And the governor of
Colorado, where Clinton is traveling Wednesday, doesn't think the
president's appearance will help in passing a gun-control
referendum, said Dick Wadhams, spokesman for Colorado Governor Bill
Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's visit politicizes the Columbine tragedy,''
said Wadhams, referring to the school shooting last April 20.
``What President Clinton wants to do is to come to Colorado for a
political rally to draw attention to his effort to influence the
Republicans in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadhams said Owens, a Republican, would have preferred that
Clinton come to his state next week, for one of the memorials
marking the first anniversary of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, once an adamant foe of gun control, backs passage of a
state referendum that would require background checks of people who
buy weapons at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   But ``President Clinton has some very high negatives'' in
Colorado voter polls, Wadhams said. ``The fact is, his presence
might actually hurt the initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been invited to ``a slew'' of Columbine memorials
next week, but decided to attend Wednesday's rally ``so this type
of tragedy won't happen again,'' said White House spokesman Jake
Siewert. ``The president's not running for anything. But he can
focus on issues that affect the American family.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few states, Clinton and gun-control advocates have had some
success in passing restrictions, according to the Arlington,
Va.-based firm StateScape, which tracks state legislation. But foes
of gun control have been far more successful, keeping anti-gun
legislation stalled in committee and passing legislation that
protects the industry, said John Grant, a StateScape legislative
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun-control people are not getting what they want,'' Grant
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the gun-control side, California last year passed a series of
gun restrictions. Massachusetts recently instituted restrictions on
new handguns sold in the state, requiring them to have tamper-proof
serial numbers, trigger locks, and other safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   But the Massachusetts rules were not imposed by legislation.
Attorney General Thomas Reilly was able to regulate the guns
without legislative approval, instead using the state's consumer
protection law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Tuesday traveled to Annapolis, Md., to attend the
signing ceremony for the Responsible Gun Safety Act of 2000, which
imposes new safety requirements on firearms sold in Marlyland. It
was the first time the president has attended a signing for a state
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the United States Congress is paying attention to
this event today,'' Clinton said after Maryland Governor Parris
Glendening signed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But in many more states, it has been the National Rifle
Association that has been winning over legislatures. The group and
their supporters have been overwhelmingly successful in getting
laws passed that prohibit cities from suing gun manufacturers
without the consent of their state legislatures, which tend to be
more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the laws go further in the area of tort reform,
protecting gun makers from lawsuits that would hold them liable for
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is critical because it goes straight to the
heart of the gun maker's business: the ability to sell weapons. It
also puts a crimp in a strategy employed by gun-control advocates
to force firearms manufacturers to adopt safety restrictions
voluntarily, or else face a lengthy, expensive court battle.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing cities to sue manufacturers ``sets a very bad
precedent'' that could encourage other such lawsuits against a
range of industries, said NRA spokesman James D. Manown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've closed the City Hall door to gun-control advocates,''
said Joe Sudbay, political director of Handgun Control Inc., based
in Washington. ``Now they're trying to close the courthouse doors
to the cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 14 states passed such ``lawsuit pre-emption'' laws last
year; Utah adopted the law in March; Virginia and Kentucky adopted
the rule this month, and in two states _ Colorado and Idaho _ the
bill is awaiting the governor's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Wadhams said Owens had not yet decided whether he would sign the
Colorado bill.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous other states, bills imposing background checks,
minimum age requirements, and even prohibiting the sale of
ammunition to intoxicated people are languishing in committee,
Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado initiative arose because the legislature refused to
pass some gun restrictions Owens pushed after the Columbine
massacre. That is typical in a state where there is not a large
urban population, Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   But gun-control advocates insist that where legislatures
disappoint them, the people will come through for gun restrictions.
``Just put it on a ballot,'' Sudbay said, ``and we'll win.''

   ASBESTOS-TREATMENT (Undated) _ For decades, patients who
contracted asbestosis were told there was nothing medical science
could do for them. You lingered for years while your lungs scarred
over. Eventually, you suffocated. Although millions of dollars have
been poured into asbestos litigation on all sides, and although
companies and unions have invested countless hours in asbestos
screenings, almost no money has gone into investigating treatments
or better ways to manage asbestos disease.

</P>
<P>
   ASBESTOS-HAMMOND (Seattle) _ The effects of deadly asbestos
fibers often don't start showing up for 30 to 40 years after
exposure, so the threat may seem remote to workers and consumers
who may be at risk. But for Richard Hammond, 69, the risk has
become reality.

   By Carol Smith. (Story has moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   ASBESTOS-MAHANEY (Auburn, Wash.) _ Bill Mahaney, a longtime
horse owner, was diagnosed with asbestosis in 1988 from decades of
working in shipyards and as a lumber-mill supervisor. He still has
the heart for horses, but he doesn't have the lungs to train them
anymore.

</P>
<P>
   COCKPIT-CAMERAS (Undated) _ The National Transportation Safety
Board recommends that the FAA require cameras, not just voice
recorders, in cockpits. Pilots have fought moves in that direction
saying it violates their privacy and worry the tapes could show up
in the media as a plane goes down. But the safety board says the
cameras could provide valuable details on the cause of many
crashes.

   It's important to get opportunities, to see them and to take
them. It's also important to see that other people get
opportunities, too.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't grow up with a silver spoon by any stretch. My dad, an
auto mechanic, was from the Oneida Indian Nation, and my mother,
who was a teaching assistant in a local school, was from the
Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians, and they kind of raised
us in the middle, in Shawano, Wis. The town was predominantly
white, with Native American all around. I've always felt
comfortable in both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   I have eight siblings. My older sister Carol and I are the only
ones of the kids who went to college and graduate school. She's a
college professor. I don't know why we accomplished what we did,
but we somehow got the message that we needed to do something to
get out of the environment unless we wanted to repeat the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   I got lucky when I was 14 or so _ I got invited to join Upward
Bound, a government program for poor kids with some potential. I
got to be with other kids like myself. I got to see some successful
people, and I got some coaching. It got me to college. The Rev.
Jerry Thompson, who headed the program, is one of the biggest
influences in my life. He was a cheerleader and a spiritual leader
and a father figure. He particularly liked beating us at
racquetball.
</P>
<P>
   After college, I went to work for IBM, where my sister Carol was
working. She got me the job _ no, she got me the interview; I got
me the job, stocking computer parts. The big thing for me was to
work for IBM; I didn't care what job. I soon got the opportunity to
get a job as a computer repairman in Milwaukee. I didn't have any
experience, but I somehow got tabbed as a guy who could succeed.
Eventually, I got into management.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was great to me, and I was great to IBM. It was a great
marriage. But in my 20th year there, I realized I wasn't going to
be chairman. I decided to seek out more opportunity, and I wanted
to come back and work with my people. The timing was right, too:
IBM was downsizing, and they offered a silver parachute, so to
speak. I had a few dollars in my pocket and I was unemployed, so I
went back to school and got my master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   I was living in Boulder, Colo., and took a summer driving trip
with my son, seeing baseball games along the way. In Wisconsin, we
came to see family, too. One thing led to another, and soon I got a
job with the Oneida tribe as director of the enterprise division.
</P>
<P>
   Indian gaming came to town in the early 1980s, and things had
changed dramatically. For the better? Yes and no. It has enabled
many things for some tribes that didn't have anything _ schools,
infrastructure, housing, jobs. But many smaller tribes now have a
new kind of welfare: wealth without having to work. It's worse than
poverty without work.
</P>
<P>
   For my new job at the Treasure Island casino, which is owned by
the Prairie Island Indian Community, I live at the casino hotel in
Red Wing, Minn., during the week. I very much look forward to going
home to Green Bay on Friday. My family saves all my chores, of
course, but I'm a big Packers fan and if there's a game I get to
go.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough being away, but my job is extremely fulfilling. One
of the most fun times I ever had was about two years ago, when I
was the gaming general manager at Oneida. I did a sky dive with the
Flying Elvi _ those entertainers in Elvis costumes. I didn't get a
costume, but I did get pictures.

 &HT;    With diva on her final tour, we take a look at what we'll miss
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only we could all retire like this: with a second home in the
south of France, a Bentley in the three-car garage and profits in
the bank from selling more than 50 million albums over the past 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention legs worth more than all that combined.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. In December, Tina Turner announced that the tour that
stops in Atlanta tonight would be ``the biggest and the best
because it's the last.'' (``I know I have the energy to do it one
more time,'' she said. ``But I don't want to diminish the memory of
my great little dresses, my great legs.'')
</P>
<P>
   As if anything could! So we decided, instead of complaining,
we'll follow the 60-year-old pop singer's example. Hold our heads
up high. And fight back the years as we consider what we'll miss
the most.
</P>
<P>
   The music: Our favorite Tina Turner tape would have to start
with her first single ``A Fool in Love'' (1960). Then ``River Deep,
Mountain High'' (1966), to get things rolling. What next? Oh yeah,
the autobiographical ``Nutbush City Limits'' (1973) and that cover
of Al Green's ``Let's Stay Together'' (1983); followed by ``What's
Love Got to Do With It?'' ``Better Be Good to Me'' and the title
track from her breakthrough solo effort ``Private Dancer'' (1984).
Maybe ``We Don't Need Another Hero'' (1985) from the soundtrack of
the post-apocalyptic Mel Gibson movie ``Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome.'' But definitely, definitely, the last song would be
her remake of Creedence Clearwater Revival's ``Proud Mary'' (1971).
Why? Because we like it rough and easy on one song.
</P>
<P>
   The unforgettable performances: You have to start with that
hip-shaking and fringe-moving Tina did with her backup singers, the
Ikettes, back when the Ike and Tina Turner Revue hit TV _
``American Bandstand,'' to be exact _ in the mid-'60s. And who can
forget the vamp she did with Mick Jagger at 1985's ``Live Aid''
benefit? Her Grammy Awards performance that same year of ``What's
Love Got to Do With It?'' was the big triumph, though. (She also
took home four Grammys). And don't forget the January 1988 show she
did for 182,000 in Rio de Janeiro _ it was the largest paying
audience ever to gather for a single performer, which got her in
the Guiness Book of World Records until 1990, when Paul McCartney
broke her record.
</P>
<P>
   The way she bridged genres: Turner's edge, coupled with her
church upbringing, helped R&AMP;B and rock converge in the '60s and
'70s. In the '80s, she helped create an atmosphere in which those
distinctions didn't matter so much. Before ``Private Dancer,'' she
collaborated with former members of British new wave bands Human
League and Heaven 17. Jeff Beck showed up on ``Private Dancer,''
while that album's title cut was written by Dire Straits frontman
Mark Knopfler. Colorblind and uncategorizable as either rock or
R&AMP;B, it was just good music.
</P>
<P>
   The Ike factor: She left her first husband _ an alleged abuser _
with 36 cents and a gasoline card in her pocket. But she still
credits the formidable guitarist with discovering her when her
older sister Alline refused to sing for his Kings of Rhythm one
night. He also changed Anna Mae Bullock's name to Tina. (Never mind
that he did so because it reminded him of Sheena, queen of the
jungle, from the TV series.) He's also the man behind those
infamous wigs. And by first taking her out on the road in 1960 as
part of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue, Ike can be credited with
officially introducing her to us.
</P>
<P>
   Er, some of the movies: Her turn as the Acid Queen in the '70s
film version of the Who's rock opera ``Tommy'' was a great screen
debut. But that pairing with Mel Gibson as Aunty Entity in ``Mad
Max Beyond the Thunderdome,'' well, hmmm...
</P>
<P>
   And though she personally had a problem with the film adaptation
of her autobiography (``It didn't show my strength,'' Turner told
one newspaper. ``(It) went all `Superfly' into drugs and the
ugliness'') there's no way we can ignore Angela Bassett and
Laurence Fishburne's dynamic performances in ``What's Love Got to
Do With It?''
</P>
<P>
   That accent: So what if she was born in Brownsville, Tenn., and
raised in the city limits of Nutbush. Her primary home has been
overseas for more than a decade (Zurich, with longtime
boyfriend/record executive Erwin Bach) and her speaking voice has
long had the clipped and proper British affectations to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The persona: Tina's arrival in pop music did a whole lot for
women in music at a time when most of them _ particularly black
women _ were of the sweet, production-line, girl group variety.
(The exception, of course, being Aretha Franklin.) Her long hair,
gyrating dance moves and raucous smirk had middle America hot and
bothered, and broke down race barriers with pure seduction. Her
confidence was also attractive to women, who _ particularly in the
'60s _ weren't used to another woman grabbing the microphone by the
collar and giving it a good talking-to.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, those legs: Not only are they insured by Lloyd's
of London for a reported $3.2 million, but in 1996 they snared her
a hefty endorsement contract with hosiery giant Hanes _ and the
envy of younger and older women alike.

SENATE SLAMS BRAKES ON EFFORT TO REPEAL FEDERAL GAS TAX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate turned aside an effort Tuesday to repeal
4.3 cents of the federal gasoline tax, as Republican lawmakers
sought to use the April 17 income tax filing deadline to promote
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax repeal measure failed by a vote of 56-43 in the wake
of the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to increase production, a move that is expected to lower
costs at the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., criticized the vote
as short-sighted, insisting that prices would rise again despite
the OPEC action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that gas prices are going to go up, and in fact we're
going to be more dependent on foreign oil,'' Lott said, calling on
his colleagues to begin working on a comprehensive energy strategy
that will reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not this, what, and if not now, when?'' Lott asked.
``There's a danger here and we need to find a way to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax repeal legislation was the first tax issue to be
brought up this week by Republican leaders who traditionally have
sought to use the annual income tax filing deadline as a way to
focus attention on their calls for lower federal taxes of all
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Before the week is out, Senate Republicans led by Kay Bailey
Hutchison of Texas hope to force a vote on a measure eliminating
the so-called marriage tax penalty, which would cut taxes by an
estimated $248 billion over the next 10 years for qualifying
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas, is trying to focus attention on tax issues in a
series of hearings dealing with alternative proposals to the
current income tax system. The alternatives include a flat tax
measured favored by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and
a national sales tax, which Archer has been pushing for years.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders also planned to hold a series of mostly symbolic
votes on measures that have little chance of becoming law, but will
give Republicans an opportunity to show their support in an
election year for reducing taxes. The measures scheduled for debate
include a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of
Congress to enact any new tax increases, and a measure that would
end the current tax code in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Topping off Republican efforts to highlight tax issues, Senate
Commerce Committee Chairman and former GOP presidential candidate
John McCain of Arizona planned to hold a hearing on a bill that
would extend the moratorium on internet transaction taxes for
another five years.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the airing of different tax measures, the heart of
the Republican effort this week is centered on the marriage rule,
which taxes some married couples filing jointly at a higher rate
than couples with the same income who file separately.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison has practically turned the effort to eliminate the
marriage penalty into a personal crusade, taking the lead on the
issue in the Senate. She called on her colleagues Tuesday to
approve her measure before Congress adjourns for a two-week Easter
holiday recess Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She planned to highlight what she called the ``inequities'' of
the marriage penalty at a news conference Wednesday, complete with
a wedding cake to make her point that couples should not be
penalized for making one of the most important decisions of their
life.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty legislation is just one of several
provisions that were part of the failed $792 billion GOP tax cut
bill that Clinton vetoed last year and are now being recast as
separate measures to put pressure on the Democrats in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats agree that voting against the Hutchison bill
could be a risky move. But Clinton has vowed to veto the measure,
and polls still indicate that most Americans are more interested in
paying down the debt and increasing funding for education and other
important programs than getting a tax break.
</P>
<P>
   That view, coupled with falling gasoline prices, enabled
opponents of the gas tax repeal to turn back an attempt by Lott on
Tuesday to force an up-or-down vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been approved, the bill would have temporarily rolled
back the 4.3 cents of the 18.4 cent federal tax on a gallon of
gasoline through the end of the year. The measure was opposed by
all 45 Democrats and a number of Republicans, who argued that it
would jeopardize the Highway Trust Fund, which uses the gas tax to
help states pay for the upkeep and modernization of the nation's
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have replenished lost trust fund revenues from
this year's estimated budget surpluses. But Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., said that idea would set ``a dangerous precedent'' of trying
to finance programs with surpluses that do not yet exist.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Olympic Games open in Australia this summer,
about 30 athletes will represent Egypt. Sixty will make up the
contingent from Turkey. Eighty will run, jump, swim and play for
Ireland. Nearly 100 will make up the delegation from Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   The company's orange logo will not appear on the the Olympic
athletes' uniforms, of course, and television commentators probably
won't even mention the giant retailer's name. But in cities and
towns around North America, thousands of Home Depot employees will
stay up late to root for the athletes on TV and get up the next
morning to devour the accounts of their exploits in the sports
pages.
</P>
<P>
   That, it turns out, is the audience Home Depot executives are
trying to reach. When a company employs 210,000 people in an
industry with one of the highest turnover rates in the country _ in
the midst of one of the tightest job markets in more than three
decades _ it does what it has to do to hold onto every last one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   So, at a cost of several million dollars, Home Depot has hired
116 Olympic athletes from the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico
_ more than all the other 50 or so companies in the official
Olympic Games jobs program employ combined _ to pace its floors and
advise customers on everything from screws to lawn mowers. It is
using their presence not to increase sales in a national
advertising campaign, but to pump up employee morale.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In this economy, in other words, the imperatives of management
can trump the demands of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has spread the 116 Olympic contenders among its 958
North American stores, where local managers enlist them to motivate
employees and attract new ones. The athletes autograph their
colleagues' aprons, and those who have won medals show them off at
company parties. Company managers point to the athletes as
real-life examples of corporate nostrums like ``going for the
gold'' and ``giving it your all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Hammill, Home Depot's senior vice president for marketing,
who oversees the program from company headquarters in Atlanta, said
of the athletes: ``They're disciplined. They're on time. They work
hard. It rubs off.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Home Depot athletes will fail to qualify for the
Sydney games. But because national Olympic committees require that
athletes be highly ranked in order to participate in the jobs
program, most should qualify, officials said. Ranging from
unheralded rowers and wrestlers to stars like the runner Butch
Reynolds, the athletes work about 20 hours a week for about $400
and spend the rest of their time training.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies in the jobs program, like United Parcel Service,
have run TV ads promoting their athletes to the general public. In
contrast, Home Depot is only now planning its first commercial
starring one of its Olympians _ and the setting is expected to be a
send-off party a store gives to wish good luck to an athlete on the
way to an event.
</P>
<P>
   So intent is Home Depot on finding qualified employees that it
has even made some of its commercials the equivalent of help-wanted
ads. Earlier this year, for example, it began broadcasting a spot
that showed employees and ended with the words, ``The Home Depot.
Great Careers Built Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy. Last year,
McDonald's ran a television ad, set to feel-good music, in which
captions like ``future software engineer'' and ``future elementary
school teacher'' appeared under its young burger flippers. At
Hewlett-Packard, Carleton S. Fiorina, the chief executive, has said
that a primary target of its current television campaign that
describes the company as ``the original start-up'' is the company's
work force, which could be easy pickings for dot-com firms.
</P>
<P>
   A host of companies, including both Home Depot and Microsoft,
are starting to use outdoor billboards to seek job candidates.
Around the country, spending on help-wanted billboards almost
tripled last year, to $16 million, according to the Outdoor
Advertising Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, however, is in a category all its own. At a time
when few skilled workers remain unemployed, it aims to more than
double its current payroll, to nearly 500,000, within four years.
That is a monumental task for a company in a traditional field that
pays entry-level employees about $10 an hour to perform work that
can be both exhausting and repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain the gung-ho workplace culture that many experts say
has helped fuel its remarkable growth, it has had to attack the
great bane of retailers: high employee turnover. For years,
executives have held pep rallies and allowed store managers to
spend the company's charity money on local causes that are often
dear to the hearts of employees. ``It's the internal people that
are the target'' of many Home Depot initiatives, said Frederick F.
Reichheld, a consultant at Bain &AMP; Co. and author of ``The Loyalty
Effect'' (Harvard Business School Press, 1996) who has studied the
company.
</P>
<P>
   That is the rationale behind the company's Olympic sponsorship.
The retailer paid $40 million to sign up as a sponsor eight years
ago, when Atlanta was getting ready to be host of the 1996 Summer
Olympics and the company was expanding across the country, Hammill
said. By the time the Atlanta games opened, Home Depot had more
than 90 American athletes on its payroll. Combining results from
the Atlanta games and the 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics, its
athletes have won 16 gold medals, six silvers and nine bronzes _
more medals in the four-year span than Belgium, Denmark or Britain
has brought home. In the last two years, the company has created
similar versions of the jobs program in Canada and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   For all the glory that the Home Depot athletes aspire to, they
follow a pretty ordinary workplace routine. On a recent Wednesday,
27-year-old Derek Mills, a runner, spent the morning and early
afternoon stocking shelves and answering questions in the
electrical department of the store in Alpharetta, Ga., an Atlanta
suburb. Wearing his orange Home Depot apron with ``Hi, I'm Derek''
emblazoned in the upper right corner, he paused at one point to
tell a colleague using a forklift that he was about to bump against
a ceiling lamp and send a stack of outdoor barbecue grills tumbling
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   There was little to suggest that Mills was the owner of a gold
medal for the 1996 400-meter relay _ until one of his colleagues
walked by and said, ``Hey, Speedy!''
</P>
<P>
   The nickname is apt, in more ways than one. Within an hour,
Mills was driving 25 miles to a training session on the campus of
Georgia Tech, where he received an engineering degree in 1995. The
next day, he was crossing the Atlantic, off to Glasgow, Scotland,
for an indoor track and field competition.
</P>
<P>
   Like other athletes in the Olympic jobs program, Mills continues
drawing his pay when he is on the road. It is a perquisite that
participants, injury-prone and financially strapped as many of them
are, greatly treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, for example, has suffered nagging hamstring and Achilles'
tendon injuries over the last three years, making it more difficult
for him to earn appearance fees at track meets. ``It's not the
early stages for my career anymore,'' he said ruefully.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For athletes in less lucrative sports, the wages can make an
even bigger difference. ``I would not be training if I didn't have
this job; it's too much of a struggle,'' said Julia Chilicki, 28, a
rower who was in the 1996 Olympics and recently transferred from a
Home Depot in Massachusetts to one in Georgia so she could train
with her team.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is one of the few big successes that the Olympic jobs
program can claim. J.C. Penney, part of the program since its
founding in 1977, now has 16 athletes on its payroll. But all other
companies in the program limit themselves to just a few athletes,
given their unpredictable schedules and the prospect of paying them
for hours they do not work.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of the 600 American athletes who will be in
Sydney _ as well as hundreds of others who are training but will
fail to qualify _ cobble together part-time jobs and appearance
fees to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In return for their pay, Home Depot's athletes take a public
role as company cheerleaders. Mills, for example, went to his
store's annual party last year dressed in his track uniform and
with his gold medal hanging around his neck. ``He let everybody
touch it,'' said Craig Denton, a colleague who himself was a member
of the Olympic jobs program as a kayaker.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Mills also starred in a mock newscast that was broadcast to all
210,000 employees in advance of a recent videotaped speech by
Arthur Blank, chief executive of Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The company's generosity toward its Olympic athletes _ paying
them a week's wages for half a week's work and keeping the checks
coming when they are traveling _ clearly has the potential for
creating resentment among the rank and file. That has not happened,
employees say, largely because the regular workers look up to the
athletes and realize how hard they have to work at their training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years from now, I may be able to tell my kids I knew someone
who won an Olympic medal,'' said Richard Faber, who works alongside
Colleen Rosensteel, a member of the women's judo team, in Palatine,
Ill. ``Everybody's living a little vicariously through Colleen.''

CONGRESS APPROVES BILL MAKING IT HARDER FOR PROSECUTORS TO SEIZE
PROPERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following years of complaints of abusive government
conduct, Congress completed legislation Tuesday that would make it
harder for government officials to confiscate property before they
actually bring criminal charges in narcotics, terrorism,
racketeering and other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that President Clinton would sign
the legislation, a compromise measure approved unanimously by a
voice vote of the House of Representatives on Tuesday and by the
Senate two weeks ago. The new law adds significant safeguards that
will make it more difficult for prosecutors to seize homes, money,
cars, boats and other property before trials begin. But it also
expands the government's authority to both discover tainted assets
and confiscate property after convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court and other courts have criticized the
current law, saying that lax standards had repeatedly permitted
prosecutors to confiscate assets of innocent people long before
criminal trials began. Congressional hearings had documented many
instances where the asset seizures had created enormous hardships
and required onerous litigation in order to try to win back money,
cars, homes and businesses that were never part of any criminal
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee who introduced the first bill to change forfeiture laws
seven years ago, said that the legislation approved Tuesday, which
he had co-sponsored, struck a fair balance between protecting
property owners while continuing to permit the government to
confiscate assets upon proving that they may have been part of a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is one we can all be proud of,'' Hyde said. ``It
returns civil asset forfeiture to the ranks of respected law
enforcement tools that can be used without risk to the civil
liberties and property rights of American citizens. We are all
better off that this is so.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws that were amended Tuesday were enacted as part of a
trend that began 30 years ago to expand the authority of law
enforcement at the height of what were then called the wars on
drugs and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Those laws were challenged this term in Congress by a remarkable
coalition of liberal and conservative lawmakers and a diverse array
of organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The groups critical of the current law included the American
Civil Liberties Union, the National Rifle Association, the American
Bankers Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Americans for Tax
Reform, and pilot, boating, hotel and housing organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the groups generally applauded Congress Tuesday
for taking an important first step in making it more difficult for
the government to confiscate assets without sufficient evidence of
wrongdoing, some said further legislation was necessary to remedy
the abuses that had already been documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is so bad that even modest reforms are
important,'' said Rachel King, legislative counsel of the American
Civil Liberties Union. ``We think this just begins to address the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation both flips the burden of proof to the government
and raises the legal standard for seizures prior to conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Under the existing law, once the government makes a relatively
low showing of probable cause that the property is subject to civil
forfeiture, the same standard required for a search warrant, the
onus shifts to the owner to establish that the property is
``innocent.'' Codified into federal law, the standard has its roots
in a legal fiction that an inanimate object can itself be
``guilty'' of wrongdoing, a fiction that grew out of English common
law and was adopted by the First Congress in 1789.
</P>
<P>
   Since the standard for confiscating property remains so low, an
owner is not automatically entitled to a return of confiscated
property even if he is ultimately acquitted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, the government can confiscate property only
if it first shows there was a substantial connection between the
property and the crime ``by preponderance of the evidence,'' a
higher burden than probable cause.
</P>
<P>
   The new law also expands possible defenses, awards lawyers fees
to owners who successfully challenge the seizure of their property,
and provides government-paid lawyers to indigent property owners in
many instances. It allows federal judges to release property to the
owner if the government possession causes substantial hardship to
the owner and extends the time a property owner has to challenge
the seizure of an asset.
</P>
<P>
   It also eliminates a provision that had required owners of
confiscated property to post a bond when they tried to contest the
forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation also offers some benefits to law enforcement
officials, which was necessary to win the support from the Justice
Department. It will make it easier, for instance, for prosecutors
to seize property after convictions. It also eases the statute of
limitations in criminal forfeiture actions; sets up a new procedure
for federal courts to enforce forfeiture judgments of foreign
nations; and gives the government greater access to financial
records in instances where the property may be held in secret
accounts overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions helped the chief sponsors of the legislation _
Reps. Hyde and John Conyers, D-Mich., in the House and Sens. Orrin
G. Hatch, R-Utah, and Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., in the Senate _ to
win the support of the Clinton administration. At the urging of the
Justice Department and local law enforcement groups, the White
House had opposed legislation that had overwhelmingly passed the
House last June that would have imposed even more restraints on law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation had required the government to prove that the
assets in question were part of a criminal scheme by ``clear and
convincing evidence,'' a higher standard than the ``preponderance''
test adopted Tuesday. The Senate ultimately watered down the
measure, added new provisions that the Justice Department had
sought, and adopted it by voice vote last month following little
debate.

SENATE SLAMS BRAKES ON EFFORT TO REPEAL FEDERAL GAS TAX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate turned aside an effort Tuesday to repeal
4.3 cents of the federal gasoline tax, as Republican lawmakers
sought to use the April 17 income tax filing deadline to promote
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax repeal measure failed by a vote of 56-43 in the wake
of the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to increase production, a move that is expected to lower
costs at the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., criticized the vote
as short-sighted, insisting that prices would rise again despite
the OPEC action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that gas prices are going to go up, and in fact we're
going to be more dependent on foreign oil,'' Lott said, calling on
his colleagues to begin working on a comprehensive energy strategy
that will reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not this, what, and if not now, when?'' Lott asked.
``There's a danger here and we need to find a way to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax repeal legislation was the first tax issue to be
brought up this week by Republican leaders who traditionally have
sought to use the annual income tax filing deadline as a way to
focus attention on their calls for lower federal taxes of all
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Before the week is out, Senate Republicans led by Kay Bailey
Hutchison of Texas hope to force a vote on a measure eliminating
the so-called marriage tax penalty, which would cut taxes by an
estimated $248 billion over the next 10 years for qualifying
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas, is trying to focus attention on tax issues in a
series of hearings dealing with alternative proposals to the
current income tax system. The alternatives include a flat tax
measured favored by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and
a national sales tax, which Archer has been pushing for years.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders also planned to hold a series of mostly symbolic
votes on measures that have little chance of becoming law, but will
give Republicans an opportunity to show their support in an
election year for reducing taxes. The measures scheduled for debate
include a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of
Congress to enact any new tax increases, and a measure that would
end the current tax code in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Topping off Republican efforts to highlight tax issues, Senate
Commerce Committee Chairman and former GOP presidential candidate
John McCain of Arizona planned to hold a hearing on a bill that
would extend the moratorium on internet transaction taxes for
another five years.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the airing of different tax measures, the heart of
the Republican effort this week is centered on the marriage rule,
which taxes some married couples filing jointly at a higher rate
than couples with the same income who file separately.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison has practically turned the effort to eliminate the
marriage penalty into a personal crusade, taking the lead on the
issue in the Senate. She called on her colleagues Tuesday to
approve her measure before Congress adjourns for a two-week Easter
holiday recess Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She planned to highlight what she called the ``inequities'' of
the marriage penalty at a news conference Wednesday, complete with
a wedding cake to make her point that couples should not be
penalized for making one of the most important decisions of their
life.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty legislation is just one of several
provisions that were part of the failed $792 billion GOP tax cut
bill that Clinton vetoed last year and are now being recast as
separate measures to put pressure on the Democrats in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats agree that voting against the Hutchison bill
could be a risky move. But Clinton has vowed to veto the measure,
and polls still indicate that most Americans are more interested in
paying down the debt and increasing funding for education and other
important programs than getting a tax break.
</P>
<P>
   That view, coupled with falling gasoline prices, enabled
opponents of the gas tax repeal to turn back an attempt by Lott on
Tuesday to force an up-or-down vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been approved, the bill would have temporarily rolled
back the 4.3 cents of the 18.4 cent federal tax on a gallon of
gasoline through the end of the year. The measure was opposed by
all 45 Democrats and a number of Republicans, who argued that it
would jeopardize the Highway Trust Fund, which uses the gas tax to
help states pay for the upkeep and modernization of the nation's
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have replenished lost trust fund revenues from
this year's estimated budget surpluses. But Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., said that idea would set ``a dangerous precedent'' of trying
to finance programs with surpluses that do not yet exist.

   GLOUCESTER, MASS. _ The envelope was hand-addressed. When
Gregory Gibson glimpsed it one afternoon in November, mixed in with
the junk mail and the bills, he knew right away what it was. The
return address was a post office box in Norfolk, near Boston where,
Gibson knew all too well, there is a state prison.
</P>
<P>
   His son's killer was getting in touch.
</P>
<P>
   So much came back that afternoon when the letter arrived at the
Gibsons' clapboard house in Gloucester, a two-hour drive from the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the letter,'' Gibson said, ``and, of course, all of a
sudden, my head is spinning and I am right back in this whole
welter of emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been seven years since that winter night when his son
Galen, an 18-year-old student at Simon's Rock College in western
Massachusetts, had been gunned down by a fellow student named Wayne
Lo. The consuming grief had abated; he and his wife of 26 years had
survived something that most parents say is too painful even to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's full beard and long brown ponytail were dulled now by
the beginnings of gray. But, at 54, the gray might have come anyway
_ even if Galen, the oldest of the three Gibson children, had not
been shot to death for no reason in one of those inexplicable
rampages by another student with a semiautomatic.
</P>
<P>
   There had been headlines for a few days after the December 1992
shootings at Simon's Rock, a school in Great Barrington designed
expressly for high-school-age students who are ready to begin
college work. But the attention had long since faded by the
afternoon Gibson carried the letter from a murderer into his
book-lined home office and sat down at the desk.
</P>
<P>
   In his mind's eye, Gibson said in a series of interviews, he had
seen Lo many times over seven years, not only in his prison cell
but also back on that awful night: an 18-year-old sophomore with a
buzz cut and a scowl, crossing the quiet campus with that big
Chinese-made SKS semiautomatic rifle.
</P>
<P>
   He pushes the rifle through the door of a security shack and,
from a foot away, fires two shots into the abdomen of a security
guard, Teresa Beavers, severely wounding her. A young professor,
Nacunan L. Saez, happens to drive into the campus. Wayne Lo kills
him in an instant with a bullet through the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Galen is studying in the library. Some students rush in, saying
there has been an accident. Galen rushes out to see if he can help.
Wayne Lo puts a bullet through his chest and one through his side
and then keeps shooting, hitting some students, missing others.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, two people were dead, four people injured. And if
the rifle had not jammed, Wayne Lo conceded recently in the first
interviews he has given, there would have been more bodies.
</P>
<P>
   At home in Gloucester, Gibson keeps cartons stuffed with
documents from his son's short life and from the court proceedings
that followed his death. There is, for example, a color photograph,
taken by the police, introduced at the trial where Lo was convicted
of murder in 1994. The picture shows exactly what Wayne Lo did.
Galen's slender body is laid out, still in his tangled college-boy
clothes. His eyes are slightly opened. His blood-drained skin is
nearly the same metallic blue-gray as the stainless steel table.
</P>
<P>
   When he opened the envelope that day in November, Gibson found
two pages of Wayne Lo's carefully printed handwriting inside.
``Dear Mr. Gibson,'' the letter began, ``I really don't know how to
start or what I should say.'' What Gibson went on to read, he would
conclude, seemed to be a killer's effort to join him in the same
search as people everywhere to understand how the unfathomable
tragedy of random killing sometimes comes to innocent places.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, other families whose loved ones have been
killed or wounded by rampage killers also try to find a place in
their lives for the shattering events. Some join victims' rights
groups. Others form gun-control organizations. There are those who
want to be alone with their experience, and there are those who say
they have turned a corner and no longer want to look back.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Gibson had once been filled, he says, with vengeful
hate. He also had a long period of paralyzing grief, ``wondering if
I would ever do anything again.'' But by the time he found himself
reading that letter from Lo, Gibson had long been on a path not
usually taken by people who have endured what he has. For years, he
has methodically forced himself to confront in extraordinary detail
the crime that caused his family's heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   It is a search for meaning that he could not, and still cannot,
fully explain. ``It's the story,'' he said to a visitor one night
in the family's kitchen, still casually decorated with pictures of
all three Gibson children. ``All we've got now is absence and
sickness. Somehow, if I follow this story long enough, it will be
positive in the world rather than negative.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   THE VICTIM'S FATHER: A Killing Sets Off A Search for Answers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know how people choose their paths through
grief. But by the time Galen was killed, Gregory Gibson was already
weaving together cerebral and practical approaches to life. He was
a Swarthmore College graduate and a Navy veteran who, as a young
man, had wanted to be a writer. After he concluded that his first
novel was unpublishable, though, he set aside his writerly
aspirations and went into the antiquarian book business. It kept
him in the world of ideas, he said, and kept bread on table as he
and his wife, Anne Marie Crotty, reared their two boys, Galen and
Brooks, who is now 22, and a girl, Celia, now 16.
</P>
<P>
   After the crime, the Gibsons sued Simon's Rock, claiming the
college's inattention to warning signs about Lo the day of the
shooting was a factor in the murders. Simon's Rock, which is part
of Bard College, denied any negligence but eventually settled the
case for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Gibson, the shortcomings of Simon's Rock were only
part of the story he was working so hard to construct. He set out
to learn as much as he could about every aspect of the narrative _
characters, scenes, circumstances _ that ended in Galen's murder.
Gibson's search became absorbing, his son Brooks said; for a while,
he worried that his father might be in too deep. ``He was really
obsessed with the whole thing,'' Brooks said. ``It would be all he
would be talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson visited other victims of the shooting, sometimes leaving
home for a few days to meet with a college student who might have
seen something or with a gun owner with an expertise in the weapon
Lo used. He talked to Lo's friends, and had Lo's parents to his
home. He interviewed Galen's friends, lawyers in Lo's case, experts
on violence, employees of Simon's Rock, authorities on firearms _
even the gun dealer who sold his son's killer the semiautomatic.
</P>
<P>
   Each member of the Gibson family dealt with what had happened
differently. Galen's mother said that after Lo's trial she already
knew more than she wanted to know about the crime. Of her husband,
she said, ``I think he hopes for some kind of answer, which I'm not
sure he'll ever get.'' She was not interested in reading Lo's
letter.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message forwarded by her father, Celia said she
would prefer not to talk to a reporter and had no intention of
reading her father's book about the murder for a long time. She
cares about Galen and her father, she said, but ``during this time
of my life I have been thinking about lots of other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he was not sure his father's search would ever end.
``My dad,'' he said, ``is an intellectual guy who is trying to
figure out for the rest of his life why his son is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In many conversations with a reporter beginning in January,
Gibson said that, at first, the energy for his investigation came
from fury that he focused largely on the administration of Simon's
Rock. Just before Lo bought the used semiautomatic rifle for $129
at a gun shop in nearby Pittsfield, he had ordered, over the
telephone, 200 rounds of ammunition from Classic Arms, a North
Carolina arms supplier and brusquely demanded the package be sent
to him, via next-day air, at the college. ``I have to have it by
tomorrow,'' an agitated Lo barked at the order clerk, according to
police reports.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Massachusetts law provided that when an
out-of-state resident wanted to buy a rifle in the state, the gun
laws in the person's home state governed. The law in Montana, Lo's
home state, permitted 18-year-olds to buy rifles with no waiting
period.
</P>
<P>
   Lo had slipped the rifle onto campus in a guitar case. Butcourt
testimony later showed that when the ammunition arrived in a long
box, some Simon's Rock dormitory advisers had been alarmed when
they saw a package in the mail room with its ``Classic Arms''
return address. But the college's dean, Bernard F. Rodgers Jr.,
decided after an administrative meeting that Wayne could take the
package to his room. ``I thought there was an issue here of privacy
rights,'' Rodgers testified in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After Lo had taken the package to his room and hidden the
ammunition, Rodgers asked Lo what had been in the package. Wayne
lied, saying it had contained gun parts for his father. His father
did not own a gun, but no one from Simon's Rock called to check the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's Rock declined to make its administrators available for
interviews for this article, but answered some questions in
writing. The college regrets the deaths and suffering, according to
the statement. But the college added: ``If mistakes were made prior
to the evening of December 14, 1992, which, in hindsight, might
have derailed or at least revealed Wayne Lo's murderous plans, such
mistakes must be viewed in the context of the setting and of the
times (when school shootings were still relatively unheard of).''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Gibson's quest to have Simon's Rock admit some
responsibility in Galen's death, along with his search for how Lo
could have so easily purchased a semiautomatic rifle, can be found
in a book he has written, his first to be published: ``Gone Boy, A
Walkabout: A Father's Search for Truth in His Son's Murder''
(Kodansha International, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   The book is an elegant account of the missteps and deceptions
that clear the way for random killing. But Gibson had not
interviewed one central character: Wayne Lo. One of the book's most
haunting images is of Gibson sitting in his car in the visitor's
parking lot of the prison, the Massachusetts Correctional
Institution-Norfolk, just staring off at the high, impenetrable
walls. Someday, he mused in the book's final pages, he would like
to confront the person who had caused all the pain.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE KILLER: Time in Prison Leads To a Life Reconsidered &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Lo, who is now 25, has been on a kind of journey, too.
After the crime and for the first years of his imprisonment, he
said not long ago, he believed that God had chosen him to commit
carnage. Now, he calls that his period of denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I thought I did the right thing,'' he said
recently. ``But as I look back at it over time, more and more it
doesn't make sense to me. And more and more I ask myself, why? Why
did I do it? I mean, why?''
</P>
<P>
   In more than five hours of interviews and 10 follow-up letters
he described an evolution of consciousness that was something akin
to a lifting of clouds. It happened gradually and, from what he
said, it appeared that much remains obscured. In prison, Lo said,
he has received no psychological counseling or medication. Nor does
he feel the need for any.
</P>
<P>
   The story Lo long told himself came down to this: In December
1992, he received a divine message to go to the gun store, order
the ammunition with his mother's credit card, then lie and deceive
and kill. He was so convinced he was justified in his acts that he
raged at his lawyers during his trial because they insisted on
asserting that he was insane. Instead, he argued, his lawyers
should have investigated his victims to uncover why a heavenly
power had selected them to be shot.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting back and talking one afternoon in a small,
concrete-block room with a glass wall facing the main visiting area
at the prison, he said the command to kill was a feeling. ``It's
not visual. It's not auditory,'' he said. ``It's just, you realize
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amiable, with smooth, slightly dimpled cheeks and a sparkling
intelligence, Wayne Lo often spoke with disarming frankness. He was
also manipulative, controlling and so eager to portray himself in a
positive light that it was sometimes impossible to believe he
thought he was telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his description of his own internal journey remained
consistent. And, apart from tending his image with a public that
has largely forgotten him, he seemed to have little to gain from
describing a growing awareness of the consequences of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   A jury rejected his lawyers' insanity defense, as often happens
with abhorrent crimes that are meticulously planned. He was
sentenced to life behind bars and, in 1998, Massachusetts' highest
court rejected his appeal. ``He'll die in prison,'' said his
lawyer, Carlo A. Obligato.
</P>
<P>
   The new ideas began to occur to Lo last summer or earlier _ he's
not sure. He began to think, maybe it was not God who had told him
to kill. And if it was not, could it be that what he had done was
wrong?
</P>
<P>
   By October, Lo said, he was experiencing such intense feelings
of remorse that when, say, he caught himself alone in his cell
laughing at a television sitcom, he would feel ashamed because
Galen Gibson and Nacunan Saez could no longer experience any
emotions at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really want at this point,'' Lo said, ``is to go back
in time and for this to not happen, not so I don't have to suffer,
but those people _ that this didn't have to happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could go back and you would still put me in jail for the
rest of my life but these people can live and these people don't
have to get injured, I would do that, I would take that. But what's
happened has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In seven years in prison, Wayne Lo has had plenty of time to
reconsider his life before the night at Simon's Rock when lives
were changed. When he spoke about those early years, however, the
limits of his growing clarity seemed clear.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly insisted, for example, that he was ``a very happy
person'' before the message to kill came, as he believes it did,
out of nowhere. He professed confusion at prosecutors' descriptions
of him as an angry youth. He said he did not know why some people
at Simon's Rock told police after the shooting that he would
sometimes talk about wanting to kill large numbers of people or,
perhaps, himself. Some fellow students told the police that Lo was
prone to anti-black, anti-gay and anti-Jewish tirades.
</P>
<P>
   Lo did say he sometimes felt like an outsider, at Simon's Rock
and, earlier, at home. He is the son of a colonel in the Taiwan air
force who retired and moved with his wife and two boys to Billings,
Mont., where they opened a Chinese restaurant in 1987. The moves,
Lo said, created stresses. He was Taiwanese in Billings, a Montanan
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for him in both places were high. The family had
made the difficult move for the sake of Wayne and his brother Ryan,
who is now a 20-year old college student. ``Our whole hope is our
two boys,'' Lo's father, Jawei Lo, said as his wife, Lin Lin, cried
softly during a long interview in their living room and over lunch
at their restaurant in Billings last month.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years until this fall, the Los said, Wayne seemed
vacant during annual visits. He would occasionally rock
rhythmically when asked about his crime, his father said. Then in
the fall he seemed to awaken, for the first time discussing what he
had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can feel regret, feel guilt,'' Lo said, ``we all think
that is the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Wayne asked his mother to have a copy of Gibson's
book sent to him in prison. In the interview, she said Gibson had
shown them that there were constructive ways that both families
could struggle together to cope with their losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is supposed to hate Wayne because Wayne killed his son,''
she said. ``But he wants to do something different than just
hate.''
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Lo said that reading Gibson's book was an emotional
experience, especially when he learned about the Gibsons' warm
family and how it had been wounded by what he did. ``The book
really did a lot to open me up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a former Simon's Rock teacher who had visited
him, Sharon Flitterman-King, Lo wondered whether he should write to
Gibson. She wrote Gibson and asked if he would be willing to
receive such correspondence. He said he would, if Wayne was willing
to accept responsibility for what he had done.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Wayne was composing that first letter in his crisply
ordered handwriting. ``I just finished reading your book,'' he
wrote. ``It was a good book, though I don't think you need to hear
that from me, because you didn't need to write it, I mean, if it
wasn't for my horrible act. There is so much I want to say, but it
is hard to put all of it on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE LETTERS: An Unlikely Team Sharing Information &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, two weeks shy of seven years since that murderous
night in the Berkshires, Gibson wrote back: ``Dear Wayne, Thank you
for your letter. As you can imagine, I have been thinking about it
a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen letters have since been exchanged. The two men
have yet to talk to each other face-to-face. But separately over
the months of their correspondence, each has talked at length with
a reporter about the other, the crime and their hopes for their
fledgling relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to help me resolve my feelings about the person who
murdered my son, and maybe I can help him too,'' Gibson said one
day in February. ``It helps him redeem his humanity and it helps me
feel I put something into the situation other than hatred and rage.
If we do pull it off, it is like some kind of alchemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo has concluded he likes Gibson. But he does not expect Gibson
to return the warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could somebody ever?'' he said. ``I don't want him to like
me. If he likes me, it would almost be that he would be
disrespecting the memory of his son.''
</P>
<P>
   On some points, there was agreement. Gibson said he had been
surprised to discover that he felt compassion and empathy for Lo.
But, answering a question, he said: ``Could I ever like the kid who
killed my son? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   To preserve some privacy, Gibson provided only a few excerpts of
the letters; Lo said he would leave that decision to Gibson. But
the interviews and letters to a reporter seemed to duplicate much
of what the two men have been saying to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Lo carefully described the evolution of his thoughts. As he had
come to realize God would not have chosen him to inflict so much
pain, he said, he had struggled to understand what made him into a
killer.
</P>
<P>
   He remains convinced, he said, that it was something outside of
himself that gave him a message to do what he did. Perhaps, he said
in answer to a question, it was a supernatural or satanic force.
</P>
<P>
   Lo would still prefer not to consider the possibility that he is
mentally ill, he said. ``Personally I am, I guess you could say, a
proud person,'' he said. ``I would like to think that I have
control of myself, that I am not impaired in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just human nature to have such hopes, Gibson said. ``He's
got dignity,'' he said of Lo. ``He doesn't want to be regarded as
an insane monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo was stubborn about several themes. He repeatedly insisted,
for example, that people had lied when they portrayed him as a
hateful bigot before the crime, fascinated by violence and
hard-core music. It was true, he acknowledged, that seven weeks
before the shooting he had become notorious on campus for a class
paper he wrote proposing the extermination of all HIV-positive
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that had merely been an effort to get a good
grade with a strong argument, not a proposal he really believed. He
was a lover of ballads and the Rush Limbaugh show, he said, not
just heavy metal music. It had merely been a coincidence, he
insisted, that the night of the killings he had worn a sweatshirt
with the name of a hardcore band. A photograph of him in the shirt
after his arrest drew national attention because the band's name
seemed to be his explanation: ``Sick of It All.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said he was sorting out the new information he was
learning. But he was forgiving of Lo's more obvious misstatements,
saying that Lo's recollections of what he felt in the chaos around
the crime may simply be mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   At times, when he considered the more awful revelations from Lo,
Gibson sounded depressed. Once that mood seemed to hit after Lo
said that the ease with which he had bought the gun, ordered the
ammunition and fooled Simon's Rock officials had convinced him that
his mission was guided by a divine force. ``It all worked so
seamlessly,'' Lo said. ``I know it sounds terrible to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, when he considered the unlikelihood of his bond with
Gibson, Lo sounded hopeful. Maybe his other victims and their
families, too, might want to hear his explanations and his remorse.
</P>
<P>
   That appears unlikely. When told about Gibson's correspondence,
Beavers, the wounded security guard, said she thought this might be
some new manipulation by Lo to make himself feel better. Baruc S.
Saez, Nacunan's brother, said he was not interested in anything Lo
might say: ``Me and my whole family have tried to forget Wayne Lo
and view my brother's death like an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   So the story, for now, has narrowed to two people.
</P>
<P>
   One, Gibson, who is not a churchgoer but says he believes in
God, said he and Lo are contending together with the spiritual
consequences of that December night. Someday, he might try to visit
his son's killer in prison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other, Lo, said he is willing to do whatever is necessary to
provide the answers his victims might need, no matter how
difficult. ``It is uncomfortable,'' he said, ``in the sense that it
just reaffirms every day and night: `It's not a nightmare. I can't
wake up from it: This is you, Wayne. You did it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is difficult for any outsider to understand.
Matthew L. David, another student shot that night, said it had been
harder to recover psychologically than physically. He wished Gibson
well, but said he had worked for seven years to put the experience
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, `why?' is not important any more,'' David said.
``I don't know if I am ever going to know why. What I know is there
were consequences to what happened.'' He had not read Gibson's
book.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, Lo said Gibson should get the answers he seeks and
then ``he should just forget me.''
</P>
<P>
   At his kitchen table in Gloucester, Gibson said the work of the
killer and the victim's father is not likely to be so simple as a
quick exchange of letters and an atonement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure,'' Gibson said, ``we've both got the rest of our
lives to talk about this.''

   GLOUCESTER, MASS. _ When Gregory Gibson received the envelope
one afternoon in November, mixed in with the junk mail and the
bills, he knew right away what it was. The return address was a
post office box in Norfolk, where there is a state prison.
</P>
<P>
   His son's killer was getting in touch.
</P>
<P>
   So much came back that afternoon when the letter arrived at the
Gibsons' house in Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the letter,'' said Gibson, 54, ``and, of course, all of
a sudden, my head is spinning and I am right back in this whole
welter of emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been seven years since that night of December 14, 1992,
when the oldest of his three children, Galen, an 18-year-old
student at Simon's Rock College in western Massachusetts, had been
gunned down by a fellow student named Wayne Lo.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were killed, four wounded. And if the rifle had not
jammed, Lo conceded recently, there would have been more bodies.
</P>
<P>
   When he opened the envelope that day in November, Gibson found
two pages of Lo's carefully printed handwriting inside. ``Dear Mr.
Gibson,'' the letter began, ``I really don't know how to start or
what I should say.'' What Gibson went on to read seemed to be a
killer's effort to join him in the same search as people everywhere
to understand how the unfathomable tragedy of random killing
sometimes comes to innocent places.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he read that letter from Lo, Gibson had long been on
a path not usually taken by people who have endured what he has.
For years, he has methodically forced himself to confront in
extraordinary detail the crime that caused his family's heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we've got now is absence and sickness,'' he said. Somehow,
if I follow this story long enough, it will be positive in the
world rather than negative.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crime, the Gibson family sued Simon's Rock, claiming
the college's inattention to warning signs about Lo was a factor in
the murders. Simon's Rock, which is part of Bard College, denied
any negligence but eventually settled the case for an undisclosed
sum.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Gibson, the shortcomings of Simon's Rock were only
part of the story he was working so hard to construct. He set out
to learn as much as he could about every aspect of the narrative _
characters, scenes, circumstances _ that ended in Galen's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Gibson's quest to have Simon's Rock admit some
responsibility in Galen's death, along with his search for how Lo
could have so easily purchased a semiautomatic rifle, can be found
in a book he has written, his first to be published: ``Gone Boy, A
Walkabout: A Father's Search for Truth in His Son's Murder''
(Kodansha International, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   The book is an elegant account of the missteps and deceptions
that clear the way for random killing. But Gibson had not
interviewed one central character: Wayne Lo.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Lo, now 25, has been on a kind of journey, too. After the
crime and for the first years of his imprisonment, he said
recently, he believed that God had chosen him to commit carnage.
Now, he calls that his period of denial.
</P>
<P>
   The story Lo long told himself was that he received a divine
message to go to the gun store, order the ammunition with his
mother's credit card, then lie and deceive and kill. A jury
rejected Lo's insanity defense, as often happens with abhorrent
crimes that are meticulously planned. He was sentenced to life
behind bars. The new ideas began to occur to Lo last summer or
earlier _ he's not sure. He began to think, maybe it was not God
who had told him to kill. And if it was not, could it be that what
he had done was wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really want at this point,'' Lo said, ``is to go back
in time and for this to not happen, not so I don't have to suffer,
but those people _ that this didn't have to happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could go back and you would still put me in jail for the
rest of my life but these people can live and these people don't
have to get injured, I would do that, I would take that. But what's
happened has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted, for example, that he was ``a very happy person''
before the message to kill came, as he believes it did, out of
nowhere. He professed confusion at prosecutors' descriptions of him
as an angry youth.
</P>
<P>
   Lo said that reading Gibson's book was an emotional experience,
especially when he learned about the Gibsons' warm family and how
it had been wounded by what he did. ``The book really did a lot to
open me up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Wayne was composing that first letter. ``I just finished
reading your book,'' he wrote. ``It was a good book, though I don't
think you need to hear that from me, because you didn't need to
write it, I mean, if it wasn't for my horrible act. There is so
much I want to say, but it is hard to put all of it on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, two weeks shy of seven years since that murderous
night, Gibson wrote back: ``Dear Wayne, Thank you for your letter.
As you can imagine, I have been thinking about it a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen letters have since been exchanged. The two men
have yet to talk to each other face-to-face. But separately over
the months of their correspondence, each has talked at length with
a reporter about the other, the crime and their hopes for their
fledgling relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to help me resolve my feelings about the person who
murdered my son, and maybe I can help him too,'' Gibson said. ``It
helps him redeem his humanity and it helps me feel I put something
into the situation other than hatred and rage. If we do pull it
off, it is like some kind of alchemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo has concluded he likes Gibson. But he does not expect Gibson
to return the warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said he had been surprised to discover that he felt
compassion and empathy for Lo. But he added: ``Could I ever like
the kid who killed my son? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   To preserve some privacy, Gibson provided only a few excerpts of
the letters; Lo said he would leave that decision to Gibson. But
the interviews and letters to a reporter seemed to duplicate much
of what the two men have been saying to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Lo described the evolution of his thoughts. As he had come to
realize God would not have chosen him to inflict so much pain, he
said, he had struggled to understand what made him into a killer.
</P>
<P>
   He remains convinced that it was something outside of himself
that gave him a message to do what he did. Perhaps, he said in
answer to a question, it was a supernatural or satanic force.
</P>
<P>
   Lo would still prefer not to consider the possibility that he is
mentally ill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got dignity,'' Gibson said of Lo. ``He doesn't want to be
regarded as an insane monster.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, when he considered the unlikelihood of his bond with
Gibson, Lo sounded hopeful. Maybe his other victims and their
families, too, might want to hear his explanations and his remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said he and Lo are contending together with the spiritual
consequences of that horrible night. Someday, he might try to visit
his son's killer in prison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lo said he is willing to do whatever is necessary to provide the
answers his victims might need, no matter how difficult. ``It is
uncomfortable,'' he said, ``in the sense that it just reaffirms
every day and night: `It's not a nightmare. I can't wake up from
it: This is you, Wayne. You did it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said the work of the killer and the victim's father is
not likely to be so simple as a quick exchange of letters and an
atonement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure,'' Gibson said, ``we've both got the rest of our
lives to talk about this.''

   SPONSORS-MOTIVATE (Atlanta) _ When the Olympic Games open in
Australia this summer, about 30 athletes will represent Egypt.
Sixty will make up the contingent from Turkey. And nearly 100 will
make up the delegation from Home Depot. The company's orange logo
will not appear on the the Olympic athletes' uniforms, of course,
and television commentators probably won't even mention the giant
retailer's name. But in cities and towns around North America,
thousands of Home Depot employees will stay up late to root for the
athletes on TV and get up the next morning to devour the accounts
of their exploits in the sports pages. That, it turns out, is the
audience Home Depot executives are trying to reach. When a company
employs 210,000 people in an industry with one of the highest
turnover rates in the country _ in the midst of one of the tightest
job markets in more than three decades _ it does what it has to do
to hold onto every last one of them. By David Leonhardt.

TECHNOLOGY SHARES CONTINUE SHARP FALL; BLUE CHIPS RISE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks were hammered again Tuesday, pulled
lower by disappointing reports from Motorola and Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.2 percent, or 132.30 points,
to 4,055.90. By the close of trading the index was lower than at
the start of the year, and nearly 20 percent below the peak reached
on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, money continued to move into blue chip stocks from
technology companies that carry much higher price to earnings
ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by strong gains in stocks like Alcoa and Minnesota Mining
&AMP; Manufacturing, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 100.52
points, or 0.9 percent, to 11,287.08. The Dow, which gained 75
points on Monday, is now down less than 2 percent from its closing
level on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``When sentiment has turned against technology, old-line stocks
come to the fore,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at
Prudential Securities. ``There is no reason to think that this time
is any different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which has traded in a
very narrow range so far this month, did so again Tuesday. It
dropped 3.87 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,500.59.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in stocks like General Electric, Bristol-Myers Squibb and
American International Group mostly offset a disastrous performance
by Motorola, and weakness in technology bellwethers Cisco Systems
and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday's trading, analysts said the reaction to a
first quarter earnings report from Motorola would likely dictate
the direction for technology shares. Motorola's earnings were very
good _ more than double what the mobile telephone maker earned in
the same period last year. But in a conference call with analysts
before the market opened Tuesday, the company warned that second
quarter earnings will fall short of Wall Street forecasts. The
comments triggered a sell-off in computer and telecommunications
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, a component of the S&AMP;P 500, fell 27 Tuesday, to 124.
</P>
<P>
   And biotechnology stocks were slammed in reaction to Biogen's
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's market close, the company reported first quarter
profits that missed Wall Street estimates by one cent a share,
partly because of lower-than-expected sales of Avonex, its multiple
sclerosis drug.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings report dragged down the Nasdaq's biotechnology
index by 3.4 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen closed at 53, down 12. But Genentech lost 20, to 136{; PE
Corp Celera fell 11[, to 88~; and Millenium Pharmaceuticals slumped
15{, to 134.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp slide in technology share prices has happened quickly,
but analysts noted that the spring and summer quarters have
traditionally been difficult months for technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And they expressed doubt about the conviction of the move into
well known blue-chip stocks, which for all the safety they may
provide do not offer the growth potential of technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some think this might be an important secular shift,'' said
Greg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities.
``But in fact this is pretty normal seasonal stuff. The only thing
unusual about this is that it started about a week early.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems was the most active Nasdaq stock Tuesday. The
stock fell 2 9/16, to 70 a share. Since it peaked on March 27,
shares of Cisco have fallen by nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, the Dow's best performer last year, led the blue chip
index up. It gained 2 11/16, to 70].

TREASURY PRICES FALL SHARPLY, PUZZLING ANALYSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices dropped sharply Tuesday, puzzling
some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, everybody is scratching their heads,''
said Thomas Connor, head government trader at J.P. Morgan
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's selling, which followed a short rally in the morning,
was across the board in the Treasury market and came as the Nasdaq
composite index dropped 3.2 percent. In the last couple of weeks,
as investors sold stocks in the technology-heavy Nasdaq index, many
of them took the money and put it into the Treasury market, often a
haven for worried investors.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1.46, to 106.94. The
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
rose to 5.76 percent, from 5.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 10-year note fell as the yield rose to 5.87
percent, from 5.77 percent, and the yield on the Treasuries
two-year note climbed to 6.33 percent from 6.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the bond's decline was a shift by investors
from longer-term Treasuries into corporate bonds and debt of the
two government-sponsored agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
which help finance home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that these two markets had fared so poorly compared
with Treasuries in the last several months that they may suddenly
have become attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-March, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt has been under
extra pressure because of the Treasury Department's support for a
proposal to strip the two of some of their tax and regulatory
advantages over investment and commercial banks. One advantage is a
conditional line of credit from the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Treasuries against other fixed-income markets
is measured in the difference _ or spread _ between the yields on
comparable maturities. When that spread widens it means that
Treasuries are outperforming the other markets. For example, the
spread between 10-year Treasury notes and 10-year Fannie Mae notes
was under one percentage point in mid-March. But during trading
Tuesday it was as high as 1.3 percentage points in the morning,
before agency and corporate bond markets rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Late in trading, the spread on 10-year Fannie Mae notes had
narrowed to 1.20 percentage points, from 1.23 percentage points
Monday. The spread on 10-year corporate bonds with a double A
credit rating had narrowed to 1.30 percentage points, from 1.32
percentage points Monday and a high of 1.41 percentage points early
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors were taking advantage of the ever widening spread
between agencies and Treasuries'' said Kevin Flanagan, money market
economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. But he said it was too
early to say that the negative sentiment toward Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac generated by the threat from the Treasury had changed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in congressional testimony Tuesday, Rep. Richard Baker,
a Republican from Louisiana and sponsor of legislation to tighten
regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, compared the financial
risk from the growth of these two agencies with that posed by the
near-collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.

A CRITICAL DECISION FOR A BESIEGED GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In what could prove to be the most important decision
of his term, Governor Paul Cellucci has turned to Andrew Natsios,
his highly trusted and oldest political friend, to bail out the Big
Dig.
</P>
<P>
   But Natsios has another mission, one perhaps as important to the
governor: help salvage Cellucci's political career and save his
administration from being swallowed up by the biggest public works
project in the country.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Big Dig debacle has put Cellucci on the
defensive, eroded his once-strong standing in the polls, and raised
questions about his ability to lead the state. His political future
in Massachusetts _ and, some say, his potential for landing an
administration job should George W. Bush reach the White House _ is
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   By firing James Kerasiotes as the project leader Tuesday,
Cellucci made a move that he and his aides hope will stop the
free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a great weight being lifted,'' said one top
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the public, inundated for months with dire predictions
of huge cost overruns, incendiary headlines, and talk-show bombast,
seemed to anticipate sweeping changes.
</P>
<P>
   The central political issue, however, is twofold: can public
confidence in the Big Dig _ and, ultimately, the Cellucci
governorship _ still be restored? And is Natsios the man to do it?
</P>
<P>
   Todd Domke, a Republican political consultant and a sometime
critic of the Weld and Cellucci administrations, says Natsios has
the integrity and political skills to handle both jobs. Domke,
however, feel the stakes go beyond Cellucci's own political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the Massachusetts Republican Party,
which depends on its image as a fiscally responsible party for its
credibility, can recover from these events,'' Domke said.
</P>
<P>
   For Cellucci, much depends on how well he can rebound from a
dismal fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   From the ``booze cruise'' scandal at Massport to the turbulence
that rocked Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift, Cellucci has
increasingly appeared indecisive and his administration seems
adrift, allowing other Beacon Hill figures to fill the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly, a Democrat trying to establish
himself on Beacon Hill, has earned credit for resolving the Harvard
Pilgrim financial meltdown and pursuing tougher state gun control
laws. Secretary of State William F. Galvin, too, has easily moved
in on issues well within the governor's reach, from price controls
on prescription drugs for seniors to a crackdown on unscrupulous
lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Big Dig crises has added to the perception that the
governor is neither bold nor innovative.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, his shakeup of Big Dig management Tuesday had some
dramatic moments, but it was hardly breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Firing Kerasiotes was easy: he had inadvertently insulted
Cellucci in print and had become a symbol of the administration's
declining credibility, a serious political liablity for a governor
who was fast losing the public's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But it would not have been any easier had Cellucci moved more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the financial disaster, most close observers and even
his enemies agree that Kerasiotes has managed the massive, complex
project relatively well. He is highly regarded in the Boston
business community, whose leadership is concerned with his firing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration sources said Kerasiotes had also earned
considerable political capital with Cellucci and former Governor
William F. Weld through the years; their confidence in him ran
deep, and aides said Cellucci personally likes him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone realized Jim had a tough job and he was cut a lot of
slack,'' said one administration insider. ``There was a feeling of,
`Let Jim be Jim,' and let him get the project done. We need a real
jerk to manage this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the relationship between Kerasiotes and Cellucci had
become strained in recent days as details of the federal audit
emerged. Some aides to the governor said Cellucci was not pleased
at Kerasiotes' moves to save his own job, including attempts to
prevent himself from being barred from federal projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unauthorized,'' said one aide.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Cellucci's political problems will continue. The
scapegoat may be gone, but the residual bad feelings among the
public still linger.

ROTE MATH SKILLS PROVE LEARNING FASTER IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER
(LESSONS COLUMN) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1982, the nation's 13-year-olds were tested in math. One
question was: If a bus holds 36 soldiers, how many buses do 1,128
soldiers need? Seventy percent did the long division correctly, yet
few got the right answer: 32 buses. More common was ``31, remainder
12.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems like this have been at the core of our ``math wars,''
an ongoing debate about how to teach. ``Back-to-basics'' advocates
say we don't drill students enough. In effect, they focus on the 30
percent who could not divide 1,128 by 36. But their opponents worry
more about children who can't picture that the ``remainder 12''
requires a whole bus with 24 empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   Math curriculum issues are hard to settle because so many of us
fear the subject. Well-educated adults joke about never having been
good at math when estimating a restaurant tip but would never brag
that they couldn't read. Many who demand that schools drill
students more are themselves examples of how that method hasn't
worked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
proposed a curriculum that not only played down rote practice but
left an impression that basic skills could be ignored. This
guaranteed a back-to-basics reaction. A new set of standards being
released at the council's meeting in Chicago is more balanced, but
unlikely to end the math wars.
</P>
<P>
   The council members insist that there is no single way to solve
math problems, and that students should experiment with
alternatives. This infuriates traditionalists; they want the
``right way'' memorized, and children tested on it.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Nancy Buell, a fourth-grade teacher, recently
circulated a petition among the state's math teachers protesting
renewed emphasis on drills. She claims that such drills won't work
well for any of her suburban Brookline students _ mostly middle
class, but about a third low-income, bused from Boston or living in
public housing.
</P>
<P>
   I visited Buell's classroom recently. She spent several days
exploring a single division problem with her fourth-graders: if
juice cans come in cases of 24, how many cases are needed to give a
can to each of 250 children?
</P>
<P>
   She told her students first to write the question as a ``number
sentence'' (250 (DEV) 24 (EQ)) and then discuss it in groups.
Traditionalists don't see why this should be a subject of
discussion _ it's a straightforward long division problem. But in
classes like Buell's, some students solve it by addition, adding
24's until they get to 250. Others subtract, taking 24's from 250
to see how many they need to reach zero. A few see it as
multiplication _ 24 times what equals 250?
</P>
<P>
   In one group, a girl reasoned that there were four 25's in 100,
so 250 students would include two of these hundreds, and then
another half a hundred students. If a case had 25 cans, she said,
exactly 4 plus 4 plus 2 cases (a total of 10) would be needed. But
with only 24 in a case, each would be short a can, and so 10 cans
must come from an 11th case.
</P>
<P>
   For another group, Buell drew a rectangle and divided it into 24
sections using parallel vertical lines. How many horizontal lines
would be needed to make at least 250 squares? Children could count
squares for the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Another group said the answer was 11 cases, 14 remaining. Buell
asked whether the ``remainder'' was kids or cans. While the
word-problem answer could be either 11 cases with 14 cans left
over, or 10 cases with 10 cans still needed, only ``10, remainder
10'' correctly solves the number sentence, she showed.
</P>
<P>
   These students may come to understand math better than most
adults, but when they reach adulthood, will they be more
comfortable than their parents calculating restaurant tips? Few
states have retained reform curriculums long enough to judge their
effectiveness, but Nancy Buell insists that if students are taught
properly, math proficiency will flow easily from their experiences.
``Trust me,'' she said, ``kindergartners can split up a plate full
of cookies fairly!''
</P>
<P>
   Some new evidence comes from Professor James Stigler of the
University of California and Professor James Hiebert of the
University of Delaware, who videotaped American and Japanese
classes. From their book, ``The Teaching Gap'' (Free Press, 1999),
it seems that math instruction in Japan, which ranks high on
international exams, is similar to Buell's methods.
</P>
<P>
   But Buell is unusual in this country, and odds are against
American schools copying her techniques. It takes more training
than most of our teachers have, and more time for planning than our
schools allow. In the hands of poorly trained teachers,
nontraditional methods can cause children to get neither basics nor
understanding. Japanese teachers spend less time teaching and more
time meeting to compare strategies.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly faster ways than Nancy Buell's to teach the
answer to 250 (DEV) 24. But in learning math, a straight line may
not always be the best path between two points.

RENO GOING TO MIAMI TO SEEK SOLUTION TO DISPUTE OVER CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno prepared to fly to
Miami Wednesday to play a personal role in resolving the dispute
over Elian Gonzalez, intensifying the drama over the boy's fate and
raising the stakes for everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Tuesday that Reno would meet
with Cuban-American leaders in Miami, federal authortities who have
been negotiating Elian's fate, and probably with the Gonzalez
relatives who have had custody over the 6-year-old refugee since he
was rescued off the Florida coast last November.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Reno would not haggle with anyone over the
terms or timing of Elian's reunification with his father, but
wanted to personally explain the US government's position to
Cuban-Americans and ask them to make the process as peaceful as
possible. A letter was to have been delivered Tuesday night to the
Miami relatives laying out the Justice Department's demands for
where and when it wants them to surrender the boy.
</P>
<P>
   By physically placing herself into the center of the
controversy, Reno not only puts her prestige on the line, but also
raises expectations that a resolution may be imminent. Her presence
also seems certain to trigger street demonstrations by a Cuban
exile community that considers her an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Reno's personal involvement also applies
pressure on the Cuban-Americans, including Elian's relatives in
Miami, because they will literally be seen as bucking the authority
of the chief US law-enforcement officer if they do not comply with
whatever demands she makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agreed that helping to bring the family together to
work out this orderly transition would be desirable, but I also
stressed that the transfer of Elian to the care of his father must
move forward without delay,'' Reno said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was issued after she met with two mayors from South Florida
who proposed that any transfer of custody take place over a
monthlong period to ease the emotional transition for the boy. They
also urged that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, work out
reunification and custody arrangements himself during a meeting
with the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives floated a similar plan Tuesday. Outside their
Little Havana home, they distributed copies of a letter they had
sent to a government-appointed psychiatrist with whom they had met
Monday. In it, they suggested a two-stage meeting with Juan
Gonzalez at a ``neutral'' spot in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   First, they said, they wanted to meet with Elian's father alone,
presumably to try to persuade him to stay in the United States or,
at least, not to take his son back to Cuba. It would be followed
``almost immediately by a meeting to include Elian,'' said the
letter, which was signed by the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The family also sent a letter to President Clinton late Monday
asking him to issue an order himself to prevent Elian from leaving
this country until a federal appeals court hears the case next
month.
</P>
<P>
   While the relatives' tone remained defiant, their apparent
willingness to discuss the terms of a relinquishment indicated that
they perceive a conclusion is drawing near. The mood in the crowd
outside the family's home reflected a similar sense of resignation,
even as the demonstrators continued to wave placards denouncing the
Clinton administration and demanding that Elian have his day in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be the voice of Elian's mother, no matter what,''
said Maria Cancio, 27, whose son is about the same age as Elian.
``I know deep down inside that the father wants his child to stay.
I know what it looks like, but we can't give up yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives, who are trying various legal maneuvers to keep
Elian in the United States, filed a brief in Miami Family Court
Tuesday asking for a hearing to determine whether Juan Gonzalez is
fit to raise his son. They alleged that the father had ``enagaged
in abusive conduct'' _ a charge his attorney and US officials
adamantly deny _ and that the boy could be subjected to ``imminent
indoctrination'' if he went back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government asked the court to dismiss the request,
saying a state judge has no jurisdiction to overrule federal
immigration law.

RITE AID REFINANCES DEBT, AT A SUBSTANTIAL COST 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rite Aid Corp., having failed to find buyers for its PCS
Health Systems subsidiary, announced a plan Tuesday to refinance
its debt for more than two years, giving it access to more than
$640 million in additional funds. The deal came at a cost of higher
interest rates on some of its borrowings and substantial dilution
for its stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a solution that is good for everybody,'' said
Bob Miller, who was hired away from the Kroger Co. in December to
become the new chief executive of Rite Aid, a chain of 3,800 drug
stores that has been buffeted by problems for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Citibank, Fleet Retail Finance and Heller
Financial will provide a $1 billion credit facility, maturing on
Aug. 1, 2002. Of that, $60 million will go for expenses connected
with the refinancing and $300 million will go to repay another debt
issue, leaving the company with $640 million in additional cash.
</P>
<P>
   Other loans will also be extended until 2002 if the refinancing
plan wins approval from all the company's lenders, something Miller
said he was confident would occur. Miller said he had prepared a
plan to get the company back on its feet by then, but declined to
give details.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, the company's offer to exchange new
securities for $350 million of publicly held junk bonds will be
made only to institutional investors. Individuals who own the bonds
and are not eligible to buy private offerings will not be able to
make the exchange, although they could sell their bonds to an
institutional investor.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid has been in turmoil since last spring, when the
company's auditors at KPMG forced the company to report lower
earnings for 1999 than had been previously announced. The audit
firm later resigned, saying it had no confidence in the company's
management, and the management team was forced to resign. The
company's new auditor, Deloitte and Touche, is expected to produce
audited financial statements for the last three years by July 11.
</P>
<P>
   When Miller took over, his immediate plan was to sell PCS, which
administers pharmacy benefits for health plans, for at lest $1.3
billion, and use the money to pay down debt. But Tuesday he said
that while the company ``will continue to explore opportunities to
sell PCS at some point,'' the price the company could get for PCS
now was ``very depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan announced Tuesday involves J.P. Morgan exchanging $200
million in bank debt for Rite Aid common stock, at $5.50 a share,
and allows other banks to convert as much as $85 million in loans
to common stock at the same price. Last October, Leonard Green and
Partners purchased $300 million of convertible preferred stock,
which was to be convertible at about $7.50 a share. The conversion
price on that issue would be reduced to $5.50 under this plan.
</P>
<P>
   If all the conversions are completed, the banks and Leonard
Green would wind up owning about 29 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid shares, which sold for as much as $51.125 in January
1999, rose $1.625 to $7.3125 Tuesday in New York Stock Exchange
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the first Rite Aid debts that would come due
would be the new $1 billion facility, which would mature on Aug. 1,
2002, two weeks before the other bank debts would mature and one
and one-half months before the company's extended junk bonds would
come due. The new facility would also be secured by the company's
inventory and receivables, giving the lenders a better chance of
being repaid even if efforts to turn around Rite Aid do not bear
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The two junk bonds being refinanced are an issue of $200 million
of 5.5 percent notes that are due in December and an issue of $350
million of 6.7 percent notes due in December 2001. The latter issue
was sold to public investors, although most of the bonds are held
by institutional investors, including junk bond mutual funds. The
offer calls for the interest rates on the deals to be raised to
about 10.5 percent, and the maturity extended to Sept. 15, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The notes due in 2001 had traded on Monday at 62.5 percent of
par value, said one trader. The bid rose to 76 percent of par value
Tuesday. The 2000 notes, which had been bid at 75 percent of par
value on Monday, rose to a bid of 82 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The differing bids for the issues, which are to be exchanged for
identical notes, may have indicated some hope that holders of the
December 2000 issue, with its earlier maturity date, might be in a
position to hold out for better terms.
</P>
<P>
   The new notes will be issued under Rule 144a of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, which allows unregistered securities to be
sold to qualified institutions and to certain wealthy individuals.
The notes evidently cannot be registered, as would be required if
they were to be offered to all holders, because the company has no
audited financial statements.

RAYTHEON SEEKING BUYER FOR ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. is in talks to sell or spin off its troubled
engineering and construction division, setting aside previous
pledges that it would hang on to the unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington, Mass. defense contractor also warned Tuesday that
the division would report an operating loss in the first quarter,
the latest in a series of earnings disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts approved of Raytheon's steps to dispose of the
Cambridge, Mass. engineering division, known as Raytheon Engineers
&AMP; Constructors, or RE&AMP;C, as a way to raise cash and pay down debt.
RE&AMP;C last year had an operating loss of $61 million on revenue of
$2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon wouldn't say with whom it is holding talks, though
speculation centered on Morrison Knudsen Corp. in Boise, Idaho.
Morrison Knudsen did not return messages seeking comment. Raytheon
said it is also considering setting up a joint venture with another
company to run RE&AMP;C.
</P>
<P>
   Few have seen RE&AMP;C as a good fit with Raytheon's major aerospace
and defense business lines, and pressure to sell it has mounted
since Raytheon disclosed an order slowdown and other problems last
fall, causing its stock to drop sharply.
</P>
<P>
   But RE&AMP;C had symbolic importance for Raytheon and its chief
executive, Daniel Burnham, who made improving the unit's
performance a chief goal when he took over at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pressure from investors, Raytheon had insisted for
months that it wasn't seeking a buyer for RE&AMP;C and that the unit
could prosper under its new top officer, Shay Assad.
</P>
<P>
   But Burnham shifted gears Tuesday and said in a statement that
while ``RE&AMP;C has growth potential within certain markets,'' it ``is
not central to Raytheon's strategy. A sale, joint venture, or
spin-off of RE&AMP;C is in the best interests of Raytheon shareholders
and RE&AMP;C.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Burnham wouldn't elaborate and wouldn't discuss
whether Raytheon was considering the sale of other operations.
Assad, the division head, was not available for comment. His
employment agreement was recently amended to allow him to receive a
severance package in case of a change in control of RE&AMP;C.
</P>
<P>
   The division had about 8,000 employees at the end of last year,
including about 300 at its headquarters in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they approved of the announcement, though some
wondered if the unit would fetch much at auction. ``Raytheon has
proven to just about everyone on Wall Street that they can't manage
RE&AMP;C,'' said Bill Fiala, analyst with Edward Jones &AMP; Co. in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   RE&AMP;C once was known as an overseer of nuclear power plant
construction. In the early 1990s, it was merged with several other
construction firms Raytheon bought in a diversification effort.
More recently, RE&AMP;C's fortunes have sagged along with its
construction-industry peers, including Boston-based Stone &AMP;
Webster, because of a general slowdown in new construction
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Assad tried to focus the company on domestic work,
and recently won contracts to build new power plants in Everett and
Weymouth, Mass. But other problems remain. Tuesday, Raytheon said
the engineering unit would report a loss of 15 to 20 cents a share
for the first quarter, due mainly to performance issues at one
international project that it did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the talks with potential buyers, Raytheon said it
wouldn't account for RE&AMP;C as a continuing operation in its
financial results for the three months ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Raytheon said, it expects to meet consensus earnings
expectations. Analysts surveyed by First Call expected the company
to earn around 24 cents a share for the quarter. Results are due
April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also expects to report its net debt rose about $500
million during the quarter, less than some expected. At the end of
last year, its total debt was $9.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's widely traded Class B shares fell 6.25 cents Tuesday
to close at $20.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

   &QL;  FARM AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SAY FARM BUREAU A ``SHAM,''
DEMAND CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION
</P>
<P>
   By Alison Vekshin
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 11 - Accusing the American Farm Bureau
Federation of representing the interests of agribusiness and
insurance companies instead of family farmers, a coalition of farm
and environmental organizations Tuesday urged Congress to
investigate the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sham that they claim to be a legitimate force for
family farmers or ranchers,'' said Rodger Schlickeisen, president
of the Defenders of Wildlife, a national conservation group
advocating the preservation of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the Farm Bureau was in its earlier years, it is now a
gigantic agribusiness and insurance conglomerate that masquerades
as a protector of family farmers,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Defenders of Wildlife, the National Family
Farm Coalition and Friends of the Earth called on lawmakers to
examine whether the bureau unfairly misrepresents its membership.
About 180 other groups signed onto a petition urging the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Farm Bureau dismissed the accusations and urged
Congress to consider the motives of the groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it disconcerting that groups would call for a
congressional investigation of any organization simply because they
disagreed with the policies of that organization,'' said Bob
Stallman, the Farm Bureau's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegations voiced by Defenders of Wildlife and their
supporters are baseless,'' he added. ``We operate lawfully and
ethically.'' More than 4.9 million families in 50 states and Puerto
Rico belong to the Farm Bureau. As the nation's largest farm
organization, it represents the country's farm and ranch families.
</P>
<P>
   The groups criticized the bureau's support for the 1996 Farm
Bill and for ``unfair trade policy.'' They also said the bureau
hinders the family farmer's competitiveness by supporting
corporate-friendly legislation and agendas that control markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going broke,'' said Chris Peterson, an Iowa farmer for 26
years and a bureau member. ``Agribusiness is eliminating us by the
thousands while our government and Farm Bureau stand by and do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Christison, president of the National Family Farm Coalition
and a fourth generation farmer from Missouri, criticized the
bureau's support for granting permanent normal trade relations for
China, saying the policy would harm farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gene Hall, a spokesman at the Texas Farm Bureau, defended
the bureau. He said the organization helped secure $14 billion in
emergency disaster relief in 1998 and 1999 to help farmers recover
from droughts and low commodity prices. 8eu[}$~`fu

HERTA SURVIVES IN `FICKLE BUSINESS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ As late as last week, Bryan Herta's plans
for Grand Prix Sunday were the same as most fans of the annual race
through the streets of Long Beach: Buy a ticket and watch.
</P>
<P>
   That's an odd place to be for a driver who has stood on the
winner's podium the last two years and been one of Long Beach's
most consistently successful drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Since finishing 26th in his first Long Beach Grand Prix in 1995,
Herta has been running at the end of every race and improving each
time out: 12th in 1996, sixth in 1997, and third in 1998 and 1999.
He's finished a mere 35 seconds behind the winners the last three
years. In six years overall on the CART (Championship Auto Racing
Teams) circuit, Herta has two wins, nine podiums (top three) and 41
top 10 finishes in 94 races.
</P>
<P>
   But the vagaries of racing economics almost forced the Valencia
resident to relive his days as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Riding for Team Rahal, Herta finished in the top five in three
of the final four races of 1999, a win at Laguna Seca, fourth in
Houston and fifth in Australia. But racing team dynamics sent him
shopping for a new ride during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually signed late with Forsyth Racing, only to find the
team plagued by mechanical problems, from switching chasis to
getting a car ready to race. The earliest the team will be ready to
race will be May.
</P>
<P>
   It took an injury to rookie Shinji Nakano for Herta to catch a
ride Sunday with Walker Racing. He's on loan with the blessing of
Forsyth and engine maker Honda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bumpy offseason,'' said Herta Tuesday between
practice sessions. ``There was a lot of interest from different
teams this winter, but they were all struggling to find the money
to compete. A lot of them were looking for drivers who could bring
(sponsorship) money with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forsyth looked like a great opportunity, and I think it has
great potential. It's just that the early testing wasn't very good,
and we weren't ready for the start of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta's ordeal is common. The viewing public marvels at the
speed of the cars and the courage of the drivers, but there's a lot
of politics and economics going on behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fickle business,'' Herta said.
</P>
<P>
   Teams often change drivers in the offseason despite good
performances. They also switch to different engines and chassis,
all looking for an edge or better financial teams. Even Chip
Ganassi's team, which has won four consecutive CART season titles,
tweaked its operation for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit frustrating,'' Herta said. ``You put up a
few strong races, you've been around six years, and you think you
shouldn't need to prove yourself. It's part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot that goes into performances. It's never just the
driver alone or the team alone. It's a complex equation, so you
take an opportunity when it comes by.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sunday. Walker Racing has a unique history, so perhaps it
isn't surprising Herta found a ride in their car.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Derrick Walker is a Scotsman who worked at Penske
Racing for several years before launching his own team in 1990.
Among his drivers have been Willy T. Ribbs, the first
African-American to race in the Indy 500, young racing heirs like
Scott Goodyear and Christian Fittipaldi, local heroes like Robby
Gordon, and Japanese drivers like Hiro Matsushita, Naoki Hattori
and Nakano.
</P>
<P>
   Despite stepping into a new car and new driving team, Herta
believes he will competitive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a different feel the seat, the steering wheel,
the shift,'' he said. ``But it's nothing insurmountable. We don't
have the familiarity of having worked together for years we've
never done a pit stop together, and that's important but each day
(of practice) gets a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motivation is to win the race. If I didn't feel that was a
possibility, I wouldn't have agreed to drive. I wouldn't predict
how we'll do, but I wouldn't dismiss a win or a top 10 finish.''
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, Herta is to be admired to be here at all. All
paths in auto racing now lead to the successful NASCAR circuit,
which has been blessed with tremendous growth in exposure, revenue
and sponsorships the last half-decade.
</P>
<P>
   CART has become a bit of the foreign legion the last few years,
with many well-sponsored European and South American drivers and
teams. Herta will be one of only three American drivers on the
streets Sunday. A race once owned by the Unsers has seen Italy's
Alex Zanardi and Colombia's Juan Montoya win the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really wanted to do was stay in CART,'' Herta said.
``Most of the sponsor dollars in the U.S. are going to NASCAR. I
don't think American drivers are having trouble, but teams are
finding it difficult. They're being put in a position where they
have tough choices to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the opportunity the last several years to do
different things. It's not like I couldn't have driven something
else. But Long Beach is my favorite race. It's the race I went to
as a kid, and I fell in love with the (CART) cars. I've been living
a dream all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a dream he won't let end. He just can't predict where it
will take him. He'll race for Walker again later this month, then
check the progress at Forsyth and adjust accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one respect, my year is shot,'' he said. ``There's no way
for me to compete for the (series) championship, and there's no
(sponsorship) pot of gold waiting for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the (Forsyth) team is still intact, waiting at the shop
anxiously for a car, and I have to take (Forsyth) at his word that
we'll race this year. I have to just ride it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's someone else's car.

WEB AIR DEALS: CAVEAT SURFER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB TEDESCHI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, I struck gold on the Internet: a
coast-to-coast round-trip flight to Oakland for $208 after taxes,
to attend a friend's wedding. I hit the ``confirm'' button on
Southwest Airlines' Web site and gloated about it to all my
friends, who exhibited the proper amount of envy.
</P>
<P>
   The other shoe dropped somewhere over Texas, when I realized I'd
misunderstood the travel itinerary on the site, which listed
``PHX/3'' under the list of stops. I assumed that meant the plane
stopped only in Phoenix _ maybe for three hours, but who cares? The
printed confirmation Southwest mailed to me gave me no reason to
doubt this logic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I stopped in Memphis, then Phoenix, then Ontario,
Calif., before heading to Oakland, where I arrived with a sore
backside and a renewed hatred for salted peanuts. Our wry flight
attendant tried to lift the cabin's spirits on the last leg. ``In
the event of a water landing, remember: kick, paddle, kick, paddle
_ all the way until you reach that shore,'' she told us.
</P>
<P>
   I barely cracked a smile. And when I finally reached Oakland, I
greeted my friend with all the warmth of a Soprano. I was toast. I
blamed the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But since I was just as much to blame as the Web, I will be
back. I may not hit the buy button quite as quickly next time, but
given the increasing ranks of the online air fare discounters,
there will still be plenty of good deals available.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, online travel executives and experts said that
consumers could expect this year to be the high point to date for
discount air fare offerings online, as newcomers to the low-price
travel category vie with the airlines, who are working feverishly
to convert their customers to Internet booking.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily because of that competition, sites have improved their
features significantly in the past several months. In addition to
offering low rates on flights you might actually consider booking _
as opposed to, say, the Milwaukee-to-Duluth February special _
airlines and others have made it easier to check flight information
with just a few clicks.
</P>
<P>
   In short, industry experts said comparison shopping would
increasingly pay off _ if consumers will accept higher degrees of
risk and lower levels of customer service, and plenty of surfing
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a buyer's market online,'' said Laurie Berger,
editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter. ``You just have to be a
smart buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried not to take that as a slight.
</P>
<P>
   Any education in discount travel begins with a short course in
yield management, the airline term for determining how many seats
to sell at what cost. In general, airlines know they can't sell
every seat at the high prices business travelers pay on short
notice, so they reserve some seats for the high-price customers and
some for buyers of midrange scheduled fares.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the seats are often sold to consolidators, who buy
the cheap tickets in bulk at widely varying discounts, and resell
them. Because different airlines will have difficulty selling
different routes, there is no set range for the number of seats an
airline will reserve for consolidators.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the quantity, though, the cheapest online tickets are
often available either through virtual travel agents that have
established relationships with consolidators, or through the
consolidators themselves. Lowestfare.com, for instance, is the
consolidator for TWA, and is expanding its offering of consolidator
tickets through agreements with other airlines, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Cheaptickets.com works directly with a number
of airlines to offer their discounted tickets, as does
Priceline.com. With Priceline, the airlines set aside some
discounted seats, and allow the company to sell a seat if it is
within 30 percent of the lowest price the airline has ever sold it
for. Priceline checks to see if it can buy the ticket for less than
the customer's requested price, to ensure some profit. If it can,
it buys the ticket and sells it to the consumer. ``You might think
you're naming your own price for a ticket on Priceline, but you're
really not,'' said Berger. Rather, she said, the company simply
agrees to buy seats from the major carriers at cut-rate prices, and
sells the seats for any price above a certain threshold. Any bid
below that level is declined.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should approach consolidators and those who sell on
their behalf with caution. Since they do not own an unlimited
inventory of seats, they do all they can to discourage customers
from changing flights. In fact, for a number of them, including
Cheaptickets.com and 1Travel.com, domestic tickets are
nonrefundable, and the flights cannot be changed once the ticket is
bought.
</P>
<P>
   These terms are typically offered before you buy the ticket
online, so read every possible link that may contain such language
before entering credit card information.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the final prices for discounted ticket are not
always obvious, analysts said. Cheaptickets.com recently listed a
flight from Hartford to San Francisco on US Airways for $285. On
the ``check availability'' page, the flight suddenly cost $310.50,
not including $3.95 shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On another part of the site, the company stated that ``prices
shown may not include certain taxes, fees, and/or surcharges,'' but
the company asked for credit card information before revealing that
flight's final cost, leaving a customer to e-mail the company
directly for that information or risk clicker shock after
committing to the purchase. (In fact, the company said, the first
price shown reflected the final price.)
</P>
<P>
   While the name-your-own-price offerings _ which now include not
just Priceline but Expedia.com _ include airport taxes and fees
within a user's bid limit, there are other potential glitches to
avoid. Customers can choose the dates they want to fly, but they
cannot currently make a more specific request about what time of
day they will fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone I work with went through Priceline for a three-day
weekend to Florida,'' said Melissa Shore, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, an Internet research firm. ``The flight she got was
cheap, but she had to leave on the last flight Saturday and come
back on the first flight Monday, so instead of a three-day weekend,
she got one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Priceline said recently that it would allow consumers to be more
specific about flight times in the near future. ``So for now, I see
it as a really great thing for college students, who aren't that
concerned about when they fly,'' Shore said.
</P>
<P>
   Other pitfalls await the online buyer. Carl Schmehl, a theater
director in Manhattan, said that he bought a bargain ticket through
Lowestfare &QC; .com last month _ or so he thought. After paying with a
credit card and logging off the site, Lowestfare.com e-mailed him
what he thought was a confirmation notice. In fact, he said, the
message asked him to confirm the flight reservation. When he failed
to respond, he was charged a higher price. Many hours of phone
haggling later, Schmehl said, he got the original price.
</P>
<P>
   Technology can also get in the way of a bargain. My father tried
to reserve through Travelocity last year, but when he hit the buy
button, the site stalled. He restarted the computer and _
suspecting a poor connection _ reordered the tickets. Turns out, he
bought three pairs of tickets, a fact he was alerted to by a phone
call from Travelocity. The site eliminated the charge, but he had
to wait a month for American Express to credit him with the refund.
</P>
<P>
   Shore said that the airlines themselves had gotten much more
aggressive about offering low fares online, in part because they
can fill seats more efficiently through the Internet. Northwest
Airlines has even rolled out a site to compete with consolidators,
airoutlet.com. The site doesn't mention Northwest Airlines _ a
practice followed by many other consolidators because the airlines
prefer not to be known as cut-rate among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are also getting more aggressive about using their
e-mail newsletters to sell seats they haven't committed to
consolidators, and haven't sold to higher paying customers. Most of
the major domestic carriers either have or are in the process of
running an e-mail fare program, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we'll start to see more airlines allow you to filter the
flights, so the e-mail only shows the destinations you're
interested in,'' Shore said. ``I just got a great rate to Dublin
for the weekend through an e-mail newsletter, so it worked for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brag, brag, brag. I'm so happy I'm not like that.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, said that although
consumers might find isolated bargains that were not last-minute
deals, ``in general good deals happen much closer in, at the last
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   And while e-mail newsletters cater to those looking for
last-minute deals online, they aren't the only mechanism for doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   Lastminutetravel.com, for instance, offers the equivalent of an
e-mail newsletter, in real time, from multiple carriers. According
to David Miranda, the company's chief executive, the site allows
carriers to offer their last-minute fares in one place, and drop
their rates if the seats aren't selling. Consumers who click on a
fare are taken to the carrier's site directly to buy the tickets.
In addition, Miranda said, his site automatically sends an e-mail
message to users when offers of possible interest become available.
</P>
<P>
   More mainstream travel sites are also doing more to cater to the
discount traveler, said Terrell Jones, the chief executive of
Travelocity &QC; .com. Jones said Travelocity had a partnership to sell
tickets through Cheaptickets.com on Travelocity's site. The company
also recently announced a deal with Priceline.com. ``Consumers who
want to bid for tickets will have a link to Priceline on our site,
and people on Priceline who read the rules and decide they don't
want to buy that way will have a link to our site,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the dozens of online choices for discount tickets, Berger
said, some consumers may be better served by simply using a travel
agent. ``I can get a great price online because I check the
Internet, travel agents and the airlines directly, even though I
usually book on the Web,'' she said. ``But if you don't know your
way around, there are a lot of opportunities for confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you only go online occasionally, and you don't want to
take the time to really understand how things work, I'd suggest
going the traditional route.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents agree. ``We're not worried about the Internet,''
said Elizabeth Dale, an agent with Dale Johnson Travel in Palo
Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Dale said travel agents could frequently offer more creative
ways to find bargains. For instance, she said, someone traveling
from the East Coast to the West Coast with one connection in
between might get a quote online for one fare. ``But we could break
that into two separate round-trip fares _ from the West Coast to
the connecting city and back, and from the connecting city to the
East Coast and back _ and save them money that way.''
</P>
<P>
   One connecting city? Cheaper fare? I took her number down for
future trips.

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ A huge billboard faces the hotels that line
the seafront here. It shows a smiling President Hafez Assad of
Syria with his arms outstretched like a welcoming host. ``We did
not create the bond between Syria and Lebanon,'' he is saying.
``God did.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a sentiment that most Lebanese share. But 24 years
after Syrian soldiers marched into Lebanon, ostensibly to enforce a
cease-fire in the civil war, Assad remains the man who pulls the
strings in this fractious nation.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing Syrian influence can be seen in the flow of
Syrians into Lebanon to work for $10 a day at Lebanese construction
sites and sell plastic trinkets to motorists at Beirut
intersections. It can be seen in Lebanese markets, where the
unrestricted dumping of cheap Syrian produce has nearly ruined
local farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's hand is seen in Lebanese elections, where candidates
openly critical of its military overlordship suffered such bullying
that they no longer even bother to run for office. Syria controls
the direction of Lebanese foreign policy, particularly the pace and
form of peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 Syrian soldiers, buttressed by an unknown number of
intelligence agents, are based in Lebanon, controlling the legal
and illegal flow of goods across the border as well as the shipment
of arms to the Hezbollah militia, the main group doing battle with
Israeli soldiers in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are everywhere, the Syrians _ stupidly,'' said Walid
Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon's Druse minority whose authority as
a clan chieftain affords him some freedom to speak his mind and who
believes the Syrian behavior unnecessarily creates hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to weaken your opponent, you go to Syria. If you
want to help someone, you go to Syria. If you want a service from
the judiciary, you go to Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   Jumblatt, like many others here, acknowledged that tiny Lebanon
cannot afford to have a hostile relationship with Syria. Still the
Lebanese chafe under the often heavy-handed Syrian dictates, even
as they have come to admit that their faltering country desperately
needs Syria as an economic partner.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has undergone changes from both sides in the
past few years, with the Syrians more subtle in their management
and the Lebanese more open in their desire to define its terms. But
it is still a lopsided arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``After nearly 25 years, they weren't able to swallow this
country,'' said Gibran Tueni, managing director of Lebanon's
largest daily newspaper, An Nahar. ``So we are asking Syria to open
a frank dialogue. We want to be partners _ part of the process and
equal.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Lebanon is weary of ``lying on the table,'' like a card
to be played by one side or the other, ``as the price for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Syrian dominance might be of little concern to anyone but the
Lebanese except for the state of unwavering hostility that exists
between Syria and Israel. Wedged between the two, Lebanon is the
arena where its two more powerful neighbors play out their
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials have not negotiated directly with Israel for
years, leaving their fate up to Syria. But the unalloyed
trepidation with which officials in Beirut greeted Israel's plan to
withdraw from the strip it occupies in south Lebanon has
demonstrated most clearly the force of the ties that bind Lebanon
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than welcoming the unilateral retreat, which Lebanon had
always argued should not be connected to the vagaries of the larger
Middle East peace efforts, President Emile Lahoud now says it must
be accompanied by the resettlement of Palestinian refugees and by
Israel's return of the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud, the former chief of staff of the 65,000-member Lebanese
army, has so far refused even to say if his country will take
charge of liberated Lebanese territory once the Israelis are gone.
He has suggested the south may remain as it has been for years: the
realm of independent warlords and armed militias.
</P>
<P>
   His ambivalence was widely taken to reflect the calculations of
Syria, which has warned that a unilateral withdrawal could be
``suicide'' for Israel and should take place only if and when Syria
decides to make peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of Israeli-Syrian negotiations earlier this year
stirred hopes here that Lebanon might soon become a less important
military card for Syria and, theoretically, could gain more freedom
of maneuver in its own affairs. A peace treaty, it was thought,
would also prompt the protectionist Syrian economy to open up to
the benefit of Lebanon, which has become saddled with debt as it
tries to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks are now stalled. But many Lebanese have now focused
their hopes on a different benefactor _ Assad's son and heir
apparent, Bashar Assad. His office in Damascus has become the home
away from home for Lebanon's political and business elite who are
looking for Syrian patronage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The younger Assad _ he is 35 and studied ophthalmology in
England _ is seen by entrepreneurs in both Lebanon and Syria as a
man open to the introduction of modern technology, free markets and
a more relaxed rein on Lebanon. The appointment of a new Syrian
Cabinet last month, promoted as one that will be tough on
corruption, is credited to Bashar Assad's influence.
</P>
<P>
   His image as a progressive has already encouraged Tueni to
broach a topic rarely discussed in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have visited Lebanon often, and have met with politicians
who undoubtedly told you what you want to hear, not what you ought
to know, about what many Lebanese think of Syrian policy in
Lebanon,'' he wrote in an open letter to Bashar Assad published on
the front page of An Nahar last month. ``Many of those politicians
speak more out of fear of Syria than love.''
</P>
<P>
   Tueni called on Syria to forge a partnership with Lebanon, not
the Lebanese ``political elite,'' as he called them, installed by
Syria. Hundreds of Lebanese expatriates sent the newspaper e-mail
messages congratulating it for confronting Syria. Assad did not
respond.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people here say that Syria has tried to be more
subtle in its relationship with Lebanon in recent years. Not long
ago, President Assad's photograph still adorned every pillar in the
decrepit Beirut international airport, and Syrian soldiers operated
checkpoints at numerous intersections in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   A modern new airport has now been built, and the Syrian's face
no longer greets arriving travelers. A few Syrian army posts remain
in Beirut, but the bulk of the soldiers are based in the Bekaa
region and the cities of northern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On the economic side, the big contracts for the reconstruction
of battle-scarred Beirut have been awarded, ending the wholesale
pursuit by Lebanese entrepreneurs of well-placed Syrian partners to
help them.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebanon, which 30 years ago was a financial and service
center for the Arab world, can no longer compete with newer
financial hubs like the one in Dubai, especially with Lebanon's
debts and its university graduates leaving because of the lack of
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the Lebanese who are pushing for economic access to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who say we will become a financial center _ they're
deluding themselves,'' said Makram Sader, secretary general of the
Association of Lebanese Banks. ``If Syria does not open, we will be
in deep trouble. We will have enormous problems creating new jobs
and economic growth. The Syrian market is vital to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese businessmen, ever hopeful, are banking on hints from
the new Syrian government that it will soon loosen currency
restrictions and allow Lebanese to extend credit and invest there,
whether or not Syria signs a peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Syrians want to be prepared for this opening that would
come with peace,'' said Taha Mikati, a confidant of Bashar Assad.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dot-com workplace is a magnet for young
Americans, with its promise of adventure, riches and a casual work
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the environment may be getting too casual. Managers
at some Internet companies are rethinking their corporate cultures
as a smattering of sexual harassment lawsuits begins to roll into
their high-technology world. Some legal experts think these cases
might be the beginning of a wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet start-up community is going to be a major target
for sexual harassment litigation,'' said Gregory I. Rasin, a senior
partner at the Manhattan office of Jackson Lewis Schnitzler &AMP;
Krupman, an employment law firm that has several dot-com clients.
</P>
<P>
   By nature, these companies are at legal risk because the
entrepreneurs who start them are often eager to create the ultimate
anticorporate environment, said Corey Sprague, director of human
resources at the RiskMetrics Group, an Internet start-up on Wall
Street. ``I get a lot of calls from people who are setting up
dot-com companies and want to create a no-holds-barred, wild
culture, free of rules and policies,'' said Sprague, whose company
is one of the few start-ups that hired human-resources personnel
from the beginning. As a result, she said, most are not eager to
create policies and training programs that address traditional
human resources concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Even managers who are sensitive to issues like sexual harassment
are so focused on raising capital and expanding their businesses
that they neglect to create a human resources department to address
them, said John Iorillo, co-founder of the Ambrose Employer Group,
a provider of human resources services in New York that has more
than 120 dot-com clients. ``For the first few years, most start-ups
are just in survival mode,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case at Pseudo Programs, a Manhattan-based Internet
TV network that was sued in January by a former employee who says
the company had a hostile work environment for women. In her
complaint, the employee, Kelly Alfieri, said male employees at
Pseudo frequently referred to female employees as ``bimbos'' and
forced them to look at sexually explicit material on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo's male employees ``were allowed to do whatever they
wanted,'' said David Jaroslawicz, Alfieri's lawyer. ``It was like
they were living in the Wild West and the sheriff was out of
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Meyer, senior vice president for marketing at Pseudo,
said Alfieri's accusations were ``completely without merit.'' The
company acknowledges that it created a human resources department
only after Alfieri quit Pseudo two years ago. ``As with most
start-ups, our senior management did everything in the beginning,
from putting toilet paper in the bathrooms to payroll,'' Meyer
said. But now, she said, its new department ``continually
reinforces the company's sexual-harassment policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the lack of formal policies and training at many
start-ups is a culture of long hours and close quarters. ``People
are working 80 or 100 hours per week, so the only social contact
they're having is in the context of the workplace,'' said Daniel
Weisberg, an employment-law specialist at Brobeck, Phleger &AMP;
Harrison, a Manhattan-based law firm. As a result, he said,
inner-office dating is rampant, and relationships that go sour have
the potential to turn into sexual harassment complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In one highly publicized example, Juno Online Services, an
Internet company based in Midtown Manhattan, was sued last fall by
two former female employees who said they had been told they would
lose their jobs if they broke off their relationships with senior
executives they were dating. Juno's lawyer, Terri Ross, said the
company denies the accusations in both lawsuits. One lawsuit has
since been referred to arbitration by a New York state court, and
Juno has applied to send the second complaint to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Another common theme in cases he handles, Weisberg said, is that
``the one who was spurned gets terminated or doesn't get the
promotion they thought they should get and decides to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Internet start-ups are often small, with many staff
members working in the same space, other employees are often
unwitting witnesses to office liaisons, according to Garry G.
Mathiason, a partner at Littler Mendelson, a San Francisco
employment-law firm that represents more than 1,000 dot-coms
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mathiason offered the example of a company he represents, where
an employee recently complained that she had walked in on two
co-workers having sex on the office floor. The woman was so
offended, he said, that she immediately quit her job and is
threatening to bring a claim against the company.
</P>
<P>
   While such reports of sexual harassment seem fairly blatant, the
majority of sexual harassment complaints at dot-coms are more
subtle, according to Weisberg. ``The most common problem we hear
about are employees who are offended by all the sexually explicit
e-mail jokes that bounce around these offices,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mathiason recently received a complaint from an employee who
said she had received an e-mail, later traced to a co-worker, that
read, ``I see you're wearing black today. You're a very bad girl,''
and directed her to an X-rated Web site. At another dot-com,
Mathiason said, female employees complained that their male
colleagues were continuously logging onto a Web site featuring
co-eds taking showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of activities seem to predominate in the dot-com
world,'' Mathiason said. ``A lot of these guys haven't been out of
school for very long, and they're still experimenting with this
kind of juvenile stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all managers turn a blind eye to such antics, of course.
Weisberg said his office had fielded several calls from dot-coms
looking to provide sexual harassment training to managers. His
office recently assisted two larger Manhattan-based Internet
companies, DoubleClick Inc. and About.com, in setting up
anti-discrimination training programs. ``We're definitely seeing
more companies take a pro-active stance,'' Weisberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Another start-up, Boutique Y3K, recently appointed a
human-resources manager to oversee its 12 employees. ``We intend to
take issues of harassment and discrimination seriously,'' said Lisa
Tisdale, the new manager.
</P>
<P>
   Those that do not take such issues seriously are looking for
trouble, Mathiason said. ``Right now, you're not seeing as much
litigation as you might expect'' in the dot-com world, he said.
That is partly because the economy is so robust that would-be
plaintiffs are ``getting six job offers on the way to their
lawyers' offices,'' Mathiason said.
</P>
<P>
   But the minute the economy slows, he warned, disgruntled
employees will have fewer opportunities to move on and will be more
likely to go after their deep-pocketed former employers. ``It will
be like an earthquake hit,'' he said.

 &HT;    Ex-Louisiana governor denies casino handlers bought his
influence
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ Former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards said
Tuesday he never took any money in exchange for his political
influence from friends who were applying to the state for riverboat
casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got a cent from Robert Guidry,'' said the 72-year-old
four-time governor, referring to a former colleague who pled guilty
to giving Edwards and his son, Stephen, $1.5 million in payoffs for
help in securing a license for the Treasure Chest casino in
suburban New Orleans. He denied Guidry's testimony that the payoffs
were put in the back of his Chevrolet Suburban and in Dumpsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That never happened in my car,'' he said. ``And Mr. Guidry is
too smart and too cautious to leave money in Dumpsters. It just
didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son, and five other men are on trial for allegedly
corrupting the state's casino licensing system for financial gain.
They have been on trial for 14 weeks, facing 34 counts of
extortion, money laundering and racketeering. Edwards was tried in
the 1980s on federal racketeering charges relating to hospital
contracts, but he has not been convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards spent the morning painting a picture of himself as a
poor Cajun who achieved the American dream of self-made prosperity
and political fame. He said his mother, a midwife who delivered
babies free of charge, taught him the value of doing favors without
asking for compensation. He sometimes made courtroom observers
laugh as he relaxed in his chair and spoke with his trademark
folksy charm. But the jury sat stonefaced, often not looking at
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by federal prosecutor Jim Letten,
Edwards admitted he gave a fellow politician advice on how to
circumvent state campaign finance laws. In a videotape secretly
recorded by the FBI, Edwards gives the lesson to state Sen. Cleo
Fields, a former U.S. congressman and gubernatorial candidate. He
said Fields did not take his advice, so no laws were broken. Letten
countered that even giving the advice was a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to stay within the law, sometimes I don't,'' Edwards
said. ``But I did not violate the federal laws that bring us here
today.''
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Edwards is seen giving Fields $20,000 in cash,
which Fields stuffs in his pants pocket. Edwards testified that the
cash was a gift to help Fields with debts incurred in his run for
governor. But he had trouble explaining why he told Fields he
should be careful how he used the money. Asked how he thought
things were going with his testimony, Edwards smiled and said,
``This is the easy part.''

BUSH CONSULTANT APOLOGIZES FOR LOBBYING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ralph Reed, a senior consultant to Gov. George W.
Bush's presidential campaign, apologized Tuesday for lobbying the
governor on behalf of Microsoft Corp. and promised not to lobby him
again on behalf of Microsoft or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an error that we regret,'' said a statement issued by
Reed's office at Century Strategies, the lobbying and political
consulting firm he heads.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, obviously irritated to learn that one of its
senior consultants was also lobbying the campaign behind the
scenes, said Reed ``made the right decision,'' adding, ``We're
pleased that he will cease his effort to lobby the governor on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A campaign official said the governor had not known that Reed's
organization was lobbying him.
</P>
<P>
   An article Tuesday in The New York Times said Century Strategies
was carrying out a quiet lobbying campaign on behalf of Microsoft
to convince prominent Bush supporters to write Bush on behalf of
Microsoft, in an effort to undermine the government's antitrust
suit against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal judge ruled that Microsoft was in violation
of federal and state antitrust laws. Within a couple of months, the
judge will issue his penalty, or remedy, in the case. It could
range from forcing Microsoft to modify its business practices to
breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft explained that the lobbying effort was intended to
counter ``a comprehensive lobbying campaign by our competitors,''
who have been urging lawmakers and political candidates to support
the government's antitrust suit and call for a tough remedy. A
lobbyist familiar with the Century Strategies effort said one aim
had been to persuade Bush to speak out on Microsoft's behalf in
opposition to the government's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft-Century Strategies lobbying effort had just begun.
In late March, John Podner, senior projects manager for Century
Strategies, sent e-mails to local lobbying firms across the
country, asking them to send him resumes of the Bush supporters who
were to write the letters. Podner said he wanted to make sure they
were sufficiently prominent and influential.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying campaign was to continue through the end of April.
So far, however, the Bush campaign has received just one letter
from a Bush supporter on behalf of Microsoft, a Bush spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed has worked for Microsoft since 1998, the statement said,
but only recently began lobbying Bush on behalf of the company. The
statement said the Century Strategies campaign to lobby Bush was
part of ``a broader program to encourage citizens to express their
views to presidential candidates of both parties, including Al Gore
and Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bush campaign and Century Strategies said Reed had
never personally lobbied Bush and asked him to take a position on
the Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's statement said, ``In an abundance of
caution and to avoid any further misconception, this company has
adopted a policy that we will no longer encourage citizens to make
their views known to Governor Bush on behalf of Microsoft or any
other clients in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, responding to the Century
Strategies statement, said Tuesday evening: ``We think this is a
fine resolution to the issue involving Century Strategies and the
Bush campaign. We will continue to work with Century Strategies and
other firms, both Democratic and Republican, to respond to attacks
by competitors and to insure that our viewpoint is heard.'' &QL;

ABC WILL SHOW PORTION OF DICAPRIO INTERVIEW WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After deliberating for days over whether to use it at
all, ABC News announced Tuesday that it would show some of the
interview of President Clinton by the actor Leonardo DiCaprio in an
upcoming special on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The special is scheduled for broadcast on April 22, which is
Earth Day. DiCaprio is the chairman of the Earth Day 2000
celebration committee.
</P>
<P>
   News of the interview angered some ABC News personnel, who said
it was improper for the organization to dispatch a celebrity to do
what they consider to be the job of a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   David Westin, the president of ABC News, initially said that
DiCaprio had been sent to the White House for a walking tour
focusing on energy efficiency there and that it was the president
who requested a sitdown interview. Because a formal interview
between the celebrity and the president was not what ABC had in
mind, Westin had said, it might not be shown.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said this version of events was
``rife with inaccuracies.'' Westin later confirmed that DiCaprio
did in fact arrive at the White House with questions in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, seemingly weary of the controversy, declined Tuesday to say
exactly how much of the interview would be shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enough conversation before the fact,'' said
Eileen Murphy, an ABC News spokeswoman. ``We prefer to be judged on
the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the project said that the editing process
was continuing but that they expected to use footage of the
interview that focused on what people could do on their own to
protect the environment, not on specific policy issues. DiCaprio is
said to come across as nervous during the interview.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said they decided to use the interview because
DiCaprio _ who is a celebrity co-host to the ABC correspondent
Chris Cuomo for the program _ is serving in the role of an informed
star and is not acting as a journalist.

BACKLASH BREWS IN MIAMI OVER CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related CUBAN-BOY-FATHER, CUBAN-BOY) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Ann Williams, 62, was a child when black Americans
marched and staged sit-ins and defied police. It would be
hypocritical, she said, to condemn Cuban-Americans for doing this,
even if it is the future of one child at stake, not the future of a
people.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others here outside the Cuban exile community,
Williams believes that, now that his father has come for him, the
boy Elian Gonzalez should go back to Cuba. But, she says,
Cuban-Americans had every right to try and stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to fight, and if that means a bunch of cars driving
slow, blocking traffic and waving flags and blowing horns, then
block traffic and blow your horn,'' said Williams, a daytime
dispatcher for a taxi company in the Liberty City district.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few streets away, Garth C. Reeves, the publisher of the
city's black weekly, The Miami Times, did not see shadows of the
civil rights movement in the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better for this community if Elian had
never arrived,'' Reeves said, echoing the sentiments of many people
here who see the case as a simple custody one gone insane from
politics. ``Most black people could care less. They hope he goes
back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where one goes in this diverse city, no matter what
color skin the people have who do the talking, opinions on the
custody standoff and the Cuban-Americans' defiant attitude vary
street to street. Some see the case as a simple matter of a
father's reunification with a son and say it has nothing to do with
them; others get so mad they shake.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans from countries other than Cuba tend, mostly, to
think that the Cuban-Americans are pampered, whining, right-wing
extremists. But some, from countries ruled by dictators, say they
understand the hatred that Cuban exiles spout for Fidel Castro's
government and understand how much this boy's presence here means
to them. Every second he stays defies Castro.
</P>
<P>
   It is a complicated argument in a complicated city, and it has
consumed so much more of it than just a few blocks of Little
Havana, or Miami's exile community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a little upset when they plan these protests, because
all it is doing is making other Miamians hate them for making our
lives miserable,'' said Elba Mejia, 38, from Nicaragua, who added
that she believed that Elian should be sent home. ``They have to
realize there are others here, not just Cubans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lidya Ceballos, 45, who came to Miami from El Salvador,
knows how it is to look back on a government with hostility, and
even fear. ``If he goes back, his mother will have died in vain,
for absolutely no reason,'' Ceballos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should stay,'' added Ceballos, who owns a beauty salon in
Miami. ``I think the government should think this through.''
</P>
<P>
   On and on it goes, with opinions shifting as often as the
accents. Miami, people here said, is a difficult city to live in
anyway with gridlock at all times of the day _ it has been rated
the nation's third most congested city _ falling bond ratings from
governmental mismanagement, and the weather, which can feel like a
hot, wet sock.
</P>
<P>
   If Cuban-Americans think they are angry about Elian, Miamians
said, think how it feels to be locked in traffic by a political
protest that has little or nothing to do with the lives of Anglos,
blacks and other Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has written about Miami's black community for much of
this century, and has seen Cuban-Americans replace Anglos as the
dominant culture here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good relationship,'' he said of the way
Cuban-Americans and blacks get along.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian dispute has only made it worse, Reeves said. Like many
others here, he sees the custody battle and ensuing demonstrations
as a selfish protest that not only disregards years of favorable
American treatment of Cuban exiles, but also selfishly
inconveniences others who have no stake in that fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic here is bad anyway, and with Elian it has been a
nightmare,'' he said. ``You really don't want to see people in your
face when you're trying to get to work or hop a flight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They act like they don't appreciate being here,'' Reeves said
of the Cuban-Americans. ``It's beginning to show.''
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded downtown food court, distinctly Miami in its
diversity, the name Elian is not on the menu. Lunch customers
there, off First Avenue North, waited in line for Argentinian
barbecued beef, and for frozen mango juice and mutton masala, eggs
rolls and empenadas.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were certainly Cuban-Americans at the tables
clustered in the center of the food court most people there had no
personal stake in Elian's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Elian?'' asked Roger David, from Madras, India, as he
waited for Indian food at a counter featuring curried everything
for $3.99. ``He is not on the news in India.''
</P>
<P>
   David came to the United States just a day ago.
</P>
<P>
   But most people here know exactly who the boy is and have a
strong opinion about him _ though many concede they are sick and
tired of him.
</P>
<P>
   Anglos in particular are fed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to know when Elian walks out of his house holding
balloons or when he's playing in his yard,'' said Roman Lurman, 26,
a computer consultant. ``And I don't need you to break into my
programming to tell me that he's just walking out of his house.''
</P>
<P>
   Television stations have adopted what many people only
half-jokingly refer to as ``all Elian, all the time'' programming,
and viewers, including even some Cuban-Americans, are beyond angry.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper readers, likewise, are disgusted with accounts that
seem only to echo the previous day's, and one Miamian compared the
coverage that Elian is still here to the old Saturday Night Live
tag line: ``Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten out of hand,'' Lurman said.
</P>

HOUSTON CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of her heavily scrutinized appearance on stage at
Arista Records' 25th-anniversary bash Monday, Whitney Houston
apparently made a reference to the rumors that drug problems were
threatening her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record's not over yet, remember,'' said the 36-year-old
singer. ``God bless you. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   The r&AMP;b diva then received a standing ovation for a 20-minute
medley designed to set minds at ease that Houston hadn't ruined her
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Poured into a revealing gown and clutching her trademark white
handkerchief, Houston swept on stage shortly after 11 p.m. to
cheers from the rapt crowd, which had sat for four hours while the
taping of the show had crept along at a snail's pace. But the
performance itself quickly took on an air of psychodrama as Houston
stumbled over a cable as she arrived on stage. The crowd gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Later, toward the end of the set, she stopped singing in the
middle of a song and signaled for water. Husband Bobby Brown rushed
on stage with a glass. Houston then kissed Brown, who toweled off
her perspiring forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's singing, however, seemed to put to rest the rumors of
a ravaged voice. She hit the high notes on cue while her creamy,
agile vocal stylings and picture-perfect looks made you think of
the Whitney we've always known.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Houston gave strong, confident readings of six of her
hits _ ``How Will I Know,'' ``I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who
Loves Me),'' ``Exhale (Shoop Shoop)'', ``I Believe in You and Me,''
``I Will Always Love You'' and ``My Love Is Your Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, wearing a leopard dress and white fur jacket, Houston
sat smiling in the audience with her arm resting on the arm of
husband Brown during a short set by Barry Manilow. Seated next to
Arista Records chief Clive Davis, Houston sang along to Manilow's
``I Write the Songs.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Brown later rose to their feet to dance to
``Supernatural,'' performed by Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about Houston and drugs have swirled due to a
much-discussed pullout from last month's Oscars, which her
publicist blamed on a sore throat; reports that airport security
officers in Hawaii found a half-ounce of marijuana in Houston's
bag; and a disjointed magazine interview. Three weeks before the
Oscars, Houston failed to appear at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
dinner, where she was scheduled to help induct Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who didn't appear backstage to talk with reporters, was
part of a gathering of the biggest names in Arista history to
perform for label founder Davis, who signed the songbird when she
was 19. The two-hour special, featuring performances from Aretha
Franklin, Santana, Alan Jackson, Patti Smith, Barry Manilow, Puff
Daddy, Sarah McLachlan and others, will be broadcast May 15 on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Santana and Franklin taped medleys of their biggest hits while
Smith performed ``Because the Night'' with McLachlan on piano. Boy
harmony group LFO sang its smash ``Summer Girls'' to cheers from
teens in the audience.

THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA? WHAT A SCREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 16) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our last family outing to the Great Wall at Mutianyu, 50 miles
north of Beijing, was a fairly typical China experience. We walked
for a couple of hours on the path atop the wall, adults taking in
the history, children running, trudging and grumbling up the
endless steps, playing hide-and-seek in the occasional guard tower.
</P>
<P>
   Mutianyu has one of the most awe-inspiring views in all of
China: the solid ancient wall, studded with parapets, receding
infinitely in either direction over the empty brown hills. The wall
was built by a series of emperors to repel foreign invaders, and
facing north, lost in time, I could almost hear their marauding
footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Almost, that is, were it not for the strains of loud pop music
playing in the background _ loud pop music that reminded my two
children that our hike is just a preamble to the day's real
entertainment. To get off the Great Wall at Mutianyu, you have two
options: a ski lift whose cars tilt in the wind to the
accompaniment of blaring tunes. Or, since 1998, toboggans.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Mutianyu tourist board installed a milelong
aluminum toboggan track that starts at the wall and winds its way
through the woods to the parking lot in the valley. And for my
5-year-old son, Andy, there was no contest. After checking the
brakes, paying about $4, and receiving a quick tutorial, my
husband, Erik, and I, and our children, Andy and Cara, 8, whooshed
off screaming down the track, our backs to ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Great Wall is old, very old. In places it is
crumbling. And in the way of entertainment, there's not inherently
much to do there.
</P>
<P>
   So China's tourist industry is aggressively transforming
historic treasures into something, well, more fun and lively. It's
Ming Dynasty meets Disney, with toboggans.
</P>
<P>
   In fast-paced modern China, the fact that the wall is ancient,
breathtaking and serene never seems quite enough. Consequently, at
Mutianyu, you can hire the Great Wall for a dinner party. At Shan
Hai Guan, where the wall meets the coast, you can make your way
though a giant maze bedecked with flags. And even at the relatively
pristine Jin Shanling site, two hours from Beijing, a developer is
putting the finishing touches on a terrifying-looking ride in which
people hurtle down into that valley buckled into a skimpy harness
that slides down a cable on a wheel stretched high above the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Purists and upscale tourists are predictably offended at how
China has gussied up its historical monuments. But most Chinese,
and all children, seem to love it.
</P>
<P>
   I have often wondered why this blend of cultural history and
low-brow entertainment has found such success on the mainland.
Perhaps it's because this ancient country is so littered with
temples and relics that 2,000-year-old objects do not inspire
immediate awe and reverence here the way they do for Americans, for
whom 200 years is a venerable stretch of time.
</P>
<P>
   Also, perhaps, it is because most Chinese today have lived
though the deprivation of the Mao years, when fun was disdained as
a bourgeois pastime; now they can make up for lost youth.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of such honky-tonk razzle-dazzle is certainly
shocking to many first-time travelers, at odds with the West's
dour, gray image of China.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after moving to Beijing in late 1997, we visited
Beidaihe, the beach resort on the Bohai Sea where China's top
leaders have their annual summer powwow. It may be the most
political beach in the entire world, filled with retreats owned by
ministries and Central Committee members. I expected something
appropriately serious.
</P>
<P>
   But Beidaihe makes Coney Island look sedate. The beachfront is
filled with vendors hawking chances to dress up as emperors or
monkey kings, and young hustlers offering gimmicky photographs. We
left three days later bearing dozens of tchotchkes made of shells _
and stacks of photographs showing my husband and me holding
miniature versions of our kids on outstretched palms, and several
other permutations.
</P>
<P>
   Since that trip, I have found that the urge to jazz up China's
natural and historical bounty is nearly omnipresent, affecting even
the most famous and remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Old Summer Palace, on the outskirts of Beijing, you can
pick your way through ancient ruins and boat on a peaceful
willow-lined lake where emperors once played. But what's that
roaring in the background? In the middle of the grounds, for about
a dollar, you can segue from communing with China's long history to
a sojourn in Jurassic Park.
</P>
<P>
   This small, gory theme park is filled with plastic ferns and
roaring automated creatures, fake blood dripping from their fangs.
Children can even ride on large mechanical stegosauri, perpetually
slightly out of control. Toddlers tend to leave in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise on Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in the remote Yunnan
Province, populated by women and children in bright costumes from
the Naxi, Bai and Tibetan minorities. In its physical beauty, the
mountain rivals the high Swiss Alps, only it is far more untamed
and deserted. Sound too dull? No problem: the locals have organized
an activity. For about a dollar, you can dress up in the flowing
skirts of a Naxi maiden or in the robes, furs and swords of a
Tibetan noble _ for a photo op, of course.
</P>
<P>
   I used to cringe each time I encountered these dress-up stalls
or a magnificent example of ancient architecture bedecked in a
flood of neon. But I've made my peace with the practice. Chinese
tourist sites are, after all, first and foremost for Chinese
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   And if that middle-aged businessman who spent the Cultural
Revolution tending pigs likes the idea of sliding down the Great
Wall on a toboggan, well, the Great Wall is long. I can point my
camera elsewhere on its ramparts.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``added entertainment'' can be fun, if approached with
the right attitude. It's lifesaving if you travel with children,
making even formal gardens and ruins of Song Dynasty temples
acceptable to the under-10's.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one of my favorite Beijing activities is walking
through Beihai Park, the former playground of China's emperors,
with its lily-covered lake, elaborate covered walkways and steep
steps leading up to the odd White Dogoba. B-O-R-I-N-G, yawn my
children. But what if that walk is the route to a boat ride in a
flying saucer?
</P>
<P>
   And so I found myself in Beihai on a recent afternoon, helping
Andy through a small metal hatch, down a ladder, into the innards
of a shaky floating spacecraft. I hit the accelerator and he
steered; we mostly traveled in small circles. For 20 minutes, I got
to see a lovely park _ the dragon boats, the Dogoba _ through our
saucer's tiny porthole, in slivers.

FOR EVERETT, GAME WAS ANYTHING BUT A LOST CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The phone rang inside Carl Everett's locker.
</P>
<P>
   The new Red Sox center fielder had just spent the better part of
an hour explaining how he hadn't been able to find Fenway Park six
hours earlier, driving back and forth along Massachusetts Avenue,
Boston's streets a maze to him, no landmark Green Monster spotted
to guide him, but finally guided home by Red Sox traveling
secretary Jack McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the park at last, Everett promptly homered on his first
Fenway at-bat, against Twins righthander Joe Mays. Then, adding
even more quirkiness to his day, Everett patiently explained how he
is a ``semi-switch hitter,'' sometimes batting left against
lefthanders.
</P>
<P>
   Against Minnesota's Mark Redman, a lefthander who relieved Mays
in the Red Sox' eight-run second inning, Everett first batted
lefty. But after injured third baseman John Valentin chastised him
for such foolishness here (``You're not hitting lefty against no
lefty with that Green Monster out there''), Everett switched to the
right side in the sixth inning. Only to homer again.
</P>
<P>
   And now, all talked out about his zany day, Everett reached for
the cell phone ringing inside his locker.
</P>
<P>
   It was his wife, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' said Everett. ``What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Linda Everett had been driving the streets of Boston for 3
1/2 hours, only to find Fenway Park just as the 33,114 fans were
streaming out, many of them singing the praises of her husband, who
went 3 for 4, with two homers and 3 RBIs in his first game in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's outside now,'' said Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Where did she watch the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``She was driving around the city.
That's what she told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he give his wife directions?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving anyone directions after what happened to me,''
said Everett. ``It kind of scared my wife. I was worried about them
getting lost _ my wife and the kids _ not so much me. I'm a big
boy. I can take care of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett then was able to chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife,'' he said, ``she still hasn't seen any of my
two-homer games.''
</P>
<P>
   And fortunate it was that Everett was able to poke those two
homers Tuesday. Everett had left his new home in Lexington early in
the morning, and while anyone familiar with Eastern Massachusetts
would promptly suggest Route 2 as the easiest way to Boston, no one
dared suggest that route to a newcomer. There aren't enough words
in the English language to explain to a newcomer what to do about
finding Fenway Park after reaching Fresh Pond Circle in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   So Everett went along Route 128 to the Mass. Pike, headed east,
``and I did exactly as they told me to do _ get off at Exit 22
(Copley Square). They said it would be easy from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hah!
</P>
<P>
   Everett got as close to Fenway as Massachusetts Avenue, then
lost his way. Back and forth, up and down Mass. Ave., Everett went
before surrendering. He called McCormick's cell phone (``thank God
he had my number,'' said McCormick), and the traveling secretary
asked the lost center fielder to name the nearest cross street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was near Columbus Avenue,'' said McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little ambiguous,'' said McCormick about guiding a lost
soul from Mass. Ave. to Fenway. Getting over to Beacon Street was
merely a straight line, but what to do after taking a left on
Beacon and finding the right way through Kenmore Square? Beacon
Street goes where Commonwealth Avenue should go, and Comm. Ave.
goes where Beacon Street should go.
</P>
<P>
   So McCormick used the old reliable technique for guiding
tourists through Boston. Don't give them streets, but places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to look out for Pizzeria Uno (in Kenmore Square)
and take a left at Pizzeria Uno,'' said McCormick. ``Then I said,
`You'll see the Cask 'n Flagon and take a left there down Lansdowne
Street.' And I told him he'd see the Green Monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Paydirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame 'em,'' said McCormick. ``Honest to God, it's
hard if you're new to Boston. Those light stanchions, you can't see
them from too many places.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett was thrilled about hitting a homer in his first Fenway
at-bat, batting lefthanded off Mays, but that was routine compared
with what happened next. Everett prefers to bat lefthanded against
lefties who throw more soft stuff than heat.
</P>
<P>
   His first time up against Redman, on his second at-bat in the
second inning, Everett batted left and struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go up there either side against lefties,'' said Everett,
``but that first time a guy was on base and I wanted to hit
lefthanded. And I was swinging good lefthanded at the time. And I
didn't know that much about (Redman) except he doesn't throw that
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he decides ``by feel'' whether to hit righty or
lefty against lefties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel good lefthanded and I feel I can hit the guy
lefthanded, I'll go up there lefthanded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Everett went back into the locker room after striking
out and then walking in the fourth, Valentin told him to bat
righty.
</P>
<P>
   Which Everett did the next time against Redman, in the sixth,
and hit his first blast over the Monster.
</P>
<P>
   And his first impressions of Fenway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Small,'' he said. ``Very small.''
</P>
<P>
   So small it's hard to find.

GARCIAPARRA A HIT, BUT SO WAS EVERETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The crowd around the locker in the Red Sox clubhouse
was four-deep. Nomar Garciaparra, strolling out of the shower, took
one look, shook his head, and did a U-turn into the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Garciaparra came out again for a look. The
area around his locker was still hip-deep in mini-cams. He moved to
the food station, loaded up his plate, sat at a table, and waited
some more.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he looked up and saw some daylight. The crowd
surrounding center fielder Carl Everett had finally dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   Everett deserved the attention after hitting a pair of home runs
and leading a 16-hit Red Sox attack that produced a 13-4 victory
over the Minnesota Twins in Tuesday's home opener at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's contribution was four hits, three runs batted in.
Yet for a solid 40 minutes after the game, the shortstop couldn't
get near his locker.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of things to come?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think Carl being the new guy, they just wanted to get
near him,'' said manager Jimy Williams with a smile and a shrug.
``Having him around helps everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially Garciaparra, who at times last season carried the Red
Sox offense on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't leave this stuff on anybody's shoulders,'' said
Garciaparra, whose opening week of the season had produced only
four hits in 22 at-bats, which had Nomar fans looking for every
excuse from cold weather to bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's 45-degree game-time temperature could hardly be
considered mild, but Garciaparra's hitting luck had changed. It
started in the first when he hit a Joe Mays pitch up the middle for
a run-scoring single. A week ago, it might have been an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar had a good day, as did a few others,'' said Williams,
who watched in delight as the Red Sox broke open the game with an
eight-run second inning that was highlighted by a two-run single by
Garciaparra and the first of Everett's home runs.
</P>
<P>
   After a season-opening West Coast trip that might have ended 0-6
were it not for the magical presence of Pedro Martinez, the Red Sox
need some sort of jump-start.
</P>
<P>
   With snow at the worst and cold at the very best in the forecast
for the home opener, they needed something to invigorate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel the energy out there,'' said Garciaparra, who
in one afternoon raised his average from .182 to .296 and doubled
his hit total for the season. ``The hits were falling today. Last
week they weren't. I guess I had better aim.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Fenway fans had seen the Red Sox was Oct. 18,
in a 6-1 loss to the Yankees in the fifth and final game of the
American League Championship Series. The West Coast struggles
already had some gloom-and-doomers wondering what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The slow start by Garciaparra _ last year's American League
batting champion _ seemed to be another warning sign. When
Garciaparra went three games without a hit last week, it marked the
first time he had such a streak since May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday eased the concerns. Not only for the Red Sox, but also
for Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra came up in the seventh, looking for his first career
five-hit day. A sharp grounder to second was the best he could
manage, and Williams pulled him after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it goes around here,'' Garciaparrra joked.
``Make an out and you're out of there.''

GOP PUSHES GUN BILL THROUGH HOUSE, A WEEK BEFORE COLUMBINE
ANNIVERSARY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas, S.C., La., Col., Fla., Ohio, Md., N.M., Ind.)   (Eds: SUBS 10th graf, On Wednesday ..., to CORRECT, Gephardt from
Missouri.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conceding vulnerability on a hot campaign issue,
House Republican leaders Tuesday sent to the floor a popular
gun-crime bill, written by Republicans, and passed it so they would
have something to show before next week's anniversary of the fatal
shootings at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers voted 358-60 to send $100 million in block grants to
states that impose mandatory jail sentences for gun crimes. Only
six states would now qualify for the grants, but supporters said
that number would grow. All but three Republicans voted in favor of
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders expressed confidence that Tuesday's vote
would arm rank-and-file members heading home for a two-week recess
on Friday with a wide-ranging gun-control bill opposed by the
National Rifle Association and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the party's anxiety over the issue, House
Republican leaders railroaded the bill to the floor under a
time-saving procedure that bars amendments, even though the measure
had only one hearing and no votes in the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership wanted this bill on the floor because the
Columbine anniversary is coming up next week,'' Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., who sponsored the bill, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, introduced a similar bill in the
Senate on Tuesday that has broad Republican support, but will
probably become a magnet for Democratic amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that Tuesday's
House vote was ``a political trap'' for Democrats and ``a cruel
political trick on the American public'' because it failed to pay
for 500 additional federal agents and 1,000 prosecutors that
President Clinton had called for. But Lockhart stopped short of
threatening a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week, Clinton and other gun-control supporters
plan to use the April 20 anniversary of the Colorado school
shooting to spotlight a months-old stalemate over the stalled
gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to Annapolis, Md., on Tuesday for a bill-signing
ceremony that made Maryland the first state in the country to
require built-in safety locks on handguns and other stringent gun
controls.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton and Rep. Dick Gephardt, of Missouri, the
House Democratic leader, will travel to Colorado to throw their
support behind a state ballot initiative to require that all sales
at gun shows, including those by unlicensed dealers, be subject to
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote came at a time when the Federal Trade Commission
has joined five states in an anti-trust inquiry into whether gun
makers are conspiring against Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest
gun maker, which has agreed to restrict how it makes and
distributes handguns.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders Tuesday defended the gun-crime bill and
their tactics. ``The Republican Congress wants to make sure it is
offering a clear, comprehensive approach to reducing gun crimes at
the same time when President Clinton is offering an approach based
on rhetoric rather than results,'' said Jonathan Baron, a spokesman
for Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House measure, states would qualify for grants if they
agreed to set mandatory minimum five-year sentences for criminals
convicted of using or possessing a gun during a violent crime. The
five-year sentence would be in addition to the sentence provided
for the underlying crime. States would also have to agree to
coordinate with federal prosecutors and law-enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions are patterned after Project Exile, a federal
program started in 1997 in Richmond, Va., by a Clinton-appointed
U.S. attorney. Since then, violent crime in Richmond is down by 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The six states that have adopted similar laws since then are
Virginia, Texas, South Carolina, Louisiana, Colorado and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the House bill added new, unnecessary mandatory
minimum jail terms, and relatively small financial incentives to
states that change their laws.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, for example, calls for $100 million in grants over the
next five years, including $10 million next year and $15 million in
2002. The bill broadly defines how states can use the money to
include police, prosecutors, courts and prison expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., said the grants would cover the
incarceration costs of only half a dozen new inmates. ``Although it
sounds good and makes a good slogan, it's not a good policy,'' said
Scott, who added that other cities in Virginia such as Norfolk and
Virginia Beach had reduced their violent crime rates with Project
Exile-type programs.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents retorted that the program was a proven success. ``It
may not be the gun-control agenda of the left, but it works,'' said
Rep. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., R-Md.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., added, ``If you bring a gun into my
neighborhood, I don't want to see you back. It's time to stop the
revolving door of justice and put these people away.''

RAMON MARTINEZ COOL _ THROUGH THE BAD AND THE GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Carl Everett hit a home run. Ramon sat and watched.
Wilton Veras doubled. Ramon sat and watched. It was the beginning
of an eight-run second inning. Ramon Martinez, he of the surgically
repaired shoulder and the Domincan Republic birthplace, sat and
watched.
</P>
<P>
   The game-time temperature was 45 degrees. It was a typical
Fenway Park Opening Day, which is to say it was a fine afternoon
for football. A man can live a hundred lifetimes in the Dominican
Republic and never have to pitch in 45-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon sat and watched through walks and base hits and even an
error. Was he tightening up? For a man with his background and
medical history, that was a fair question. On and on it went until,
finally, Veras lined to third for the final out. It may have been a
10-1 lead, but this was going to be a test for Martinez, who is
generally regarded as the key to the Red Sox' hopes this season. A
good pitcher says thank you to his offense after a big inning by
returning them to the dugout as soon as possible. There was no way
Martinez was going to be allowed to blow the game, but there also
was no way Jimy Williams wanted to get into his bullpen early in
this game, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven pitches,'' beamed pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``Eleven
pitches. 1-2-3, boom. We had the momentum for the rest of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez disposed of the Minnesota Twins on 11 pitches in the
third inning. He likewise sailed through the fourth and fifth
before retiring for the day, his W in this 13-4 game intact and his
spirits on the up-tick. You can forget about that first night in
Seattle. That guy doesn't exist. At least, that's what everyone is
saying. And what everyone also says is that the Ramon Martinez who
got out of a bases-loaded, one-out, one-run in jam in the first and
threw four subsequent scoreless innings was merely a
tip-of-the-iceberg Ramon Martinez, that before the season is over
we're all going to see the real Ramon Martinez, and then we'll know
why Dan Duquette was so eager to get him.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to get technical, we can get technical. After
getting leadoff man Todd Walker in the first, Martinez went walk,
single, single, walk. That's right. He walked in a run. But then he
and catcher Jason Varitek figured out that if his two-seam fastball
was so lively that it was drifting outside the strike zone, then
perhaps things might get better if Varitek would move to his right,
setting up outside the plate and giving Ramon a target that would
allow his ball to become a strike. He got Corey Koskie on a foul
pop to third and Marcus Jensen on a fly to left. Then he came back
to the dugout and vented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon was really upset when he came off the mound following
the first inning,'' reported Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins had a run that Martinez figured would never have been
scored if he had analyzed the situation properly from the get-go.
You must understand that when you're talking about a Martinez
brother, you're talking about someone for whom the game is, as Yogi
Berra would say, ``90 percent half-mental.'' These men pride
themselves on being thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset with myself,'' Martinez said. ``I said, `This is
not going to happen again. I am going to get my rhythm and I am not
going to pitch like that. I may walk four or five guys, but in
seven or eight innings.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are learning a lot about Ramon Martinez. They know,
for example, that just because he is a Dominican, that doesn't mean
they can't count on him for help when the temperature dips a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little worried,'' said Williams, ``but then I saw him
out there in short sleeves. I said, `The man must be feeling pretty
good.' And he never did change. But some guys don't like long
sleeves. They feel freer. They're not restricted.''
</P>
<P>
   Good guess, Skip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel comfortable with long sleeves,'' said Martinez.
``Yes, it was cold, but I decided to go with short sleeves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan had his own weather worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned,'' he said. ``Not from a physical standpoint,
but with the idea of the slickness of the ball. The feel of the
ball is very important to him. He needs to have that feel because
of having two grips on his fastball and his changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching coach has full confidence that Martinez is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bounces back well,'' said Kerrigan. ``We saw that in spring
training. And the day after his start in Seattle he was throwing
long ball and practicing from the stretch. And he wasn't lobbing
the ball, either. So right away we know his arm is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those people who gained more needed insight into the Ramon
Martinez phenomenon Tuesday was his catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got to stay out there and find his rhythm,'' Varitek said.
``He made a big adjustment in the second inning, and an even bigger
adjustment in the third, after we scored all those runs. It was
important to see what he would do with the lead. Your mind can
float a little bit. Ramon did an excellent job of keeping his focus
and throwing a lot of strike ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Do keep in mind that Martinez is just starting his comeback
following major shoulder surgery. He is building arm strength. It
is April. There's a lot of baseball to play. We haven't even had
the Marathon yet. In those terms, he has barely hit Ashland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to get better,'' Martinez said. ``I know I
will pitch better. I've got to keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team has already seen enough of Ramon to know he
is a cut above the ordinary in the categories that transcend mere
physical ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon knows how to forget about his last start, good or bad,''
said Derek Lowe. ``And the way he pitched in that third inning,
after we scored the eight runs . . . he put up that quick zero.
That's very important. It was a tremendous job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't ever get comfortable in Seattle,'' said Varitek,
``and he didn't get off to a great start today. But he found
himself before he got out of that inning, and then once we gave him
a nibble he knew what to do. I hadn't caught him enough to have a
frame of reference, but now I can see what he does when he gets his
feel. And he is a definite `feel' pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   What he can do when he has his feel is get guys out. That
happens to be the basic job description.

ELIAN'S FATHER GREETS ARRAY OF SYMPATHETIC GUESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CUBAN-BOY, CUBAN-BOY-MIAMI) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ He has received the likes of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, bearing comfort for the spirit, and Vicki Martin of
Madison, Wis., bearing cheese for the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first taste of snow, Washington traffic and the media
glare, from the 20 television cameras trained on the house of
Cuba's top diplomat here that is, for now, home.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, 31, an employee at a tourist resort
seeking custody of his 6-year-old shipwrecked son, Elian, left Cuba
on Thursday with a sendoff from President Fidel Castro and then
flew in a private jet to Washington. In short order, over the next
five days, he sat down with Attorney General Janet Reno, chatted
with members of Congress, thanked the fishermen who rescued his son
and greeted 100 people at a reception in his honor at Cuba's de
facto embassy.
</P>
<P>
   If Gonzalez has not exactly taken the town, the town is somewhat
taken by him. His whereabouts are staked out by the news media and,
some assert with dismay, by the Cuban government. But Gonzalez no
doubt has received a memorable taste of America, however limited or
unintended.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Gonzalez sits on the landing of the brick house here
or sees visitors off on the driveway with a wave, now and then
glancing at the media pack.
</P>
<P>
   In private moments, he hands out snapshots of Elian taken in
Cuba. He repeats over and over that he wants his boy and that he
wants to go back to Cuba. He is getting impatient. He speaks to the
boy by phone but only sees him on television. He is concerned that
it looks like Elian has lost weight and chafes when the boy flashes
the victory sign, a sure influence from the Miami relatives whom
visitors say Gonzalez has come to loathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more he sees his son on TV, it's like so close yet so
far,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the former general
secretary of the National Council of Churches, who has visited
Gonzalez several times since his arrival. ``It's like having a
baby. You wait nine months and then the last week is
interminable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has seen at least five members of Congress: a
Republican, Bob Ney of Ohio, and four Democrats, Jose E. Serrano of
New York, Maxine Waters and Barbara Lee of California and Donna
M.C. Christensen, the delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the human thing to do to see how he was doing,'' said
Lee, who visited Gonzalez on Sunday. He showed her the photographs,
explaining it was his way of demonstrating his relationship with
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad this thing is so politicized he has to justify
his fitness as a father,'' said Lee, who had visited Gonzalez in
Cuba in February while attending a trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most spontaneous contact with an American came
Saturday with Martin, who is secretary of the Madison,
Wis.-Camaguey, Cuba Sister City Association. After she told members
of the group she would be in Washington on an unrelated matter,
they suggested she leave a basket of cheese _ a symbol of the state
_ for Gonzalez at the Cuban Interests Section.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived, an official there, struck by the gesture,
arranged for Martin to visit with Gonzalez the next day, she said.
They chatted on the green leather sofa in the living room, which
she said is sparsely appointed with modern furnishings but no
prominent photographs or icons of Cuba or Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I discussed Wisconsin as being the heartland,'' said Martin, a
real estate agent, who visited Cuba three times in the last year.
``He was interested in that. Camaguey is similar. He told me Elian
was very smart, and he thought it was because of the school system
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who attended a reception Sunday night at the interests
section and met Gonzalez there, said Gonzalez expressed ``great
interest'' in U.S.-Cuban relations but ``right now he is guarded in
his comments because he is anxious to get his son back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Gonzalez's visitors all have expressed the
belief that the boy belongs with his father in Cuba, and a number
have visited the country and believe the United States should have
stronger ties. But the contacts have drawn the ire of those who
oppose Castro and who, despite the denials of Cuban officials and
Gonzalez's lawyer, believe Gonzalez's movements and words are
strictly controlled by Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The three Cuban-American members of Congress, who have opposed
Castro for years, said they never received a response to their
invitation to have lunch with Gonzalez, his wife and baby.
</P>
<P>
   Jaqueline Stevens, a spokeswoman for Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart,
R-Fla., one of the Cuban-American congressmen seeking a meeting,
said it was impossible for Gonzalez to speak or visit freely ``when
he is surrounded by people who we believe intimidate him and I'm
sure have done something to scare him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, and a State Department official confirmed, that
although Fernando Remirez de Estenoz, the diplomat in whose home
Gonzalez is living, said on national television last Thursday that
he would waive diplomatic immunity for the residence, the Cubans
never followed through with a formal request to do so. Therefore,
she said, Gonzalez is living on Cuban territory and subject to the
travel restrictions it places on its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Campbell, who has been close to the Gonzalez
family, said she had seen no evidence that Gonzalez's activities
were restricted. She said he has focused his energy on reuniting
with Elian and little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more limited by the press,'' she said. ``He could go out
and walk freely if that is what he wish or that were possible
without being accosted by the press.''

PROMINENT SCIENTISTS URGE DELAY IN MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's proposed national missile defense
system could be fooled by simple decoys or other countermeasures
easily within the grasp of any nation able to launch a nuclear
warhead at the United States, a team of prominent scientists said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, including several who have served in the past on
Defense Department research panels, said that the government should
delay any decision on whether to proceed with a missile-defense
network, which is expected to cost $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see a lot of ways to get around this system and we
presumed that if a country was able to mount a missile attack
against the United States it was also able to use these well-known
countermeasures to confuse or overwhelm this system,'' said Andrew
Sessler of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The study by 11 physicists and engineers was done by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Union of Concerned
Scientists. The scientists based their calculations on
nonclassified information describing the complete missile defense
system from the Pentagon and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists questioned why the Pentagon is waiting until 2005
_ at least five years after President Clinton has said that he will
decide whether to put such a system into operation _ to test
whether its system would be fooled by realistic countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   The initial proposed system of 100 anti-missile missiles ,
ground radar and satellites is meant to protect the nation from a
limited nuclear attack or an accidental launching.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, the scientists argued that if the North Koreans
were sophisticated enough to build an intercontinental ballistic
missile that could threaten the United States, they were clever
enough to use countermeasures such as balloon decoys or an aluminum
shield that could cool a nuclear warhead and thereby deceive an
interceptor.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon called the study's findings premature, saying that
the missile defense system is in the early development stage and
that the main focus for now remains hitting a target, not defeating
countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a prototype and you have to walk before you run,'' said
Mike Biddle, spokesman at the National Missile Defense Office.
</P>
<P>
   In two preliminary tests of the system, the anti-missile missile
or kill vehicle was able to hit a mock warhead only once. As a
result, the Pentagon has delayed a third test until June before
Clinton decides whether to approve the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are arguing to defer the decision until there has been more
research and development, and tests of various systems using real
world conditions,'' said Lisbeth Gronlund, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The panel studied several potential methods that an enemy might
use to defeat the missile shield, including shiny mylar plastic
balloons, like the kind sold in grocery stores, which the
scientists said could easily fool the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   A government intelligence report made public last September
acknowledged that emerging missile states were capable of using
decoys. But Biddle said that, based on classified intelligence
information, the Pentagon is confident that the defense system will
work against against any challenges or countermeasures that could
be mustered by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said that a missile defense system might also be
confused if an enemy enclosed a warhead in an aluminum shield
cooled by liquid nitrogen, foiling the heat-seeking sensors on the
anti-missile missiles sent to destroy the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this defense system the attacker always has the
advantage,'' said George Lewis a panel member from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

 &HT;    The West looks the best in NHL playoffs
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The most dominant team in the NHL this season enters
the most magical part of the season tonight _ the part that makes
51-win years suddenly evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the playoffs, St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, `What have you done for me lately?''' Blues defenseman
Chris Pronger said. ``Who cares what happened in the past?''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis won the Presidents Trophy this season with the
league's best record at 51-20-11. The Blues should not have any
problems in their first-round series against San Jose when the
Stanley Cup playoffs begin tonight at the Kiel Center. But as the
Blues attempt to follow up the Rams' post-season success and make
St. Louis an unlikely City of Champions, there are two statistics
worth noting:
</P>
<P>
   _ Only four of 14 Presidents Trophy winners have gone on to win
the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Blues had a composite record of only 6-7-1 against Dallas,
Colorado and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is particularly important because the balance of
power in the NHL clearly tilts to the West. The Blues, Dallas
Stars, Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings arguably are the
best four teams in the league and potentially could sweep their
respective first-round series. What follows could be the two best
series of the post-season: St. Louis vs. Detroit and Dallas vs.
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think the Cup winner is in the West,'' said
Thrasher center Ray Ferraro. ``The only way it's not in the West is
if they all killed each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado was the league's hottest team the last three weeks of
the season, going 14-2-1 and ripping teams on the power play since
the acquisition of defenseman Ray Bourque from Boston. The Avs did
little celebrating after clinching the Northwest Division title,
for as goalie Patrick Roy said, ``The object is the silver thing in
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In the East, New Jersey, Toronto, Philadelphia, Washington and
Florida all took turns looking like the team to beat. Now it's
easier to decipher why each team won't reached the finals. The
Flyers beat out Jersey for the top seed but are missing coach Roger
Neilson, who is recovering from bone marrow cancer, and center Eric
Lindros, who is nursing a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Philly's first-round opponent is Buffalo _ as in goalie Dominik
Hasek plus 19 other guys. Hasek said of the Flyers, ``They had more
than 100 points, and they have the home-ice advantage. But that
doesn't mean they're going to win.''

MAINE LEGISLATORS BACK PRICE CONTROLS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a slap to the pharmaceutical industry and a rebuke to
Congress, the Maine Legislature on Tuesday became the first in the
country to approve a bill that would clamp sweeping price controls
on medications sold in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Act to Establish Fairer Prescription Drug Prices'' would
immediately establish a pricing board to set suggested lower
prices. If the prices did not fall, then as of Oct 1, 2001, the
board would mandate that all drugs sold in Maine could cost no more
than they would in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The bill must still go to Gov. Angus S. King Jr., who has
remained neutral on it, but it passed by veto-proof margins in both
chambers Tuesday _ 23-9 in the Senate, 102-47 in the House. It is
expected to face legal challenges, in particular on the grounds
that it hinders interstate commerce, but the state attorney general
has testified that he believes the bill can withstand them because
it tries various other measures to hold prices down before putting
controls in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes Maine the first state to say, `Americans shouldn't
be subsidizing low prices for prescription drugs around the world,'
'' state Sen. Chellie Pingree, the Senate's Democratic majority
leader and the bill's primary sponsor. ``The pharmaceutical
industry worked extra hard against this bill, but they had no
argument and this is a huge national issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of medications is particularly an issue in
border states like Maine, where residents can cross into Canada,
which has national health insurance, and reap the benefits of the
discount the Canadian government negotiates with drug companies,
saving as much as 60 or 70 percent on certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont state Senate recently passed a similar bill with
``fair pricing of prescription drugs'' in its title, though it has
yet to be voted on in the state House of Representatives. The New
England states have also formed a coalition to try to present a
united front on drug prices, whether through local price controls
or pooling their residents to demand mass discounts. The
legislative leaders in the coalition argue that virtually every
other country negotiates a low price for their drugs with the
industry, so Americans end up footing the bill for all the research
that benefits everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' said Peter Shumlin, president pro tem of the
Vermont state Senate, ``is to have a number of states move forward
simultaneously to send a message to the pharmaceutical industry
that people in New England are sick and tired of paying a 60 to 80
percent premium for drugs made in America, and _ I think we share
this view with our friends in Maine _ as long as the pharmaceutical
industry remains the top donor to members in both parties in
Congress, not much will happen there; it's going to have to happen
state by state.''
</P>
<P>
   To backers of the pharmaceutical industry, that goal is deeply
misguided, as is the Maine bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like they're claiming this is a win for the
Legislature, but I think it's a detrimental blow to patients in
Maine who need access to medicine,'' said Gabrielle Williams, a
spokeswoman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, the Washington-based trade association. ``It could have
significant impacts on access to certain medications in Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays in setting prices could bring delays in access to new
drugs, she said. Also, price controls remove the financial
incentive for research and development to create new miracle drugs,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   And some fear that manufacturers would refuse to sell drugs in
Maine. The bill's backers say that would be a public relations
disaster for the companies.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of local opposition to the bill in Maine as
well. On Monday, a group of doctors, biotechnology backers and
senior citizens' groups held a news conference to oppose the bill,
saying they worried that price controls might restrict access to
some drugs. They called for changes in insurance programs to make
drugs more affordable for old people rather than for universal
price controls.
</P>
<P>
   Others sounded like Clyde E. Dyar, the economic and community
development director for the town of Fairfield, who worried that
the bill would chill investment in Maine's small biotechnology
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put price controls on in Maine, and we don't do it
nationally, then it puts an onus on companies not to do business in
Maine,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Why don't we start in
Louisiana? Why don't we start in Texas? Why don't we do it on the
national level, where it belongs? Why do we impose a hardship on
Maine? It's tough enough as it is to do economic development in
Maine. This puts another cross upon us to carry.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the bill came to the floor of both chambers Tuesday,
Pingree said, the debate was lengthy largely because so many
lawmakers wanted to share what they and their constituents had
experienced buying medicine. Ultimately, the support for the bill
crossed party lines. Also spurring the vote was testimony from
hundreds of elderly Mainers at a public hearing last month; many
described choosing between paying for their medication or basics
like food and rent.
</P>
<P>
   The energy with which lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry
opposed the bill may also have backfired. Pingree said that on the
day the legislative committee that handled the bill was about to
vote, ``There were something like 20 industry lobbyists there and
three charter jets at the Augusta airport _ everyone was joking
about it because that's a rare sight here in Augusta, a town of
40,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maine bill sets aside $200,000 for its legal defense. It
lays out the composition of an 11-member pricing board and lays out
several interim measures meant to reduce prices. The state-mandated
pricing is not to come into effect if prices can be lowered by
those other means.
</P>
<P>
   Shumlin of Vermont said he did not believe any other states were
planning to pass similar bills in this legislative session, which
is already winding down in Maine and elsewhere, though many other
states are tackling drug prices in other ways. But the two senators
seemed mighty happy with their own two-state rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bills in Maine and Vermont, ator Pingree said, is
``absolutely a shot across the bow of excessive pricing by the
pharmaceutical industry.''

 &HT;    AUDIT CALLS HUD STOREFRONT OFFICES, KIOSKS WASTEFUL
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has spent more than $8.5 million to set up
``customer-friendly'' storefront offices and outdoor kiosks that
have little practical value, according to HUD's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, to be released Wednesday, charges that HUD began
building the new facilities without a clear plan or justification
and has failed to provide evidence of their usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Costs for the storefronts are ``excessive and the benefits
derived by the customers are not measurable,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit examined neighborhood-style offices in six cities, as
well as 73 kiosks, which provide information on touch-screen
computers around the clock. Most states have at least one of the
unstaffed kiosks, which are placed in public sites such as shopping
malls, city halls and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Cities that now have HUD storefronts include Albuquerque, N.M.;
Baltimore, Buffalo, N.Y.; Reno, Nev.; Sacramento, Calif., and
Washington. HUD plans to establish at least 10 more storefronts
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's storefront opened on Marietta Street near the Five
Points MARTA station on Feb. 28, too late to be part of the audit.
</P>
<P>
   The new style of office was launched two years ago by HUD
Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who predicted the new service centers would
``translate the lofty ideals of government reinvention into the
down-to-earth reality of improved performance.''
</P>
<P>
   More accessible than a high-rise office, the new facilities are
designed to provide sites for community meetings, training
sessions, and brochures on federal housing programs.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Deputy Secretary Saul N. Ramirez defended the concept as a
plan ``to remove the distance between government and people.'' He
disputed the conclusions of the inspector general report, saying
that they were ``simply wrong'' or ``demonstrate a lack of
understanding of the purposes'' of the storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ramirez conceded that the program could use
better monitoring of its customer service and storefront
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the offices includes a nearby kiosk. Operating just six
of the new offices and kiosks will cost $3.8 million a year, the
inspector general said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal auditors concluded that the storefronts were only
marginally useful because HUD's ``primary'' customers are not
walk-in clients but public housing authorities, lenders and
community groups. The study found these customers generally met
with HUD officials at sites other than the storefront offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer service provided by the storefront staff was not very
effective,'' the audit concluded after surveying a list of local
contacts provided by the HUD offices. The report said that no
reliable statistics exist on how many people are using the kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also noted that the storefront offices were designed
to be staffed by so-called HUD's ``community builders.'' That
program was killed by Congress, amid charges from Republicans that
it had become a haven for political patronage.

RED SOX TRIUMPH AGAINST TWINS IN HOME OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan was speaking of Ramon
Martinez, but he unwittingly touched upon a broader theme of the
13-4, welcome-home, 100th anniversary party the Red Sox threw for
themselves Tuesday afternoon at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew somehow, someway, he'd find it,'' Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan was referring to the way Martinez righted himself
against the Minnesota Twins after a rough first inning. But he just
as easily could have been talking about newcomer Carl Everett and
rookie Wilton Veras, who were among the Sox players who had trouble
negotiating the correct route to Fenway Park for Tuesday's home
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Everett arrived 10 minutes after everyone else was dressed, with
traveling secretary Jack McCormick bringing him in by cellular
phone, like an air traffic controller guiding an airplane in
distress to a safe landing. Veras, answering a summons from
Pawtucket along with reliever Rob Stanifer, made it in time, but
not before they made a couple of passes by the ballpark on streets
choked with traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, however, no one in a Sox uniform had to be pointed
in the direction of home. With Everett hitting two home runs, one
from each side of the plate, and Nomar Garciaparra stroking four
singles, driving in three runs, and scoring two, the Sox scored
twice in the first, eight times in the second, and three more times
in the sixth while collecting 16 hits in their most lopsided
home-opening win since they spanked the 1995 version of Tom Kelly's
Twinkies, 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   Every player in the starting lineup had at least one hit except
for DH Brian Daubach, whose first-inning sacrifice fly gave the Sox
a 2-1 lead. Leadoff man Jose Offerman was on base five times _
three walks and two singles _ and Veras and catcher Jason Varitek
had two hits apiece against the vertically challenged Twins, who
tortured Kelly with an assortment of misplays that included dropped
popups and falling outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a baseball game,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly would have a hard time convincing the Fenway faithful of
that on a day where the temperature (45) matched this season's
price of a top ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Everett, making his Fenway Park debut,
homered onto the tarp in center field while batting lefthanded
against righthander Joe Mays to touch off the second-inning rally.
He was turned around in the sixth and took lefty Mark Redman into
the left-field screen. Everett had faced Redman from the left side
when he whiffed to end the second and walked in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's got power from both sides,'' said manager Jimy
Williams after Everett went deep from both sides for the fourth
time in his career and became the third Sox player to accomplish
the feat, joining Luis Alicea (1995) and Reggie Smith (1973).
</P>
<P>
   ``If I call him Carl, is he going to hit lefthanded against
lefties? And if I call him `E,' is he going to bat righthanded?''
Williams said. ``I don't know. Anyway, it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who also walked and doubled, pointed heavenward twice,
a la Tom Gordon, as he circled the bases following his first home
run, then cocked another finger at the fans as he headed for the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go up to the plate, I'm thankful,'' he said.
``There's not too many people can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on whether a Stephen King novel is in the works, but
clearly Everett brings a high entertainment quotient to Yawkey Way,
even if he has trouble finding it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our showing today, you can see why they're excited,'' Everett
said of the sellout crowd of 33,114 that kept warm by leaping to
their feet for so many standing ovations that it looked like a
Richard Simmons aerobics class. ``And if we continue to play like
this, they'll be excited all summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Veras, who had a terrific spring in Florida but still was sent
to the minors, was recalled because John Valentin's left knee is
acting up again. His ground-rule double following a walk to Mike
Stanley galvanized the Sox again in the second, when they sent 13
batters to the plate and expanded their lead from 2-1 to 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was happy for me,'' Veras said.
</P>
<P>
   It was even more so for Martinez, who walked home a run in the
first inning but left the bases full of Twins, then spun four
shutout innings before departing after five, sufficient labor to be
credited with his first win this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys (the Sox) are a good hitting team,'' said Martinez,
who lasted just four outs in a 9-3 loss in Seattle in his first
start. ``The pitchers, we've got to do the pitching. We'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero, who also lost to Seattle in his first start, draws
the Twins Wednesday ight at Fenway Park. No, he doesn't need a
compass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living downtown _ I know how to get to the ballpark,'' he
said. ``Some of those taxis I've taken over the years, I paid
attention.''

   Fitness magazine's regular ``Fit People'' column this month
focuses on  &UR; Hilary Swank &LR; , who just won an Oscar for her
performance in ``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you think she looked a little thin when she received the
award? The magazine describes her training regime and passes along
several of her exercises. ``In six weeks,'' said her personal
trainer,  &UR; Rich Guzman &LR; , ``she dropped her body fat from 22 percent
to 12 percent, and at 5'8'' weighed 115 at her leanest.''
</P>
<P>
   Standard body fat recommendations at high levels of fitness are
21 to 24 percent. Even the editors feel compelled to note that at
Swank's height, ``125 to 160 pounds is a healthier range.''
</P>
<P>
   And 5-foot-1  &UR; Janeane Garofalo &LR; , Marie Claire magazine cover
girl, said she's ``down to 110 pounds. But I'm not proud of losing
weight. It's been a sell-out. I lost weight so I could be
considered for a wider range of acting jobs. I don't pretend that
it's a health kick or that it's just to feel better about myself.
I'm smoking a lot more _ about a half a pack to two packs a day _
and drinking more coffee and Diet Coke and more water, which I
hate. I joined Crunch gym and went for three weeks, but then I
stopped because I couldn't handle the workouts. I continue to
fantasize about what I really want to eat every f_ day. I don't
think I'm sexy, but I do get a lot more compliments now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the British government's minister for women has
announced a June conference of fashion executives, models and
health experts on the pressure on young women to be thin. Many
young women suffer, said  &UR; Tessa Jowell &LR; , ``because they can't match

`BIG DIG' CHIEF FORCED OUT IN BOSTON AND ACCUSED OF HIDING COST
OVERRUN

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The overseer of the most expensive public works project
under way in America, Boston's ``Big Dig,'' was abruptly asked to
step down Tuesday after federal auditors denounced him for staying
deceptively mum for months about $1.4 billion in looming cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
   The dig, its price tag expected to be possibly $2.8 billion over
budget, at $13.6 billion and rising, is about two-thirds finished.
</P>
<P>
   At its completion, scheduled for 2004, it will have sunk
Boston's raised Central Artery underground, erected two bridges
across the Charles River and linked the Massachusetts Turnpike with
Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   For all the criticism of the ousted supervisor, James J.
Kerasiotes, the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority,
the Big Dig will tunnel onward, but under different leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts governor, Paul Cellucci, announced Tuesday
that after reviewing a 48-page audit report by the Federal Highway
Administration criticizing the dig's management, he had asked
Kerasiotes to resign and would replace him with Andrew S. Natsios,
the state's secretary of administration and finance. About 60
percent of the dig's money comes from the federal government, but
its management is under state control.
</P>
<P>
   One of the auditors' most serious criticisms of Kerasiotes was
that he knew of the cost overruns two months before a bond issue
for the project in December, but said nothing about the budget
problems until February.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors' report said the silence kept by dig managers about
cost overruns ``stands as one of the most flagrant breaches of the
integrity of the federal/state partnership in the history of the
nearly 85-year-old federal-aid highway program.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who did not appoint Kerasiotes but has defended him in
the past, took a more understanding view. ``In his zeal to finish
this project,'' Cellucci said, ``he forgot something that's pretty
fundamental in a democracy, and that is that the citizens have the
right to know what it's going to cost. Certainly, the Federal
Highway Administration has the right to have the information.''
</P>
<P>
   The new top digger, Natsios, speaking with Cellucci to reporters
in Boston, said he understood that one of his jobs now was to keep
the project ``completely transparent,'' along with looking for ways
to save money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the big dig needs now is a change in culture,'' said
Natsios, who is known as being so fiscally stingy that a conference
table in his office displays a red sign with the simple word
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's action, Cellucci said, apparently came as a surprise
to Kerasiotes, who has overseen the project since its beginning in
1991 and has been saying for weeks that despite the mounting
criticism of him, he planned to see the project through to its end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult phone call,'' Cellucci said. ``It was not
what he was expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes was not available for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The direct source of trouble for Kerasiotes was his long and
aggressive insistence that the project would come in on its $10.8
billion budget and on time. When he suddenly announced in February
that in fact the project was going to be $1.4 billion over budget,
the critics he had been quashing rose up against him with renewed
energy. And the federal officials responsible for the dig's
oversight were unpleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper problem, it would seem, was his personality. He has
been called a bully by his critics, and is known for his fierce and
bullish style. An aggressive nature seemed in place when he could
argue that it took a tough man to build a tough project
efficiently; but with the cost overrun and recent reports in The
Boston Globe that Big Dig contractors were routinely running amok
financially, he no longer looked tough where it counted most.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes has not said what he plans to do next, but in a
recent interview he said that he had given up plans to hold public
office and expected to return to the private sector when his work
with the dig was done.

LAKERS GET A CONFIDENCE BUILDER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The Lakers didn't thrive without Shaquille
O'Neal, they merely survived. And if he returns Friday night, as
expected, the final tally will be: one ugly loss, one thrilling
overtime win, and the confidence that, if necessary, they can
compete with O'Neal on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was very important that we got a win without him in
the lineup,'' said Glen Rice, the hero of Monday's overtime win
over Seattle.``We'd definitely love to have him, but there's going
to be situations where he may be in foul trouble, and we've got to
believe that we can go out there and play without him.''
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, the Lakers won't have to prove that point
again anytime soon. Coach Phil Jackson gave the team two days off,
and by the time the Lakers practice again Thursday, O'Neal will
have rested his sprained left ankle for a week.
</P>
<P>
   He almost certainly will play Friday night, when the Lakers play
host to the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The win Monday was the Lakers' first in three Shaq-less games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know when we get Shaq back in that 5-spot (the center
position), we're going to be a good team,'' Ron Harper said. ``He's
a player this team needs to have, and we need him back. So whenever
he feels like playing basketball again, there's a suit there for
him. ... I would love to have Shaq back, but on his own time.''
</P>
<P>
   And though the Lakers suffered an 18-point rout against the
Spurs and shot 35.8 percent over the last two games, Harper said
the malaise was due to more than just O'Neal's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand, we've got a large lead here (in the
standings), and it's late during this long, long season,'' Harper
said, ``and so we're not playing hard, but we're just going out
there and trying to have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Healing time: The two off days will be good not only for O'Neal,
but for Derek Fisher (bone spur in left ankle), Robert Horry (sore
knees) and others with various untold bumps and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have time off during this late run,'' said
Harper, who suffers knee tendinitis. ``This is good for our team.
There's some guys who are hurt, guys who need good days off. I'm
definitely going to enjoy my days off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who already have won home-court advantage throughout
the playoffs, have four games left and a chance to tie the club
record of 69 wins. They have home games against Sacramento and
Minnesota before concluding the season at Dallas and San Antonio.

CLINTON MEETS WITH ISRAELI LEADER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although President Clinton had hoped to give a
nudge to the Middle East peace negotiations, he emerged from an
hourlong meeting on Tuesday night with the Israeli prime minister,
Ehud Barak, without any new proposals, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit at the White House, suggested by the Israelis, came at
an especially crucial time, with negotiations with Syria stalled,
the deadline for a framework agreement with the Palestinians
looming and the troop withdrawal from Lebanon also nearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are difficult negotiations and discussions, and it's
important that from time to time they meet face to face to take
stock and look at ways that we can ensure that the process stays on
track,'' said the White House's spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, speaking to reporters before the Oval Office meeting,
said he hoped the session would provide ``new energy and momentum
to the timeline that we have set.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton said the session was not intended to produce
any dramatic developments. Instead, Clinton sought to hear Barak's
views before a planned session with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sought to brief Barak on his recent meeting in
Geneva with Hafez Assad, the Syrian president, which revealed
differences that appeared irreconcilable in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said at a brief public appearance before the meeting
with the Israeli leader that while there were ``still differences''
with Assad, ``that's no bleaker than before we met.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of violence accompanying Israel's
withdrawal from Lebanon, Clinton remarked: ``If Israel pulls out in
accordance with the United Nations resolution, what justification
will anyone have for violence? They've been asking for this for
years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked if he expected the reaction to be peaceful
or serene, Clinton said, ``Serene is a word not normally used in
the context of the Middle East these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other issues Clinton raised was Israel's sale to the
Chinese of military technology, which critics argue was produced
with American financial and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Raising particular concern at the Pentagon is the proposed sale
to China of the Israeli-made Falcon early-warning radar system,
which is similar to the aerial reconnaissance radar in Boeing AWACS
planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about that,'' Clinton told reporters in the Rose
Garden before the session. ``You know I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who also met with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, turned
aside questions about the sale, offering only, ``We'll discuss
that.''

TEXAS HIGH COURT RULES AGAINST GIRL, 17, IN ABORTION CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled a
17-year-old girl cannot have an abortion without first notifying
her parents, even though her parents kicked an older sister out of
the house when that girl revealed she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in the case of Jane Doe 4 marks the first time the
state high court has rejected a minor girl's plea for a judicial
bypass around telling her parents that she is seeking an abortion.
The parental notification law was passed by the Texas Legislature
last year and signed by Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Three other girls have had their requests for judicial bypass
turned down by trial courts, but the Supreme Court returned each of
those cases to the lower court for further consideration. Because
of the cloak of confidentiality on these cases, it is unclear what
has happened to those girls.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Doe 4's plea for judicial bypass was rejected by a trial
court last month, but the Supreme Court returned it for further
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   That triggered a tirade by Justice Nathan Hecht that some of his
colleagues were trying to undermine the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or six justices in an Austin courthouse are ensuring that
minors throughout the state, sight unseen, can obtain abortions
without telling their parents,'' Hecht wrote in his dissent to the
6-3 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, all nine justices ruled against the girl.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a judicial bypass, a girl must demonstrate to the
court that she is mature and informed enough to make a decision or
that it would not be in her best interest to tell her parents.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion signed by seven of the justices said the girl lacks
the maturity and information to make a decision on an abortion
without notifying her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told the judge she spoke to a doctor and testified that a
past medical problem may make an abortion more complicated, but
(she) was unable to explain how or in what way it might be,'' the
opinion said. ``This demonstrated a lack of comprehension about the
specific risks of the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices said the girl's increased medical risk also
enhanced the justification for a trial judge to have ruled against
her on the question of what is in her best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial judge could have determined that the girl's
particular physical needs and possibility of physical danger
outweighed the potential disruption of her family relationship,''
the opinion said.
</P>
<P>
   In the court's March 22 ruling in the case, the justices noted
that the girl told them that when her sister told her parents about
being pregnant, the parents kicked the girl out of the house, cut
off support and have not spoken to her since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doe believes that her parents would treat her similarly if
notified that she is pregnant and seeking an abortion,'' the
justices wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the court also noted that the girl's testimony left gaps in
the story as to whether there were other reasons why the parents
kicked the older sister out of the house and cut off contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no clear evidence that the minor would suffer the
same fate as her sister should she tell her parents,'' the court
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hecht and Justice Priscilla Owen joined the majority in
Tuesday's ruling, they also criticized it in a concurring opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Court's reasoning shows that it continues to minimize
parents rights to help children decide whether to have an
abortion,'' Hecht and Owen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Kae McClaughlin of the Texas Abortion Rights Action League said
nothing in Tuesday's ruling will force the girl to carry a baby to
term.
</P>
<P>
   McClaughlin said the girl might tell her parents, might go to a
state like New Mexico or Oklahoma that do not have parental
notification laws or might just seek out an unlicensed abortionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to note that no court, no judge, no law can
tell the girl to tell her parents,'' McClaughlin said. ``It just
leaves her without a safe medical procedure.''

JUDGES' EX-WIVES SAY SUIT WILL ALLEGE MALE-BIASED LEGAL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Wendelboe is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest fallout from the infamous New Hampshire divorce
that sparked a judicial crisis, the ex-wives of five New Hampshire
judges have banded together with plans to file a federal lawsuit,
claiming that a close-knit network of lawyers and judges prevented
them from getting a fair shake in divorce court.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing complaints made by Judith O. Thayer in her divorce from
former Supreme Court Justice W. Stephen Thayer, the women claim
that New Hampshire's old-boy legal community denied them proper
legal representation, forcing two of the women to rely on a
non-lawyer who describes himself as a ``legal reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Thayer resigned from the court a week and a half ago
amid charges he had tried to intervene in cases in which he had an
interest, including his own divorce. The Chief Justice is facing
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   While some fear the crisis is causing the state's legal system
irreparable harm, the ex-wives of some judges and lawyers say it
may have served some public good. Finally, they say, others are
seeing just how unfair that system is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief to know that I'm not alone,'' said Betsy
Millard, who got divorced in 1985 from a trial attorney who has
since become a state Superior Court Judge. But ``to feel that I'm
not so isolated _ that's not comforting. That's profoundly
disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Millard and at least four other women, whose ex-husbands are
judges on various levels in the state, have expressed interest in
the not-yet-filed suit. The effort is being spearheaded by Caroline
Douglas, a lawyer whose torrid divorce from former Supreme Court
Justice Charles Douglas drew national attention. It is unclear
whether Judith Thayer plans to be part of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The women plan to argue that their divorce court troubles
represented gender discrimination and violated their rights to
equal protection under the law.
</P>
<P>
   And while some legal experts say the lawsuit's chances of
success are slim, some New Hampshire attorneys and political
leaders say the case still highlights a difficult truth about the
New Hampshire legal community. It's sometimes hard for the spouse
of a lawyer or judge to get represenation at all, they say, in a
small, close-knit state where the chances are high that a judge's
and lawyer's paths will cross again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty small world up there in New Hampshire, in the
judicial circles,'' said Millard, who now lives in New Mexico. And
some lawyers, she said, seem to fear that ``if they know they're
going up before a judge, that they may have to pay a price down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   When her case began, Millard said, she felt coerced into taking
what she now considers bad legal advice: accepting every intial
demand from her ex-husband, who later became a Superior Court
judge. In the protracted child-support battle that has followed,
Millard said, she has felt bombarded with motions. And she has
wound up braving the New Hampshire legal system without a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire state Representative Francine Wendelboe said she
has heard similar complaints from a number of judges' and
attorney's ex-wives. She has become a clearinghouse of sorts for
their complaints, after she raised public concerns about similar
patterns in the Thayer and Douglas cases.
</P>
<P>
   After Thayer's resignation, Wendelboe sent a letter to state
legislative leaders, suggesting the state should examine every
divorce case involving a member of the judiciary, and perhaps every
member of the bar. After a story about her quest ran in the
Union-Leader of Manchester, she said, ``all of a sudden, I started
having these women calling me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some were ex-wives of judges, she said. Others were ex-wives of
lawyers. Many had similar complaints. Some said their cases had
been bounced around to different courts, or that they had been
bombarded with motions from hyper-aggressive lawyers. Others said
that while their ex-husbands could get free representation from
friends, they had to scramble to pay for legal help _ and sometimes
had to search to even find it.
</P>
<P>
   It can be tough to find representation in such highly-charged
cases, said Karen Heller, who practices family law in Manchester,
N.H., and recently tried to find representation for two different
judges' wives. She had declined their cases herself, she said,
because she has a policy of not handling open cases. But when she
shopped around for other lawyers, she found few who would touch the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Many didn't want to get themselves into legal battles that would
lead to future conflicts of interest for themselves or their firms,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a problem because New Hampshire is so small,''
Heller said. Many lawyers practice across the state and deal with
many judges, she said, instead of concentrating their work in
particular counties with more self-contained legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers have the option of settling their disputes with binding
arbitration, but some choose not to do so, Heller said. And while
it's possible, in some cases, to try divorce cases in other states,
she said, many divorce lawyers are far more comfortable practicing
in their own states, where the judges and legal precedents are more
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, complaints about unfair treatment in divorce courts
are more often raised by men, who sometimes complain that the
courts demonstrate bias against fathers, said Jack Beerman, a
professor at the Boston University School of Law, where Stephen
Thayer has taught.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-wives' legal challenge, Beerman said, would likely face
some serious hurdles in the federal courts, which are reluctant to
touch family-law cases in general, and tend to avoid broad attacts
on the way state courts operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal courts stay out of these kinds of disputes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendelboe questions how many women will ultimately join the
case, after all. ``It's a disorganized effort,'' she said. ``They
have not filed a suit yet. I don't think they've signed on the
dotted line.'' Because it is so early in the process, it is unclear
who would be named as defendants in the suit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they might be willing to go public with their
stories, they might not be willing to go through the expense and
the emotional turmoil'' of reopening proceedings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the divorce court controversy has sparked much discussion
in legislative circles, Wendelboe said. Since the majority of
judges in New Hampshire are men, some have seen the case as a
feminist issue, she said. But some male legislators have raised
concerns about the saga, as well, she said, wondering if judges and
lawyers have been able to shield themselves unfairly from
divorce-court woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides aren't particularly happy,'' Wendelboe said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans said Tuesday that their proposal
for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, to be announced this
week, would use private insurance subsidized by the government to
help pay the drug costs for millions of people who are elderly or
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement will be a milestone on the road to such
coverage, a firm proposal by leaders of the majority party in the
House that says how they would spend up to $40 billion over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican working on the proposal said Tuesday: ``Our plan is
very similar to the president's, but better. We'll offer a
voluntary drug benefit, available to all Medicare beneficiaries and
run by the private sector, as the president wants.''
</P>
<P>
   In his plan, President Clinton specifies details of the basic
drug benefit, including the co-payments charged to beneficiaries;
House Republicans will invite private insurers to offer a variety
of competing drug plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could pick the policy that best suited you, depending on
your needs and your income,'' said a Republican working on the
proposal. ``There would be more choice, more variety in the design
of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans will announce their proposal a few days before
the spring recess, when Democrats plan to hit the issue hard in
political events around the country. ``Our guys couldn't go home
empty-handed,'' one representative said.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing their proposal with Clinton's, House Republicans said
their plan would provide more definite protection to people with
high drug expenses; less insurance for routine, ordinary drug
expenses; and less of a subsidy to affluent Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's plan, the government would directly
subsidize premiums for everyone who signed up for drug benefits.
Under the House Republican plan, the main subsidy would be
indirect: the government would pay most of the costs for a small
number of beneficiaries with the highest drug expenses, so that
insurers could charge lower premiums to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the House said that they, like Clinton, would
also provide financial assistance to low-income beneficiaries. The
details have not been decided, they said, but they want to pay the
premiums and perhaps other costs for people with incomes up to 35
percent or 50 percent above the poverty level. Under federal
guidelines, a couple is classified as poor if has less than $11,250
of income this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said he did not know all the details of the House Republican
proposal. ``But from what we gather,'' he said, ``it appears to be
a structurally unworkable policy that does not ensure access to
affordable prescription drugs for all beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they had consulted with the presidential
campaign of Gov. George W. Bush. But the proposal was devised
mainly by senior Republicans on the two House committees that share
authority over Medicare. Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois
supervised the process; Rep. Bill Thomas of California had the
biggest role in shaping the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate have approved budget blueprints
that would provide up to $40 billion over five years for Medicare
drug benefits, roughly the same amount envisioned in the first five
years of the Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
   In a document describing their proposal, House Republicans said
it would provide ``a voluntary private drug coverage option for all
seniors.'' This approach is favored by the drug industry but
opposed by the Health Insurance Association of America, which says
its members are not interested in selling drug insurance because
they could not keep the premiums affordable.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they would try to overcome the insurance
industry's objections by having the government pick up most of the
cost for a small number of beneficiaries with very high drug
expenses. This would permit insurers to charge lower premiums _ and
is therefore a kind of indirect subsidy _ to all Medicare
beneficiaries who buy drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Drug expenses are highly concentrated; 5 percent of Medicare
beneficiaries have drug costs exceeding $5,000 a year, but they
account for 29 percent of all spending on drugs by people in
Medicare's conventional fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans will not be too specific this week. But they
said that under their proposal, the government might pay 80 percent
of the costs for the 5 percent of beneficiaries with the highest
drug expenses. Insurers would be responsible for the remainder of
those costs, so they would have a financial incentive to control
the use of prescription drugs, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   While clearly not embracing the House Republican plan, Charles
N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, said: ``This proposal is different from others we have
seen in the past. We need to study it before we decide what
position to take on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa J. Raines, senior vice president of Genzyme, the
biotechnology company, said: ``The House Republican proposal for a
high-risk insurance pool, with significant federal subsidies, is an
important intellectual contribution to the debate. This could bring
down premiums 25 percent below what they would otherwise be. It
would help drug-benefit plans manage their financial exposure,
thereby making the Medicare market more attractive to them.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they would create a new entity, separate
from the agency that now runs Medicare, to administer the drug
program. Republicans said the new entity, known as the Medicare
board, could eventually supervise the health maintenance
organizations that now provide care to 6.6 million of the 39
million Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the Republican proposal, prepared by the House
Commerce Committee, describes it this way: ``All Medicare
beneficiaries would have the option of purchasing drug coverage
through the board. The board would contract with insurers operating
on both a local and national basis and would provide information to
beneficiaries about their options.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they assumed that insurers would work
with companies that have years of experience in managing drug
benefits. Such ``pharmacy benefit managers'' typically negotiate
with drug manufacturers to obtain large discounts for their
customers.

AETNA SETTLES TEXAS SUIT AND AGREES TO CURTAIL DOCTOR INCENTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc., the nation's largest managed-care insurer, settled a
lawsuit in Texas Tuesday by agreeing to change several practices
that doctors and consumer advocates portrayed as undermining
patient care, like rewarding physicians who stayed within cost
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said it was ready to make similar changes in other states,
but officials in New York and Connecticut said that, on first look,
the Texas concessions were not far-reaching enough to satisfy their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were the first since the company's new chief
executive, William H. Donaldson, pledged last month to improve
Aetna U.S. Healthcare's relations with doctors.
</P>
<P>
   John Cornyn, the attorney general of Texas, said the agreement
would curtail financial incentives that ``tempt doctors to deny
necessary medical care'' by linking their incomes to holding down
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said it would stop paying a set amount for each
health-plan member to doctors whose practices have fewer than 100
health maintenance organization members; instead, they would be
paid a fee for each service. Doctors with more than 100 HMO members
would continue to be paid per member.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said he hoped the settlement would be a precedent for
settling other lawsuits against insurance companies like Humana
Inc., PacifiCare and the NYLcare unit that Aetna was forced to sell
to Texas Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the changes, resulting from a year-long
negotiation with the attorney general, would also let patients take
appeals to independent reviewers when payments are denied for
prescription drugs, emergency care, and procedures regarded as
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to recently passed laws in most states that require
outside reviews, Aetna had earlier established external review for
denials of other types of care that are deemed medically
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna will also publish a pamphlet explaining how it pays
doctors in Texas, and it will establish a company omsbudsman to
support customers who have health insurance complaints. The
attorney general's office will oversee the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American Medical Association and the Texas
Medical Association said the agreement was a step in the right
direction. But they said it showed the need for national patients'
rights legislation that would remove obstacles to medical
malpractice lawsuits against insurers. Employers and insurers
strongly oppose that right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna officials said the agreement, in which the company
acknowledges no wrongdoing, would take the wind out of the sails of
class-action lawsuits pending against Aetna and other managed-care
companies. But a spokesman for lawyers in several of the suits
argued Tuesday that the agreement would strengthen the plaintiffs'
criticism of Aetna and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ross, a vice president of the Texas Medical Association,
said Aetna had made ``a significant shift, for complex reasons that
I am sure were associated with their stock price.'' Aetna's shares
have rebounded recently after dropping sharply when the lawsuits
were filed. They gained 18.75 cents Tuesday, to $58.25 each, on the
New York Stock Exchange, still 40 percent lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In another move long demanded by medical associations, Aetna
said that it would no longer insist that Texas doctors in small
group practices accept low-paying members of health maintenance
organizations or give up the business of other, better-paying Aetna
networks. The rule still applies to groups of 10 or more primary
care doctors and 25 or more specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fundamental change in our business model,'' said Dr.
Arthur Leibowitz, chief medical officer of Aetna U.S. Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   David F. Simon, chief legal counsel of the health care unit,
said he had offered to discuss changes based on the Texas agreement
with Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, and
Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general of New York. Both officials
said they would meet with Aetna but also planned to proceed with
previously announced investigations of its practices.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who has sued Physicians Health Plan, a big
Connecticut-based HMO, said the practice of paying a set amount for
each patient should be ended for all doctors _ not just those with
relatively few HMO patients.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brown, a spokesman for Spitzer, said his investigation
would also continue. The New York attorney general has been
examining Aetna's methods of approving or denying payment for care.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said that the ``No. 1 concern'' of the HMO industry was to
set up procedures that would resolve their problems without facing
lawsuits in which individuals have won awards as high as $100
million. There are 40 individual suits pending against Aetna in
addition to seven class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Texas agreement, he noted, Aetna could be fined or
held in contempt, but there would not be punitive damages like
those that the class-action lawyers, fresh from lucrative victories
against cigarette makers, were expected to seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money in it for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joey Langston of Booneville, Miss., national coordinator for
many of the class-action lawyers, said that Aetna, in the Texas
agreement, acknowledged problems that ``are part of the factual
basis for our claims.'' The plaintiffs will ask Aetna to ``make
accommodations to patients and enrollees who have been harmed by
these policies over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   A special panel of federal judges is expected to decide soon
whether the class-action suits nationwide should be consolidated in
one court.

OPERATION SMILE ACTS ON RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE CONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acknowledging for the first time that its organization lacked
proper oversight, the charity Operation Smile notified its chapters
last week that it was enacting sweeping changes at the suggestion
of an outside lawyer retained by the organization to review its
conduct. The changes are aimed at addressing criticism that arose
last year over the charity's management and the quality of its
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The charity, which helps thousands of underprivileged children
overseas obtain plastic surgery, said it would step up efforts to
hire a new chief executive and would add the position of chief
medical officer. The charity also intends to strengthen its board's
supervision of the volunteer medical staff. Two articles published
by The New York Times last year reported on deaths and health
complications among some of the children under the care of the
charity.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter circulated among the charity's staff members and
volunteers in recent weeks, David N. Ventker, an Operation Smile
director, also disclosed that the review of the organization's
conduct uncovered ``isolated instances of inadequately documented
expenditures and other record-keeping issues.'' Without providing
further details, he said that ``all such expenses have been
reimbursed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the charity promised last November to make public the
full findings of the review by the outside lawyer, a spokeswoman
said Operation Smile now considered it an internal review. F.
Bradford Stillman, a lawyer from Norfolk, Va., who performed the
review, did not respond Tuesday to a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some members who left the board last year in frustration
expressed disappointment that the charity was not being more open
about the findings of its investigation and more direct in
addressing specific concerns. ``They did themselves a disservice,''
said one of those who resigned, Stephen H. O'Connor, president of
New Brunswick Tomorrow, a New Jersey civic group. ``It raises more
questions than it answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded by William P. Magee Jr., a plastic surgeon, and his
wife, Kathleen, in 1982, Operation Smile sends volunteer doctors
and nurses to poor countries to perform surgery on children with
facial deformities like cleft lips and palates. The charity had
long enjoyed the unstinting support of major corporations like
Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Warner-Lambert and many celebrities. But last
year the charity came under increasing criticism from volunteers,
members of its board and foreign doctors, who said the charity was
practicing assembly-line medicine by putting volume ahead of
patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   Amid much of the uproar, the charity's chief executive resigned
under pressure, several directors left the board, and some key
donors like Warner-Lambert withdrew their support.
</P>
<P>
   Though Magee has adamantly defended the quality of the charity's
surgeries, he declined to comment Tuesday, and Ventker, the
director who signed the letter, did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Ventker's letter, which was dated March 30 and written after the
board had a chance to digest Stillman's report, stated quite
plainly that the charity's board thought that ``there is room for
improvement.'' ``There is no evidence of cover-up or destruction of
records,'' he wrote. ``Indeed, the board was aware of the deaths in
the field, including China, Kenya and Vietnam, which were
documented by the media, but it is also clear that the board lacked
an appreciation for medical issues and complications which occurred
in these and other cases, and that it has not provided the
oversight required.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' Ventker's letter continued, ``the board has
determined that we need to place greater emphasis on issues related
to quality assurance and the standard of medicine to be practiced
in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was first made public by The Virginian-Pilot
newspaper in Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that does not appear to be changing is Magee's role as
chairman of the charity, according to Lisa Jardanhazy, a
spokeswoman for Operation Smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board of directors is committed to professional
management, and the board does include Dr. Magee,'' said William C.
Wren, a regional airports commission executive in Minneapolis who
serves on the Operation Smile board.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the charity reached Tuesday would not disclose any
additional information on the financial irregularities that were
uncovered in the review other than to confirm that Stillman had
retained PricewaterhouseCoopers to help review records and look
into concerns over financial mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   No action has been taken against any individuals, according to
Jardanhazy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though Ventker's letter said that ``fiscal policies and
procedures will be tightened and improved, and will be closely
monitored by the board of directors,'' Jardanhazy could not
elaborate on any specific steps to be taken by Operation Smile.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also said that as it replaces directors who have
resigned, Operation Smile will include more representatives from
the charity's chapters.

QUARTEY READY, WEIGHTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS - Felix Trinidad, who had difficulty making 147 pounds
when he was a welterweight, was like a new fighter when he moved up
to 154 to challenge David Reid in March. He seemed to be stronger,
faster, better. And he won easily.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ike Quartey experience the same thing when he faces IBF
junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas here on Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   One of few knocks against Quartey is that he tends to fade late
in fights. He seemed to do so against Oscar De La Hoya in February
of last year, when De La Hoya rallied in the late rounds to win a
controversial decision that Quartey still disputes.
</P>
<P>
   If Quartey (begin ital)did(end ital) fade, adviser Godwin Asifo
suggested, it was because he had difficulty making the 147-pound
weight limit. He reportedly had to lose more than 10 pounds in the
final weeks to reach that figure.
</P>
<P>
   If true, that might also explain at least in part Quartey's
uncharacteristic lack of aggression against De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a difficult time (with weight),'' Asifo said. ``And
when you have a difficult time, you don't want to spend yourself.
You want to pace yourself. That limits your aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (154) is comfortable, this is where he should be. Just
like Trinidad.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Vargas is expected to face Trinidad if he can get
by Quartey, and one would think Quartey would have the same option
if (begin ital)he(end ital) wins.
</P>
<P>
   However, Quartey said he'd rather fight De La Hoya again first.
</P>
<P>
   He said the fact he lost a controversial decision to De La Hoya
no longer bothers him, but he seems to remain bitter - ``I think I
won the fight, that's it'' - and clearly wants to set the record
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to fight Oscar (rather than Trinidad). I want to
prove I'm the best fighter in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's a problem: De La Hoya fights at 147 pounds
while Quartey fights at 154.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would be willing to move to the other's weight, but
there might be an opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be willing to do it at a catch weight (between the
two weights),'' Asifo said.
</P>
<P>
   No respect: Quartey isn't showing Vargas much respect.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas has repeatedly employed the fight's slogan in pre-fight
hype, ``Two Warriors, One War,'' the implication being he will
stand toe-to-toe with a fighter known for his physical strength.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey doesn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's going to fight (aggressively),'' he said.
``He's not as strong as (Jose Luis) Lopez (with whom Quartey drew).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too young (22) to go to war.''
</P>
<P>
   New 'do: Quartey, from Ghana, Africa, is sporting striking
bleach-blond hair ``to change my image,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea, but Quartey has a long way to go: He's one of
the most soft-spoken, taciturn fighters around. And while English
is a primary language of Ghana, his accent is so thick it's
difficult to understand him.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate for him because fighters rely heavily upon
self promotion.

PHILADELPHIA SUES 14 HANDGUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Texas, Conn., Ga.)   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philadelphia filed a lawsuit against 14 handgun makers Tuesday,
despite a new Pennsylvania law that prohibits such suits, charging
the manufacturers with negligently distributing their products to
make it easy for criminals and juveniles to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's action brings to 31 the number of cities or
counties to sue the gun industry over the past year and a half and
adds to the pressure on the firearms companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia lawsuit, like most of the other cities', has a
dual purpose. The cities hope to receive damage awards to offset
the costs of hospital care and police services related to gun
crime, and they also hope the courts would order gun makers to
change their practices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the gun makers named in Philadelphia's suit is Smith &AMP;
Wesson, even though several cities, along with the states of New
York and Connecticut and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, have dropped claims against the company after it
agreed to broad restrictions on the ways it makes and distributes
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   A Philadelphia official said the city was unwilling to waive
claims against Smith &AMP; Wesson without a better agreement that
forced the company to give documents to the cities that would be
useful in the suits against other gun makers, and that provided
some financial settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's lawsuit is in many ways similar to those brought
by a number of the other cities and counties, said David Kairys, a
professor of law at Temple University who is an adviser to
Philadelphia and many of the other municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how the lawsuits against the gun makers are
spreading, a number of organizations representing community groups
joined Philadelphia. These included Guardian Civic League, a group
representing black police officers in Philadelphia, Aspira Inc., an
organization that provides services for Hispanic youths in the
city, and the Residents Advisory Board, which represents public
housing residents.
</P>
<P>
   The groups do not give Philadelphia any greater legal claim,
Kairys said. ``But I think they will help in court because it makes
it clear that this kind of reckless proliferation of handguns
really is a nuisance with a significant effect on the tenor of
everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   One challenge for Philadelphia is that the state legislature
passed a law late last year barring cities from suing the gun
industry, a law similar to that passed in more than a dozen states,
including Texas and Georgia, where the legislature is sympathetic
to the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Trujillo, the Philadelphia city solicitor, said he did
not believe the law would be an obstacle because it only prohibited
cities from filing suits against legal marketing practices by the
gun manufacturers. But, Trujillo said, ``Our lawsuit is based on
the claim that their marketing practices are illegal and a public
nuisance, and under Pennsylvania law a public nuisance is a
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that the gun makers have made no efforts to
stop what are known as straw purchases, when a person without a
criminal record buys a gun on behalf of a criminal who is barred
from buying the gun himself, nor have they attempted to cut off
suspicious customers who make repeated purchases of large numbers
of cheap semiautomatic pistols that are likely destined for
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, one straw purchaser in Philadelphia bought 41 handguns
in six weeks, the suit said, while another bought 57 in three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendants knowingly and recklessly market and distribute
handguns _ a product designed to kill that is the primary tool for
violent crime _ in a manner that facilitates their use in crime in
the city of Philadelphia,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on studies by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, the suit also said that the ``defendants produce, market
and distribute substantially more handguns than they reasonably
expect to sell to law-abiding purchasers, knowingly participating
in and facilitating the criminal handgun market.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 13 other gun makers named in the suit were Beretta USA
Corp., Bryco Arms Inc., Colt's Manufacturing Co., Glock Inc. and
Sturm, Ruger and Co.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the past two weeks, the gun makers have been hit
by the announcement that six states have begun an antitrust
investigation of the gun industry to determine whether it has
engaged in a conspiracy to damage Smith &AMP; Wesson after it agreed to
the restrictions.

OPPOSITION LEADER CALLS FOR PROTESTS UNLESS THERE IS RUNOFF
ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Preparing for what appeared to be an expected
announcement that President Alberto Fujimori had squeaked out a
victory in Sunday's election, his opponent, Alejandro Toledo, said
on Tuesday that he would not accept anything short of a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted he would take part in a second round only if the
electoral agencies were totally revamped since the first round
provoked charges of fraud from official election monitors and the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said on
Tuesday that the United States would raise ``serious questions'' if
Peru did not hold a second round of voting. ``We expect there will
be a runoff, and I think serious questions will be raised if the
vote count indicated something otherwise,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   With 90.82 percent of the official vote count complete, the
central election authority reported on Tuesday evening that
Fujimori had won 49.79 percent of the vote to Toledo's 40.39
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate needs 50 percent plus one vote to avert a runoff.
The latest count actually showed a slight decrease in Fujimori's
percentage from tallies earlier in the day, but his vote percentage
could climb again as ballots come in from remote jungle and Andean
villages where the president is strongly supported by Indian
voters. International election observers also say that election
controls were least stringent in such areas.
</P>
<P>
   The government said final results will be released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who is running for a third five-year term, has denied
that anything but minimal irregularities took place, and said he
would resist suggestions by the Clinton administration, several
European governments and Peru's congressionally-appointed ombudsman
that a second round vote be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to accept the will of the Peruvian people,''
Fujimori told reporters on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, the Organization of American States and several
Peruvian and international election monitoring and polling groups
reported that quick-counts of sample vote tally sheets indicated
that Fujimori fell at least two percentage points short of a
majority. Several polls of voters leaving the voting sites actually
had Toledo, a 54-year-old business school professor, ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Organization of American States observation team
has publicly criticized long and unexplained delays in the delivery
of ballots and tally sheets to computer centers, and he said
monitors could not determine where the counts were taking place.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports that on some ballots the names of rivals
to Fujimori were waxed over, so that only his name could be marked;
that in some cases ballots had been printed without Toledo's
photograph, and that some ballots were pre-marked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, election authorities completed their count by midnight
of election day and released total unofficial results the next day.
In that election, Fujimori vanquished several opponents with almost
two-thirds of the official count.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Peruvian election officials said they would deliver a
reliable _ if not the absolutely official _ total vote count within
24 hours of the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Toledo said he would lead nonstop peaceful
demonstrations across Peru. But he also reached out to the
military, appealing to it not to take part in election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to invoke the pride of the Peruvian armed forces,''
Toledo told a throng of thousands of people who gathered in
downtown Lima on Tuesday afternoon, ``so that they resist the
pressures they are now under to block the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``we need a change of chef and waiters,'' he
demanded that he be allowed the equal access to television networks
that he had been denied in the first-round campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing his words carefully, Toledo appealed to the people to
remain calm, adding, ``I am not going to be responsible for putting
fuel on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's calls for protests came as tens of thousands of
demonstrators gathered in Lima, Iquitos, Arequipa and several other
cities, blocking traffic, honking car horns and picketing outside
government facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The police stepped up patrols of the cities with armored trucks
mounted with water canon. Army and police units around the
presidential palace were reinforced.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Toledo replaced the faded jeans and red bandanna he has worn the
last few days with a dark suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   While calling on Fujimori to meet with him to resolve growing
tensions, Toledo provocatively suggested that there was a growing
level of discontent over the election process in the armed forces,
which remain a powerful political force in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know I can't reveal,'' he said. Then directing his
remarks to the armed forces, he said, ``I am asking that they not
be pressured to continue breaking the rules. I ask that they not
participate more in the polarization among Peruvians.''
</P>
<P>
   A restructuring of the military command late last year put
allies of Fujimori's intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, in
all the top assignments in the Defense Ministry and in regional
headquarters. But many junior officers, spurred on by retired
senior officers, are said to be upset with the way the election was
handled and the way promotions in the military now depend on
political connections to Fujimori and his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a chorus of criticism by former officers has been
retired Gen. Francisco Morales Bermudez, the last military dictator
who ruled Peru in the late 1970s. In an interview with the
newspaper El Comercio published on Tuesday, he was quoted as
saying, ``This is the most fraudulent and aberrant election process
in our national history. Toledo was really the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the campaign, Toledo appealed for support among the army
and police, promising to raise salaries and give soldiers the right
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senior aides to Toledo said he was in contact with influential
officers in the army, but they did not reveal the content of the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has never held high government office, and he is
virtually untested as a leader. His political party, Peru Posible,
is little more than a civic group and does not have a strong
organization. But in his surprising surge in the final weeks of the
campaign, he connected strongly with working- class urban voters,
millions of whom like him are of mixed Indian-Latino blood. He
attracted large crowds in the campaign throughout the country, even
though he did not have the funds to offer supporters food or
transportation as is customary in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a bricklayer and fish monger, one who shined shoes as
a boy and won scholarships to earn two masters degrees and a
doctorate in the United States, Toledo was viewed as the embodiment
of a Peruvian dream come true. He has promised to be ``the
president of the poor'' even while offering a centrist platform
that includes government loans to small business to create jobs and
tax incentives to export-oriented industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo has been widely criticized for leading tens of
thousands of people on the presidential palace Sunday night before
more than a few official results were even counted. Protesters set
bonfires in front of the palace before police fired tear gas to
disperse the crowd, and some businesses in downtown Lima were
vandalized.

GOP PUSHES GUN BILL THROUGH HOUSE, A WEEK BEFORE COLUMBINE
ANNIVERSARY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas, S.C., La., Col., Fla., Ohio, Md., N.M., Ind.)   (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to clarify, NRA supports bill approved
Tuesday, opposes a separate bill that had been bottled up in
Congress.) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conceding vulnerability on a hot campaign issue,
House Republican leaders Tuesday sent to the floor a popular
gun-crime bill, written by Republicans, and passed it so they would
have something to show before next week's anniversary of the fatal
shootings at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers voted 358-60 to send $100 million in block grants to
states that impose mandatory jail sentences for gun crimes. Only
six states would now qualify for the grants, but supporters said
that number would grow. All but three Republicans voted in favor of
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders expressed confidence that Tuesday's vote
would give rank-and-file members heading home for a two-week recess
on Friday ammunition against accusations that the Republican-led
Congress was bottling up a separate wide-ranging gun-control bill
that is opposed by the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the party's anxiety over the issue, House
Republican leaders railroaded the bill to the floor under a
time-saving procedure that bars amendments, even though the measure
had only one hearing and no votes in the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership wanted this bill on the floor because the
Columbine anniversary is coming up next week,'' Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., who sponsored the bill, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, introduced a similar bill in the
Senate on Tuesday that has broad Republican support, but will
probably become a magnet for Democratic amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that Tuesday's
House vote was ``a political trap'' for Democrats and ``a cruel
political trick on the American public'' because it failed to pay
for 500 additional federal agents and 1,000 prosecutors that
President Clinton had called for. But Lockhart stopped short of
threatening a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   In the next week, Clinton and other gun-control supporters plan
to use the April 20 anniversary of the Colorado school shooting to
spotlight a months-old stalemate over the stalled gun-control
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to Annapolis, Md., on Tuesday for a bill-signing
ceremony that made Maryland the first state in the country to
require built-in safety locks on handguns and other stringent gun
controls.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton and Rep. Dick Gephardt, of Missouri, the
House Democratic leader, will travel to Colorado to throw their
support behind a state ballot initiative to require that all sales
at gun shows, including those by unlicensed dealers, be subject to
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote came at a time when the Federal Trade Commission
has joined five states in an anti-trust inquiry into whether gun
makers are conspiring against Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest
gun maker, which has agreed to restrict how it makes and
distributes handguns.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders Tuesday defended the gun-crime bill and
their tactics. ``The Republican Congress wants to make sure it is
offering a clear, comprehensive approach to reducing gun crimes at
the same time when President Clinton is offering an approach based
on rhetoric rather than results,'' said Jonathan Baron, a spokesman
for Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House measure, states would qualify for grants if they
agreed to set mandatory minimum five-year sentences for criminals
convicted of using or possessing a gun during a violent crime. The
five-year sentence would be in addition to the sentence provided
for the underlying crime. States would also have to agree to
coordinate with federal prosecutors and law-enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions are patterned after Project Exile, a federal
program started in 1997 in Richmond, Va., by a Clinton-appointed
U.S. attorney. Since then, violent crime in Richmond has fallen 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The six states that have adopted similar laws since then, and
which would be eligible for the grant money, are Virginia, Texas,
South Carolina, Louisiana, Colorado and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the House bill added new, unnecessary mandatory
minimum jail terms, and relatively small financial incentives to
states that change their laws.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, for example, calls for $100 million in grants over the
next five years, including $10 million next year and $15 million in
2002. The bill broadly defines how states can use the money to
include the police, prosecutors, courts and expanding prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., said the grants would cover the
incarceration costs of only half a dozen new inmates. ``Although it
sounds good and makes a good slogan, it's not a good policy,'' said
Scott, who added that other cities in Virginia such as Norfolk and
Virginia Beach had reduced their violent-crime rates with Project
Exile-type programs.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents retorted that the program was a proven success. ``It
may not be the gun-control agenda of the left, but it works,'' said
Rep. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., R-Md.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., added, ``If you bring a gun into my
neighborhood, I don't want to see you back. It's time to stop the
revolving door of justice and put these people away.''

 GORE BRUSHES UP ON POLITICAL LESSONS WHILE ATTENDING ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The last time a vice president tried to help a
student spell a word with the national press corps watching, he put
an ``e'' at the end of ``potato,'' suffered national humiliation
and lost the election that fall.
</P>
<P>
   So it was perhaps with Dan Quayle in mind that Vice President Al
Gore stayed mum Tuesday while observing first graders at Avondale
Elementary School struggle to spell ``sincerely.'' (The kids and
their teacher spelled it ``sincerly.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous, I guess,'' said the teacher, Stacie
Magill.
</P>
<P>
   And who could blame her, with the room packed with television
crews, newspaper reporters and photographers recording the second
installment of what Gore calls ``school days,'' his all-day tours
of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The events have provided Gore, the presumptive Democratic
nominee for president, a forum in which to show his concern about
education, praise the work of teachers _ whose national unions
support him _ and talk up his proposals for expanding
prekindergarten programs, rebuilding aging schools, reducing class
sizes and helping parents afford college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale offered a useful backdrop for many of those issues. The
109-year-old building, though in good condition, needs an
air-conditioning system and is overcrowded: during recess, children
watch television sitting in hallways; art and music classes are
held in a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   And the school, which is in one of Columbus' poorest
neighborhoods, is a showcase for an array of government programs:
more than 90 percent of its children qualify for subsidized
lunches, it receives federal Title I funds and many of its students
attend remedial reading classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be doing a lot more to bring revolutionary
improvements to our schools,'' Gore told parents and teachers in
the school's library. ``If I'm entrusted with the presidency,
that's going to be my top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics, of course, was not far from the surface. Columbus is a
potential swing city in a battleground state that many Democrats
say Gore needs to win to defeat his Republican rival, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, who leads him in polls here.
</P>
<P>
   Though both city and state tend to vote Republican, President
Clinton and Gore took Ohio's 21 electoral votes in 1996, and
finished a respectable second in Columbus that year.
</P>
<P>
   As he did before his first school-day event, in Michigan, Gore
spent the night at the home of a teacher, Susan Fadley, keeping her
up past midnight with chit-chat about their families and education
policy. This morning, Fadley's husband, Rick, cooked Gore an omelet
before the vice president made his way through a cold drizzle to
the heavily guarded school.
</P>
<P>
   Gore greeted children in the cafeteria as they ate breakfasts of
cold cereal and juice, helped students in Fadley's kindergarten
class spell their names and make a collage from magazine scraps
depicting the African continent in art class.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with parents and teachers in the library, Gore
argued that the government could help working parents spend more
time with their children by raising the minimum wage, encouraging
more flexible work hours and requiring businesses to provide
family-leave time.
</P>
<P>
   He also used the meeting to attack Bush's proposal to take
federal funds from failing schools and allow parents to use the
money to send their children to other public or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, that means the kids would be moving to the next
school district over, crowding into classrooms that are already
overcrowded,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, Gore taste-tested a government-subsidized meal of
wrinkled-looking sausages, French toast, milk and an apple. And he
tried his hand at co-teaching Juanita Mitchem's fifth-grade
geometry class.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on hips, he strolled between the desks, offering helpful
tips with problems and looking every bit like a stern-faced vice
principal _ except for his occasional nods and winks at the
assembled press corps.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore's presence here was meant to speak to voting-age
parents through their children, he also did something any fifth
grader could appreciate. As Mitchem was completing her lesson, Gore
raised a hand to his lips and, with a sheepish glance at the
reporters, suppressed a yawn.

HEAD OF HUGE BOSTON ROAD PROJECT FIRED AMID COST ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci Tuesday fired James J.
Kerasiotes moments after the nation's top highway official accused
the Big Dig chief of engaging in an ``unconscionable'' betrayal of
the federal government by ``intentionally'' concealing the
project's soaring cost overrun that could reach $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, transportation authorities vowed to complete
construction of the costliest roadway in the country, even as they
acknowledged its price tag is now approaching $14 billion and as
they face continued pressure from a congressional watchdog to
suspend the funding.
</P>
<P>
   But US Transportation Department officials, citing a ``breach of
trust'' by the state, made clear that a new management team on the
Big Dig is needed to repair the damaged relationship with
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic twists in the 16-year project
history, Cellucci rushed from a tense, closed-door briefing with
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater and the state's
congressional delegation to a private anteroom where he phoned
Kerasiotes and demanded his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, in a news conference afterward, said Andrew Natsios,
his secretary of administration and finance, will replace
Kerasiotes as the state struggles to resolve the fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important we open the doors and open the windows'' of
accountability, Cellucci said of his decision to fire Kerasiotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Federal Highway Administration to conclude that it was
an intentional withholding of information, that's pretty serious
... In a democracy, you can't do that,'' Cellucci added.
</P>
<P>
   The firing followed Slater's release of a stinging audit that
accused the Big Dig manager of ``repeatedly and deliberately''
failing to disclose the exorbitant overrun, causing ``one of the
most flagrant breaches of the integrity of the federal-state
partnership in the history of the nearly 85-year-old federal aid
highway program.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 weeks after Kerasiotes said the Big Dig's cost
would not exceed $10.8 billion, the 48-page federal report
concluded that the price could approach $13.6 billion. Slater, in
the private briefing with Cellucci and the 12-member congressional
delegation, acknowledged the total cost could reach $14 billion,
after inflation and lawsuits are taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, acting on an investigation by auditors clearly furious
that the Federal Highway Administration's regional office was kept
in the dark by Kerasiotes about the cost overruns, issued 34
recommendations that will impose an unusual level of scrutiny on
the project's management and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Slater made future federal highway spending in
Massachusetts contingent on the state spreading funds to other road
and bridge repairs far from the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   He also said ``no one is blameless as it relates to this
effort,'' including the Federal Highway Administration, which he
said became too cozy with the project. Peter Markle, the federal
regional highway administrator, has already been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But Slater did implicate Kerasiotes for ``intentionally
withholding knowledge'' of an overrun, which he first disclosed on
Feb. 1 to have reached $1.4 billion. Auditors said that figure
could reach $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The report also labeled the Massachusetts Highway Department and
the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority as ``high risk'' recipients of
federal funds, which could make it more difficult for the state to
get transportation aid from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And the report calls for the project's management consultant,
Bechtel and Parsons-Brinckerhoff, to explain whether the company
raised questions about skyrocketing costs and information that was
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican who chairs
the House appropriations panel that controls transportation
spending, called the findings ``deeply disturbing'' and called on
Slater ``to suspend federal participation in the Central Artery
project at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Slater said he intends to see the project is completed. And
Senator John F. Kerry said he received assurance from another
potentially powerful foe of the Big Dig, Senator John McCain, the
Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, that
he would not turn the project into ``a political football.''
</P>
<P>
   Project director Patrick Moynihan, whom Kerasiotes called on to
do a top-to-bottom review of the Big Dig's soaring costs, appeared
to be safe in his position for now, though Natsios has the power to
remove him, and would not respond to questions about project
personnel Tuesday. It was Moynihan who projected the $1.4 billion
overrun.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes, who has been unusually subdued the last few days,
was ``deeply upset'' by the governor's phone call, aides said.
After being asked to resign, Kerasiotes told his staff he did not
plan to go home because television crews were staking him out in
front of his house. He then left his office at the state
Transportation building in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In a resignation letter to Cellucci, Kerasiotes wrote ``I am
saddened and disappointed at this turn of events...I believe when
the final reckoning is made, my record will stand as a solid one in
service to the people of the Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cellucci praised Kerasiotes for taking the
``engineering marvel'' to nearly two-thirds completion, he too,
blamed Kerasiotes for failing to disclose the overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his zeal to complete the project,'' Cellucci said of
Kerasiotes, he ``sacrificed'' his fundamental obligation to report
the whopping budget overruns to state and federal authorities.
``That simply cannot stand,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly two-hour meeting in Representative J. Joseph
Moakley's Capitol Hill office that preceded the firing unfolded
like a case study in diplomacy involving a Republican governor, a
Cabinet secretary, and a dozen Democratic members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci sat with his hands folded. Slater generally played the
role of conciliator, though he quickly and forcefully rebutted
Cellucci when the governor attempted to argue that the overrun
might not be as high as the report estimates, according to several
people who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Slater agreed with Kerry that the final cost of the
project could reach $14 billion if contingencies such as inflation,
lawsuits and environmental costs are factored in.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Cellucci responded to concern from delegation
members that the Big Dig was jeopardizing funding for road and
bridge projects across the state by saying, ``The Big Dig is like
El Nino. Everybody is blaming it for why the roads and bridges
aren't getting done.''
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting was over, the governor pushed away from the
conference table and retreated to a private area to use the
telephone as a Massachusetts state trooper stood guard.
</P>
<P>
   One call went to Natsios, asking him to take over the project.
One went to Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift, alerting her to the
developments. And then the call went to Kerasiotes, whose brash
management style created many enemies, even within the Cellucci
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes was reportedly stunned to hear Cellucci ask for his
resignation, and had hoped to work out an arrangement where he
would remain at least partly involved in running the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult phone call to make,'' Cellucci said
afterward. ``He was expecting a call. I think he was hoping for a
different outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes was removed as chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority, the position under state law that includes oversight of
the Central Artery project.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he selected Natsios to take the job because of his
reputation as a hard-liner whose penny-pinching ways are legendary
on Beacon Hill. It was unclear who would replace Natsios as the
state's top budget director.

 &HT;    Bush invokes Lincoln in `new prosperity agenda'
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday brought his
presidential campaign to a working-class neighborhood that
Republicans often bypass to talk about a subject Republicans often
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   In a no-frills meeting room at Cleveland's West Side Ecumenical
Ministry, Bush unveiled his $41 billion ``new prosperity agenda,''
designed to lift the working poor into the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the names of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt,
Bush said the Republican Party has a ``higher and older tradition''
of using government to ``promote the rewards of work.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Lincoln, Bush told the crowd of 250 community and
religious leaders, who financed colleges, welcomed immigrants and
used the Homestead Act to give Americans a ``piece of land and a
start in life.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Bush said his initiative would cut taxes for the
working poor, improve access to health insurance, help them buy
homes and make it easier for them to save their hard-earned money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for a new prosperity initiative that reflects the
spirit of Lincoln's reforms _ a plan to help remove obstacles on
the road to the middle class, a plan to clear a path for all.
Instead of helping people cope with their need, we will help them
move beyond it,'' said Bush, who was introduced by Gov. Bob Taft,
his Ohio campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush targeted those just leaving welfare, American's new
immigrants and Americans who for years have struggled from paycheck
to paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy must also honor and reward the hard work of
factory and field, of waiting tables and driving cabs _ not just
enterprise, but sheer effort, not just technology, but toil,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His pledges rang hollow, however, to supporters of his
Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign aides were outside the community center with a
written statement attacking Bush. It cited, among other things, a
New York Times story Tuesday that said as governor of Texas, Bush
had not made health care a priority, despite his state's long
record in poor public health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is more interested in a tax giveaway for the wealthy than
health care for working people,'' Douglas Hattaway, Gore's
spokesman, said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush senior campaign adviser, said the Times
article did not accurately represent Bush's record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Ecumenical Ministry community center, which provides
a variety of social services to 51,000 people _ mostly single
mothers _ Bush received a warm reception. Before the speech, Bush
toured El Barrio, another West Side community center that serves
the city's Hispanics. While at El Barrio, he chatted in Spanish,
visited a training class for bank tellers, and posed for a picture
with a mother and her two children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has previously discussed the tax cut proposals that were in
his speech, but the other proposals Tuesday were unveiled for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the tax cut plan would reduce the current 15
percent tax bracket to 10 percent for the first $6,000 of taxable
income for single taxpayers with no children, to $10,000 for single
parents and $12,000 for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a single-parent family of three now starts paying
federal income taxes at about $21,000 in income. ``Under my plan,
federal taxes don't begin until $31,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His health insurance plan would ``promote individual choice''
and ``rely on private insurance,'' he said. It would provide a
credit of up to $2,000 per family to cover up to 90 percent of
health insurance for uninsured families earning less than $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   To promote home ownership, Bush would permit participants in the
federal government's Section 8 rent voucher program to use a year's
worth of rental payments as a down payment. For those not in the
voucher program, Bush proposed using a federal subsidy of up to
$1,500 to help make a down payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in private property so strongly, and so firmly, I
want everyone to have some,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for the working poor to save, said Bush, so he wants
to help them by giving banks a federal tax credit to match savings
of up to $300. The participants could withdraw their savings
tax-free for education, to help start a business or to buy a home.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to fight poverty a new way, said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``For decades our government tried to fight poverty by
redistributing income, often leaving a legacy of dependence,'' he
said. ``The great promise of our time is to fight poverty by
building the wealth of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of Bush's $41 billion initiative to help the working
poor
</P>
<P>
   Tax relief:
</P>
<P>
   _ Current 15 percent tax bracket would be cut to 10 percent for
the first $6,000 of income for single taxpayers, the first $10,000
for single parents and the first $12,000 for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   _ Existing child tax credit would be increased from $500 to
$1,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   _ The percentage of total income taxes paid by those earning
more than $100,000 would increase from 62 percent to 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Health care
</P>
<P>
   _ A credit of up to $2,000 per family to cover 90 percent of
health insurance costs for families earning less than $30,000 not
already covered by a government health program or an employer plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reduce health insurance costs for small businesses and their
employees by allowing them to buy policies from multi-state
professional associations.
</P>
<P>
   Home ownership opportunities
</P>
<P>
   _ Permit participants in federal government's Section 8 rental
voucher program to use up to a year's worth of vouchers to finance
down payments on homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide $1 billion in matching grants to lenders to help
650,000 low-income families not enrolled in Section 8 make down
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Help build savings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide tax credits to banks that match savings deposits of up
to $300 by low-income investors. Savings can be withdrawn tax-free
for education, to help start a business or buy a home.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A judge in Britain's high court Tuesday ruled against a
historian who claimed that he had been libeled in a critique of his
writings on the Holocaust. The judge said the historian, David
Irving, was in fact an ``active Holocaust denier.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has been closely watched by people alarmed at the
rising tide of neo-Nazis and Hitler apologists who contend that
there was no Nazi program to put the Jews of Europe to death, or
who argue that its scale has been greatly overstated.
</P>
<P>
   The British historian David Irving brought the suit against
Deborah Lipstadt, a professor at Emory University in Atlanta, who
had described Irving in a book as ``one of the most dangerous
spokespersons for Holocaust denial.'' Denying the Holocaust is not
a crime in Britain, but Irving sued for libel asserting that his
reputation had been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Charles Gray of the high court handed a resounding
victory Tuesday to Lipstadt and in a scathing ruling found Irving
to be a racist, anti-Semitic Holocaust denier who deliberately
distorted historical evidence to cast Hitler in a favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   Gray concluded that often Irving's treatment of history was
``perverse and egregious.''
</P>
<P>
   In losing the case, Irving becomes liable for the defense's
costs, in the millions of dollars. He indicated that he might
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case concerned ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault
on Truth and Memory,'' first published in 1993 in the United States
by Lipstadt, a professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at
Emory University. In the book, Lipstadt wrote that Irving, now 62,
``is at his most facile at taking accurate information and shaping
it to conform to his conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   After the book was published, Irving, the author of more than 30
books on World War II and the Holocaust, some of which historians
have praised, sued Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Books,
charging that they had irrevocably damaged his reputation and would
make it hard for him to get his work published in the future.
</P>
<P>
   He brought the suit here because British libel law puts the
burden of proof on the defendants _ in this case, Lipstadt and
Penguin.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, visiting Washington,
commented on the ruling Tuesday. He said: ``The strength of Israel
today ensures that today no second Holocaust will take place, and
no one in the world will dare rise against the Jewish nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in parallel, a determined struggle is going on against the
people who deny the Holocaust that brought the death of a third of
our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of his career, Irving wrote a number of
admired books, notably ``Hitler's War'' (1977), and Justice Gray
today praised his dogged use of primary sources and said that ``as
a military historian, Irving has much to commend him.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Irving's views have become more and more
extreme, and he has been increasingly associated with right-wing
groups and neo-Nazis. In 1992 he was fined and banned from Germany
after he was convicted under a German law that makes Holocaust
denial a crime. He has also been refused entry to Canada, Italy,
Austria and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Irving has said that the gas chambers at
Auschwitz were not used to kill people _ Jews who died there
suffered from typhus and other diseases, he argues _ and that
Hitler neither ordered nor approved the Nazis' plans to put
Europe's Jews to death systematically.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he has argued, Hitler did not know about the mass
killings until at least 1943. And while Irving has acknowledged
that many Jews died during World War II, he has also said that it
was logistically impossible for the number to have been in the
millions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 St. Martin's Press withdrew his biography of the Nazi
propagandist Josef Goebbels, which contends that Goebbels, not
Hitler, was behind the murder of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial Irving used that as evidence that Lipstadt's book
had fanned the flames of an ``organized international endeavor'' to
destroy his career.
</P>
<P>
   To prove the merit of Lipstadt's statements about Irving, her
lawyers presented testimony from a number of Holocaust historians
who picked apart many of Irving's research methods and conclusions,
showing them to be based on deliberate distortions and selective
use of facts, Judge Gray found.
</P>
<P>
   In his denunciation of Irving's credibility, Justice Gray said,
in essence, that Irving did not have a case. The judge refuted
Irving's argument that any historical misrepresentations he might
have made were inadvertent rather than deliberate distortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irving has for his own ideological reasons persistently and
deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence,''
the judge said. ``For the same reasons, he has portrayed Hitler in
an unwarrantedly favorable light, particularly in relation to his
attitude toward and responsibility for the treatment of the Jews.''
Irving, he concluded, is ``an active Holocaust denier'' and
anti-Semite who ``associates with right-wing extremists who promote
neo-Nazism.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, a jubilant Lipstadt, 53, said Irving had been
``hoist on his own petard,'' with his own evidence, and exposed as
a liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not about versions of the truth,'' she said. ``This
wasn't about a historian with a controversial view of history. This
was about a man who claims to be a historian making up, distorting,
perverting, manipulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who was splattered with a raw egg by a protester as he
went to court this morning, so that he sat through the judge's
ruling in his shirtsleeves and vest, slipped out a back door after
the decision and did not speak to reporters. But he told the Press
Association in an interview in his apartment in Mayfair that he
found the ruling ``perverse'' and ``historically incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused Lipstadt and Penguin of enlisting the help of ``the
leaders of the Jewish communities around the world'' in an
orchestrated effort to discredit him. ``Their method was to pour a
bucket of slime over me and say, `Look, he's covered in slime,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not at all anti-Semitic,'' he added. ``It is not
anti-Semitic to be critical of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Under British libel law, Irving, who represented himself at the
trial, is now responsible for paying the costs incurred by the
defendants. Lawyers for Lipstadt said the legal bills were likely
to run as high as $3.2 million, a sum Irving says he cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Julius, a lawyer for Lipstadt, said the case was not
about whether the Holocaust took place, but whether there was any
historical evidence to support Irving's views.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Rabbis Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper, the dean
and associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles,
called the ruling a ``victory of history over hate'' and said it
put an end to Irving's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision definitively places Irving where he belongs _
not as an historian, but as a leading apologist for those who seek
to whitewash the most heinous crime in human history,'' the rabbis
said. ``Irving tried to manipulate the British legal system in
order to put the victims murdered in the gas chambers on trial;
instead, the net result is that he will be relegated to the garbage
heap of history's haters.''

BUSH PROPOSES TAX CREDIT FOR PURCHASE OF HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Fleshing out his frequent pledge to remove
``obstacles on the road to the middle class,'' Gov. George W. Bush
entered the national debate over health care policy Tuesday by
proposing a tax credit of up to $2,000 a family to help low- and
moderate-income working people buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The credit, worth $34.7 billion over five years, was the most
costly of an array of proposed tax incentives and vouchers for
health care and home ownership that Bush packaged Tuesday as ``a
new prosperity initiative'' intended to help immigrants, former
welfare recipients and other low-income Americans make poverty a
``stage, not a fate.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall program, another step in Bush's effort to position
himself as a ``new kind of Republican,'' would cost $41.6 billion
over five years. His aides said it would help as many as 18 million
of the nation's 44 million uninsured buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the plan here in Cleveland at the West Side
Ecumenical Ministry, a faith-based charity, the Texas governor, who
has been steadily trying to reach out to independents and
moderates, spoke of ``those living in prosperity's shadow.'' He
also quoted Lincoln's exhortation that ``every poor man should have
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for a new prosperity initiative that reflects the
spirit of Lincoln's reforms,'' Bush said. ``A plan to help remove
obstacles on the road to the middle class. A plan to clear a path
for all. Instead of helping people cope with their need, we will
help them to move beyond it. With the same energy and activism that
others have brought to expanding government, we must expand
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech, delivered in a battleground state in the
presidential campaign, was Bush's first of the campaign to address
health care, an issue the Democrats consider one of their strongest
in this election. The Democrats say Bush is particularly vulnerable
on the issue because his state has the nation's second-highest
number of uninsured and some of the highest rates of AIDS,
tuberculosis and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the campaign of the apparent Democratic nominee, Vice
President Al Gore, attacked Bush over Texas' record, saying that
with his new proposal he was trying to ``divert attention from the
deplorable state of health care and other issues in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides defended his health care record, distributing a
fact sheet that said Texas had slowed the growth in the number of
uninsured to 3 percent in his five years in the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign distanced the governor from remarks made by the
state's health commissioner, Dr. William R. Archer III. In an
interview with The New York Times for an article published Tuesday,
Archer said among other things that Texas' high teen-age pregnancy
rate had come about because the state's Hispanic population lacked
the belief ``that getting pregnant is a bad thing.'' Ari Fleischer,
a spokesman for Bush, said Tuesday that Archer's remarks were ``not
in keeping with the spirit of the governor's comments'' on health
care.
</P>
<P>
   (Archer himself issued a statement Tuesday apologizing for his
remarks. ``I deeply regret that I have created an erroneous
impression about Hispanics and teen pregnancy,'' the statement said
in part.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech in Cleveland was the third he had made since
effectively winning the Republican nomination last month in which
he moved away from the conservative tone of the primary campaign.
Last week he visited another swing state, Pennsylvania, to propose
a series of environmental measures to hasten the cleanup of
abandoned industrial sites. And a week before that, he unveiled a
five-year, $5 billion program that would provide grants to states
for teacher training and other measures to improve childhood
literacy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan he introduced in Cleveland, which was modeled on
bipartisan legislation in Congress, Americans without health care
coverage and not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid could receive
a tax credit of up to $1,000 an individual or $2,000 a family to
cover 90 percent of the cost of insurance. The credit would phase
out with rising income, so that individuals earning $45,000 a year,
or families earning $60,000, would no longer be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said the credit would be refundable, meaning that
people would qualify even if they had no federal tax liability. And
the tax credit could be ``assignable'': any refund due could go
directly to the insurance company, either monthly or yearly, to
help cover the premium.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a more expansive, more government-based health
care plan, whose cost he estimates at more than $346 billion over
10 years. It would try to guarantee access to health coverage to
all children by 2005, by expanding eligibility for the Children's
Health Insurance Program, established three years ago for children
in families not poor enough for Medicaid but not affluent enough to
buy private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would also allow their uninsured parents to enroll
in the program. And it would allow many uninsured Americans ages 55
to 65 to buy into the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   But the costliest part of the Gore plan would be a $200 billion
provision to create a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, an
issue Bush was silent on Tuesday. His aides said the governor would
address health care issues relating to the elderly later in the
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush took pains Tuesday to distinguish his approach from
that of the Democrats. ``We will not nationalize our health care
system,'' he said. ``We will promote individual choice. We will
rely on private insurance. But make no mistake: in my
administration, low-income Americans will have access to
high-quality health care.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the tax credit would help buy only basic coverage.
``In most places in America,'' he said, ``that means visits to a
doctor, discounted prescriptions and hospitalization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The basics,'' he said, ``but enough to ensure against sudden
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approach does have some bipartisan support in Congress
and is a favorite of some New Democrats, who often differ with
their party's orthodoxy. But the Gore campaign questioned whether
it would truly provide health insurance for the poor. Gore aides
cited a recent study in Health Affairs magazine saying that similar
proposals covered less than a third of the costs of a typical
nongroup family insurance policy and were not sufficient to help
those most in need.
</P>
<P>
   Further, a leading expert on health care costs, Diane K. Rowland
of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, voiced skepticism Tuesday
over how much insurance the tax credits would cover. Rowland said
that ``the average cost in 1998 for a group family policy was
$4,092.'' That, she said, is what fairly large employers would have
to pay; individuals buying family insurance would find their rates
``much higher.'' If less expensive policies could be created, she
said, they ``would not cover much.''
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions of Bush's plan would give states more leeway in
how they administer the Children's Health Insurance Program. He
would also encourage the development of multistate health plans
among small businesses, and would expand and make more flexible two
programs that give favored tax treatment to medical savings.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush also ventured into the area of home ownership Tuesday,
noting that while the level of home ownership among whites was 73
percent, it was only 47 percent among blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   He embraced legislation, already overwhelmingly passed by the
House, that would allow families that get rent subsidies under the
Title 8 housing program to instead opt to use up to a year's worth
of rental vouchers to make a down payment on a home. He would also
create a $1 billion fund that would give banks incentives to help
with a down payment for first-time home buyers earning less than 80
percent of their area's median income.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to encourage savings, he would provide tax
incentives to financial institutions that match deposits of up to
$300 made by people earning less than 60 percent of their area's
median income.

   The National Transportation Safety Board set itself on a
collision course with airline pilots Tuesday, calling for video
recorders in the cockpits of all commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the recent crash of EyyptAir Flight 990 may
never be solved because of a lack of information about what was
happening on the flight deck that cameras could have addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect that the backup Egyptian copilot may have
deliberately put the jet into a suicidal dive last Halloween as the
jet cruised at 33,000 feet _ a view angrily rejected by the
Egyptian government.

   All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767-300 were killed when it
plunged into the Atlantic about 30 minutes out of New York's
Kennedy Airport on a night flight to Cairo.
</P>

   The board's recommendation was detailed in a letter to the
Federal Aviation Administration and during an appearance by board
Chairman Jim Hall before a congressional committee.

   The biggest union of the nation's commercial airline pilots is
strongly opposed to the idea. The Airline Pilots Association argues
it would be an invasion of a pilot's privacy, and there is also
concern that the cockpit video from a doomed jetliner would sooner
or later show up on the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   But in his letter to FAA Administration Jane Garvey, Hall said
the time has come to supplement the so-called black boxes on
commercial jets with a crash-protected cockpit image recording
system. Such a system is technologically and economically feasible,
Hall said, and would advance safety and possibly save millions of
dollars and thousands of hours of investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety board recognizes the privacy issue with recording
images of pilots,'' Hall said in his latter. ``However, the board
believes that given the history of complex accident investigations
and lack of crucial information regarding the cockpit environment,
the safety of the flying public must take precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he will ask Congress to implement provisions to
prevent the public release of cockpit video recordings. The NTSB is
prevented by law from ever releasing the actual sound recordings a
plane's cockpit voice recorder, though it does occasionally release
written transcripts of what what was recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Even the release of transcripts has upset commercial pilots and
their union.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the EgyptAir plane, Hall cited several other
crashes to support the argument for cockpit video recordings: The
1996 Valujet crash near Miami, the 1998 Swissair crash off the
coast of Nova Scotia and the crash of SilkAir Boeing 737 in
Indonesia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The board found that the Valuejet crash was caused by a fire
that broke out in the forward cargo hold. The cause of the Swissair
crash remains under investigation, but the pilots reported smoke in
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Had both jets been equipped with cockpit video recorders, Hall
said, investigators would have invaluable information about the
conditions in the cockpit and whether proper procedures were
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the conditions were known, it might be possible to modify
aircraft systems or training programs to assist future crews in
recognizing these indications and effecting a safe recovery,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   The SilkAir crash is believed to have been caused by the
deliberate act of the plane's troubled captain, who apparently
disconnected the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder to
mask his actions and then put the Boeing 737 into a steep dive from
its cruising altitude of 35,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of recorded information concerning the circumstances
in the cockpit has continued to hamper the investigation,'' Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the case with EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have found nothing in an analysis of the cockpit
voice recorder and the jet's flight data recorder that would point
toward a bomb or a mechanical problem as the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, with no evidence that the crash was an accident,
Hall was prepared to turn the investigation over to the FBI when
the Egyptian government strenuously objected.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the board has been working closely with Egyptian
aviation authorities to gather as much factual information about
the crash as possible, and Hall has had little to say about the
on-going probe _ until yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before the House Transportation aviation
subcommittee to lay out the board's recommendation, Hall said the
probable cause of the EgyptAir disaster not been determined but
information from the plane's flight data recorder was consistent
with ``a deliberate action on the part of one of the crew
members.''
</P>
<P>
   A cockpit video recorder on the jet would have shown ``who was
in the cockpit, who was in what seat, who left and when,'' Hall
told the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Air Line Pilots Association, which represents about
55,000 pilots, also appeared before the House committee. Union
president Duane Woerth said time and money would be better spent on
more sophisticated flight data recorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the state of existing protective legislation, cockpit
video is an egregious invasion of privacy for minimal, in any,
safety data,'' he told the committee. ``It would just be a matter
of time before the world shares first-hand the cockpit environment
in the seconds before a disaster,'' Woerth said in prepared
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In a front page story on the controversial issue this week, the
Wall Street Journal interviewed several airline pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the old Soviet Union, with Big Brother watching
you,'' a USAirways DC-9 captain told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   And a 737 captain was quoted by the paper as saying if video
cameras are placed in the cockpit, ``I'll have a place to hang my
hat.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The truth about Derek Jacobi, one of the most
emotionally potent British classical actors of his generation, is
that he has never known how to take a bow. He loathes being singled
out for approval. To him it is a degrading spectacle, a charade.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his aversion proved so vexing to his mentor, Laurence
Olivier, that one day, after a performance of the Peter Shaffer
play ``Black Comedy,'' Olivier took his protege aside and offered a
fatherly reprimand. ``He said,'' Jacobi recalled, ```If you have
pretensions of being a leading actor you must learn how to take a
curtain call.'''
</P>
<P>
   This may seem an odd sort of inhibition for an actor. Yet for
Jacobi it persists to this day. Audiences at ``Uncle Vanya,'' the
new Roundabout Theater Company production in which Jacobi makes his
first Broadway appearance in more than a decade, will easily spot
him during the curtain call: he's the one looking as if he'd rather
be doing his taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like being special,'' he said the other day in
his dressing room at the top of the Brooks Atkinson Theater, where
the revival opens on April 30. ``I know they've got to say thank
you, and it's rude not to acknowledge it. I just wish they
wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   This may not be false modesty but (italics)true(end italics)
modesty. In the program for ``Uncle Vanya,'' for example, Jacobi's
biographical entry is half the length of those of some of his
fellow actors. And it fails to mention his 1985 Tony Award for his
portrayal of Benedick in ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' brought to New
York by the Royal Shakespeare Company in repertory with ``Cyrano de
Bergerac'' ( Jacobi also played Cyrano).
</P>
<P>
   It also offers no hint of the ``Sir'' he is entitled to by
virtue of his knighthood by the queen, conferred on a day when Her
Majesty, still recuperating from a broken arm, came to the
investiture with a handbag draped over her cast.
</P>
<P>
   On a stage, though, there is nothing unassuming about Jacobi.
``He's a truly self-made star actor,'' Frank Rich wrote in The New
York Times, reviewing a 1988 London production of ``Richard II.''
``Having no strong personality of his own _ or selflessly choosing
not to project one _ he packs his performances with the kind of
precise character details (remember the gentle stutter in `Breaking
the Code'?) that demand the most intense concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   His Vanya follows very much in that tradition. In the famous
scene in which the buffoonish professor, Serebryakov, played by
Brian Murray, reveals that he is planning to sell the estate upon
which Vanya and his niece Sonya have depended and toiled for years,
Jacobi's tantrum plays out as a series of emotional explosions, set
off on the stage like depth charges, that build to his firing a gun
at Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi has no patience for a deconstruction of his performance.
``Chekhov is so text driven that it's wonderful to play,'' he said.
``But I don't like to talk about how I'm doing it. The truth is, it
should be seen and not talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   He is less reluctant to parse his 40 years onstage. On a recent
Saturday night, he spent several hours at a corner table at a
restaurant in Manhattan telling funny stories about his life in the
golden age of British theater in the 1960s and '70s; about working
with the likes of Olivier and Michael Redgrave, Maggie Smith and
Albert Finney; about the unexpected success of ``I, Claudius,'' the
BBC series that became a cult hit when it was broadcast in the
United States on PBS in 1977. (He bought the London house in which
he now lives from the widow of Jack Pulman, who had adapted the
Robert Graves novels for television.) And he spoke about the
endless succession of roles he has played over the years in togas
and doublets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a tights man for so long,'' he said with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   For all those celebrated appearances in tights, though, Jacobi
has never achieved the widespread celebrity in this country that
can be claimed by several of his contemporaries, among them Judi
Dench, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. Unlike them, he has not
had the kind of movie or commercial television role that would
appreciably raise his profile _ and his price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in a play, he said, in his soothing, precise baritone,
``is more difficult and ultimately, it's more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all got to be working vocally, physically. And then there
is the exhilaration you feel at the end.'' Adrenaline is one thing;
fiscal health another. ``I'm tempted to say it's worth $20 million.
But it's not!''
</P>
<P>
   Given his great ambivalence about stardom, it is hard to know
how seriously to take Jacobi when he talks about wanting something
as indelicate as a big payday. Chekhov's hapless Vanya is his first
stage appearance since he played the part at the Chichester
Festival in England in 1996. (In the Roundabout production,
directed by Michael Mayer, Jacobi is also appearing with Roger Rees
and Laura Linney.)
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years _ his longest hiatus from the theater in
decades _ he has concentrated on his ``Cadfael'' television
detective series, set in the Middle Ages, and on movies. The
critics lavished praise on his wildly theatrical performance as the
painter Francis Bacon in the 1998 ``Love Is the Devil,'' and he has
featured roles in Philip Haas' forthcoming ``Up at the Villa'' and
Ridley Scott's highly anticipated ``Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   He even made the Hollywood rounds: ``I'm told by my friends, `Go
out to L.A., sit by a pool and talk to everybody.''' So he threw
off the tights, pulled out a bathing suit and took a bunch of
meetings with casting people, ``who all seemed to be 22 years
old.'' They told him, ``Sir Derek, we are so proud to have you
here.'' Proud, maybe, but not brimming with offers.
</P>
<P>
   Fit at 61, with leonine features, sea-blue eyes and a blondish
goatee, Jacobi certainly looks ready for his closeup. But he
remains the quintessential man of the playhouse, one of a vanishing
breed of actor in the English-speaking theater, so steeped in
Shakespeare and Chekhov that no classic seems beyond his reach.
This is an actor, after all, who knows off the top of his head how
many times he has played Hamlet (397, not counting high school).
</P>
<P>
   It is Olivier whom Jacobi believes deserves much of the credit
for the artistic stature of the London institutional theater in the
1960s and later. As the founding director of the National Theater _
now the Royal National Theater _ Olivier used his own star power to
forge a repertory theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such was his reputation that people like Maggie Smith and
Albert Finney and Robert Stephens were willing to say, `OK, I am
willing to join you,''' Jacobi said. ``And with just three years at
the Birmingham Rep, I found myself in the company of these glorious
performers.'' In 1963, he opened in ``Hamlet'' on his birthday,
playing Laertes to Peter O'Toole's Prince of Denmark. At the
opening night party, Shirley Bassey sang ``Happy Birthday'' to
Jacobi from the stage. ``It was,'' he said, ``a magic, magic
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi, of course, would become a mainstay of Olivier's company.
Years later, when he himself was playing Hamlet, at the Old Vic in
1979, Richard Burton dropped by for dinner. They had met on the set
of one of Burton's films in which Jacobi had a tiny part, and he
had promised to see Jacobi's play. Backstage, Jacobi said, Burton
made a special request.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Do you mind if we go onto the stage? I haven't been
on a stage in 20 years.''' Together, they stood under the lights.
``And when we went to dinner, he wanted to talk Shakespeare all
night.''
</P>
<P>
   It strikes a listener as a poignant juxtaposition, the movie
star long gone from the stage expounding on Shakespeare to a man
who would never leave it. For Jacobi is a tights man through and
through. Some look to their dotage and see golf. Jacobi looks ahead
and envisions Lear.

UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER GETS BROAD PATENT FOR NEW PAINKILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of Rochester said on Tuesday that it had been
awarded a broad patent covering the use of a new type of painkiller
that has become the pharmaceutical industry's fastest-selling new
product.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the university estimate that the patent could bring
in billions of dollars in royalties over its 17-year-life, which
would make it the most lucrative patent ever held by a university.
</P>
<P>
   The patent supposedly covers all medical uses of drugs known as
Cox-2 inhibitors, which are sometimes called ``super-aspirin'' for
their ability to alleviate pain while minimizing side effects,
particularly stomach ulcers, associated with frequent use of
aspirin, ibuprofen or similar painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   The first such Cox-2 inhibitor drug to reach the market, G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co. Celebrex, had sales totaling $1.5 billion in 1999, its
first year on the market. Some 17.5 million prescriptions were
written in the United States last year, eclipsing Viagra as the
fastest-selling new drug in history, according to IMS Health, a
health care information company.
</P>
<P>
   On receiving the patent, the university filed a
patent-infringement suit against Searle and Pfizer, which helps
market Celebrex. It sought, among other things, an injunction to
stop sales of the painkiller now used by an estimated seven million
people, mainly to relieve arthritis pain.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists at Rochester and other universities first
discovered the Cox-2 enzyme, Searle developed a drug to block the
action of that enzyme but did not know of Rochester's request for a
patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine waking up in the morning and having a patent on
aspirin,'' said Gerald P. Dodson, a lawyer representing the
university. ``Well, these people at Rochester woke up this morning
and have a patent on a substitute for aspirin that is even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger A. Williams, associate patent counsel at Searle, said the
company believes that the Rochester patent is invalid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overly broad,'' he said, agreeing that it does seem to
cover all uses of Cox-2 inhibitors. He also said that work done by
others before Rochester could nullify the patent. Searle is the
pharmaceutical division of Monsanto, which is now part of the
Pharmacia Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said his company had not yet seen the lawsuit, which
was filed in Federal District Court in Rochester, N.Y. But he
added, ``I would question why a university would want to take a
therapeutically beneficial product off the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Rochester officials say they do not really want to take the drug
off the market, but rather want to negotiate royalty agreements
with Searle and other manufacturers of such drugs. The suit is
really to put pressure on the company to negotiate, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to work with them as amicably as
possible,'' Jeanine Arden Ornt, general counsel for the University
of Rochester Medical Center, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co. also sells a Cox-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, which had
United States revene around $373 million last year, after being
approved for sale in May, according to IMS. Lawyers for the
university said they want to talk with Merck as well but did not
sue because they want to concentrate for now on Celebrex, the
bigger-selling drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John H. Klippel, medical director of the Arthritis
Foundation, said his group would be concerned by any prospect,
however remote, that Celebrex or another Cox-2 inhibitor would be
taken off the market. He said it was hard to say whether Vioxx
could be a substitute for Celebrex, adding, ``They have different
compounds and different labeling indications.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for big royalties, assuming that the university
can defend its patent, is based on forecasts that sales of Cox-2
inhibitors will rise to several billion dollars a year. Other
companies besides Searle and Merck are developing such drugs.
Moreover, the drugs are now being tested to see if they can prevent
cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Jackson, president of the University of Rochester, called
the patent ``extraordinarily exciting for us,'' both for the
potential income and the recognition it would bring the university
for a contribution to public health.
</P>
<P>
   The private university now gets $150 million to $200 million a
year in federal research grants and is in the midst of adding
buildings and scientists to bolster its medical research. Any
income from the patent would be ``a significant augmentation of our
basic research efforts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The patent is based on the work done in the late 1980s and early
1990s by Dr. Donald Young, a professor of medicine and biochemistry
who is now semi-retired.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, it was thought that a different Cox, which is short
for cyclo-oxygenase, was involved in pain and inflammation. But
Young, assisted by Michael K. O'Banion and Virginia D. Winn,
suspected that a new type of Cox enzyme, now known as Cox-2, was
the culprit and they cloned the gene responsible for producing it.
The original enzyme, now known as Cox-1, turned out to be involved
in protecting the lining of the stomach from acids.
</P>
<P>
   Aspirin, ibuprofen and other so-called nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs work by blocking both Cox-1 and Cox-2. So
while they reduce pain and swelling, they also cause ulcers and
gastrointestinal bleeding that lead to thousands of deaths in the
United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   But once they knew of the difference between the two enzymes,
drug companies set out to develop drugs that inhibit Cox-2 without
affecting Cox-1, thereby reducing the risk of ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   The patent, filed in 1992, took eight years to work its way
through the patent office, which turns out to Rochester's benefits
because the drugs have just gone on the market. But it is bound to
be a disappointment to two other universities _ the University of
California at Los Angeles and Brigham Young University, where
scientists were making the same discoveries at about the same time
as the Rochester team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They filed for a patent and we didn't,'' said Dr. Harvey R.
Herschman, a professor who led the work at UCLA, somewhat ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Dodson, the attorney representing Rochester, said the patent
should survive because it made it through an eight-year examination
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

THE BOYS OF ROCK: FOREVER BOYS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, everyone assumes that the serious music fan is an
arrested adolescent. Nick Hornby's 1995 novel, ``High Fidelity,''
devastatingly captured the paralyzed mental state of smart males
whose emotional lives revolve around cultural product, not people.
</P>
<P>
   Now his characters have been made into Hollywood archetypes by
the director Stephen Frears and the actor John Cusack. Once, record
geeks made fun of themselves. Now mainstream America is talking
about how lovably pathetic they can be.
</P>
<P>
   Rock 'n' roll has long given men, its dominant players, a route
to rebellion and self-transformation. But when did its focus
change, from boys wanting to become men to men wanting to stay
boys? Although the music has always been linked to youth, and, some
would say, immaturity, many early rockers used it to prove their
virility.
</P>
<P>
   There was rage in the recklessness of those stars, many of them
poor white and black Southerners whom the mainstream considered
less than men. Chuck Berry may have written ``Sweet Little 16''
about a girl he admired, but he wrote ``Brown-Eyed Handsome Man''
about himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, being young became its own political stance. But
rock 'n' roll's flower children still wanted the full participatory
rights society granted adults. The counterculture called for a
different kind of grown-up, as spontaneous and questioning as a
teen-ager but able to shoulder the weight of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s may be when the grown-boy stereotype merged with that
of the rocker. Rock became just another official periphery, a
bohemian enclave like many before it, and some music lovers used
its otherworldliness to facilitate their retreat.
</P>
<P>
   This is the tribe ``High Fidelity'' explores so effectively:
shaggy guys who display their esoteric knowledge on their
promotional T-shirts, who lack basic social skills but can recite
Bob Dylan's catalog at will. Hornby's second novel, ``About a
Boy,'' went even further in telling the stories of these sweet
nerds. He's recently been joined by the writer Camden Joy, whose
second novel, ``Boy Island,'' depicts musicians even more eager to
escape maturity's traditional commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Such grown boys are overwhelmingly white and middle class,
exiles from manhood rather than invaders. The impulses they honor _
to follow your passion instead of money, to express individuality
even when it's messy, to play by the gut, not the rules _ fed the
social movements rock 'n' roll helped inspire. Detached from a
shared context, though, these values become sources of weakness
instead of power.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's grown boys don't want to become regular men but can't
imagine how else to thrive. One of the few improvements the film
makes on Hornby's novel is to turn the masculine cliche grown boys
despise into a fleshed-out character. Played by Tim Robbins with
the smarmiest of New Age smiles, this avatar of mellowness is the
same pompous oaf who gets the boot in Jane Austen novels. Resting
too surely in his power, he's destined to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Grown boys act jealous of the authority such men have, but they
could attain it if they wanted. A dream deferred can be a
comfortable thing, if your reality isn't that bad to start with.
Because they don't feel engaged with any larger rebellion, grown
boys combat straw enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly they battle the women in their lives, who have replaced
``the Man'' of social protest as embodiments of convention. ``High
Fidelity'' denigrates this old bohemian view of the feminine as a
trap, but only hints at how it might be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, a writer named Caroline appears; unlike any
other female character, she's a music expert too. Had she been a
full player, grown boys in ``High Fidelity'' would have tangled
with a big change, if only an interior one caused by confronting
their own sexism. Instead, Hornby's grown boys, like many real
ones, spin their wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Rock obsessives have needed self-critiques like Hornby's to
expose their solipsism, but it's important to remember that other
story, of manhood's definition expanding under rock's impact.
That's one message of ``The Filth and the Fury,'' Julien Temple's
homage to the working-class rebellion of English punk.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's subjects, the Sex Pistols, were the sort of
public-housing lads whose futures held little promise of the
satisfactions adulthood can bring. Like the 1950s stars before
them, they railed against a culture that wanted to keep them boys.
</P>
<P>
   Grown boys and the rockers who would be men both refuse to
reconcile with manhood as their elders defined it. Yet they keep
pushing, inspired by rock 'n' roll's mandate to try for more. And
sometimes a narrative captures the excitement that can come from
taking that dare.
</P>
<P>
   One such tale is the new novel ``War Boy'' by Kief Hillsberry.
It follows its teen-age hero, the deaf skateboarder Rad Boy, as he
embarks upon manhood guided by a cadre of grown boys he meets in
the California punk scene.
</P>
<P>
   Always treated differently because of his hearing loss and
starting to realize that his homosexuality will also mark him as an
outsider, Rad Boy finds solidarity with extremists _ radical
environmentalists and speed freaks. They let him down, but he
survives, moving through tragedy toward maturity. He's inspired by
the music he hears in his head _ and his favorite band is the
all-female Sleater-Kinney. The end of his road doesn't look like a
trap. It is lit with the sense of possibility rock has always
offered its confused, blessed boys.

JETS CLOSE TO DEALING JOHNSON TO BUCS FOR DRAFT PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA and MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the latest upheaval of their tumultuous off
season, the Jets were on the brink Tuesday night of a trade that
would send All-Pro wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson to Tampa Bay in
exchange for the Buccaneers' two first-round picks in Saturday's
National Football League draft.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Stanley, the agent for Johnson, spent Tuesday night in
Tampa, Fla., trying to complete an agreement on a new long-term
contract. According to a league official, the deal would pay
Johnson almost $7 million per year, and would include a signing
bonus of between $12 and $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and the Bucs have already agreed to the terms of the
trade, leaving it up to Johnson and the Bucs to come to terms on a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   According to the league official, several teams tried to get in
on the deal within the last 48 hours, telling the Jets to hold off
on finalizing the trade until they could make offers. The Jets
declined, and the Bucs have a self-imposed deadline of Wednesday to
complete the deal with Johnson or end negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley did not return repeated messages and Jets Coach Al Groh
did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade gets done, the Jets would have four picks in the
first round of the draft, including their own (16th and 18th) and
the Bucs' 13th and 27th. That would put them in position to either
make a blockbuster trade to move up to nab one of the draft's
premier players, or to stockpile young talent by exercising all
four picks.
</P>
<P>
   But it means the Jets, handicapped by salary cap woes and
determined to avoid what seemed an increasingly likely holdout by
Johnson, would also be bereft of their best player and one of the
critical members of a team that was thought to be in position to
make a run at the Super Bowl next season.
</P>
<P>
   And if they trade their most visible star, the Jets will have
crafted a deal that will surely bewilder some Jets players and many
fans. Johnson has been a controversial figure from the start of his
career _ he held out for 24 days before his rookie season and wrote
a book critical of some of his teammates. But he is also a premier
playmaker. Last season was his best as a pro, with 89 receptions
for 1,170 yards and eight touchdowns. The team's next most
productive receiver was Wayne Chrebet, one of the subjects of
Johnson's rookie season ire, who had 48 receptions for 631 yards
and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's draft is generally regarded as having four premier
players: defensive lineman Courtney Brown, linebacker LaVar
Arrington, receiver Peter Warrick and offensive lineman Chris
Samuels. With four first-round picks the Jets could offer a package
to any of the teams holding the top four picks. But the Cleveland
Browns, who hold the No.1 pick, would likely demand at least three
of those picks to make a trade, the team's director of football
operations Dwight Clark has said. And the Redskins seem intent on
trying to grab Arrington and Samuels with their picks, No. 2 and
No. 3. The Bengals, with the No. 4 selection, have said they would
listen to offers to move down. The Baltimore Ravens at No. 5, have
entertained offers for their fifth overall pick. But Ravens Coach
Brian Billick wondered yesterday whether the Jets could offer
enough to pry the fifth pick from his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they'd have enough juice,'' Billick said. ``If
they were trying to go to the fifth, they'd give us the 13th and
they'd probably to have throw in one of those later ones and then a
fourth-round pick.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Groh indicated that the Jets might be wary of
pursuing a high draft pick because signing him might put as much of
a cramp on the salary cap in future years as restructuring
Johnson's deal would have. Instead, the Jets might choose to use
all four picks to fill numerous needs in an attempt to continue
what Groh called the ``success cycle'' without forcing the team
into future dire financial straits. In addition to trying to
acquire a receiver to replace Johnson in the receiver-deep draft,
the Jets need a tight end, a pass-rusher and help in the secondary.

COMMENTARY: A NATION AT RISK _ OF ENNUI 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton is nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The risk-addicted president is worried that he may have taken
one risk too many. The independent counsel is once more mulling
indicting him in the Monica magilla.
</P>
<P>
   While he stews, the rest of the country indulges in risk
nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   The hot new Broadway play is ``Copenhagen,'' the Michael Frayn
``imaginative reconstruction'' of a 1941 meeting between Werner
Heisenberg, a physicist on the German atomic bomb project, and his
mentor, Niels Bohr, a quantum theorist who went on to Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS on Sunday night, George Clooney and a starry cast did a
live black-and-white remake of ``Fail Safe,'' the Cold War
nightmare about nuclear bombs gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   America is so comfortable and glossy now, a Pottery Barn catalog
of a country, Clooney figured he could give us a good scare, if not
with the tense nuclear tale at least with the prospect of movie
stars muffing their lines on live TV.
</P>
<P>
   Critics shrugged. ``It was a bunch of middle-aged white guys
talking for two hours,'' said MSNBC's Dana Kennedy. (Bet she can't
wait for the Bush-Gore debates.)
</P>
<P>
   At the end, producers made a bid for relevance by listing
countries with nuclear capability. But, as The Washington Post's
Tom Shales wrote, the list was ``somehow not as chilling or
horrifying as, say, last week's plunge in stock prices on the
Nasdaq exchange. The world has changed a lot since `Fail Safe.'
It's all about money now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Elian lunacy must be seen through the prism of risk
nostalgia. As Hendrik Hertzberg wrote in The New Yorker: ``If the
real Cold War was grand opera, this tiny remnant, this Cold Spat,
is operetta, and comic operetta at that ... the nuclear shadow that
once darkened every Cuban crisis has lifted, taking existential
terror with it.''
</P>
<P>
   We've grown so coddled on the glide path to riches that when the
Nasdaq went kerflooie last week, brokers had to remind their
clients to get reacquainted with that old market fundamental, risk.
</P>
<P>
   The cheap thrills of the Nasdaq roller coaster can't compare to
those sweaty-palm, hide-under-your-school-desk days of the Cuban
missile crisis. The anarchists and Ruckus Society and Birkenstock
anti-globalist guerrillas descending on Washington are trying to
replace the threat of the end of the world with the threat of one
world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ``No Nukes'' and ``Down With the Military-Industrial
Complex,'' the Capitol was awash in signs like ``No to Debt, No to
Structural Adjustment Programs.'' Not quite the same ring.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one place where existential terror still lurks: the
White House. The president's pals say he is upset about the threat
by Kenneth Starr's replacement, Robert W. Ray, to indict him after
he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews Ray has said Clinton is still in the
cross-hairs. ``The process has to be vindicated,'' he told The
Times. ``No person is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of closing the books, Ray has hired six new prosecutors
and an investigator and is planning to spend $3.5 million over the
next six months, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who was hired by Rudy Giuliani to work in the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan in 1989, is the latest victim of
Clinton poisoning _ a malady that causes normal people to become
obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, camera crews will be waiting at Ray's home
to watch him take out the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr may be gone. The independent counsel law may have
lapsed. But like a Potomac Hydra, the independent counsel is
gearing up again to hunt down Bill Clinton. Even Javert jumped into
the Seine at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-two million isn't enough?'' harrumphs James Carville.
``They want to spend another $50 million?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton always performs best at the brink, and almost seems
to enjoy being the scamp who dances away from his pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   But now he must be having nightmares about a split-screen
departure from office. Just as Jimmy Carter had to watch the Iran
hostage release as Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president, Clinton
must visualize a split screen with his successor parading down
Pennsylvania Avenue even as federal marshals wait with handcuffs
for Citizen Bill.

BEN &AMP; JERRY'S HOMEMADE AGREES TO $256 MILLION TAKEOVER BY
UNILEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after saying it was considering a plan to be
taken private, Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade has reached an agreement to
be sold to Unilever PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was described by people close to the
takeover talks, was apparently reached late Tuesday, during a
lengthy meeting of the Ben &AMP; Jerry's board in New York.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant to Ben &AMP; Jerry's chief financial officer, Frances
Rathke, would not comment Tuesday night. Unilever's spokesman and
the company's investment banker did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever has agreed to pay about $42 a share for Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
making the deal worth about $256 million, the people said. It is a
significant premium on Ben &AMP; Jerry's share price, which despite
rising to a 52-week high of $35.625 in Tuesday's trading, closed at
$34.9375.
</P>
<P>
   It is also about $4 more a share than the leveraged buyout plan
that Ben &AMP; Jerry's said it was considering on March 29. That plan
would have divided the company between one of its founders, Ben
Cohen; a venture-capital firm called Meadowbrook Lane Capital that
describes itself as socially responsible; and Unilever. Unilever
would have controlled about 28 percent of the company under that
plan, while Cohen and Meadowbrook Lane Capital would have held 36
percent apiece.
</P>
<P>
   As in the earlier plan, Jerry Greenfield, the other founder and
namesake of Ben &AMP; Jerry's, would relinquish his role in the
company. It was not clear Tuesday what led to the revised offer,
nor what Cohen's role would be once Unilever took control. Cohen
and Greenfield issued a statement last month saying that they
remained close friends.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief issues facing Ben &AMP; Jerry's is its distribution
system in the United States, where it sells most of its flavors
like Cherry Garcia and Wavy Gravy. Until 1998, most of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's ice cream was distributed by Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, an
Oakland, Calif.-based company that has a large share of the market.
Ben &AMP; Jerry's broke off the arrangement, which began in 1987, and
replaced with one that relied on Haagen-Dazs, another big
competitor, as well as Dreyer's and some company-owned
distributors. All in all, it was seen as a less-than-ideal solution
by many analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly not a negative for Unilever,'' said Jeffrey
G. Kanter, a food stocks analyst for Prudential Securities.
``Whether or not it becomes a home run remains to be seen. Unilever
is obviously looking at this for the long term. It's a fair price
for an asset with strong brand equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's, which had received takeover offers in the past,
issued an unusual statement in early December in which it said it
had received ``indications of interest'' and would be evaluating
them. The stock has risen since then from about $17 a share, and
people involved with the company, including several owners of
franchised ice-cream shops, said Ben &AMP; Jerry's appeared to be
taking the offers more seriously than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   A big concern of the franchise owners has been whether a new
owner would preserve the unusual aspects of Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
particularly its commitment to social causes like helping the
homeless and conserving the environment. Unilever maintains on its
corporate Web site that it is working to preserve clean water
resources and is involved with other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's made an offer of $31 a share in February, according to
a copy of documents submitted with the offer. Two days later,
Meadowbrook Lane Capital submitted an offer of $32 a share. Both
were lower than the $40 a share that Unilever bid around the same
time, said a person familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A Dreyer's spokesman had little comment when contacted Tuesday,
and refused to confirm reports that Dreyer's had raised its bid
this week to $38 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we would do on any kind of company would be on a
friendly basis, and we would only do things that are accretive to
our shareholders,'' said the spokesman, Tyler Johnston. ``Outside
of that, I can't comment on what's swirling out there.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A memory pill to help old people learn new tricks is
being developed by scientists who believe they will soon discover
an antidote to amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers said Monday they may have found an
explanation for why memory begins to fade in later life, a
discovery that could lead to the development of a memory-enhancing
drug.
</P>
<P>
   The research is focused on a strain of laboratory mouse that is
remarkable for its ability to learn and remember new things in old
age better than it could in its youth.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Giese, a memory scientist at University College London,
said the mouse lacks a gene that plays a crucial role in learning
when the animal is young but which is positively harmful for its
memory in later years. The same gene exists in humans and probably
has the same function in causing forgetfulness in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   By blocking the gene's activity in people older than 50, it
should be possible to improve their memory. ``The idea of a memory
pill is very exciting,'' Giese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fantastic if this turned out to be the beginning
of the development of a memory pill for the elderly. I can foresee
that we will be able in the future to improve learning and memory
abilities in old age _ basically to restore them to a young age,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have very important implications for society,
because the average lifespan is increasing and, along with
lifespan, we want to increase the quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mice, like humans, suffer a decline in the ability to learn and
remember new things as they grow old. The scientists at UCL's
Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, working with the
University of California, Los Angeles, found that the gene, which
is involved in the transmission of nerve signals, appears to play a
key role.

   (UNDATED) _ A memory pill to help old people learn new tricks is
being developed by scientists who believe they will soon discover
an antidote to amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers said Monday they may have found an
explanation for why memory begins to fade in later life, a
discovery that could lead to the development of a memory-enhancing
drug.
</P>
<P>
   The research is focused on a strain of laboratory mouse that is
remarkable for its ability to learn and remember new things in old
age better than it could in its youth.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Giese, a memory scientist at University College London,
said the mouse lacks a gene that plays a crucial role in learning
when the animal is young but which is positively harmful for its
memory in later years. The same gene exists in humans and probably
has the same function in causing forgetfulness in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   By blocking the gene's activity in people older than 50, it
should be possible to improve their memory. ``The idea of a memory
pill is very exciting,'' Giese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fantastic if this turned out to be the beginning
of the development of a memory pill for the elderly. I can foresee
that we will be able in the future to improve learning and memory
abilities in old age _ basically to restore them to a young age,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have very important implications for society,
because the average lifespan is increasing and, along with
lifespan, we want to increase the quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mice, like humans, suffer a decline in the ability to learn and
remember new things as they grow old. The scientists at UCL's
Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, working with the
University of California, Los Angeles, found that the gene, which
is involved in the transmission of nerve signals, appears to play a
key role.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known why the gene is beneficial for learning in young
mice, yet hinders their memory in older age. However, Giese said
blocking the gene in older people would have clear benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use pharmacology to mimic the same effects, to test
the idea (that) we can, ultimately, develop a memory pill for the
elderly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giese warned that bringing a memory pill to market could take
another 10 years of research, but the benefits would be significant
for an aging population. ``Such a pill should bring your learning
and memory ability up to that of a young age,'' he said. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Men in the United States who may still be having
trouble stiffening their resolve before sex will soon have an
alternative to the little blue lozenge known as Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for Uprima, a smaller pill that slides under the
tongue and promises, within 30 minutes, to assist with arousal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of increasing blood flow to the penis, this drug is
meant to raise levels of dopamine in that part of the brain
involved in causing erections.
</P>
<P>
   Just approved for consumer use by an advisory committee to the
powerful U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Uprima can, indeed,
cause a steep drop in blood pressure. Steep enough to cause a man
to faint.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible side effects that would not seem
conducive to efficient sexual union, like sleepiness, sweating,
vomiting and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the blood pressure factor that gave the FDA panel
some pause. (In the end, its members voted 9-3 to allow the pills
onto the market.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some people who will probably lose their lives
because they pass out at the top of the stairs or are operating a
car,'' agreed Dr. Peter Kowey, who voted in favor of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Among men tested for the drug, one in thirty suffered a collapse
in blood pressure or fainted. One, indeed, blacked out while
driving home from the doctor's office and crashed into a fence.
Another passed out in surgery, fell down and cracked his skull.
</P>
<P>
   But in the trials, Uprima did help some men regain their
strength sufficiently to engage in sexual intercourse _ and because
many of the America's estimated 30 million impotent men have shown
an intolerance to other medications _ the panel voted 9-3 that
Uprima should sell as long as men and their doctors get clear
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA does not have to heed its advisers' decisions but does
so in eight out of ten cases.
</P>
<P>
   TAP Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures Uprima, said men
``desperately need'' alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra became a huge seller when it hit the market in 1998 as
the only oral impotence treatment but is not without its risks. It
can in fact be fatal when taken by men on certain forms of heart
medication.
</P>
<P>
   TAP said in studies of 3,000 patients, most that lasted a month,
no one died.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the pills should carry this warning: to be taken
after you have entered the bedroom and when you are already lying
down. Not to be taken while climbing the stairs. &QL;

RULING UPHOLDS TOUGHER PENALTIES FOR FATAL CHILD ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Missouri appeals court on Tuesday upheld a
new, tougher approach that sent a Kansas City man to prison for
murder in the beating death of his 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling, combined with one last month in another Jackson
County case, upholds prosecutors who used murder charges against
people who unintentionally beat children to death.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County prosecutors said the rulings mean more people who
kill children during vicious discipline will be charged with
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy the ticket,'' County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said, ``and you
can take the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say the rulings improperly allow murder
convictions without proof of intent to kill. They said the issue
would be appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling by the appeals court in Kansas City upholds
John J. Williams' 1998 convictions for felony murder, endangering
the welfare of a child and armed criminal action.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 32, is serving life plus 30 years. Williams beat
Michael Scott to death with a frayed belt in 1997 after the boy wet
his pants.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, another Kansas City appeals court panel
upheld the felony murder conviction of Robert A. Bouser, 27. The
Grandview, Mo., man is serving 18 years in the 1997 beating death
of 1-year-old James Matthew Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, prosecutors used felony murder charges in hope of
getting stiffer sentences. Missouri prosecutors had rarely
attempted the tactic since the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Felony murder charges allow a murder conviction and up to life
in prison when someone dies during a serious crime, such as a
robbery. Prosecutors argued that the children's deaths were felony
murders during child abuse or child endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers in both cases argued at trial that their clients
did not intend to kill and so committed no more than involuntary
manslaughter _ which carries a maximum sentence of seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about felony murder in child abuse cases go back to an
1878 Missouri Supreme Court decision. The court ruled that felony
murder could not apply in the case of a man who beat a child to
death with a fishing pole.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed, the appeals court ruled, when Missouri enacted
a 1984 law that said felony murder charges could be used for almost
any crime resulting in death.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' appeals attorney argued in legal filings that the
appeal should have bypassed the appeals court and gone straight to
the Missouri Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew A. Schroeder, Bouser's appeals lawyer, said he would
appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings tilt the law far too much in favor of prosecutors
and impose harsh penalties on people who never intended to kill,
Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have another option in child beatings.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri General Assembly enacted a law in 1997 that allows
for up to a life sentence when child abuse results in a death.
</P>
<P>
   But that law, unlike the felony murder statute, does not require
a defendant to serve 85 percent of the sentence before parole.
Because of that, Beaird said, prosecutors will use felony murder
charges in the worst cases.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon said the 85 percent
requirement means those who kill children will serve many more
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly a bad day for child abusers,'' Nixon said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Popper, a Kansas City law professor, said such tougher
laws reflect changes in social attitudes that affect what has been
the heart of criminal law _ mental state at the time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're morally culpable for the result,'' Popper said,
``even if you didn't intend it.''

COMPUTER PROBLEMS LEFT U.S. UNABLE TO PROCESS SPY SATELLITE DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. government's ability to keep track of
looming international threats was drastically curtailed last year
because of a prolonged computer breakdown at the Pentagon agency
that collects and analyzes photographs from spy satellites, several
federal intelligence officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer malfunction was so bad last August that U.S.
intelligence agencies were left nearly blind for a few days, unable
to rely on photographs from any spy satellites for use in a wide
range of intelligence operations, officials added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a catastrophic systems failure,'' said one senior
official. ``We were really lucky that there weren't any major
crises going on at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer crisis, at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency,
began in early August and continued for about a month, and was far
more serious than the brief, previously disclosed Year 2000-related
problems in intelligence systems that occurred over the New Year's
holiday, officials said. It came as the mapping agency was
installing a new system, which caused the breakdown. Some critics
have said the new system may have been inadequately tested.
</P>
<P>
   After months of work, the problem has largely been solved,
although some officials said the system still does not work as it
should.
</P>
<P>
   The malfunction was seen as a serious problem within the
government because spy satellites are among the most important
national security tools available to the United States. They
provide the president and his advisers prized information through
high-resolution images on every national security issue, including
Chinese naval deployments and Iraq's rebuilding of its chemical
weapons plants.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, the nation's fleet of spy satellites
continued to take pictures, but the computer malfunction prevented
the mapping agency from quickly distributing photographs from them
over a classified network to Clinton administration policy-makers,
the CIA and the Pentagon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With its sophisticated hardware malfunctioning, the government
had to rely on low-tech solutions. Analysts at the mapping agency
would look at the photographs on computer screens and describe them
over the telephone to officials who needed the information. In
other cases, the agency made printouts from its computer terminals
and then had couriers deliver the photographs to policy-makers at
the White House and other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer databases that contained archives of older
photographs at the mapping agency were also malfunctioning, robbing
analysts of the ability to compare the few new images they were
receiving with earlier pictures of the same buildings and
installations. That made it extremely difficult for intelligence
officials to develop strong analytical judgments about critical
foreign policy issues facing the president.
</P>
<P>
   The system was so badly limited that only imagery dealing with
topics that posed short-term threats to the national security of
the United States _ the North Korean nuclear weapons program, for
example _ was processed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had had multiple hot spots flare up all at once, I don't
think we could have handled it,'' said one senior intelligence
official. ``We were not quite blind, but we were way short for at
least a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts working on longer-term issues _ narcotics production
and trafficking, for example _ were forced to endure much longer
delays in their requests to obtain satellite photographs, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a major dip in the volume of imagery,'' said one
official. ``If you were an analyst monitoring the development of
narcotics crops, or you were watching a new military facility being
constructed somewhere, you faced significant delays.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Senior government officials acknowledged that the prolonged
breakdown represented a major technological challenge for the U.S.
intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown has intensified an internal debate over whether
the government is prepared to handle a new generation of spy
satellites to be deployed over the next decade, the single most
expensive intelligence program in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the intelligence community is spending billions of
dollars for the new fleet of high-tech spy satellites while largely
ignoring how to process, analyze and distribute the flood of photos
those satellites will send to earth. Matching the new generation of
satellites with the system of collecting and processing their
photos ``will be like lashing together a Mercedes and a Trabant,''
said one official, comparing the German luxury car to the economy
compact produced by the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag on the satellite program, dubbed the Future
Imagery Architecture, quickly grew by 50 percent, prompting
Congress to demand a cap on spending increases. Although the exact
price of the program is classified, the cost overruns have raised
concerns about whether there will be enough money to improve the
systems on the ground to handle the data from the new satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the Future Imagery Architecture program is
being built without much consideration for the need to invest in
infrastructure to support it,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   Task forces made up of senior CIA and mapping agency officials
worked on the problem from August through December, first to rig
ways to get imagery to policy-makers, and then to fix the computer
malfunction itself. But problems at the mapping agency continued to
flare for months, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is still really fixed,'' said one senior
official.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Snow, acting chief of public affairs for the National
Imagery and Mapping Agency, said agency officials would not comment
on the malfunction. ``We can't go into details of the system
because of security issues,'' Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems developed just as the agency was
overhauling its main computer system and installing a new one,
called the National Exploitation System, in time to deal with Year
2000 problems, officials said. But as soon as it was installed in
early August, analysts found it impossible to transfer images to
administration policy-makers and other intelligence analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a massive information technology overhaul, and the
lesson is that we in the intelligence community have to learn how
to do that better,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a question about whether NIMA has expertise to manage
the technical challenge they are going to face in systems
integration and acquisition and support of the new satellites,''
another official said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Imagery and Mapping Agency has been at the center
of controversy since it was created in 1996, when spy satellite
photo collection and analysis was transferred from the CIA to the
Pentagon at the urging of the former director of central
intelligence, John M. Deutch. Critics in the intelligence community
warned that the move was a mistake. They argued that with the
Pentagon in control, the satellites would be used largely for
tactical military issues, like determining how many tanks are in a
certain region of Serbia, rather than intelligence issues with
broad political implications.

MICROSOFT FEELINGS FLY HEATEDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Nothing, it seems, inflames reader passions like a
column saying something in defense of Microsoft, the company many
Americans love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Not even at the height of Standard Oil's symbolism as the
quintessential robber barony has a company been able to generate
the magnitude of public enmity Bill Gates' empire elicits.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Friday's column was typical of what happens in the
aftermath of a favorable Microsoft commentary. The column posited
that Microsoft found itself suffering the wrath of Washington's
trustbusters because it had failed to grease the political wheels
with adequate amounts of campaign largess.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 or so Microsoft-related e-mails waiting Monday
morning, there were slightly more con responses than pro. The tone
of the supportive mail, however, paled in comparison to the vitriol
of the column's critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give you credit for being one of the stupidest SOBs
in journalism,'' said one particularly pungent missive. ``If you
have no idea what you're talking about, which you don't, then stop
misleading the public with your nonsense. This article is so
wrongheaded it isn't even funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, incidentally, failed to address any of the column's
specifics. It was more a rant than a considered response, which is
always the case when it comes to Microsoft haters. Read on:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your article is filled with specious reasoning, and your
statements appear to have been taken directly from a Microsoft
press release,'' charged one reader. ``Microsoft wields far too
much power, and if you will read all of the court documents related
to the trial, you will see that they wield it like a bludgeon,
smashing everything that threatens their dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dissenter apparently took issue with Chairman Bill's
attempts to create a warm and fuzzy image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to disagree. ... They should have been prosecuted and
punished long ago for the companies they put out of business and
unfair tactics. ... Bill wearing nice sweaters and giving a few
billion to charity doesn't change anything legally. ... If you rob
someone, and then do something good later, it doesn't change the
fact that you robbed someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the comedians, doing their sarcastic best to
emulate H.L. Mencken:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful piece of breathtakingly shallow reasoning. Brought
by the same folks that gave us `creationism' in their public
classrooms. No wonder so many people think the oxygen is cut off in
the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some roses amid the brickbats, though. This was my
personal favorite:
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations on your column,'' said one perspicacious
respondent. ``You have a better grasp of economics than most
university professors. It seems most politicians are determined to
wreck all American industry. Could it be simple jealousy of REAL
productivity, or is it blackmail?''
</P>
<P>
   Another letter got right to the heart of Microsoft's appeal and
success:
</P>
<P>
   ``I really appreciate what Microsoft has done for standardizing
an operating system that I think is inexpensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the enduring wonder of it all is the emotional
intensity. And given the widespread hostility toward Microsoft,
bashing this company is obviously good politics.

IN SAN FRANCISCO, OPENING DAY FOR BIG WALLETS AND NEW STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moving in `s' category) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gerry Needham was desperate, for all the world
to see. So was Carole Cunningham. And John Patel. And the three
guys in red Microsoft golf shirts who preferred to remain
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   They were all standing pathetically in front of San Francisco's
new monument to baseball, holding ``Need Giants Tickets'' signs,
hoping against hope five minutes before game time that some greedy
scalper might come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd pay up to a grand,'' said Needham, a salesman for an
Internet ad company. ``Five hundred _ for a bad seat,'' said
Cunningham, a designer for an online design firm. ``The sky's the
limit,'' said one of the three Microsoft guys, who said he was ``in
software.'' ``Whatever the market will bear.''
</P>
<P>
   This being opening day at Pacific Bell Park, with the San
Francisco Giants playing the Los Angeles Dodgers, the home team's
most hated rivals, those hoping for exorbitantly priced tickets
would have to settle for a $10 program or $25 commemorative T-shirt
to prove they were here on what Needham, 36, called ``one of the
historic days in San Francisco and baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone. Opening day, celebrated on the front pages of
the local newspapers, with continuous coverage on news radio and
with sidewalk salespeople giving away everything from coupons for
free videos to free massages, is the closest San Francisco has come
to having its own private holiday since a blackout stopped the city
in its tracks a year ago last fall. From the fireworks, which shot
rainbow colors into the pale blue sky, to the five F-15s to the
40,800 fans who skipped work or school on a Tuesday afternoon to
see the game, opening day took over the city like a Thanksgiving
Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if San Francisco, one of the biggest tourist cities
in the world, needed another attraction. But this seemingly
sophisticated urban enclave has a proud baseball history, what with
baseball greats Joe DiMaggio and Willie Mays (who is honored with a
statue in front of the park) local heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The $319 million Pacific Bell Park _ the utility company paid
$50 million to put its name on the park _ replaces Candlestick
Park, one of the most notorious in baseball. While Candlestick had
the pretty name, it was one of the windiest, foggiest parks in pro
baseball, forcing fans to huddle in blankets to see a game in July.
Like Baltimore's Camden Yards and other new parks, Pac Bell appeals
to the nostalgia for old stadiums, with a red brick facade and
large multipane windows. The closest seats are just 46 feet from
home plate. And passersby can gaze into right field, which abruptly
ends where it meets the waters of China Basin, in San Francisco
Bay. In one exhibition game last week, outfielder Barry Bonds hit a
home run over the right field fence right into the bay, and boaters
were plunked Tuesday in position near the field, hoping they might
catch a flying ball.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hoopla, however, the new ballpark has its critics.
It has only 4,800 dedicated parking spots, and while repeated
warnings from city officials to take mass transit or walk from the
financial district made traffic flow smoothly for the game's start,
it is not at all assured that the fans will continue to forgo their
cars during the course of 81 home games. The concessions, which
sell everything from garlic fries to sushi, are pricey; beer and a
dog will set you back $9, and the lines, at least during exhibition
games, were so long that fans nearly rioted. And the stadium's
location, in a formerly forlorn backwater of the city that
warehouses and factories called home, had an immediate gentrifying
effect even before the foundation for the park was laid, driving up
both commercial and residential rents and marking every vacant
patch of land for development, most of it for Internet companies
willing to pay more than landlords ask for.
</P>
<P>
   The best seats costs $42, making the park the sixth most
expensive in pro baseball. But that is clearly not too expensive
for some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could have bought a $42 seat, I would die a happy man,''
said Gerry Needham, who was so desperate for a seat by the second
inning that he was willing to pay $2,000 for a ticket. ``Maybe,''
he said, ``even two and a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the game, he could console himself upon hearing
that his beloved Giants had lost, 6 to 5.

ANDRETTI STILL HAS DESIRE TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The calendar on the wall reports, as of
today, that Michael Andretti is 177 days shy of his 38th birthday.
That same calendar informs us that only only one current CART FedEx
Championship Series driver - 41-year-old Roberto Moreno - is older
than Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   However, there hasn't been a calendar invented that measures
aggressiveness in a race car and desire to win races. And, for that
matter, even if there was, where do you hang a calendar in a race
car?
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is a guy that has been in the series for a long time
and every year he comes back as strong, if not stronger than the
year before,'' said Dario Franchitti, one of the young stars of the
series. ``So there is no loss of motivation, which you have got to
look at and say he is pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 17th season, Andretti has more race wins (38) and
laps led (6,119) than any other CART driver and has more poles (32)
than anyone but Rick Mears (39). A win this season would push
Andretti's consecutive seasons with a victory streak to 13 years,
which is one more than Mears.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, the Newman-Haas Racing veteran, bristles a bit when
broaching the subject of age and chuckles uncomfortably when
hearing tales of some of the younger CART driver's admiration of
the veteran star.
</P>
<P>
   ``My very first race and I'm starting next to Michael
Andretti,'' second-year driver Cristiano da Matta said of his CART
debut at the 1999 Grand Prix of Miami. ``I remember thinking that
was pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   He also remembers that Andretti sped his way to a second-place
finish that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I am the old guy, if you want to put it that way,''
said Andretti, whose father, Mario, was 53 when he won his last
race and is the patriach of one of America's first families of
racing. ``That's just the facts of life. But I don't feel old.
Experience is something you can't buy. I still like to think I'm as
aggressive as ever, which made me successful in this business.
Maybe I'm a little smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   When Andretti rolls into town this weekend for the Toyota Grand
Prix of Long Beach it will be the 252nd start of his career.
Chances are he'll take a minute to reminisce about his first CART
victory when he outdueled another young sensation from a racing
family Al Unser Jr. in the 1986 Long Beach Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Beach is really special to me and my family,'' said
Michael, who has one of four Andretti victories and three of the
family's six pole positions in Champ Car events at Long Beach. ``My
first time there to watch my dad was in 1976. It's a good feeling
to go back every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti has come to Long Beach as well as every other CART
facility the past three years with a Swift-Ford package that
trailed the Honda-Reynard setup which allowed Target/Chip Ganassi
Racing to win four consecutive championships. For the first two
years of that span, he was running on Goodyear tires, which were
second-best to Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to scratch out consecutive wins at the season opener
at Homestead-Miami Speedway in 1997-98 and had a victory in the
1999 Motorola 300 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Four more podium finishes in 1999 two seconds and two thirds
helped Andretti finish in fourth place in the championship, which
was his best showing since tying with Alex Zanardi for second place
in 1996 behind Jimmy Vasser. It could have been better without
struggles on road courses as 236 of the 237 laps he led came on
ovals.
</P>
<P>
   It's not Andretti's style to compete for fourth place - or for
that matter second or third. During the off season, Andretti and
fellow Newman-Haas driver Christian Fittipaldi returned to the Lola
chassis that Michael used to secure a season-high five victories in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The testing went very well on oval tracks, but Andretti's opener
on the Miami oval ended with disappointment as an engine part
caused an oil pressure drop to ended his day after 37 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian had the same problem in the (race) warmup and they
fixed it,'' Andretti said of his teammate, who finished seventh.
``He was lucky he had his problem before the race. It was
unfortunate for us that it was a 10 cent part which did us in.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointing start to what Andretti hopes is his
second championship CART season. Team managers from 15 CART teams,
in fact, voted Andretti as the pre-season favorite to win the 2000
championship. And Max Papis, the race winner in Miami, agreed with
that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like Michael is the favorite,'' Papis said.
``Michael is very experienced and he has a tremendous background
and lot of personality. He knows what he's doing out there.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, the CART champion in 1991, greets the expectations
with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they are right,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, Andretti will continue his career long enough to
satisfy the final three years on his Newman-Haas contract. After
that, depending on the strength of his racing desire, he'll make
come career decisions.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing he's certain of, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely won't drive as long as Dad,'' Michael said. ``I'm
not sure that can be done again. Nobody has more passion for the
sport - or maybe another sport - than Dad has for racing. I know
he's dying to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Michael does join his father on the sideline, he'll have
plenty of business ventures to keep him busy. And he can thank his
racing career for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary to think about what my life would have been like
without racing,'' Andretti said. ``I have no idea what I would have
done. Who knows, maybe I would have sold vacuum cleaners door to
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe he would have sold calendars.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Shrouded in darkness on the tough streets of the South
Side, a Roman Catholic priest, Michael Pfleger, is looking for
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pfleger, the 50-year-old pastor of St. Sabina Church, pays cash
for a half-hour, typically $50, and then uses the time to talk to
the women about ways to escape the indignity and danger of selling
their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of three parishioners from St. Sabina, sometimes without
Pfleger, make the rounds to rescue prostitutes. One of the women
they found was Kathy Ellis, a 40-year-old drug addict and
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ashamed of the way my life is,'' she told Pfleger, ``but I
got six kids and lots of problems, and I don't know what else to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfleger told Ellis that the church would help her get drug
counseling and job training, would clean her clothes and even pay
for a haircut at a beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody cares,'' said Ellis, who now attends Narcotics
Anonymous meetings. ``It's a feeling I never did feel before. When
you're out there prostituting, you don't think anybody cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Using cash from church collections to buy time to counsel
prostitutes and drug dealers, Pfleger is once again raising
eyebrows among the leaders of the Archdiocese of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A '60s-style social activist who has long been highly critical
of the church hierarchy, Pfleger has staged sit-in protests at drug
paraphernalia shops and has whitewashed liquor billboards in poor
neighborhoods. In his latest street campaign, Pfleger says that
more than a dozen prostitutes have left the streets with the aid of
St. Sabina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has spent too much time concentrating on fish frys
and workshops,'' Pfleger told parishioners at one recent Sunday
Mass. ``We ought to be doing things like paying for haircuts for
homeless people, so they can go on a job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   The parish initially raised $2,000 in a special collection at
Sunday Mass. Since word has spread about the campaign people
outside the church have sent another $4,000. A stock broker from
the wealthy North Shore sent money, and an 80-year-old man pedaled
a bicycle from miles away to give a check for $500.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 years since Pfleger started his work at St. Sabina,
transforming a dying Irish Catholic parish into a vibrant black
congregation, some of the more conservative leaders of the
archdiocese have regarded him as something of a troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Francis George, the conservative leader of the Chicago
Archdiocese, the largest in the nation, has made no public comment
about Pfleger's work.
</P>
<P>
   Pfleger said he crossed paths with the cardinal recently, and
that the church leader ``made a comment that seemed sarcastic.''
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese has referred calls about Pfleger to Bishop
Joseph Perry, who characterized the notion of paying prostitutes as
``somewhat out of the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   But Perry said church leaders, including George, had no
animosity for Pfleger, and did not doubt his sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Pfleger has expressed frustration with the church
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls and offers of help from everywhere but my
archdiocese,'' said Pfleger, sitting in his office one recent
afternoon. ``I want to ask them: How is what I'm doing not part of
the gospel? The church leaders talk about evangelization. Well, if
this isn't evangelization, I don't know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   In his street work with prostitutes and drug dealers, Pfleger
organizes three-man teams to search the streets; one of the men
sits in a nearby car with a two-way radio, ready for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago police, who have praised Pfleger's work, also keep
tabs on the street mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Pfleger works hand-in-hand with the police,'' said
Dexter Yarbrough, a community policing officer in Chicago. ``He
consults us before he does these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarbrough said he has watched Pfleger knock on the doors of
``crack houses'' and issue his warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say, `What you're doing is wrong, and I'll use the power
of prayer _ and the power of the Chicago Police Department, if I
have to _ to stop it,''' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   In talks with gang leaders last year, Pfleger elicited a promise
from gang leaders that young people who want to leave a gang be
allowed to do so _ as long as they do not join a rival gang.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Wallace, 22, a former drug dealer and gang member, is
one of the men of St. Sabina who walks the streets to talk to
prostitutes and drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in jail six times,'' he said. ``And now I don't have
to look over my shoulder anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfleger said the prostitutes the church has found have been of
virtually all ages, from girls 13 years old to women in their 50s
and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, he said, women are terrified of the pimps who
control them. St. Sabina has helped move at least two of these
women to other neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman pulled up her shirt to show me how her pimp had
burned the nipples of her breasts,'' Pfleger said. ``She apparently
had come back one night without bringing in enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfleger shook his head in anger and sadness, and cursed.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno's aides said Tuesday
night that she was prepared to fly to Miami on Wednesday to meet
with Cuban-American leaders and relatives of Elian Gonzalez to
persuade the boy's Miami family to surrender the 6-year-old Cuban
boy peacefully to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno drew closer to a decision to meet with Cuban-Americans,
Justice Department officials were completing a letter to be sent to
Elian's relatives, ordering them to relinquish custody of the boy
no later than 10 a.m. on Thursday at the general aviation terminal
at the Opa-Locka Airport north of Miami, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian would then be flown immediately to a reunion with his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, although the precise site of the
arrival has not yet been decided, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has told aides at the Justice Department for several days
that she was convinced that her direct intervention could soothe
the fiery passions within the Cuban-American population of Miami,
where Reno grew up and where she served for 15 years as the elected
local prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno's desire to travel to Florida underscored how she has
been swept up by the raucous updraft of politics, emotion and drama
swirling around the child in Miami, the city where Reno experienced
firsthand the violent clash at the crossroads of the law and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, as the state attorney for Miami-Dade County, Reno
watched as the city erupted in a riot after prosecutors in her
office failed to win a conviction against four white police
officers charged with the beating death of black insurance
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   The custody battle over Elian has seemed to renew Reno's vigor.
She has shed her wooden, often uncommunicative style, speaking
emotionally and emphatically at news conferences and television
interviews about her sympathy for the many Cuban-Americans who
vehemently oppose sending Elian back to the homeland ruled by of
Fidel Castro, whom Reno has said she unequivocally opposes.
</P>
<P>
   But she has also said that international politics should not
block the reunion of father and son, an outcome that she said was
correct as a long-established matter of immigration law and family
values. Pediatric psychiatrists, she said, have recommended turning
over Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possibility of an angry confrontation over the boy
has haunted negotiations between the government and Elian's Florida
relatives ever since fishermen plucked him from the Atlantic Ocean
off Florida on Thanksgiving after his mother drowned in their
ill-fated voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have said they would obey the law, including a
court order allowing the government to transfer custody to Elian's
father, but they have never agreed to turn the child over to his
father, repeatedly asking for further legal review of whether the
child should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seemed headed to a showdown when last week, Elian's
father arrived in the United States to retrieve his son from the
Miami relatives, who were granted temporary custody until federal
authorities ordered that the boy be reunited with his father.
Gonzalez has told authorities he intends to take his son back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the boy's relatives offered a proposal that was
officially ignored by the Justice Department. In a letter
distributed outside the Miami home of Lazaro Gonzalez, the
great-uncle with whom Elian has been living, the family said it
would be willing to meet Elian's father at any ``neutral place in
South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter added that the session would be followed immediately
by a second meeting with the father that would include Elian. The
relatives sought an assurance from the government that Elian would
not be forcibly taken from them at the proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who is staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat
in a Washington, D.C., suburb, has said he does not want to meet
the Miami relatives, but would fly to Florida if necessary to pick
up his son. Afterward, the father has said, the adult members of
the Gonzalez family might seek a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department Tuesday, two Miami area mayors, Alex
Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Joseph Carollo of Miami, met with
Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the immigration service,
and urged the attorney general to arrange a meeting between Elian's
father and the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Reno issued a statement saying that she
welcomed their suggestions. She added, ``The mayors have asked me
to speak with leaders of the Miami community and I have indicated
my willingness and desire to do so. We agreed to continue working
together to seek an outcome that allows Elian to be reunited with
his father in the best way possible for him, his family and for the
Miami community as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Juan Miguel Gonzalez has said he does not want to
defect to the United States, the House Republican leadership and
Cuban-American lawmakers Tuesday invited him to a private meeting
on Wednesday in the Capitol. The lawmakers said in a letter to
Elian's father, which was delivered by congressional aides, that
they wanted him ``to be sure that you are aware of all the options
available to you as you make your decision.''

BUSH PROPOSES TAX CREDIT TO EXPAND HEALTH COVERAGE TO WORKING POOR
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ After months of avoiding the campaign debate on
national health care, George W. Bush on Tuesday offered a tax
credit plan to expand health coverage to the working poor and
former welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the $39.6 billion proposal would help expand health
coverage to as many as 18 million Americans who can't afford
insurance now but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. Bush
called them people who ``live in a world above welfare's
assistance, but beneath prosperity's promise.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Every low-income, working family in America must have access
to basic health insurance _ for themselves and for their
children,'' he said. ``For a family without health insurance, a
single doctor bill can be a financial disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed a refundable health insurance tax credit, which
would be worth as much as $2,000 a year to a family earning less
than $30,000 and could be spent only to purchase health insurance.
The credit could be advanced to insurance companies to pay
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, called for expanding tax-free medical savings accounts.
His plan also calls for changing federal law to allow the creation
of insurance pools to make health coverage more affordable for
small businesses that don't now offer such coverage to their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative groups and the National Federation of Independent
Business hailed Bush's plan, while the more liberal FamiliesUSA
called it ``trivial'' and ``a placebo for the growing uninsurance
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has
made health care a major element of his campaign. His aides Tuesday
challenged Bush's sincerity on expanding health care coverage for
the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Bush's record in Texas I think it is obvious
that these issues are new to him. He hasn't done anything to
improve health care in Texas,'' said Gore spokeswoman Kathleen
Begala.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, for example, ranks 49th among the states in the
percentage of children with health insurance. Nearly one-fourth of
Texas' 5.8 million children don't have health insurance, although
the state began enrollment last week for a new
government-sponsored, low-cost Children's Health Insurance Program,
or CHIPs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush laid out his health care plan as a key part of his ``New
Prosperity Initiative,'' which he unveiled at a faith-based social
services ministry in a working-class neighborhood in this
Midwestern city.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also proposed programs to help low-income Americans buy
houses and open savings accounts. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; He said that too many Americans were being left behind in this
``age of unmeasured prosperity.'' Greater opportunities to obtain
health insurance, own a home and save money in the bank were
crucial to offering them hope, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our society, it is easy to be secluded in success, in gated
communities and separate schools. Yet our growing nation must not
be allowed to grow apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His five-year health care tax credit plan covers as much as 90
percent of the cost of coverage _ up to a maximum of $1,000 a year
per individual and $2,000 per family _ for eligible recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals earning $15,000 or less a year and families with
annual incomes of $30,000 or less would be eligible for the maximum
tax credit. The government's share of the cost would be decreased
as a family's income rises. Individuals earning more than $45,000,
families making more than $60,000 and people who are offered health
insurance through their employers would be ineligible for the
program.
</P>
<P>
   To help low-income children and their parents, Gore has proposed
expanding the existing CHIPs program and for expanding the
eligibility limits for the federal program to about $41,000 for a
family of four. The vice president claimed that this expanded
funding would ensure that all children have access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also proposed a 25 percent refundable tax credit on
premium costs for individuals who cannot buy health insurance
through employers.
</P>
<P>
   John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis called
Bush's plan ``bold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a moderate income family, the Bush credit is twice as
generous as the Gore credit,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Pollack, executive director of FamiliesUSA, said the
Bush plan falls short because it would pay for no more than half
the actual cost of buying insurance for a typical low-income
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the primary reason families are uninsured is because
they can't afford coverage, these tiny tax credits will do little
to change that equation,'' Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   Federation of Independent Business president Jack Faris praised
Bush's health plan as a means of allowing small businesses to buy
health insurance for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's campaign noted the bipartisan Congressional Budget
Office released a report in January that found overall enrollment
in employer-sponsored health care plans would only increase by
about 330,000 people nationally under a system of association
health plans.

WHEN ART SHOULD YIELD TO NATURE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHOEK, Namibia _ This time every year, when the gingko tree
outside my door in Manhattan begins to bud, I advise art to run for
cover. Wagner and Bach have been doing well at Lincoln Center, but
hibernation deserves some serious thought. The flowering pear trees
are acting up on city sidewalks, and nothing going on under any
roof can compete with them.
</P>
<P>
   Art should lie low until October and then come out of hiding.
Although nature and art in a single bundle (at Tanglewood in
Massachusetts, Ravinia in Illinois and Blossom in Ohio) may sound
like a bargain, open-air concerts end up as either greenery with
Muzak or high art with low-flying Cessnas. The antagonism is built
in.
</P>
<P>
   Music won't go away, however. Too many musicians' salaries to
pay, too many seats to sell, too many boring evenings in the
country to fill with culture. It is an awful thing to admit, but
behind the most high-minded art lurks money. Not many make much of
it in classical music, yet enough has to be ground out to keep the
paychecks coming.
</P>
<P>
   The status we city folk assign to high art is a presumption born
of our surroundings. We make everything around us with our own
hands. Even the bushes in our backyards are where we want them to
be. There are rats and cockroaches to remind us that we are not in
complete control, but such things tend to be mentally pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   Every composer, conductor, musicologist and critic ought to be
forced to spend time in places like West Africa. The shrinkage of
stature would both alarm and instruct them. The roads of Botswana
are less invitations to travel than warnings to stay home. The
airstrips are several hundred feet of rough clay cut out of the
bush. Pray that they are not mud and that a herd of impala has not
camped on your taxi space. Africa barely notices your presence.
</P>
<P>
   People count for little in a country of 230,000 square miles
inhabited by 1.3 million citizens. Given the vastness and variety
of life, the works of man rate only a small entry in a very large
catalog of experience.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary beauty of living and growing things in the
Okavango Delta in Botswana makes one forget the equally
extraordinary danger to the relatively helpless human being.
Hippopotamuses may be the endearing clowns of Walt Disney's
``Fantasia,'' but hippos kill more people than any other animal in
Africa. (Never get between them and the water.)
</P>
<P>
   By day there is the overwhelming silence of the bush. At night
one hears the community and the competition. Lions moan in tall
grass; hippopotamuses grunt in bursts of three as they come from
the water to feed on the rushes around you; baboons engage in
high-decibel argument. Each is saying to the bush, ``I am here, and
this is who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone pondering the meaning of art might give a listen to the
birds and animals of the Okavango. The sounds they make are both
warning and welcome, but mostly they are acts of self-expression
and thus self-preservation. If animals can be said to have an art,
it is in the unequivocal announcement of their presence. The
message to their own kind is, ``We are the same''; to others, ``We
are different from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Wagner and Bach are doing the same thing, even if we,
having exalted our presence in the world beyond all reality, are
too presumptuous to realize it. Instead of calls or cries, people
have language, be it visual, verbal or musical. Language is more
complex and flexible than the squawk of the gray lory, and not as
uniform. The message changes from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe our art is what we create as a substitute. Perhaps our
music is simply a way of telling ourselves and the inhabitants of
the next tree who we are and what we are not. Just as the sight and
sound of one stork incorporates the evolutionary story of a
species, so Wagner's ``Ring'' encapsulates a genetic history of its
own. It also says to the squirrel on the lawn, ``I am different
from you.''
</P>
<P>
   If we could bring ourselves to renounce art and music in the
months when nature is at its most powerful, we might be disabused
of the notion of our special connection with the almighty. The
Beethoven Ninth Symphony, which seemed so close to God in January,
would take on a very different look in August, heard at a place
where people have little presence and almost no influence. The
Beethoven Ninth without a roof over its head is just another
birdcall. It proclaims that humans write Beethoven Ninths and that
other animals don't.
</P>
<P>
   Another antidote to human arrogance are the colossal red sand
dunes of western Namibia. Drive among them, and you will feel awe
and a few twinges of fear as well. You are not where you belong,
and there is nothing but emptiness behind you and up ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Windhoek, the Namibian capital, looks tidy. An orchestra or
opera company might pass through yearly, usually from Cape Town,
but table conversation tends toward land and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Civilization puts up a brave front, but the surrounding Kalahari
Desert has its crushing psychic effect. Human beings do best in
bigger cities, where they can assure themselves of their mutual
importance. We may think that the sounds of Bach and Wagner reach
to the heavens, but Africa tells us that they are minor peeps,
identifying humans to themselves and to any other creature that
might care.

NTSB CALLS FOR VIDEO CAMERAS IN COCKPITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that the EgyptAir crash may never be fully
understood from the black boxes and the wreckage, the National
Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday evening that all planes
should have cockpit video recorders, and that the power switches
for the cameras, as well as the voice and data recorders, should be
moved to where the crews cannot reach them.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted unanimously to recommend to the Federal Aviation
Administration that recorders holding two hours of video be
required in all new planes beginning in 2003, and be installed in
older planes by 2005. It said the planes should have enough cameras
in each cockpit to see all the cockpit screens and other displays,
and all actions by the crews in working the controls
</P>
<P>
   Pilot unions oppose cameras as a violation of their workplace
privacy. The Safety Board said, though, that it would treat the
video images just as it treats the cockpit voice recorder tapes,
playing them only for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The board cited several crashes where cockpit images would have
been helpful, including two brought down by smoke or fire, Valujet
592, a DC-9 that crashed in the Everglades on May 11, 1996, and
Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11 that crashed off Halifax, Nova
Scotia, on Sept. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But in Egyptair 990, which crashed on Oct. 31, 1999, as the
board delicately put it, ``questions still remain as to the exact
environment in the cockpit prior to the upset.'' Publicly, the
board has said only that investigators believe that the crash may
have been a deliberate act, but its own investigators, and those of
other Federal agencies, believe that the plunge from an uneventful
cruise fight, which killed all 217 people aboard the Boeing 767,
may have been a suicide by the relief co-pilot.

MARCH BRINGS ANOTHER RECORD FOR KANSAS CITY AREA CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ March is always a very good month for the
casinos, but last month's performance stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gaming Commission reports show the area's four casinos
raked in an astonishing $48.3 million on record admissions of 2.4
million. That shattered the previous high marks of $44.6 million
and 2.2 million, set in February.
</P>
<P>
   Those dollars are gamblers' combined losses, and the growing
tally concerns foes of legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are gambling. That's a fact,'' said Steve Taylor,
executive director of the anti-gambling lobby Casino Watch. And
that's thanks mostly to open boarding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more people gamble, more and more people will wind
up being addicted. Those are the people that we are concerned about
_ those that can't handle it,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The big numbers hardly raised an eyebrow at the region's
economic think tank.
</P>
<P>
   David Reisdorph, a senior researcher at the Mid-America Regional
Council in Kansas City, noted that $48.28 million a month _ $579.36
million a year _ represented a 1.3 percent sliver of area
residents' $46 billion in annual after-tax income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the things we can consume, it barely registers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, consumers in the 11-county metropolitan area this
year are projected to spend $6.46 billion at area restaurants and
bars, $3.2 billion on new furniture and household goods, and $950
million for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Reisdorph added that a similar free-spending phenomenon occurred
around the same time every spring and early summer on new cars and
durable goods, such as refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is that everybody had recovered from
their Christmas spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maxine Odell of the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater
Kansas City speculated that another factor for the riverboats'
March Madness might be the annual Big 12 men's and women's college
basketball tournaments. The games attract around 10,000 out-of-town
visitors to Kansas City who are looking for entertainment between
games.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming Commission financial analyst Jim Oberkirsch has another
theory: ``The early (federal income tax) filers are already getting
their refund checks.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Finamore, Station Casino's president for Midwest
operations, sees the effects firsthand. ``People are getting money
to burn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri boats in the metropolitan St. Louis market also set a
record in March by topping $37.4 million, leading to a statewide
revenue record of $90.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of open boarding in St. Louis last summer and in
Kansas City last fall is certainly one of the biggest factors for
the overall bump in gambling activity. Admissions and revenues have
been climbing at unprecedented rates since those changes.
</P>
<P>
   But spring is also a factor, Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, like clockwork, Kansas City casinos' best months are
March and the peak vacation period in July. If the past is any
guide, the market should fall back to the low to mid $40 million
level until midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   The irony isn't lost on Finamore.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago in March we were talking about $42 million being a
record that month,'' he said. ``Now we're wondering if we'll slump
back to that level.''
</P>
<P>
   But the past may no longer be prelude.
</P>
<P>
   The customer-friendly dynamics of open boarding appear to have
rewritten the laws of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   Before open boarding, casino patrons had to plan and time their
arrival to coincide with phantom two-hour ``cruise'' departures or
wait up to 75 minutes for the next chance to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Now casino doors are open all the time. Statewide last month,
riverboat admissions were up 27 percent from March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to a casino is now a spur-of-the-moment thing,'' said
Bill Edwards, founder of the Kansas City-based International
Association of Slot and Video Players.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area's battle for market share, longtime
leader Harrah's trailed Station Casino for the third straight
month. But give Harrah's an A-plus for trying.
</P>
<P>
   The North Kansas City casino in March topped $15.9 million,
breaking Station's July 1999 record of $15.6 million for the
richest month in Kansas City riverboat history.
</P>
<P>
   But Station posted an even better March _ $16.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Station entertained more than 850,000 patrons last month,
topping the monthly admission record of 838,000 it set in February
1997. That was Station's first full month of operation, when the
sprawling entertainment complex was still a ``must see'' novelty.
</P>
<P>
   While Station is the market's new leader, Harrah's is still more
efficient at making money.
</P>
<P>
   In March the Kansas City marketplace had 9,249 ``gaming
positions,'' or places for gamblers at any one time. Harrah's
operates 27.6 percent of those positions but last month captured
almost 33 percent of the market's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Station owns almost 45 percent of the positions but took in 34
percent of the dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity means Harrah's frequently is operating at
capacity, while Station must absorb the overhead expense of excess
slot machines and table games that no one is playing.

CHASE TO PAY $7.7 BILLION FOR FLEMING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ Chase Manhattan formally agreed Tuesday to acquire
Robert Fleming Holdings for $7.7 billion, part of an effort by
Chase to strengthen its presence in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which had been widely expected, means the end of
independence for Fleming, one of the last privately held investment
banks based in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It also illustrates the intensifying pressure on midsize firms
like Fleming to merge with larger institutions on favorable terms
or risk being swallowed up or driven out of an increasingly global
business.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said its motive in acquiring Fleming had little to do with
saving money by trimming overlapping businesses. Rather, the
American bank said, the purchase would help vault it into a
position that would allow it to compete more effectively around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will give Chase, the third-largest bank in the
United States, a quick presence in Asia, where Fleming's asset
management business has been flourishing, and in Europe. The
addition of Fleming also gives Chase new revenue streams from asset
management.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is expected to be completed by July or August.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about expense synergies,'' said William B. Harrison
Jr., Chase Manhattan's chief executive. ``If you like the growth
prospects for Asia and Europe, then you will like this
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all investors and analysts viewed the deal so favorably,
with some saying Chase might have overpaid for Fleming. Under the
terms of the agreement, Chase will pay about $4.1 billion in cash
and $3.6 billion in its stock. In New York on Tuesday, Chase
Manhattan shares fell $2.125, to $86.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly took a bit for Chase to leverage it away from the
family,'' said Julian Bird, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais
Securities here.
</P>
<P>
   Chase acknowledged that the acquisition would dilute earnings
the first year, but maintained that the dilution was not
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, which is not a publicly traded company, is 29.4
percent-owned by the Fleming family _ which included Ian Fleming,
the writer who created the character James Bond.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was founded 127 years ago by Robert Fleming, a onetime
bookkeeper who saw a future in investing in the cattle ranches and
railroads of America, then the world's most promising emerging
economy. Fleming formed the Scottish-American Investment Trust,
which expanded into one of Britain's biggest asset managers by the
time of his death in 1933 at age 88.
</P>
<P>
   It has since grown to operate in 40 countries with a staff of
7,500, managing $140 billion in clients' funds. The company also
owns Jardine Matheson Holdings, one of Asia's leading investment
management and banking groups.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that the new company, which will be called
Chase Flemings, would still operate in a second-tier league to
larger and more powerful investment banks like Merrill Lynch and
the Goldman Sachs Group.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Fleming, a loss of independence may have been inevitable
if it is to ultimately survive in the face of aggressive global
expansions by American firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same dilemma that Schroders faced,'' said John Tyce,
a banking analyst at SG Securities here, referring to the
acquisition by Citigroup of that British investment bank in
January. ``In case no one has noticed, the Yanks are here and they
are making people squeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining independent British investment bank is now
Cazenove &AMP; Co., which, interestingly, advised Fleming during the
negotiations with Chase Manhattan. Chase's own
mergers-and-acquisitions unit acted as its adviser.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Fleming sold its half-stake in a joint
venture with T. Rowe Price Associates for $780 million to Price,
the Baltimore-based mutual fund company and money manager. Rowe
Price Fleming manages about $43 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, Fleming's current chief executive,
William Garrett, will continue to run the business. Chase said no
layoffs are expected.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Fleming reflects Chase's strategy of building
its business by making several smaller acquisitions rather than
merging with one of the bigger banks. Last year, Chase bought
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist for $1.35 billion, strengthening itself in
technology-related investment banking.

OPENING EYES TO A KUBRICK MASTERPIECE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick's death last spring, followed by the release of
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' revived a long-running argument among critics
and fans about whether Kubrick was one of the most important
contemporary filmmakers or merely among the most self-important _
an avatar of cinematic perfection or a cold, detached
perfectionist.
</P>
<P>
   The debate shows no signs of ending any time soon. Last month,
Vanity Fair published a long, passionate defense of Kubrick, and in
particular of his widely unloved last work, by his friend and
sometime collaborator Michael Herr. And beginning Friday, Film
Forum will provide fuel for many nights of heated cafe-table
contention as it mounts a three-week retrospective of the
director's work, ranging from the limpid black-and-white of
``Killer's Kiss'' to the deep red of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' _ from Kirk
Douglas to Jack Nicholson to Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget _ though many have tried _ Ryan O'Neal, who
played the title role in ``Barry Lyndon.'' Film Forum's series
opens with a full week of Kubrick's slow, gorgeous interpretation
of William Makepeace Thackeray's obscure, semi-parodic homage to
the picaresque novels of Fielding and Smollett. This film _
legendary for its length, its cinematography and its costumes _ has
never figured very prominently in the squabbling over Kubrick's
oeuvre. Now audiences can set aside their preconceptions and view a
clean new 35-mm print with fresh eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But our eyes may be more jaded than they were 25 years ago, when
``Barry Lyndon'' was released to bafflement, exasperation and only
an occasional note of praise. It was nominated for eight Academy
Awards and won five, for cinematography, set decoration, art
direction, costume design and adapted score. (Milos Forman's ``One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' swept the major Oscars.)
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's previous two films, ``2001'' and ``A Clockwork
Orange,'' had been successful enough to entice Warner Brothers to
invest $11 million in 183 minutes of episodic storytelling complete
with third-person voiceover narration and printed chapter headings.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, as Vincent Canby noted in The New York Times,
movies in which characters write ``with a feather'' were a hard
sell in the movie industry. ``Barry Lyndon'' may not have restored
the prestige of the literary costume drama (``period _ or feather _
films,'' as Canby put it) in Hollywood. But in hindsight the film
seems to prophesy the ascendancy of James Ivory, Ismail Merchant
and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, whose tastefully decorated, scrupulous
adaptations of literary masterworks have been among the most widely
praised and influential films of the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But resemblances between ``Barry Lyndon'' and the renderings of
E.M. Forster, Jane Austen and Henry James that constitute a minor
genre unto themselves are misleading. For one thing, the literary
feather film is usually a festival of big acting, and Kubrick was
never more indifferent to his cast than in ``Barry Lyndon.'' Within
the movie's formal restraints, however, the acting is nearly
flawless. O'Neal and Marisa Berenson (as the preternaturally pallid
Lady Lyndon) are surprisingly affecting.
</P>
<P>
   But a deeper distinction lies in Kubrick's canny choice of
literary source, and his brazen subversion of it. Most films
adapted from books strive, above all, to be faithful. With good
exceptions (Amy Heckerling's ``Clueless'') and bad (Pam Densham's
``Moll Flanders''), fidelity to a book is commonly taken to require
the careful preservation of its every nuance and detail.
</P>
<P>
   But this approach dooms even intelligent and sensitive readings
like Ivory's ``Howards End'' or Ang Lee's ``Sense and Sensibility''
to charming mediocrity, as though they were school essays on the
great books rather than fully imagined versions of them. This is
because part of what makes the books great _ what makes them live _
is their modernity, the sense of vital contemporaneity we get when
we read.
</P>
<P>
   Austen did not set out to recreate Regency England; she lived in
it, and the country house dramas of status, ambition, and desire
she wrote are also dramas of incomplete social change.
</P>
<P>
   But not costume dramas. The line of English novelists that
followed from Austen _ the great tradition, as F.R. Leavis defined
it, of George Eliot, Henry James and D.H. Lawrence _ is relatively
unconcerned with recreating the past. To be faithful to them by
means of painstaking recreation is thus, necessarily, to betray
them.
</P>
<P>
   Thackeray's first novel, which nobody has ever called a
masterpiece, is a different kind of literary beast. It is, for one
thing, a costume drama in its own right. Published in 1844, ``The
Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.'' not only unfolds in the latter
decades of the 18th century, but is a self-conscious throwback to
the literature of that era, which its author viewed as superior to
the work of his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows then,'' Thackeray wrote in a coda he later
suppressed, ``but the old style of Moliere and Fielding, who drew
from nature, may come into fashion again, and replace the terrible,
the humorous, always the genteel impossible now in vogue?''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick, always an enemy of the ``genteel impossible,''
responded to this provocation, and applied it against the cinematic
vogue of his own time by making a movie at once florid in its
realism and brazenly, gluttonously formalistic. His shots duplicate
18th-century prints and paintings, as though he were Hogarth
telling stories by tableau. And like Hogarth's prints, ``Barry
Lyndon's'' static compositions teem with life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the futures Kubrick painted in ``2001'' and ``A Clockwork
Orange,'' his past does not feel out of date. More than most movies
drawn from antique literature, ``Barry Lyndon'' recreates in the
viewer the leisurely absorption of reading a 19th-century novel. It
is also a masterpiece of 18th-century cinema _ the kind of movie
they used to make back before movies were invented.

GOVERNORS BASH INTERNET PANEL IN LETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the nation's 50 governors will deliver
to Congress a scathing bipartisan attack on the Internet tax
commission on Wednesday, denouncing it as a forum for special
interests seeking tax breaks while threatening the system in which
states set their own tax policies to pay for police, fire-fighters
and schools.
</P>
<P>
   The letters come as the Republican leadership in Congress hosts
a series of events to toast the report by an advisory commission
that would effectively continue the exemption from sales taxes on
products sold by companies that operate only in cyberspace.
National retailers with bricks-and-mortar stores would have to
continue collecting sales taxes on all sales, including those over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, 36 governors, most of whom have reputations as
tax cutters, had signed a letter saying that Congress should not
interfere with the right of each state to determine its tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason to oppose the Internet tax
commission's report ``is that it would substantially interfere with
state sovereignty,'' the governors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Constitution was very clear in both ensuring state
sovereignty and creating a critical balance between federal and
state authority. For well over 200 years the federal government has
respected state sovereignty and has been extremely careful not to
interfere with the states' ability to independently raise revenues.
This proposal would dramatically undercut this precedent,'' the
governors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also says that the Internet tax commission ignored
its mandate, instead pursuing special interest tax breaks sought by
companies with seats on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of addressing the requirements laid out in the law to
recommend a new state and local sales tax system to provide for
fairness and balance,'' the governors wrote, ``the proposal chose
to use this opportunity to seek a host of new and expensive special
tax breaks. We urge you to reject the report.``
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by 19 Republicans, 15 Democrats and two
independents, Jesse Ventura of Minnesota and Angus King of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Four other governors sent separate letters supporting state
sovereignty in taxation as a constitutional principle, but not
attacking the Internet tax commission.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did not sign the letter are Governors George W.
Bush of Texas, Jeb Bush of Florida, George Pataki of New York and
Governor James S. Gilmore 3rd of Virginia, all Republicans, and
Gray Davis of California, a Democrat. Gilmore chaired the Internet
tax commission.
</P>
<P>
   The support for a tax-free Internet has caused deep divisions
between Capitol Hill Republicans and Republicans who run
statehouses and city halls, where sales taxes are the largest
single source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Hill Republicans are also under attack from
retailers ranging from organizations of mom-and-pop merchants to
Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer. Only a handful of large
retailers favor the proposal to keep the Internet exempt from sales
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill, who say any tax cut is a good tax
cut, see the Internet as critical to future prosperity and want to
be seen as its protector from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that solid support among congressional Republicans
for a tax-free Internet is weakening in Washington, on Tuesday Sen.
John McCain quietly canceled plans for the Senate Commerce
Committee to vote tomorrow on a bill to extend the Internet Tax
Freedom Act for three years to 2006. The withdrawal was revealed
when the issue did not appear on the committee agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Buse, the committee staff director, said the planned vote
was delayed indefinitely ``at request of senators who wanted more
time to look at the issue and find out if they are in favor of a
moratorium or favor new taxes on their constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Buse said McCain favors ``stepping back and taking a larger
view'' of Internet taxation and wants to avoid ``a rush to judgment
on how to impose taxes'' on goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, Buse said, ``was too highly political and did
not provide any glide plan to answer these complex questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the National
Governors Association, said he was delighted that McCain has
delayed action. ``This means we are getting through'' with the
message that ``who has the right to cut taxes in the states. Is it
the federal government or is it the states?''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Mike Leavitt of Utah, a tax-cutting Republican who
organized other governors to sign the letter, said he, too, opposes
taxes aimed at the Internet, but that protecting the Internet as a
tax-exempt zone will distort the economy and shift power to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the Internet should be taxed. No bit taxes,
no bandwidth taxes, no access taxes. We should not do anything that
will inhibit this powerful engine of economic growth. But that is
not the issue here. The issue is whether the states will determine
their own tax policy and whether business will have a level playing
field. This is about whether local government will be allowed to
function independently of the national government.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said he persuaded so many governors to sign the letter
because they ``see this as the most significant federalism issue we
have faced in this century.''

HOUSE HOPES TO COMBAT TREND TOWARD ABANDONING BABIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Tuesday urged federal, state and local
health agencies to track the number of newborn babies discarded in
trash bins, bathrooms and other public places, as part of a
nationwide effort to stop parents from abandoning their infants.
</P>
<P>
   In passing a nonbinding resolution, lawmakers said the federal
government currently relies on media reports to determine the
number of abandoned babies, a flawed method that undermines efforts
to remedy the problem. Having health officials count each abandoned
child will spur policy-makers to develop ways to combat the
problem, House members said in passing the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Department of Health and Human Services, in its
informal media survey, said 105 babies were found abandoned
nationwide in 1998, including 33 who died.
</P>
<P>
   In its resolution, the House praised Texas for its landmark law
enacted last year that excuses from criminal prosecution adults who
abandon children at medical-care facilities. The law, similar to
legislation being considered in 24 other states, is intended to
stop infant abandonments that end in death by allowing desperate
parents to leave their children in a safe place without fear of
being sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a chief sponsor of the
resolution, called the measure an important step in combatting the
crisis of infants being left in trash cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must know how bad the situation is before we can stop it,''
DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of babies left in unsafe public places is
unknown, the federal government estimates that more than 30,000
babies are abandoned at hospitals each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These babies are the lucky ones,'' DeLay said, noting they
have instant access to health care. ``The little ones left in trash
bins often don't live past their first day.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay added that lawmakers and community leaders must join in
trying to end abandonments.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, called the resolution, which
lacks the force of law, ``an important first step'' in finding a
solution to the problem of abandonment. Jackson Lee has introduced
legislation that would require the Justice Department to conduct a
study and report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Thirteen babies were found abandoned in Houston last year, mostly
in trash bins and alleys. Three of these children died, local
officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   The rash of abandonments in Houston last year prompted local
officials to form the Task Force on Baby Abandonment, which has
mounted an advertising campaign to help parents in crisis. The task
force also has a toll-free hot line (1-877-904-SAVE) to advise
these parents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
States considering laws like that in Texas are Alabama, California,
Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey,
New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.

CHILDREN GET A LESSON IN THE LAW FROM FAIRY TALE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE OLIVA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The prosecution cringed as the defendant took
the stand Tuesday and insolently explained how a family treasure
got turned into toothpicks on the morning of Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in the little chair ... rocking back and forth, and it
felt so nice,'' she said, twirling a blond lock around her finger.
``And then it just broke. It must not have been put together very
well. It was obviously a very cheap chair. But I did feel just
awful about it. It was a complete accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gold E. Locks was acquitted of criminal damage, a jury
of 12 eighth-graders from Foreign Language Middle School found her
guilty of criminal trespass.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the State vs. Gold E. Locks was just one of several
Kansas City Metropolitan Bar Association events scheduled for Law
Week 2000. Young lawyers took on the roles of Locks, Pop A. Bear,
Babe E. Bear and Mom A. Bear, while Jackson County Circuit Judge
Jack Gant presided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tries to show them how it really is and how the process
works from beginning to end,'' said lawyer Sybil Renick, who played
Locks. ``Sure, we threw in some of the dramatics ... to make it a
little bit more enjoyable, but it shows them how you have to really
listen to what people are saying. Hopefully they realize how
important of a duty it is as a juror to listen to all the evidence
and try to make the right and just decision in a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Renick, who works at the law firm of Armstrong Teasdale said
this was the first year Locks had not lost on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-grader Laura Sellers, one of the jurors, said that she
knew someone was lying, but that there was not enough evidence to
prove Gold E. Locks damaged the property on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand, Locks said she had just stopped by because Babe
had broken her bedroom window playing baseball the night before.
When she found the house unoccupied, she went in to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knocked on the door a bunch of times, but no one answered,''
she said. ``The door was open, so I peeked in. ... Where I come
from, if you go to see a neighbor and the neighbor isn't home, you
just sit on the front porch and wait for him to return. If it's too
cold, then you go inside and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   But ignorance of the law is no excuse, the jurors decided. Locks
was not invited in; therefore, she was guilty of trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's amazing when you see how they rationalize and
come to the verdict, because you don't get to see that in an actual
trial,'' said Law Week chairwoman Jennifer Hannah, who acted as
Locks' defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The students who sat on the jury said deciding someone's fate
was more difficult than they thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to harm anybody,'' said eighth-grader Makila
Williams, ``but you have to do the right thing.''

DUCKS' SEASON `NOT ACCEPTABLE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   ANAHEIM -- There were times when Pierre Gauthier tried to smile,
but not even a faint smile could disguise his anger and frustration
at the Mighty Ducks' failure to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sugarcoat anything, this is not acceptable,''
said Anaheim president and general manager. ``We said we were going
to make the next step and we didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 18-point point increase and sixth-place finish in the
Western Conference last season, the logical next step would have
been a move up the standings, not a ninth-place finish. The Ducks
completed the 1999-2000 season with the same number of points (83)
and only one less win (34), but while they treaded water others
swam past, including the rival Kings who open their first-round
series Thursday in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier is determined not to let it happen again. He knows he
has two of the elite players in the league (Paul Kariya and Teemu
Selanne) and a solid young defense (led by Oleg Tverdovsky), but he
also was adament that changes will be made during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you right now we aren't coming back with the same
team,'' said Gauthier. ``We need to find some other players. We
should be in the playoffs, but were not a top tier club (yet).
</P>
<P>
   ``This a huge summer for us. The step is right there for us to
make, we just have to make the right moves. We need to get
immediate results here and it's my responsibility to look at every
part of the operation, coaching, scouting, player personal
decisions. I have to have a discussion with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But as frustrated as Gauthier is, he also insists that Anaheim
is closer to being a top tier team than it was a year ago,
especially with the development of defensemen Tverdovsky, Vitaly
Vishnevski, Niclas Havelid and Pavel Trnka.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a team to break up, it's a team to add to,'' he
said. ``We don't need to build a team through free agency, we need
to find pieces to the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of that puzzle figures to be finding players that
could help take some of the scoring burden off the No. 1 line of
Kariya, Selanne and Steve Rucchin. Gauthier wouldn't address
specfic needs, but the need for a proven, physical scorer would
appear to be obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, despite playing with a sore hip and a broken foot at
times during the season, still scored 42 goals, Selanne, hampered
by a bad back scored 33 and Rucchin, who missed 11 games due to a
staph infection in his foot and was never at full strength again,
scored 19. No other forward scored more than Matt Cullen's 13.
After Kariya, Selanne and Rucchin the leading goal scorers were
defensemen (Tverdovsky and Fredrik Olausson both had 15).
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored very few hard goals,'' said Gauthier. ``We scored a
ton of nice goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite outside criticism of Craig Hartsburg's system and the
rumors of his dismissal, a head coaching change doesn't appear
likely. One thing for sure Hartsburg has the support of his two
stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he knows the game,'' said Selanne. ``I think he did a
good job and I hope he is back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching staff did an excellent job,'' said Kariya. ``It's
the players that didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier didn't give Hartsburg, who has one year remaining on
his contract, a complete vote of confidence, but it's hardly
unusual for the Ducks GM not to lay all of his cards on the table,
especially with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of places there might be an emotional reaction and
fire the coach,'' said Gauthier. ``In our case we are going to sit
down with Craig and discuss solutions. The plan is to stay with
Craig as long as we have the solutions to address our fallbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to win and he's taken this very, very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, who looked as somber after a meaningless loss to the
Kings on Sunday as he had all season, was asked Monday how much of
a burden he places on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge,'' he said. ``I feel I should have done better. I'm going
to look at myself. I'm involved in this game because of the team
and when you lose you feel like you've let people down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hartsburg did say the season will not be a total failure if
you learn from it.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Ducks certainly learned was the importance of
special teams and goaltending. It was those two areas that probably
doomed the Ducks to an early vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty killing unit finished last in the league, while the
power play dropped from No. 1 last season to No. 14. And Anaheim
had to go on a tremendous late-season surge (the Ducks were No. 1
after Feb. 1) to move up that high.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time the damage had been done. The Ducks were four
games over .500 (18-14-4-1) on Dec. 26 despite their horrendous
special teams play, but a power play goal here, a key penalty kill
there and Anaheim might have been leading the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Ducks had little room for error when the underrated
Rucchin was out for 11 games, and a 3-11-2 slump knocked them out
of a playoff spot for good.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a good second-half team the Ducks spun their wheels as
Hebert, usually an excellent second-half goalie suffered through
the most inconsistent period of his career. Soft goals became an
all too common sight, leads were lost as were valuable points.
Anaheim wasn't good enough to overcome them and a 14-12-6-2 mark
over the last 32 games wasn't good enough to sneak into postseason
play.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the Dec. 22 game versus Phoenix the Ducks were
second in the league in defense (allowing 2.15 goals a game). They
finished the season 16th (2.73 per game).
</P>
<P>
   To his credit Hebert hasn't ducked the issue and has been quite
candid about his failures down the stretch. He said his play
``didn't make me very happy and nobody else as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was whicked see-saw type season,'' he added.``A good-game,
bad-game type. A couple more good games and we'd be talking about
going into the first round of the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Ducks now have almost six months to think about
what might have been. The lost leads, the losses to inferior teams
(i.e. Montreal, the Islanders and Tampa Bay) and a lack of
consistency. Anaheim's longest winning streak was four games and
their longest unbeaten streak was five (3-0-2). The only the
consistent thing about the Ducks was their ability to hover around
the .500 mark all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look back at the way we played we didn't deserve to
get in. We played like a .500 team all year,'' said Kariya. ``We
were up and down. We showed some good things then went into the
tank for three or four games. You can't expect to win like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But doesn't make it any easier to take. ``I woke up and it (the
season) was all over,'' said Tverdovsky. ``You play all year to
experience the playoffs. You never know how many chances you are
going to get ... We just lost a chance and it's not returnable.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 Rob Tannenbaum's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the Eagles' ``Greatest Hits, 1971-1975,'' the best-selling pop
album ever.  
 By ROB TANNENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few weeks ago at the Pioneer Theater in Manhattan,
the director Amos Poe introduced ``The Blank Generation,' his
rough-hewn documentary of early punk rock shows, shot on 16-mm film
in 1976 and rarely seen since. The sound and video in Poe's film
are not synchronized, which can be disorienting _ it was like
watching one movie while listening to another. But themes develop
fortuitously, and the film has a strangely disjunctive and
imagistic power.
</P>
<P>
   Before the screening, Poe likened ``The Blank Generation'' to
the Zapruder film of President John F. Kennedy's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   His implication was clear: viewers who closely examine the
blurry pictures can spot a historic event. Poe's analogy was
brazen, and skeptics may discount it. But the program of rare punk
and new wave films being shown at the Pioneer Theater, including
several weeks of the intimate, sometimes amazing series called
``Nightclubbing,'' shot at CBGB (the Dealey Plaza of punk rock) and
other New York clubs from 1975 to 1980, substantiates Poe's showy
claim for the era. (The program will end on May 24.)
</P>
<P>
   These documentaries, shot in the innocent era before MTV made
rock musicians irremediably self-conscious about performing for
cameras, show that those five years represent the apex of New York
rock history, a rampage of weird creativity and unkempt inspiration
spawned in a city so different from today's, it may as well be
Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   After only 20 years, the approach taken in ``Nightclubbing'' now
seems vestigial: no backstage interviews and little production
trickery, just live performances videotaped at close range. The
director Pat Ivers and the producer Emily Armstrong _ whom a
journalist described in 1980 as ``the Lewis and Clark of new wave
video'' _ had a nose for truffles.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Live From CBGB'' episode includes a tentative six-song set
by Talking Heads from December 1975, almost two years before the
band's first album was released. The performance captures a band in
its awkward adolescence, like a pimply high school class photo.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivers and Armstrong series offers clips of punk, post-punk,
new wave, no wave, hardcore and avant-jazz figures, most of whom
play with spirit, invention and colorful style. Some, like Blondie,
went from Hurrah or Danceteria to fame; others, like Pylon and the
Lounge Lizards, rose to cult status and linger there as ambered
legends.
</P>
<P>
   These films, shown 20 years ago in clubs, galleries and on cable
television, illustrate the fertility of the era, but cannot explain
the conditions that created it. The city was almost bankrupt.
Streets and parks where children now play were filthy and unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   But Felix Rohatyn's fiscal nightmare was punk rock's delight;
these conditions were ideal for musicians. When the Tuff Darts sang
of New York, they said with palpable ambivalence, ``If I didn't
love it, I swear I'd burn it to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   As always in any discussion about New York, real estate is a
major theme. Artists could easily earn their cheap rents by working
a few nights as a bartender, a cabdriver (like Philip Glass) or
even a male hustler, as the Ramones sang about on ``53rd and
Third.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1971, new laws allowed artists to live in lofts that
had previously been zoned for manufacturing use only. The Ramones
and Talking Heads lived together in large spaces where they could
rehearse at odd hours. Other bands encamped in derelict apartments
near CBGB on the Bowery, in a former red-light district for
sailors.
</P>
<P>
   The guitarist Rhys Chatham, who founded the music program at the
Kitchen, recalls living in a 2,000-square-foot loft in SoHo in 1971
for $180 a month. Today, only an Internet millionaire could afford
it.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's city who read the 1996
book ``Please Kill Me,'' Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain's oral
history of punk rock (Grove Press), might find the New York of the
late '70s as unrecognizable as any distant urban life described by
Luc Sante, if not Jacob Riis. Although the book's narrative often
voyages to Los Angeles, Cleveland, Detroit or London, it returns to
New York as its true north.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Young artists who had read about Andy Warhol in their parents'
issues of Life flocked to New York, much as the Lost Generation did
to Paris in the 1920s, because it was cheap. (In ``Please Kill
Me,'' Stiv Bators of the Dead Boys urges his oddball Cleveland
bandmates to move to New York, saying, ``We'd be normal there.'')
</P>
<P>
   The city's music scene was led by outsiders: gays, junkies,
strippers, transvestites, poets, former mental patients. After
Warhol, divisions between rockers and musicians were obliterated,
so middle-class art graduates mingled with Bronx truants.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream music was suffused with a healthy ambition that rock
purists viewed as pretentious. The effect was a kind of
deconstruction of the rock band, with widely varying ideals of
performance and skill.
</P>
<P>
   In one compelling scene from ``Nightclubbing,'' Lydia Lunch of
Teen-age Jesus and the Jerks sneers at an unseen crowd. ``We
(italics)are(end italics) great, (italics)aren't(end italics) we?''
she says, and the band races into a distorted racket that hops
between two harsh chords, like kids bashing at instruments during
an unsupervised recess. After 30 seconds, the noise halts suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   The music incorporated the flamboyant showmanship of Charles
Ludlam's Ridiculous Theater Company and internalized the city's
violent energy. ``I understand all destructive urges,'' Tom
Verlaine of Television sang, over a distorted guitar riff. In
another scene, Stiv Bators twitches onstage like a hamster during
electroshock. Dressed in black, he drinks beer, chews bubble gum,
takes down his jeans, and, having created the mayhem he sought,
dives into a mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   To pare the city's budget, Mayor Abraham D. Beame fired 65,000
municipal workers beginning in 1975, leaving far fewer police on
patrol. ``Please Kill Me'' would give Giuliani an anxiety attack.
It describes a city that's all but unregulated, more like the scene
of a Cormac McCarthy western or ``Lord of the Flies'' than our
current boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   One musician tells an anecdote about being caught by cops with
heroin and a needle and then released. So much for zero tolerance.
In a song from Television's 1977 debut album, Tom Verlaine sings
about a friend who suggests they dress up like the police, adding,
``Think of what we could do.'' Verlaine replies with caution
(``Something said, `You better not''') because he's wary of
impersonating the law in a lawless town.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the music was driven by the madness and, yes, the
occasional inspiration of cheap and abundant drugs. But also, in a
day when politicians left artists alone, there was an abundance of
publicly supported places to perform like Artist's Space, the
Kitchen, Franklin Furnace and P.S. 122, as well as the poetry
series at St. Mark's Place, where Patti Smith and Jim Carroll
regularly read. All these places were kept full because New York
was slow to get wired for cable, and there were fewer reruns and
sports broadcasts to keep people dormant.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the music died of too much freedom. Drug use turned to
addiction. The last chapters of ``Please Kill Me'' are full of
nervous breakdowns and death, lots of death. The economic
conditions that drew immigrant vagabonds changed. They emerged
later in the outer boroughs, where they engendered hip-hop culture,
and in other towns, like Athens, Ga., or Seattle, then vanished
there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Reed's old refrain, ``Those were different times,'' remains
an urban constant. But for half a decade, New York's filthy,
libertine conditions fertilized a great rock scene no future
residents are likely to equal.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16)  
 Christopher Reardon's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about the choreographer David Parsons.  
 By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sally Silvers calls herself a dancer and a
choreographer, but by many conventional measures she resembles
neither. She has never succeeded at an audition, or joined a
professional dance company, or started a troupe of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Silvers exerts a palpable force within the downtown
dance scene, both as a performer of striking intensity and as a
creator of wildly original movement. Working mostly with pick-up
troupes, she has gained an ardent following over the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Her choreography _ marked by dense layers of imagery and sudden
shifts of weight and mood _ owes as much to improvisational music,
independent film and experimental poetry as it does to modern
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sally is one of the brightest people downtown,'' said Mark
Russell, who directs PS 122 and was an early champion of her work.
``There are plenty of postmodern choreographers out there borrowing
from other art forms, but she's one of the few who really grasp the
concepts behind the music and poetry scenes she's plugged into.''
</P>
<P>
   Her newest piece, ``Storming Heaven,'' will have its premiere on
April 26 at the Kitchen. Inspired partly by Luigi Nono, who was
Italy's leading postwar avant-garde composer, it chronicles a
series of revolutions from the Paris Commune of 1871 to the
Zapatista rebellion that began six years ago in Chiapas, Mexico.
The two-act piece, which focuses on four female rebels, puts
psychology before polemics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in the moment of mobilization than in what
happens after, or why so many revolutions go bad,'' Silvers, 47,
said over lunch recently at her East Village apartment. ``This
piece explores the internal struggles: the decisions to get
involved, the doubts, the hesitations, the process of learning to
think as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to sketch the contours of her life as an independent
artist, from the periodic thrill of breaking new ground to the
constant struggle to get grants to pay the dancers. But while she
inhabits a world just outside the spotlight, her work has not gone
unnoticed. She won a Guggenheim fellowship in 1988, a Bessie award
in 1993 and five grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   A compact woman with deep brown eyes and a hushed voice, Silvers
grew up in Greenville, Tenn., a tobacco town in the Appalachian
Mountains. Around the age of 6, she started taking classes in
ballet, tap, jazz and acrobatics at the local VFW post. Yet it was
not until her sophomore year at Antioch College in Ohio that she
took dancing seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The college's artist in residence that year was Cecil Taylor,
the trailblazing pianist who helped invent free jazz, and he had
with him a modern-dance choreographer named Ken Miller. For
Silvers, it was an epiphany. ``Ken was an artist, not a teacher,''
she said. ``Working with him that year turned my head around.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1975, she considered writing for an
alternative newspaper in West Virginia's coal-mining communities,
but the muse beckoned. In New York, dance classes with Douglas Dunn
and Dana Reitz made her yearn for the old Judson Dance Theater, the
loose collective of artists who expanded the limits of dance in the
1960s. But with Judson long gone, she turned to a circle of
experimental artists that included John Zorn, the prodigious
saxophonist and composer, and Bruce Andrews, a writer intent on
developing new literary forms and new methods of composition.
</P>
<P>
   Like them, she began using improvisation as a way to generate
fresh material, filling untold hours of videotape and then
fashioning the most unusual movements into new dances. (For many
years, Zorn helped provide live accompaniment for her
performances.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't stuck in the dance tradition of making lyrical,
academically structured work,'' she said. ``I could compose a dance
the way experimental poetry is constructed or the way a film is
edited.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvers later was co-director of two short films, including
``Little Lieutenant,'' which won a silver award at the 1994 Dance
on Camera Festival. Her affinity for cinematic techniques, and
montage in particular, is readily apparent in ``Storming Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking her cue from films about workers' revolts by Eisenstein,
Pudovkin and Godard, Silvers is constructing scenes that function
like close-ups. While rehearsing a segment about the 1968 student
uprising in Paris, for example, eight dancers assembled in two
facing rows to frame a narrow tunnel. Suddenly, someone's hand
reached across the empty space to take a leaflet from someone
standing opposite.
</P>
<P>
   A visual artist, Antonio Martorell, will remain onstage
throughout the piece, creating props on the fly. Martorell, whose
lacework maps were shown at the 1997 Whitney Biennial, has also
designed several set pieces for the production, including a cyclone
made of copper tubing that will hang upside down above the stage.
At one point, he will dance a tango with his daughter, Alejandra,
who frequently performs in Silvers' work.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, who composes electronic music as well as experimental
poetry, is creating a soundscape modeled on the life and work of
Nono, who died in 1990. Last winter, he and Silvers visited the
composer's archives in Venice, where they met his widow and watched
a videotape of the 1978 La Scala production of ``In the Sun's
Love-Provoking Light,'' Nono's opera about the Paris Commune.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said the encounter had made his music ``much less
jumpy'' than the soundscapes he had created for dozens of earlier
dances by Silvers, his longtime partner in life and art.
</P>
<P>
   Silvers tends to develop new material on her own and then gather
a group of dancers when she is ready to present it _ an approach
that limits her to a few engagements each year but gives her access
to talented performers. Many of them _ including Cydney Wilkes,
Andrea Kleine and David Neumann _ are choreographers themselves.
(Neumann is in the midst of a two-week season at P.S. 122, where he
is performing a duet with the poet John Giorno and staging an
ensemble work, ``Oyinbo,'' that uses square dancing as a vehicle
for exploring cultural identity.)
</P>
<P>
   Between rehearsals, Silvers reports to her day job at the Labor
Institute, which produces health and safety videos and organizing
materials for labor unions. She has been there 18 years, working 20
hours a week in return for a regular paycheck, a health-care plan
and a pension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I would want the career of the
dancer-choreographer whose life was touring and teaching and doing
residencies,'' she said. ``Even though I make wildly abstract
works, I feel it's important to stay connected to the social world,
to keep myself grounded in something real.''

 &HT;    Gore promises improved education for nation's children in Ohio
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS _ Vice President Al Gore was back in school Tuesday
solving math problems, drawing pictures, writing letters and trying
to convince voters that he will do more to improve education than
his rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But in between classes and a hot-dog lunch, Gore's visit to a
Columbus' elementary school focused on much more serious questions
from parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Questions such as, Why are so many kids being killed in schools
or bringing guns into their classroom? Why are young students
judged so heavily by proficiency tests? And how can teachers be
effective when their classroom are overflowing with kids?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the largest generation of students in our nation's
history and all of our classrooms are crowded. That's why education
is my top priority and will remain that way if I'm entrusted with
the presidency,'' said Gore, who was making his second in a series
of visits with students, teachers and parents that his campaign is
calling School Days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence in our schools and the way we measure our schools'
performance are primary concerns of people I have talked with
around the nation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce school violence, Gore said parents need to become more
involved with kids, the nation needs fewer guns on the street and
schools need more counselors and smaller class sizes that would let
teachers better identify kids with problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit to low-income Avondale Elementary School reinforced
the importance of the education issue in this year's presidential
campaign _ an issue on which Gore, a Democrat, and Bush, a
Republican, have continually sparred. Campaign officials for Gore
on Tuesday again called attention to a 1999 study that ranked the

   Gore, who visited a Michigan middle school last month, told
Avondale's parents and teachers that making preschool available to
all students and communities is the cornerstone of his education
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids can catch up, but some never do, and dollar for
dollar, pre-school is the best investment in education we can
make,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaign, Gore has touted a plan to spend $115
billion over 10 years on a host of education programs, including
preschool, expanded after-school programs, modernizing schools and
reducing class sizes by providing local school boards with more
money to hire teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Avondale Principal Mary Ann Burns said Gore's visit with her 400
students wasn't staged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to see what a real school day was like, so we tried
to give him one,'' Burns said. ``A lot of our schools' problems and
the problems of most other schools could be solved if more parents
would take an active role in their children, and the vice president
talked about that a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's all-day visit included solving math problems with
fifth-graders, writing a letter to Mother Earth with first-graders
and creating a collage with a third-grade art class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a funny guy to talk with and it was cool to have him in
our school,'' said Anthony Fisher, a third-grader who sat next to
Gore during lunch.

ADVERTISING: OMNICOM MOVES TO EXPAND ITS INTERACTIVE EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another step to expand an already extensive
interactive empire, the Omnicom Group in New York is investing in
an innovative agency that specializes in creating offline campaigns
for online marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom, which has interests in such Internet powerhouses as
Agency.com, Razorfish and Red Sky Interactive, is acquiring what is
being described as a significant minority stake in Eisnor
Interactive in New York, a shop with projected billings for this
year of $36 million from such dot-com clients as About.com,
CarOrder.com, Cnet, Dealtime.com, Homestead.com and MapQuest.com.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal, scheduled to be announced Wednesday, are not
being disclosed. Eisnor, founded an eon ago in Internet time _ 1997
by the regular calendar _ will work principally with Merkley Newman
Harty in New York, a midsize shop owned by Omnicom with billings
estimated at more than $300 million from clients like BellSouth,
Fila, Forbes, JetBlue Airways and Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   The investment by Omnicom, which also owns Madison Avenue
mainstays like BBDO Worldwide, DDB Worldwide and TBWA Worldwide,
comes as reports in the traditional media are resuming an alarmist
tone about the future of dot-coms, particularly those devoted to
consumer businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a significant shakeout takes place among Internet
marketers, there would remain at least some that had grown into
successful enterprises requiring advertising services. That view
seems to be shared by a principal rival of Omnicom, Interpublic
Group of Cos., in New York, which said Tuesday that it would
strengthen ties with a leading interactive services agency, Icon
Medialab International in Stockholm, by making additional
investments in that company.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Di-Ann Eisnor, chief executive at
Eisnor, which has nearly 50 employees at its New York headquarters
and at offices in Boston and San Francisco, acknowledged the
daunting challenges that dot-coms face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients have so much pressure to build their brands and at
the same time generate results'' in the form of sales, said Ms.
Eisnor, 27, a graybeard in Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's increasingly difficult to stand out from the
clutter,'' she added. ``That's why we try to think through how
people consume media and then how different media work together, so
we can use each tactic as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a promotion, sometimes it's event marketing,
sometimes it's a TV spot,'' said Eisnor, whose agency has also
produced wireless telephone ads for TheStreet.com, attached
billboards to bicycles to pitch Healthshop.com and paid commuters'
toll and subway fares to promote CarOrder.com. ``We're media
agnostic; we'll do whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that spirit prevailing among Eisnor and her colleagues
that appealed to the executives of Merkley Newman, said Stephen
Harty, managing director there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy level, the inventiveness, is amazing,'' Harty said.
``They're people who don't observe the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been, you could say, less adventurous with dot-coms,''
he added, referring to the small roster of such clients at the
agency that includes CareerMosaic.com, Computer.com and the
Forbes.com unit of Forbes. ``Eisnor offers a refreshing influx of a
different perspective on our business.''
</P>
<P>
   The pairing of Eisnor with Merkley Newman is the most recent in
a series of steps by Omnicom to broaden the offerings of Merkley
Newman since that agency was awarded the Mercedes-Benz of North
America account in March 1999. Merkley Newman now also operates an
agency in Atlanta, Bayless Cronin; an agency specializing in
pharmaceutical advertising, Consumer Healthworks; and an agency
specializing in direct marketing, Team South.
</P>
<P>
   While Merkley Newman ``will be home base for Eisnor within
Omnicom,'' Harty said, Eisnor will also work with other Omnicom
agencies. Eisnor will report to the Diversified Agency Services
division of Omnicom rather than to Communicade, which manages
Omnicom's investments in Internet agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Interpublic and Icon Medialab, the new commitments
from Interpublic represent a deepening of a relationship that began
13 months ago when Interpublic allied with Icon Medialab through
steps that included an investment of $20 million in exchange for a
stake of just less than 20 percent. In November, Nicholson NY, an
interactive shop that was 25 percent owned by Interpublic, agreed
to be acquired by Icon Medialab and has subsequently served as the
first U.S. office of the Swedish company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped them get their U.S. business off the ground,'' said
Sean Orr, executive vice president and chief financial officer at
Interpublic in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Interpublic has committed more money to help Icon Medialab
expand in Asia as well as to make an additional investment in the
company that brings the Interpublic stake back up to just less than
20 percent; the stake had diminished over the last year because of
issues of stock and options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship has been a very, very good one,'' Orr said of
the ties between the Interpublic and Icon Medialab executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, they know how to make money,'' he said,
laughing. ``When they are in a market for more than 18 months, they
are profitable. They're also technically very proficient, very
bright and very entrepreneurial.''
</P>
<P>
   Icon Medialab clients include Coca-Cola, Motorola, Nestle and
the Opel unit of General Motors, all of which are also clients of
Interpublic agencies like the McCann-Erickson World Group.

PHILIPPINES SET TO VOTE ON PRIVATIZING NATIONAL POWER COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Legislators in the Philippines are set to vote this
week on a bill that would privatize the heavily indebted national
power company, a reform that the International Monetary Fund and
other lenders have demanded before disbursing critical new loans.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives is scheduled to begin voting
Tuesday on the Power Reform Bill, which would liberalize the
Philippine power industry and put the unprofitable, state-run
National Power Corp. into private hands. President Joseph Estrada
and Manuel B. Villar, the House leader, have both pledged support
for the bill, which the Philippine Congress aims to make law by
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has given Manila until June 30 to pass the power bill,
along with the privatization of the Philippines National Bank,
before it releases $500 million in loans needed to help offset the
country's 62.5 billion peso ($1.5 billion) budget deficit. The
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have also made further
lending contingent on the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   This week's vote has also become a test of the credibility of
Estrada's administration, which has shown some of the same
tendencies toward corruption and ineptitude that had characterized
the era of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Action on the power
reform bill has been delayed for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors want to see some tangible evidence that the
government can do something right,'' said Rebecca Patterson, an
analyst at J.P. Morgan in Singapore. If legislators fail to push
the power reform bill through this week, she said, ``it suggests
they can't get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling the company would also have several tangible benefits,
economists say _ easing electricity prices, which are second only
to Japan's, promoting investment and reducing a sizable burden on
public finances. Government outlays to Napocor, as the money-losing
utility is known, are a major contributor to the Philippines budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some optimism the House can pass the bill before
next week's Easter recess, there is less hope about the power
bill's fate in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines is not the only country in Southeast Asia where
the IMF is threatening to cut off aid to stimulate economic reform.
In Indonesia last week, the IMF's move to withhold $400 million in
loans spurred the government in Jakarta to expedite economic
changes to keep the money flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine financial markets have been rocked this year by
concerns about creeping cronyism and other forms of corruption.
Fueling those concerns is a scandal over alleged insider trading
involving a friend of Estrada's. The stock exchange's entire
compliance department resigned late last month in protest over what
it called a cover-up of the insider trading affair.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal is overshadowing what economists say is an otherwise
positive economic picture. A trade surplus, low interest rates and
strengthening domestic demand are underpinning an economy that
analysts at Merrill Lynch predict will grow 3.4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Napocor's financial problems are partly the result of the
country's chronic power shortages of the early 1990s. In response
to the brownouts, the company signed contracts with roughly a dozen
independent power producers, who now provide about one-quarter of
the nation's electricity. The contracts overestimated the country's
power demand, however, meaning Napocor has to pay for the power the
country does not need. Worse, most of the power plants use oil for
fuel, leaving the Philippines dependent on petroleum imports for
about half of its power needs.

 &HT;    Agassi advances in Tennis Challenge
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Any concern that Andre Agassi might be weary from his
Davis Cup heroics and six consecutive weeks on the road were
allayed Tuesday night as the world No. 1 bolted to a 4-0 lead and
finished off Belgian teen-ager Xavier Malisse 6-3, 6-4 in 70
minutes at the Galleryfurniture.com Tennis Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, making the switch to clay courts with just a day's
practice, wasn't as sharp as he was last weekend, when he scored
two critical singles victories in the U.S. team's 3-2 Davis Cup
victory over the Czech Republic in Los Angeles. But Agassi still
had plenty for Malisse, ranked No. 154.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually quite a feeling to win a Davis Cup tie and then
come play in front of Americans,'' Agassi said. ``You feel the
appreciation, and there's a lot of motivation in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi wasn't as aggressive as usual with his groundstrokes
because Malisse showed no ability to hurt him on his backhand side.
Agassi failed to serve out the match at 5-3 in the third when he
made three sloppy errors, but he broke Malisse the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an easy adjustment coming here, but I expected that
difficulty coming from indoors (at the Forum) and perfect
conditions, to outdoors, windy, clay courts, bad bounces, more
rotation on your shots,'' Agassi said. ``It was a good first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Malisse is one of the tour's brightest young prospects, but he's
becoming at least as well known in tennis as Jennifer Capriati's
boyfriend. Capriati attended the match. Agassi's girlfriend, Steffi
Graf, has been a faithful follower of Agassi on tour but isn't
expected here this week.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, second-seeded Stefan Koubek opened defense of
his singles title with a 7-5, 6-0 victory over Frederico Browne of
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Koubek, an Austrian left-hander who's an expert on clay, won
last year's tournament as a qualifier with eight wins in eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   Koubek has been on the road the past eight weeks playing on hard
courts and was slow to get going on the clay Tuesday. Twice down a
break in the first set, Koubek broke Browne's serve at 4-5 and won
the final nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping to get my tennis together again because I was
playing a lot on hard courts and I have to change on clay, so the
first time is a little bit difficult, but I feel it's coming
back,'' Koubek said. ``In the second set, I was breaking him all
the time, and any time I needed a shot I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Koubek's second-round match tonight figures to be much tougher
as he faces No. 83 Paul Goldstein in the feature match.
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing Tuesday was third-seeded Magnus Larsson, a
quarterfinalist here last year. Larsson defeated Christian Ruud
6-1, 6-4.

   The average daily room rates for hotels in major cities in the
United States grew by 4.4 percent during the second half of 1999
from the comparable period in 1998, according to PKF Consulting's
Hospitality Research Group. Among the reasons the research firm
cited for this increase, which occurred despite a continuing
oversupply of hotel rooms and slight declines in occupancy rates,
was the ``wealth effect'' in a booming economy that has prompted
``a loosening of tight corporate travel budgets and personal
pocketbooks.'' Reflecting this, higher-priced hotels are faring
best right now. &QL;

   The annual airline quality rating study jointly conducted by the
business school at Wichita State University and the Aviation
Institute at the University of Nebraska always gets a lot of
publicity with its customer-service performance rankings of the top
10 airlines in the United States in areas such as on-time arrival,
boarding availability and mishandled baggage.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2000 survey, which placed Southwest Airlines in first
place and United Airlines last, has some footnotes and observations
intended to put the overall industry on notice. Among them:
``Continued declining industry performance quality in 1999 gives
cause for Congress to again seriously consider the passage of an
Airline Passengers' Bill of Rights'' that would provide an
enforceable alternative to existing in-house attempts by the
airlines to define standards for handling customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the study warns, the decline in comfort and
reliability in air travel is leading to ``consumer retaliation''
that shows up in a doubling of informal complaints made to the
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, according to the study is that ``soon, consumers
will become driven by price and schedule only'' without regard to
loyalty for any particular airline.
</P>
<P>
   The study also faults the industry for ``targeting'' regional
and start-up airlines with practices like temporarily adding
flights to block upstart competitors.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Airways is accusing Northwest Airlines of trying to do
just that. AirTran recently filed a complaint with the government
saying that Northwest ``dumped'' seats onto its Minneapolis-Atlanta
routes to thwart AirTran's plan to introduce flights on that route
in June, using 100-seat Boeing 717 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This over-aggressive capacity increase eliminates the
possibility for AirTran to profitably enter the market,'' AirTran
said in a statement. But Northwest denied acting unfairly toward
AirTran, saying that it filed for expanded service on the
Minneapolis-Atlanta routes in mid-February _ weeks before AirTran
filed for its new routes. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ If you keep up with contemporary art and have spoken
to anyone besides your dentist in recent weeks, you've probably
been asked your opinion on the PS 1 vs. the Biennial question. No,
that's not a landmark court case concerning the First Amendment,
but rather an unofficial face-off between two much-mooted museum
exhibitions. The question is this: which is the better show?
</P>
<P>
   ``Greater New York,'' at PS 1 Contemporary Art Center, the newly
annexed Queens outpost of the Museum of Modern Art, is a spirited
affair that rounds up enough youngish artists (146 in all) to start
a day camp. The 2000 Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American
Art, despite its broader, cross-the-country sweep, is similarly
well-stocked with unfamiliar names; its 97 artists do not include
Jasper Johns, Brice Marden or any other sacred cows. The latest
art-world trend is untrendy artists.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the P.S. 1 show feels more rambunctious and
alive, which may simply be a function of context. The works on view
pick up reflected energy from their ``Grease''-like setting, a big,
meandering former public school with institutional-green walls,
linoleum floors and a lunchroom. The Whitney, by contrast, has a
Madison Avenue stiffness, and meals must be taken in staid
Sarabeth's.
</P>
<P>
   But the Biennial does offer at least one advantage over the PS 1
show. By mingling new names with a handful of post-adolescent
veterans (Richard Tuttle, Robert Gober and John Currin, among
them), it reminds us that art is a long-haul deal and that the
winners are the ones who sustain their vision over time.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the two exhibitions have more in common than the
curators of either might care to acknowledge. Each show abounds
with inspired moments, but has no center or defining direction.
Perhaps that's because each was organized by a team of six
curators. Call it the new sextuple approach; it offers the illusion
of egalitarianism and suggests that museums are seeking to break up
the reign of the New York galleries, or at least to prove that
museums, too, can discover new names.
</P>
<P>
   The two shows share some artists, but surprisingly few. Six
artists overlap: E.V. Day, Paul Pfeiffer, Shirin Neshat, Chakaia
Booker, Ghada Amer and Lisa Yuskavage, only one of whom works in
oil-on-canvas and all of whom live in New York. In an age enamored
of blurred boundaries, they seem destined to be known as the
Cross-Exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   E.V. DAY proves it is possible to study critical theory in
graduate school and emerge with your sense of humor intact. Her
blown-up party dresses, floor-to-ceiling installations in which
silky tatters appear to be caught in midblast, invest
deconstruction with wit and panache.
</P>
<P>
   At first, her work might strike you as the irate gesture of a
fashion slave-turned-terrorist, but Donna Karan and other couture
queens need not worry. In the end, Day lets pleasure win out over
rage. Her not-to-be-missed installation in the Whitney's lobby,
``Bombshell'' (1999) _ a detonated replica of the dress worn by
Marilyn Monroe in ``The Seven-Year Itch'' _ puts you in mind of
things flying, female and climactic, including those Renaissance
ascension scenes in which the Virgin hovers in midair, her robes
swirling, her face pure rapture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a shopper,'' said Day, 32, a New York native who
studied at Yale and whose first solo show opens at Henry Urbach
Architecture in Chelsea on April 28. ``I've been in Bergdorf's only
once, and it reminded me of my great-grandmother's. I prefer
Niketown, where the manipulation is incredible. You don't go to
Niketown to buy sneakers. You go there because it's an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pfeiffer harbors an odd twin obsession with basketball and
the Bible. While plenty of American men treat hoops as if it were a
major world religion, Pfeiffer is in no danger of being confused
with your average jock. His high-concept, high-anxiety videos are
shrunk down to the size of snapshots, and they have a mesmerizing
interiority, like visions glimpsed in the space behind one's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   His ``John 3:16'' (1999), at PS 1, is a never-ending video loop
assembled from more than 5,000 digitized images of a basketball as
it floats through the air. What should we make of this blurry ball?
It suggests a throbbing orange migraine (especially if you don't
love sports), as well as an eternal light, centered, radiant and
harking back to the New Testament passage of the work's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the biggest sports fan myself,'' said Pfeiffer, 34, a
native of Hawaii who was raised in the Philippines. ``I do go to
Knicks games, which are among the great spectacles of our time.
Stadiums are often referred to as domes, a direct relation to
religious architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a drag to watch movies standing up, but we'll do it for
SHIRIN NESHAT, an Iranian-born artist with a substantial
reputation. She makes photographs and 16-mm films in which women
dressed in flowing black chadors evoke the behind-the-veil
strictures of Islamic life. Although Neshat tends to get treated as
the art world's resident expert on Iranian affairs, her work
contains a large quotient of entertainment value, extracting a lush
cinematic glamour from the mosques, narrow streets and thronged
bazaars of the Muslim landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Her pearly toned ``Rapture'' (1999), a two-screen,
black-and-white film now at PS 1, is a desert spectacular with a
cast of hundreds, the art-house version of ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make films, the world is your studio,'' said Neshat,
who is 43 and has lived in this country since her college days in
Berkeley. ``I don't really like the art world. Instead of being in
my studio in Chinatown and thinking about what some collector
wants, I prefer looking at a map and saying I want to go to Egypt
and hiring a cast of 500 people.'''
</P>
<P>
   CHAKAIA BOOKER brings new life to old rubber tires, recycling
their shredded remains into twisty sculptures and wall reliefs. She
belongs to the junk-into-art tradition conceived by Kurt
Schwitters, an art scavenger who discerned a pathos in discarded
things. But that's an old European story, and Booker manages to
update it in her tire-specific, American-style assemblages.
</P>
<P>
   Tires conjure visions of motion, and no one would ever want to
puncture one, except for teen-age delinquents _ and Booker, whose
work strips the tire of its getaway potential. In the place of
manly autonomy and flight, her sliced and woven-together wheels
variously suggest innards, crazily overgrown house plants and a
fleshy tangle of limbs. Don't drive off, they seem to say. The best
action is right here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are at least 300 tires in my Whitney piece,'' said
Booker, 47, a native of Newark. ``I get most of my tires from
automotive repair shops in New York City, usually for free, though
I have to be selective. I wouldn't want a tire that is too hard to
cut. I prefer the ones that are super-worn and where all the tread
is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   GHADA AMER extracts cutting-edge elegance from the unlikely
tradition of the sewing bee. Born in Egypt, she is best known for
hand-embroidered paintings in which delicate threads are set
against bright, Popsicle-color grounds. At first her pictures look
abstract, a stitched version of Cy Twombly's deluxe doodling, but
step up close and their linear traceries reveal a sorority of
female nudes.
</P>
<P>
   You can see her work as a parody of Abstract Expressionism,
offering dainty needling in the place of macho angst and
paint-flinging, though, in the end, Amer seems amusingly conflicted
about men. A proper postfemininst, she resents male domination but
knows in her heart that she cannot escape it, blithely accepting
the submissive role of the patient, painstaking seamstress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly like sewing,'' said Amer, 36, whose solo
show at Deitch Projects in SoHo opened Saturday. ``It's very
relaxing for about 30 minutes but then it becomes incredibly
boring, and I just have to go on and on. I would use a sewing
machine, but you can't get the same detail from machines. They
can't do eyes and other fine curves.''
</P>
<P>
   LISA YUSKAVAGE earned her first fame with paintings of bimbos
stepping out of velvety fogs. Viewers weren't sure whether the work
was intended as a wry critique of Penthouse readers, or rather as a
sincere tribute to the ditsier members of the female sex. But now
we know.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from ``True Blonde at Home'' (1999), an arresting
portrait on view at the Whitney, bimbos do have inner lives and
deserve our respect. Here we see a twentyish woman from the
shoulders up, her eyes rolled heavenward in the buggy, exaggerated
style of an El Greco saint. She is caught in a moment of fervent
prayer, though it isn't clear whether she is praying for the
salvation of her soul or just for the telephone to ring.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, by the way, has been chosen by the Whitney for the
Biennial banner hanging above the museum's entrance. ``That's
probably because it's a figurative painting,'' said Yuskavage, 37,
a native of Philadelphia. ``You can't put an abstract painting on a
banner. It's less readable when you're flying by in a cab.''

   One thing was certain: Linda Simensky loved the sheep. And the
French fries weren't bad, either. ``Mo pitched us an idea, and it
was so silly and so funny, we just laughed,'' recalled Simensky,
vice president of original animation for the Cartoon Network. ``And
they served us French fries. Hardly anyone feeds you during a
pitch, but it's a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Over that plate of pommes frites in June 1998, a baa-ing cartoon
character took his first tentative steps toward stardom. His name:
Sheep. His creator: Mo Willems, a New York University film major
and onetime downtown performance artist who had a dream of taking
an animated wool-bearer out of the barnyard and into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward almost two years to a bustling studio in SoHo,
where Willems, 32, and a phalanx of artists, writers and computer
types are now churning out the storyboards for the first 13
episodes of ``Sheep in the Big City,'' which is to bow on the
Cartoon Network this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The irony-laden animated series, starring a nonverbal sheep who
escapes from a farm and finds a laughably affordable apartment in a
nice neighborhood, is the latest to get approval from the network,
which is not only home to such original series as ``Johnny Bravo,''
``Dexter's Laboratory'' and ``The Powerpuff Girls'' but is also one
of the hottest networks on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo is a writer for `Sesame Street': that's the `Saturday Night
Live' for preschoolers,'' Simensky said. ``The people coming out of
there are the Dr. Seusses of our day. My rule is, someone shows up
from `Sesame Street,' work with them. They're funny under all sorts
of circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Simensky rule pretty much sums up the ethos of the cannily
successful Cartoon Network: find people who write funny and draw
funny, and let them loose on America's children. The formula has
worked so well that a network that started eight years ago as a
kind of jukebox of animated golden oldies, running a never-ending
cycle of ``The Flintstones'' and ``The Jetsons,'' has evolved into
a supplier of some of the most innovative new animation on
television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, for instance, the 24-hour channel, now in some 62
million American homes, saw the largest increase in viewers of any
channel on the cable box, making it the third-highest-rated
advertiser-supported network on cable. And while the channel is
exceedingly popular with young viewers _ 8 of the top 10 shows on
cable for children ages 2 to 11 were on the Cartoon Network _ it
also has surprising traction among adults: nearly a third of its
viewers are grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The vitality of that adult audience was underscored on April 1,
when the Cartoon Network began operating a spinoff channel,
Boomerang. Network officials say it is intended to appeal to baby
boomers through a steady diet of reruns of boomer favorites like
``Popeye,'' ``Top Cat'' and ``Quick Draw McGraw.''
</P>
<P>
   That an all-cartoon channel could make such a splash in the
highly competitive, narrow-casting kingdom of cable is a testament
to the explosion of imagination that animation in movies and
television has unleashed over the past decade. With the prime-time
successes of animated programs on Fox, and the stream of
feature-length releases by studios like Disney and DreamWorks,
there is what amounts to a new cartoon cachet. ``The Simpsons,''
``King of the Hill'' and ``Futurama'' rank among the most
consistently funny sitcoms on television; ``Rocky and Bullwinkle,''
``Bugs Bunny'' and ``The Flintstones,'' once regarded as
pop-cultural flotsam, are now viewed as classics by a generation of
young animators who are reinvigorating the form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we are in the best period for animation since the
'40s or '50s,'' said Simensky, a cartoon fanatic whose other
television infatuation is the Weather Channel. (``It's really just
a cartoon map of the United States with clouds moving.'')
</P>
<P>
   Spanning the dial, the cartoon spectrum is probably more varied
than at any time in television history. It ranges from
``Scooby-Doo'' (on the Cartoon Network) to ``South Park'' (on
Comedy Central), from ``The Rugrats'' (Nickelodeon) to ``Daria''
(MTV). Along the way, there have been some notable misfires: just
last month, for instance, NBC canceled a critically scorched
animated series in prime time, ``God, the Devil and Bob,'' after
only a few episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks aren't sure where animation fits in their
lineups,'' said Simensky, who came to the Cartoon Network from
Nickelodeon. ``It really varies depending on the passion of the
executives in charge. Animation is a huge commitment because it's
really time consuming and it's really expensive.'' The cost of a
half-hour series starts at something like $500,000 an episode.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among child-centric cable channels like Nickelodeon, Fox
Family and Disney, the Cartoon Network is devoted entirely to the
whimsy of the pen and pixel; the network is so cartoon-crazy that
it recently ran a mock presidential campaign, featuring Bob Dole
and other flesh-and-blood politicians, endorsing the cartoon
candidacies of characters like Daffy Duck and Space Ghost.
(Scooby-Doo won the viewer write-in contest.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasy storytelling in general is really booming right now,''
said Betty Cohen, who has been the president of the Cartoon Network
since its inception in 1992. ``People are getting used to not
working within the constraints of live action. That's why you're
seeing 30 percent of our audience being adults. Once animated
stopped being relegated to Saturday morning, it became O.K. to be a
cartoon person, whether you're an adult or a teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   But what genuinely confers identity on a television network is
the new material that it beams into homes. Having put on the air a
passel of original series, like ``Ed, Edd n Eddy,'' about three
teenage boys growing up, and ``Johnny Bravo,'' featuring a
buffoonish blond brute who gets his comeuppance from every man,
woman and child who crosses his path, the Cartoon Network, which is
owned by the Turner Broadcasting System and has its headquarters in
Atlanta, is solidifying its image as a bastion of novelty.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is also putting the finishing touches on its own animation
studio in Burbank, Calif., and has committed $450 million to the
development of new programs over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like Cartoon Network's whole philosophy,'' said Craig
McCracken, the creator of ``The Powerpuff Girls.'' ``If you have a
passion, they want you to be in charge of the project.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken's series, which made its debut in November 1998, is
the first among equals in the Cartoon Network's video cabinet of
prides and joys. ``The Powerpuff Girls'' is the most popular
original series on the channel, its tongue-in-cheekiness reflecting
the tone of many of the network's new offerings, a sensibility that
goes in heavily for the sort of playful satire that can appeal as
much to a viewer of 37 as 7.
</P>
<P>
   The girls of the title are three candy-colored sisters, Blossom,
Bubbles and Buttercup, who were conceived in the laboratory of
Professor Utonium. He mixed together sugar, spice and everything
nice. Accidentally some of the mysterious Chemical X splashed in,
and presto! a trio of 5-year-old superheros were soon enrolled in
kindergarten at Pokey Oaks elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The girls constantly do battle with postmodern villains, whether
it is the school rich kid, poisoning the educational atmosphere
with an outsize sense of entitlement, or a gigantic, marauding
inflatable fish that shakes their hometown, Townsville, right down
to the foundations of the Kosherama food store and the shops of
Little Tokyo (a homage, of course, to Japanese monster flicks).
</P>
<P>
   McCracken, who trained in an animation program financed by
Disney at the California Institute of the Arts, said he wanted to
follow in the tradition of children's programs that tickled adults.
``When I was a kid, my favorite show was the Adam West `Batman,'''
he said. ``But my parents would sit there and laugh, and I never
understood what was funny until I got a little older. So I wanted
to make a show like that, that kids could watch on an action level:
the core concept is `cuteness and toughness.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like McCracken, most of the animators the Cartoon Network works
with _ the vast majority in this male-dominated field are men _
learned the basics in art or film school. Often, the network, with
168 cartoon hours a week to fill and an insatiable appetite for
inventory, commissions short works by artists whom it sometimes
goes back to with an offer of a series.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships deepen so quickly because animation, for all
its increased visibility, remains out on the show-biz fringe.
Calling a work in another medium ``cartoonish,'' after all, is
still generally a pejorative; a form so steeped in silliness is
always likely to have trouble being taken seriously. ``No matter
how great the work gets,'' Simensky said, ``it still always ranks
somewhere below game shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the network's younger generation of animators, though, one
does not sense much insecurity. In the digs of ``Sheep in the Big
City,'' a recently refurbished suite in a building on Broadway just
south of Houston Street, the gregarious Willems proudly led a tour
of the various departments in which the series is getting
sheep-shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to animation, the art of it, is that if you can make a
character seem to `think,' to be able to get some emotional
reaction, it's magic,'' he said, sitting in the editing room with
his colleague, the series producer, Kris Greengrove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheep in the Big City'' is the network's first attempt to
sustain a half hour with a single story; the other original
programs are made up of shorter cartoons. The new series has a
large cast _ about 40 voices an episode _ and is imbued with the
kind of twisted humor used by Jay Ward in the old ``Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' and ``Fractured Fairy Tales.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, Sheep leaves Farmer John's spread after
discovering that a rogue military officer, General Specific, is
looking for just the right sheep to use as fodder for a new weapon.
Sheep, whose only dialogue is an occasional plaintive ``Baa,''
hightails it to the city, where he knows no one but still manages
to outwit his pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   Children may groove on the chase; grown-ups will intuit the
influences of Monty Python and a century's worth of theater of the
absurd. ``It's about being an outsider, about being alone and
making it in the world,'' Willems said. (Not coincidentally, the
pilot ends with Sheep in the middle of a busy thoroughfare, tossing
his fleece in the air, a la Mary Richards.)
</P>
<P>
   In the editing room, behind Willems, a primitive drawing of the
Ranting Swede, a character who appears at the end of each episode
and delivers a nonsensical diatribe, flashed across a computer
screen. Willems smiled reflexively at the image, a portrait of an
artist getting a kick out of a playground of his own design.

SLATTERY RESIGNS AS MANAGER OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (subs 6th graf for revised information; adds 4 new grafs at end) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank P. Slattery V, who had a phenomenal first year as a
manager of the PBHG New Opportunities Fund but then stumbled over
the past month amid market turbulence, resigned Tuesday and said he
would pursue other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Slattery, who goes by the nickname Quint, joined PBHG in 1998,
after two years at Merrill Lynch, which he joined after graduating
from Princeton University. He began running the New Opportunities
Fund in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Slattery, 27, did not return a telephone call seeking comment on
his departure, which was announced by the company.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ended March 31, the New Opportunities Fund
showed a total return of 533 percent, more than twice the return of
any other mutual fund with assets of at least $30 million,
according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But while the fund had been very volatile for its entire life,
that volatility had increased in March, as the fast-growing
technology stocks that he specialized in came under selling
pressure on some days.
</P>
<P>
   During its first year, the worst period for the fund came last
summer, when it lost 15 percent of its value in slightly less than
a month. But since the fund peaked on March 9, it has had drastic
swings and is now down 42 percent from the high, although it is
still up 14 percent since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Slattery's strategy called for putting about 80 percent of the
fund's money into the 30 fastest growing companies, and holding
them no matter how high their price rose. The remaining 20 percent
of the fund was used for quick investments, often trying to
anticipate what stocks would get hot, and then selling them after
they had gained a dollar or two.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Slattery said that during the first
year of the fund's existence, it had shown gains of at least 1,000
percent on three stocks: MicroStrategy, SDL Inc. and Infospace.
Each of them peaked in March and has fallen substantially since
then. Through mid-afternoon Tuesday, they were down 33 percent, 53
percent and 85 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Slattery grew up in Villanova, Pa., the son of a leasing company
executive. ``I've been around finance all my life,'' he said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   In November, after the New Opportunities Fund exceeded $100
million in assets, PBHG closed that fund to most new investors,
although existing investors were free to invest more money. It also
announced that Slattery would manage the PBHG Select Equity Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Money soon began to pour into the Select Equity Fund, which
increased its assets from $250 million to a peak of $2.1 billion
last month. It also rose rapidly, gaining 78 percent from the end
of 1999 through March 10, before it too began to fall back. Through
Tuesday it was down 37 percent from its peak, although it was still
up 12 percent since the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The New Opportunities Fund peaked at more than $570 million in
March. Both have come down more recently because of redemptions and
price declines.
</P>
<P>
   PBHG said the two funds would be run by Gary Pilgrim, Pilgrim
Baxter's chief investment officer. Slattery started at Pilgrim
Baxter as an assistant to Pilgrim.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ He sought to present himself as a legitimate historian
with contrarian views on the Holocaust. But the British writer
David Irving lost a libel case Tuesday when a judge declared that
he was in fact an ``active Holocaust denier.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has been closely watched by people alarmed at the
rising tide of Hitler apologists and neo-Nazis who state that there
was no massive Nazi program to put the Jews of Europe to death, or
who argue that the scale of the Holocaust has been greatly
overstated.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were a number of assertions in ``Denying the Holocaust:
The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory,'' a book first published
in 1993 in the United States by Deborah E. Lipstadt, a professor of
modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Lipstadt wrote that Irving, now 62, was ``one of
the most dangerous spokespersons for Holocaust denial'' and said
that ``he is at his most facile at taking accurate information and
shaping it to conform to his conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust denial is not a crime in Britain, as it is in Germany.
But Irving, the author of more than 30 books on World War II and
the Holocaust, some of which historians have praised, sued Lipstadt
and her publisher, Penguin Books, saying that the book had severely
damaged his reputation as a historian.
</P>
<P>
   He brought the suit here because British libel law puts the
burden on the defendants _ in this case, Lipstadt and Penguin _ to
prove the truth of their assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case, Charles Gray of the British high court,
handed a resounding victory to Lipstadt. In a scathing ruling
notable for its stern wording, Gray declared that Irving was a
racist Holocaust denier who deliberately distorted historical
evidence in order to cast Hitler in a favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's treatment of history, he said, was often ``perverse and
egregious.''
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, Irving, who represented himself at the trial,
is now responsible for paying the costs incurred by the defendants,
Lipstadt and Penguin. Lawyers for Lipstadt said that the legal
bills were likely to exceed $3 million. Irving said he would seek
permission to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the ruling Tuesday during a trip to Washington,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel said: ``The strength of Israel
today ensures that today no second Holocaust will take place, and
no one in the world will dare rise against the Jewish nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in parallel, a determined struggle is going on against the
people who deny the Holocaust that brought the death of a third of
our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of his career, Irving wrote a number of
admired books, notably ``Hitler's War'' (1977), and Gray Tuesday
praised his dogged use of primary sources and said that ``as a
military historian, Irving has much to commend him.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Irving's views have become more and more
extreme, and he has been increasingly associated with right-wing
groups and neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 he was fined and banned from Germany after he was
convicted under a German law that makes Holocaust denial a crime.
He has also been refused entry to Canada, Italy, Austria and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Irving has said that the gas chambers at
Auschwitz were not used to kill people _ Jews who died there
suffered from typhus and other diseases, he argues _ and that
Hitler neither ordered nor approved the Nazis' plans to
systematically put Europe's Jews to death. In fact, he has argued,
Hitler did not know about the mass killings until at least 1943.
</P>
<P>
   And while Irving has acknowledged that many Jews died during
World War II, he has also said it was logistically impossible for
the number to have been in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 St. Martin's Press withdrew his biography of the Nazi
propagandist Josef Goebbels, which contends that Goebbels, not
Hitler, was behind the murder of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, Irving used the withdrawal as evidence that
Lipstadt's book had fanned the flames of an ``organized
international endeavor'' to destroy his career.
</P>
<P>
   To prove the merit of Lipstadt's statements about Irving, her
lawyers presented testimony from a number of Holocaust historians
who picked apart many of Irving's research methods and conclusions,
showing them to be based on deliberate distortions and selective
use of facts.
</P>
<P>
   In his denunciation of Irving's credibility, Justice Gray said,
in essence, that Irving did not have a case. The judge refuted
Irving's argument that any historical misrepresentations he might
have made were inadvertent rather than deliberate distortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irving has for his own ideological reasons persistently and
deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence,''
the judge said. ``For the same reasons, he has portrayed Hitler in
an unwarrantedly favorable light, particularly in relation to his
attitude toward and responsibility for the treatment of the Jews.''
Irving, he concluded, is ``an active Holocaust denier'' and
anti-Semite who ``associates with right-wing extremists who promote
neo-Nazism.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, a jubilant Lipstadt, 53, said Irving had been
``hoist on his own petard,'' with his own evidence, and exposed as
a liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not about versions of the truth,'' she said. ``This
wasn't about a historian with a controversial view of history. This
was about a man who claims to be a historian making up, distorting,
perverting, manipulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who was splattered with a raw egg by a protester as he
went to court Tuesday morning, so that he sat through the judge's
ruling in his shirtsleeves and vest, slipped out a back door after
the decision and did not speak to reporters. But he told the Press
Association in an interview in his apartment in Mayfair that he
found the ruling ``perverse'' and ``historically incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused Lipstadt and Penguin of enlisting the help of ``the
leaders of the Jewish communities around the world'' in an
orchestrated effort to discredit him. ``Their method was to pour a
bucket of slime over me and say, `Look, he's covered in slime,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not at all anti-Semitic,'' he added. ``It is not
anti-Semitic to be critical of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Julius, a lawyer for Lipstadt, said the case was not
about whether the Holocaust took place, but whether there was any
historical evidence to support Irving's views.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the focus on his writing and proved that it wasn't up
to standard,'' he said. ``It's important to secure definitive
rulings against Holocaust deniers, to send them back into the
anti-Semitic ghetto from which they came.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Rabbi Marvin Hier and Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the
dean and associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles, called the ruling a ``victory of history over hate'' and
said it put an end to Irving's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision definitively places Irving where he belongs _
not as an historian, but as a leading apologist for those who seek
to whitewash the most heinous crime in human history,'' the rabbis
said. ``Irving tried to manipulate the British legal system in
order to put the victims murdered in the gas chambers on trial;
instead, the net result is that he will be relegated to the garbage
heap of history's haters.''

ELSTER ANSWERS THE BELL FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- He was supposed to be back in Las Vegas,
building a bar and getting his second career underway, not spoiling
the Giants' little lovefest with their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there Kevin Elster was Tuesday, the all-time party spoiler,
rocketing three home runs to lead the Dodgers to a 6-5 victory over
the Giants in the debut of Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Elster was the last guy the Giants figured would add to their
long Dodgers misery, a No.8 hitter who sat out all of last season.
A 35-year-old shortstop who didn't decide to try one last swing at
the majors until January, getting a late non-roster invite with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Elster had never hit three home runs in a single game at any
professional level.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the third home run, I think I was the most shocked guy
in the ballpark,'' Elster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time was Little League.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster hit Pac Bell Park's first home run in the third off Kirk
Kueter, added a two-run shot off Kueter in the fifth and a final
solo shot off reliever Felix Rodriguez in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with four RBI, plenty of stunned looks among the
dotcom crowd of 40,920 and a new found appreciation for those in
early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a remarkable day,'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Elster had some help along the way -- Chan Ho Park pitched six
effective-enough innings to earn his second victory, Jeff Shaw
survived a shaky ninth to earn his second save, Geronimo Berroa
filled in for the injured Eric Karros at first with two hits and an
RBI, Devon White had three hits and Gary Sheffield shook off his
sore ankle to start in left.
</P>
<P>
   But the guy who left San Francisco weeping in its Brie and
sourdough was Elster. A guy released by the Rangers in the middle
of the 1998 season, who went home a career .228-hitter and figured
it was time to move past this baseball thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I was retired,'' Elster said.
</P>
<P>
   Elster returned to his home in Henderson, Nev. and started
making plans to build a bar off the Vegas strip. He lifted weights,
but stayed away from playing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Then he started to get that itch. Johnson had been his manager
while he was with the Mets. He was raised in Huntington Beach. He
saw the Dodgers trying to build a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a real nice, full circle,'' Elster said. ``When
I decided to come back and play for Davey, I didn't want to do it
unless I could contribute. A day like today makes me feel like I
can, and hopefully kick starts the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants actually started the scoring Tuesday when Barry Bonds
doubled in Bill Mueller. Elster's first home run in the third tied
it, but the Giants took back the lead on a Bonds' solo homer in the
bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Then Elster put the Dodgers on top for good with his two-run
homer in the fifth. Shawn Green's bloop RBI single gave L.A. a 4-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Park, the closest thing the Dodgers may have to a stopper with
Kevin Brown nursing a broken pinkie finger, allowed three runs in
six innings,surrendering one more run in the sixth a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho pitched well,'' Johnson said. ``He was consistent the
whole game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big key for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Berroa's RBI single in the sixth, Elster gave the Dodgers
one more run to work with when he drilled a 3-2 pitch from
Rodriguez out in the eighth for his third home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get production like that from the bottom of your order and
it helps everyone else relax,'' Sheffield said. ``We feel like we
don't have to do everything all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added home runs from Doug Mirabelli off Terry Adams
in the eighth and J.T. Snow off Shaw in the ninth, but there would
be no memorable comeback on the opening of their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants threw this really big party, but the unexpected guest
ruled the day.

ONLY DOCTOR IN SENATE TO ENTER TRANSPLANT DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When shots were fired at the U.S. Capitol two years
ago, Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist, M.D., sprinted from his office
across the street to aid the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as the only doctor serving in the Senate, he will
be called upon again to use his medical expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Frist, a former heart transplant surgeon, will
attempt to heal a wound that has been festering for decades as the
federal government has struggled to fairly distribute a scarce
supply of donated organs to tens of thousands of patients in need
of lifesaving transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where everybody is tired of the fighting,''
said Bob Spieldenner, spokesman for the Richmond, Va.-based United
Network for Organ Sharing, the private contractor that has run the
country's transplant network since its creation in 1986. ``We all
want to work this out and move forward to come up with the best
system we can, so we're hopeful that Senator Frist can find a
workable compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   With 20,000 organs expected to be donated this year, about 5,000
of the nearly 69,000 patients in line for transplants of hearts,
livers, kidneys or other organs will die waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The issue before Congress is who should write the rules
transplant doctors follow in deciding who will get a transplant and
who will not.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says the federal government, which is
accountable to taxpayers, should have the sole authority to decide
how the country's organ supply should be used. UNOS argues that
since a medical decision is required, it should be made by
transplant professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has drawn support from transplant surgeons, hospital
administrators and organ bank officials, as well as donors'
families and the transplant patients themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy heated up two years ago, when, frustrated by a
disparities in the amount of time patients around the country must
wait for a transplant, U.S. Heath and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala announced a new set of rules. Her plan was to change
the current system of distributing organs locally or regionally
first to a system where organs would be shared on a national basis,
with the sickest patients given top priority regardless of where
they live.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement sent a shock through the transplant community,
with smaller transplant centers and organ banks complaining that
they would have to compete with larger hospitals that have long
waiting lists for organs. Many transplant surgeons also argued that
if all the organs go to the sickest patients, survival rates would
plummet, wasting organs that could be better used in patients who
might have a better chance of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana sued to try to stop the rules from taking effect. At
least seven states, including Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, passed
laws giving them the right to hoard organs in-state if it comes to
that. Then the fight moved to Washington, where Congress succeeded
in holding off implementation of the rules _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   On March 16, the rules, toned down considerably from their
original insistence on national sharing and the sickest-first
criteria, finally took effect, essentially giving full authority
over transplant policy to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the House voted 275-147 to throw the rules out
and give authority to UNOS. Shalala criticized the bill as a ``step
backwards,'' and President Clinton threatened to veto it if it
reaches his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Frist, 48, will step in Wednesday to offer a compromise to
fellow members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee: Let the medical community write the policy, but give the
government oversight to ensure that UNOS treats all patients as
fairly as possible. His bill also creates an independent commission
that would resolve disputes between UNOS and HHS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to have medical decisions made by the transplant
community, with strong oversight and strong accountability,'' the
Republican senator said last week as he introduced his compromise
bill. Despite nearly a week of negotiations, Frist had not been
able to convince Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to sign onto his
bill as a co-sponsor, but aides for both senators said talks would
continue until the committee meets Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., on Tuesday introduced
his own bill, essentially giving HHS what it originally wanted _
strong authority over UNOS and broader sharing of organs with the
sickest patients at the front of the transplant line. His bill also
would abolish state organ-hoarding laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House bill, in my judgment, is indefensible. There is no
public accountability for this private contractor. It's completely
inappropriate,'' Fitzgerald said. ``And Senator Frist's bill tries
to split the baby and gives HHS no real regulatory authority over
UNOS.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said seven co-sponsors had signed on to his bill and
predicted that Frist may face ``vigorous opposition'' to his plan
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frist, who once served as head of the Vanderbilt University
Multi-Organ Transplant Center, performed more than 200 heart and
lung transplants during his medical career. He also held hands with
dying patients who could not hold on long enough for a donor organ
to become available.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to share that 20-year experience is expected to be
crucial, both in Wednesday's debate, and, if he is successful, in
an eventual conference committee to work out differences in the
House and Senate bills.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department officials are preparing a letter
to the relatives of Elian Gonzalez ordering them to hand over the
boy to authorities on Thursday morning at an airport north of
Miami, government officials said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, aides to Attorney General Janet Reno said
Tuesday night that she had canceled plans to fly to Miami on
Wednesday to meet with Cuban-American leaders and relatives of the
boy in what would have been an attempt to persuade Elian's family
to peacefully surrender the 6-year-old Cuban boy to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The order to hand over the boy was contained in a letter being
written by Justice Department officials, who plan to order Elian's
relative to bring the child to the general aviation terminal at
Opa-Locka Airfield, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian would then be flown immediately to a reunion with his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, although the precise location of the
arrival has not yet been decided. The letter, is likely to be sent
to the relatives on Wednesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has told aides at the Justice Department for several days
that she was convinced that her direct intervention could soothe
the fiery passions within the Cuban-American population of Miami,
where Reno grew up and where she served for 15 years as the elected
local prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Reno has spoken emotionally and emphatically at
news conferences and television interviews about her sympathy for
the many Cuban-Americans who vehemently oppose sending Elian back
to the homeland ruled by of Fidel Castro, whom Reno has said she
unequivocally opposes.
</P>
<P>
   But she has also said that international politics should not
block the reunion of father and son, an outcome that she said was
correct as a long-established matter of immigration law and family
values. Pediatric psychiatrists, she said, have recommended turning
over Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possibility of an angry confrontation over the boy
has haunted negotiations between the government and Elian's Florida
relatives ever since fishermen plucked him from the Atlantic Ocean
off Florida on Thanksgiving after his mother drowned in their
ill-fated voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have said they would obey the law, including a
court order allowing the government to transfer custody to Elian's
father, but they have never agreed to turn the child over to his
father, repeatedly asking for further legal review of whether the
child should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seemed headed to a showdown when last week, Elian's
father arrived in the United States to retrieve his son from the
Miami relatives, who were granted temporary custody until federal
authorities ordered that the boy be reunited with his father.
Gonzalez has told authorities he intends to take his son back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision to fly to Miami seemed to add yet another
unpredictable element to the international custody case, giving the
Miami relatives a slim hope that they might argue their case for
keeping the child to the country's highest legal officer. But Reno
has insisted she will not waver in her determination to reunite
Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the boy's relatives offered a proposal that was
officially ignored by the Justice Department. In a letter
distributed outside the Miami home of Lazaro Gonzalez, the
great-uncle with whom Elian has been living, the family said it
would be willing to meet Elian's father at any ``neutral place in
South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter added that the session would be followed immediately
by a second meeting with the father that would include Elian. The
relatives sought an assurance from the government that Elian would
not be forcibly taken from them at the proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who is staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat
in a Washington, D.C., suburb, has said he does not want to meet
the Miami relatives, but would fly to Florida if necessary to pick
up his son. Afterward, the father has said, the adult members of
the Gonzalez family might seek a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department Tuesday, two Miami area mayors, Alex
Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Joseph Carollo of Miami, met with
Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the immigration service,
and urged the attorney general to arrange a meeting between Elian's
father and the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Reno issued a statement saying that she
welcomed their suggestions. She added, ``The mayors have asked me
to speak with leaders of the Miami community and I have indicated
my willingness and desire to do so. We agreed to continue working
together to seek an outcome that allows Elian to be reunited with
his father in the best way possible for him, his family and for the
Miami community as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Juan Miguel Gonzalez has said he does not want to
defect to the United States, the House Republican leadership and
Cuban-American lawmakers Tuesday invited him to a private meeting
on Wednesday in the Capitol. The lawmakers said in a letter to
Elian's father, which was delivered by congressional aides, that
they wanted him ``to be sure that you are aware of all the options
available to you as you make your decision.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A GREEN SHIP LOST AT SEA ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, someone on the good ship Jets shouted: ``Land,
Ho!'' Maybe Bill Parcells called land, maybe it was Leon Hess. In
any event, for long-suffering Jets fans, this Promised Land was a
sight for sore eyes: the Super Bowl was close.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets lost to Denver in the 1998 American Football Conference
championship game. No matter. The team was young and fiery:
Keyshawn Johnson, the brazen wide receiver, was returning.
Parcells, the gruff captain, was coming back. The ship was intact.
</P>
<P>
   Last season was an injury-induced disaster, and Tuesday came the
news came that Keyshawn Johnson was probably headed to the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers in a blockbuster trade.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, in the midst of snow and rain, the vibrant land of
a Super Bowl that loomed so large two seasons ago seems to be
rapidly shrinking. The great green ship is being pulled out to sea
by a dastardly undercurrent so familiar to Jets fans.
</P>
<P>
   Jets fans will probably find a way to rationalize the loss of a
great player: if the deal goes through, the Jets, who already have
two first-round picks, would receive Tampa Bay's two No. 1's. They
might even get one of the Bucs' starting wide receivers. Of course,
that's no loss for Tampa Bay, whose passing game is miserable.
That' why they're willing to mortgage their future for the All-Pro
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Another scenario has the Jets trading at least three of those
picks to Cleveland for the first pick of the draft, which they'll
use to get Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington or defensive end
Courtney Brown. If you think that solves the Jets' defensive
problems, you're crazy. With their primary offensive threat gone,
and the defensive genius, Bill Belichick, gone, the Jets face a
daunting challenge in the league's most competitive division.
</P>
<P>
   The great problem with this trade for the Jets is that Tampa Bay
knows exactly what it's getting: a navigator they've sorely missed
on offense. The Jets are getting promising players, some of whom
may be deck hands. Who knows if there are any navigators in the
group. That leaves a first-year coach and a new owner to battle the
turbulent seas of the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was fourth in the American Football Conference last
season in receptions with 89 for 1,170 yards and 8 touchdowns for
the 8-8 Jets. He has caught 305 passes for 4,108 yards since being
drafted No. 1 out of Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who has followed the Jets' recent rise knows that
Johnson's value goes beyond numbers. His value is his attitude,
even though ``attitude'' is what initially turned critics off to
Johnson. He played by the rules: No off-field problems. He
graduated from USC, converted his NFL fame into endorsements,
opening a restaurant. But Johnson was cocky. And direct. He'd look
anyone in the eye _ Parcells, Al Groh, Woody Johnson _ and speak
his piece. Not everyone likes that.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells liked it because he knew that what the bland, nameless,
faceless Jets needed was a blustery coach and a brazen star
receiver. The Jets are saying this is strictly a salary-cap issue,
and during the owners meeting last week, Johnson gave the
law-and-order spin about the sanctity of contracts:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a member of the team _ he has a contract with the team,''
Johnson said. ``I think that contracts are a part of society.
Contracts are important. I think if you sign an agreement with
somebody and agree to do something, you should take that for what
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But Johnson's manner can be intimidating to a rookie coach
and a rookie owner. Especially if the ship begins to drift.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Al Groh promised that the Jets would never trade
Johnson. ``We want Keyshawn on the team, therefore, we're not
trading Keyshawn,'' he said. ``I think the statement stands on its
own legs. There's nothing more to add to it. We have no trades in
the works right now, and we're not attempting to put any
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Buccaneers were like the Jets in 1998: one game, one
quarter, one missed call away from the Promised Land. Tampa Bay
upgraded its equipment: it fired an offensive coordinator and is
trying to bring in a world-class navigator in Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets may be sending their brightest ray of light to sunny
Tampa, leaving themselves with no compass; and no winds in their
sails.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Jets fans have seen this scene before. Dark clouds,
deep thunder, a ship facing storm after storm, sailing from one
bizarre encounter to another without ever seeing land.
</P>
<P>
   The horizon is shrinking and by mid-November fans will ask:
``Didn't someone say `Land, Ho?'''
</P>
<P>
   That's how mutinies begin.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some art centers are born with well-defined missions
in mind and sizable budgets to help make their most ambitious
programming dreams come true. Others are fueled more by can-do
spirit and make-do inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, some seemingly well-financed places flounder or
disappear even after presenting good, memorable shows. (Remember
the IBM Gallery or the short-lived Center for International
Contemporary Arts?) And then there are the offbeat, sometimes more
impulsive art outposts that pop up and, despite the odds, hang on
for years and unexpectedly become important, even treasured
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Exit Art/The First World is one such irascible survivor. Now,
with a retrospective exhibition titled ``The End: An Independent
Vision of Contemporary Culture, 1982-2000,'' the nonprofit arts
center, which has become an essential stop for professionals and
enthusiasts alike, is celebrating _ and analyzing _ its own history
since its founding 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The large show, wide-ranging in its themes and content, will
remain on view through April 29. At a time of millennial fever, and
as something of an answer to other museums' splashy surveys of
20th-century art, ``The End'' offers its organizers' distinctive
take, in particular, on the art of the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see all art as a dynamic of opposites,'' said Papo Colo, an
artist, writer and performer who is a co-founder of Exit Art,
during an interview at the offices he shares in SoHo with its other
founder, Jeanette Ingberman, and a small staff. Colo, who was born
in Puerto Rico, is a restless thinker and a peripatetic voyager in
various creative fields. He speaks passionately of a commitment to
fostering artistic expression that cuts across disciplines and
cultures. He calls his outlook ``transcultural.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Colo watched the flurry of activity at a television
station next to his home; his father was a prizefighter, and from
those early influences, he acquired an appreciation of performing
and of how images, ideas and information can be persuasively
packaged. He came to New York in 1971, in his early 20s, hung out
at the Chelsea Hotel and then studied literature for a year at
Columbia University. ``I went to Mexico, did the Don Juan thing,
then spent a decade making art and going back and forth between New
York and Barcelona,'' Colo recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The product of a postcolonial society in an increasingly
multicultural world, he became fascinated by the meaning of
cultural identity _ an individual's, a nation's _ and how it is
formed. For a while, Colo created false documents as works of art,
including a fake Puerto Rican university diploma whose Latin
inscription questioned _ or mocked _ the notion of one culture
conferring legitimacy on another. That piece is on view in the
current exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Colo around 1980, when I was a curator at the Bronx
Museum,'' Ingberman said. A native New Yorker of Polish-Jewish
descent, she raised eyebrows when she focused, as a graduate
art-history student at Columbia in the late 1970s, on the still-new
topic of art and the law. A subsequent spot in the Whitney Museum's
curatorial program led to her job in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Of the early days of her collaboration with Colo, she said:
``Colo was making wound paintings when I first visited his studio;
he slashed his canvases and then sewed them back together so they
looked severe. He was involved in performance art, poetry,
painting. Immediately we had an exciting dialogue. We came from
very different backgrounds, which is what Exit Art would be about,
informed by all sorts of cultural ideas. We don't just have an idea
and try to fit artists' work into it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Colo and Ingberman mounted their first exhibition, the
sex-themed ``Dirty Pictures,'' in the Franklin Furnace Archive
space in TriBeCa. Two years later, they inaugurated their own space
on lower Broadway, effectively helping expand the SoHo art district
eastward. In 1993, they opened Exit Art's present space at 548
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the spirit of his and Ingberman's work, Colo said,
``A curator is a translator of ideas.'' But Exit Art has helped
shape the art discourse of its time, too. Others who have followed
its programming add that Colo and Ingberman's exhibitions have
responded to and reflected the strong emerging trends that their
research has turned up long before commercial galleries or
mainstream museums caught up with them.
</P>
<P>
   In their early years they gave solo, mid-career shows to
artists, including Martin Wong, David Wojnarowicz, Cecilia Vicuna
and Krzysztof Wodiczko, who had created substantive bodies of work
that establishment venues had ignored or shunned.
</P>
<P>
   Exit Art earned a place on the front lines of the culture wars
with shows like ``Illegal America'' (1990), which examined artists'
run-ins with the law and censorship. Other notable offerings have
included ``The Design Show'' (1993), a survey of exhibition
invitations; ``Comic Power'' (1993), a look at artists whose work
was influential in underground and independent comics; and
``Counterculture'' (1996), which explored alternative media from
the underground press to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Exit Art has also presented films, music events, performances
and numerous panel discussions, as well as curiosities like ``La
Tradicion: Performing Painting'' (1997), in which 10 painters lived
and worked in the exhibition space for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Hess, a former art critic for The Village Voice, said:
``Exit Art's attitude and the art it showed came out of certain
social issues and a certain edgy place. What keeps it fresh is that
Jeanette and Colo have never stopped visiting artists' studios,
even now, when everyone is so busy. Working critics and curators
absolutely have to visit studios.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is that unusual name. ``People like myself have
been marginalized by those who wield cultural power in our
society,'' Colo said. ``We've been lumped together as `the Third
World.' But in fact, the hybrid culture of our age is being
nourished by `outsiders' of all kinds _ Asians, Africans, the
peoples of the Americas. It is they who are actually creating the
new prevailing culture of the first world with their diverse
contributions. We say `exit' to suggest moving away from the
established art system and its stereotypical way of thinking. Every
exit is an entrance. Thus our name: Exit Art/The First World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The End,'' which refers to the end of one phase of Exit Art's
mission and the beginning of another, consists, in part, of
posters, photographs, slide projections and other materials that
document the gallery's major exhibitions to date. They are
presented in the kind of spare, accessible installation for which
Colo is known. A second section features paintings, drawings,
sculptures, prints and videos from past shows. Among them are
Laurie Anderson's ``O Superman'' video (1982), Wodiczko's sleeping
container on wheels for the homeless (1988), samples of the
comic-irreverent painting style of the 1980s, and David Hammons'
untitled sculpture from 1989, a big wheel of green glass bottles
anchored in a heap of beautifully sinister charcoal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike conventional museums, Colo doesn't overly aestheticize
the work he installs,'' said Mary Anne Staniszewski, an art
historian who has served on Exit Art's board of directors and is
the author of ``The Power of Display,'' a book about the history of
exhibition design at the Museum of Modern Art. ``Instead, it's set
up in a way that articulates the meaning of what's being shown.
Often you can touch the objects. The viewer can have diverse
experiences in different kinds of installations.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Exit Art served as a significant steppingstone to
the mainstream system of commercial galleries and museums for some
artists. Although Wojnarowicz would die of AIDS two years later, at
the age of 38, his career received a boost after Exit Art exhibited
his controversial work in 1990. It pointedly addressed social and
sexual taboos and antigay bigotry. That show had originated at
Illinois State University; other New York sites were reluctant to
pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists genuinely feel welcome, and our work is presented in
ways that engage viewers in the issues it deals with,'' Wodiczko,
who comes from Poland, said of his experiences as part of what he
called ``the Exit Art family of artists'' from around the world. He
added, ``If we address sensitive issues like homelessness, even if
they may be difficult for the public or confrontational, Exit Art
is willing to consider and show the work.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be because, by insisting on their independence, even
while learning to play the inescapable fund-raising game, Colo and
Ingberman have made sure that they can show such work. (Exit Art
has received support from the National Endowment for the Arts, Dow
Jones &AMP; Co., the Lannan Foundation and others.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ingberman said, ``We're constantly asking ourselves:
`What (italics)is(end italics) an exhibition, anyway?''' Similarly,
``The End'' is more than just a salute to past achievements; it is
an introspective exhibition about the making and meanings of
exhibitions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Colo and Jeanette are busy writing the unwritten
history of modern and avant-garde art,'' said Martha Wilson, a
performance artist and the founding director in 1976 of the
Franklin Furnace Archive, the downtown alternative-art space.
</P>
<P>
   Colo would probably concur with her, albeit with an explanatory
proviso. ``For me,'' he said emphatically, ``Exit Art has been the
great party of my life.''

 MRS. CLINTON PRODS GIULIANI TO TAKE STANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton asserted Tuesday that
Rudolph Giuliani was avoiding discussion of how he would vote in
the U.S. Senate, and said it was not enough to ask voters to judge
him based solely on his record as mayor of New York, as Giuliani
has suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am running a campaign that will tell you what I will do,''
Clinton said in a hall packed with cheering municipal workers. At a
news conference later on Tuesday, she added, ``I think this
campaign should be about issues and about how each of us would vote
in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   With her remarks, Clinton sought to lay out a framework for how
voters should judge the Senate contest. The candidates, she said,
should be evaluated primarily based on how they would vote in the
Senate, a formula that would presumably favor Clinton in New York,
a Democratic state. By contrast, Giuliani has presented the
election as mainly a referendum on his performance as mayor, saying
that voters could look to New York City to judge his potential
effectiveness as a senator, an assessment that would also appear to
play to his greatest strength.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asserted that Giuliani ``won't tell you where he
stands'' on issues like the Republican tax-cut proposal in Congress
and increasing the minimum wage. In truth, Giuliani has discussed
these issues, though only in a limited way and only in response to
questions. He has yet to give a major policy speech in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Giuliani's campaign spokeswoman, Juleanna Glover
Weiss, condemned Clinton's attack, saying Giuliani has
unhesitatingly offered his views on controversial subjects, like
the fate of Elian Gonzalez, while Clinton has held back. ``Mrs.
Clinton is everywhere and nowhere simultaneously,'' she said,
``while Mayor Giuliani talks about issues every day and has the
record to back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered a new response to complaints that she is running
for office in a state she only recently moved to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're trying to recruit somebody for the Yankees or the
Mets,'' she said, ``we wouldn't care where they were born.''

MAINE LEGISLATORS BACK PRICE CONTROLS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs 3rd graf to give different reason for attorney general's
views) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a slap to the pharmaceutical industry and a rebuke to
Congress, the Maine Legislature on Tuesday became the first in the
country to approve a bill that would clamp sweeping price controls
on medications sold in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Act to Establish Fairer Prescription Drug Prices'' would
immediately establish a pricing board to set suggested lower
prices. If the prices did not fall, then as of Oct 1, 2001, the
board would mandate that all drugs sold in Maine could cost no more
than they would in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The bill must still go to Gov. Angus S. King Jr., who has
remained neutral on it, but it passed by veto-proof margins in both
chambers Tuesday _ 23-9 in the Senate, 102-47 in the House. It is
expected to face legal challenges, in particular on the grounds
that it hinders interstate commerce, but the state attorney general
has testified that he believes the bill can withstand them, in part
because the commerce clause in the U.S. Constitution allows an
exception for states protecting the basic health and safety of
their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes Maine the first state to say, `Americans shouldn't
be subsidizing low prices for prescription drugs around the world,'
'' state Sen. Chellie Pingree, the Senate's Democratic majority
leader and the bill's primary sponsor. ``The pharmaceutical
industry worked extra hard against this bill, but they had no
argument and this is a huge national issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of medications is particularly an issue in
border states like Maine, where residents can cross into Canada,
which has national health insurance, and reap the benefits of the
discount the Canadian government negotiates with drug companies,
saving as much as 60 or 70 percent on certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont state Senate recently passed a similar bill with
``fair pricing of prescription drugs'' in its title, though it has
yet to be voted on in the state House of Representatives. The New
England states have also formed a coalition to try to present a
united front on drug prices, whether through local price controls
or pooling their residents to demand mass discounts. The
legislative leaders in the coalition argue that virtually every
other country negotiates a low price for their drugs with the
industry, so Americans end up footing the bill for all the research
that benefits everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' said Peter Shumlin, president pro tem of the
Vermont state Senate, ``is to have a number of states move forward
simultaneously to send a message to the pharmaceutical industry
that people in New England are sick and tired of paying a 60 to 80
percent premium for drugs made in America, and _ I think we share
this view with our friends in Maine _ as long as the pharmaceutical
industry remains the top donor to members in both parties in
Congress, not much will happen there; it's going to have to happen
state by state.''
</P>
<P>
   To backers of the pharmaceutical industry, that goal is deeply
misguided, as is the Maine bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like they're claiming this is a win for the
Legislature, but I think it's a detrimental blow to patients in
Maine who need access to medicine,'' said Gabrielle Williams, a
spokeswoman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, the Washington-based trade association. ``It could have
significant impacts on access to certain medications in Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays in setting prices could bring delays in access to new
drugs, she said. Also, price controls remove the financial
incentive for research and development to create new miracle drugs,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   And some fear that manufacturers would refuse to sell drugs in
Maine. The bill's backers say that would be a public relations
disaster for the companies.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of local opposition to the bill in Maine as
well. On Monday, a group of doctors, biotechnology backers and
senior citizens' groups held a news conference to oppose the bill,
saying they worried that price controls might restrict access to
some drugs. They called for changes in insurance programs to make
drugs more affordable for old people rather than for universal
price controls.
</P>
<P>
   Others sounded like Clyde E. Dyar, the economic and community
development director for the town of Fairfield, who worried that
the bill would chill investment in Maine's small biotechnology
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put price controls on in Maine, and we don't do it
nationally, then it puts an onus on companies not to do business in
Maine,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Why don't we start in
Louisiana? Why don't we start in Texas? Why don't we do it on the
national level, where it belongs? Why do we impose a hardship on
Maine? It's tough enough as it is to do economic development in
Maine. This puts another cross upon us to carry.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the bill came to the floor of both chambers Tuesday,
Pingree said, the debate was lengthy largely because so many
lawmakers wanted to share what they and their constituents had
experienced buying medicine. Ultimately, the support for the bill
crossed party lines. Also spurring the vote was testimony from
hundreds of elderly Mainers at a public hearing last month; many
described choosing between paying for their medication or basics
like food and rent.
</P>
<P>
   The energy with which lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry
opposed the bill may also have backfired. Pingree said that on the
day the legislative committee that handled the bill was about to
vote, ``There were something like 20 industry lobbyists there and
three charter jets at the Augusta airport _ everyone was joking
about it because that's a rare sight here in Augusta, a town of
40,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maine bill sets aside $200,000 for its legal defense. It
lays out the composition of an 11-member pricing board and lays out
several interim measures meant to reduce prices. The state-mandated
pricing is not to come into effect if prices can be lowered by
those other means.
</P>
<P>
   Shumlin of Vermont said he did not believe any other states were
planning to pass similar bills in this legislative session, which
is already winding down in Maine and elsewhere, though many other
states are tackling drug prices in other ways. But the two senators
seemed mighty happy with their own two-state rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bills in Maine and Vermont, Pingree said, is
``absolutely a shot across the bow of excessive pricing by the
pharmaceutical industry.''

   &UR; PASTAPOMO _ &LR;  Two years ago, San Francisco's Pasta Pomodoro was
on the verge of boiling over.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of moderate-priced Italian eateries had grown from a
single, tiny North Beach location to eight neighborhood restaurants
in just three years. It doubled in size, from four to eight
locations, in just 12 months during 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The first four Pasta Pomodoros were so successful, ``We thought,
`This is easy. Let's speed it up,''' recounted Adriano Paganini,
the company's 33-year-old founder. ``It's that invincible syndrome
that's so dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Milan-born Paganini, who has been working in
restaurants since he was 17, presides over a successful, 12-outlet
chain that generated about $15 million in sales last year and is
poised to expand.

 2 Upstart Phone Firms Irk Watchdog  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A consumer watchdog group plans to file a complaint with state
regulators today against two upstart phone companies that target
customers who've had their local phone service shut off because
they didn't pay their bills.
<P>
   The Utility Consumers Action Network of San Diego claims Tel
West Communications of Seattle and Smoke Signal Communications of
Houston have been gouging low-income customers by charging them as
much as $80 per month, when many of them should qualify for a
subsidized ``Universal Lifeline Service'' that costs just over $5
per month.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers wind up paying the higher fees, consumer
advocates said, because they feel they have no other option for
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   UCAN's Charles Carbone claims that neither company offers the
cheaper lifeline service, as required by state rules. The group
plans to complain to the California Public Utilities Commission
today.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the group claims that Tel West, which offers
service in most of California, including the Bay Area, neglected to
file required documents disclosing their prices and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   Tel West President Jeff Swickard said he first learned about
UCAN's accusations Monday, and immediately asked an employee to
make sure the company is complying with all of the state rules and
regulations. ``We want to work with the PUC,'' Swickard said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the company has never been named in a customer
complaint filed with the PUC. And Swickard said he doubted many
customers would qualify for lifeline service. He said customers
typically aren't poor, but have had problems managing their money.
Smoke Signal, also known as Choctaw Communications, could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have been aggressively recruiting customers with
financial problems. Smoke Signal, for instance, has been running
television commercials in Southern California featuring actor Erik
Estrada, famous for his role as a state trooper in ``CHiPS.''
</P>
<P>
   The firms will generally offer service to anyone, but ask
customers to prepay their bills in advance. And they charge higher
rates. Smoke Signal charges $50 per month for local calls, plus
another $30 for local toll calls (beyond 12 miles but too short to
be considered long distance). Tel West charges $40 a month for
local calls only.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Pacific Bell's rates start at about $11 per month
and lifeline service costs half that. A family of four must have an
income of $25,090 or less to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   UCAN's Carbone said the group hopes it can put the companies out
of business by pressing the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a submarket created for low-income people,'' Carbone
said. ``They are offering a worse service at a much higher price.''

 Brience Attracts $200 Million Golden Financing  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In what could be the largest first-round venture financing of a
startup, GTCR Golden Rauner of Chicago announced yesterday that it
has invested $200 million in Brience Inc. of San Francisco.
<P>
   The company, whose name is short for broadband experience, is
developing software that allows big companies to deliver e-commerce
solutions through a variety of devices such as personal digital
assistants, cell phones and TV set-top boxes. Brience's technology
also will let companies personalize access by providing premium
bandwidth to their best customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded last month by Rod McGeary, former co-CEO
of KPMG Consulting LLC, and Keyur Patel, former chief strategist
for e-business at KPMG. McGeary is CEO and chairman of Brience,
Patel its chief strategist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the largest first-round found  &LR; financing
ever,'' said Patel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundred million would be an exceedingly large round,''
said Tamar Zemel, a spokesperson for VentureOne, a San Francisco
research firm that tracks venture capital investments. ``Last year,
the median first-round investment was $6 million, and the median
size of all investment rounds was $7.5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of 2,969 U.S. venture financings last year, only four
companies received more than $200 million, and all of these  &LR; were
later-round investments. For example, CarsDirect.com of Culver City
received $280 million in third-round financing; Webvan of Foster
City raised $275 million; Spectrasite Holdings of Cary, N.C.,
raised $231 million; and Corvis Corp. of Columbia, Md., raised $216
million.
</P>
<P>
   Brience expects two Fortune 500 companies to begin testing its
content delivery software next month. GTCR of Chicago, which
manages more than $4.5 billion in private equity investments,
focuses on e-business and other information technology
opportunities.

MAKING TV BY BITING THE HAND THAT FEEDS IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn.)   Karen Schoemer is a pop music critic for Us Weekly.  
 By KAREN SCHOEMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Forde does not know what made him say it. He had not
planned to say it _ not consciously, at least. But clearly it had
been lurking in his subconscious for some time.
</P>
<P>
   It popped out of him on an episode of ``Mental Engineering,''
his quirky, low-budget PBS talk show about television commercials
and the social significance of advertising. The panelists had just
viewed a Buick Century spot in which the car glides silently
through a forest while the family inside gazes rapturously through
the windows up at the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the rich have more friends than the rest of us?'' the actor
Willem Dafoe intoned in a voiceover. ``Are they more deserving of a
comfortable seat? Are they more entitled to brake safely on a rainy
day?'' Leola Johnson, a communications professor with graying
dreadlocks, remarked upon the spot's mixture of ``class envy and
class hatred.'' Tim Mitchell, a comedian, sputtered: ``I don't
think people are going to fall for this ad, that somehow Buick's
against the rich. I mean, how much does the CEO of Buick make? You
know? Yeah, `Buy the new Buick Commiemobile, the new Buick
Proletariat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Forde, an amiable fellow with a square, jutting chin and a
penchant for wearing sport coats and collarless shirts, looked
admiringly at his panelists. He was enjoying himself. Still, he
wanted to push boundaries, make waves _ geez, he just wanted to
know if (italics)anyone was watching.(end italics) So when the
camera turned back to him, he blurted it out. ``Why,'' he said, his
voice rising with indignation, ``does GM advertising almost
universally suck?''
</P>
<P>
   The question hung there in the air. It bounced off the PBS
satellite, beaming into markets like San Francisco, Buffalo, New
Orleans _ although, thankfully, not Detroit. Another panelist, Greg
Fideler, a writer, shrugged and answered, with suitable absurdity,
``Because they kill small children.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate oligarchy did not exactly crumble that day, but it
did shiver, however imperceptibly, in the chill wind of voices
raised in protest. ``Mental Engineering'' may be the only
television show ever to take aim at big business in the vast, gushy
spot where it is most vulnerable: advertising. Each episode
dissects and deconstructs four broadcast commercials, with Forde
(pronounced FOR-dee) egging on his guests with questions like,
``For most Americans, is money the slave or the master?'' and, ``Do
Third World citizens see investors as coming to help?''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the panelists need much encouragement. After viewing a
1999 Super Bowl commercial for the job-search service Monster.com,
in which children spout lines like, ``When I grow up, I want to
file all day,'' and, ``I want to claw my way up to middle
management,'' Lisa Disch, a political scientist, commented: ``When
I saw this commercial, I thought, `Wow! Unions are taking out
ads!'''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the line between mass entertainment and the
advertising that supports it is blurred almost beyond recognition,
``Mental Engineering'' could not be more relevant. Interview a few
of the show's participants, and sooner or later a conversation
leads to Noam Chomsky. ``There's a real political dimension to the
show,'' Forde said. ``We're trying to get people to think about
themselves as citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The political element, though, is not always explicit. The
show's more obvious goal is to untangle the convoluted social
imagery that advertising projects. Is the lonely-heart woman in the
soft drink ad really suggesting that Diet Coke can take the place
of sex? If the life insurance commercial is actually about a man
dying and leaving his children as orphans, why is the family
romping on a beach? ``I look for a really strong subtext,'' Forde
said. ``If the whole point of the segment is to critique the
commercial, then we've missed it. I want to talk about the meaning,
the message it sends to adolescent girls, to elderly people or poor
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental Engineering'' is not afraid to be brainy, even (gasp)
academic. ``There's definitely emotion and identity bound up in our
purchases,'' said a panelist, Chris Vigliaturo, who is a computer
programmer. ``And the deeper motivations psychologists talk about _
sex and death _ are very effective at getting people's attention.
So besides keeping corporate organizations honest, thinking about
advertising invites us to unwind our own puritanism.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Mental Engineering'' is such a brilliant idea _
``Politically Incorrect'' meets Super Bowl morning-after water
cooler chat _ then why haven't you seen it?
</P>
<P>
   Forde, 41, a member of Mensa with degrees in philosophy and
psychology, started ``Mental Engineering'' in 1998 as a St. Paul
cable access show. He had no previous television experience; he had
driven a bus, made pizza and worked as an orderly in a hospital
senile ward. But he had big ideas. After a stint as a radio station
intern, he decided to use some gift money from his parents to
produce his own show.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he began pitching it to public television, and through
painstaking station-by-station networking, he landed on some 50 PBS
affiliates. ``If there's ever been a show that screamed
noncommercial television, it's this one,'' said Bill Hanley, the
executive vice president for content at KTCA in St. Paul. ``It's
thoughtful, it's fun, and it deals with a subject most commercial
folks wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even PBS, which gets corporate financing from, among many
others, GM, is treating the show in a gingerly way. Major markets
like New York, Boston and Atlanta have not put it on. A Los Angeles
station ran episodes in a two-week burst, then never showed the
program again. ``PBS doesn't return my phone calls,'' Forde said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley, whose KTCA was the first affiliate to climb on board,
denies that PBS has a problem with the show's anticorporate
content. ``You ever listen to `Car Talk' on public radio?'' he
asked. ``They regularly say that General Motors cars suck, and
apparently public radio has survived. Most big companies understand
how to take a little criticism. If they were to beat up on public
television over something like that, it would really be sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Forde, who is producing each episode on a minuscule $4,000 to
$5,000 budget, relishes his David versus Goliath stance. ``If we
get sued,'' he said, ``they can't engage us on the legal front
without also engaging us on the public relations front. I look
forward to instructing them in the art of public relations
jujitsu.'' Forde actually tapes the ads himself off commercial TV,
and he claims he has ``two written legal opinions from eminent law
firms'' that say he is free to use the material because it is for a
nonprofit educational purpose. In other words, he is not profiting,
so why should anyone mind?
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, the advertising community is not as ruffled as one
might suspect. ``I suppose it's a compliment to those of us who
make advertising our careers,'' said Edward Boches, the creative
director at Mullen Advertising, which produced the Monster.com
spot. ``It sort of legitimizes it as an entertainment art form.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at GM, people are a little less charitable. ``They've
constructed a panel of quote `experts' _ people who are there to
critique and scrutinize the work, not react to it in a natural
consumer environment,'' said Tom Jump, the director of promotions
and marketing for Buick. ``I don't think it reflects the real
world. What's more interesting to us is, how do our consumers
respond when they're in the market for a car?''
</P>
<P>
   Jump is unintentionally making the same point as Forde:
advertisers don't want you to think, and ``Mental Engineering''
does. Forde believes his show, which was nominated in February for
a Peabody Award, has enormous potential. ``I think we're poised to
be as big as `Politically Incorrect' in a year or two,'' he crowed.
His supporters are more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will ever find a venue in commercial
culture,'' Leola Johnson said with a laugh. She compared it to
another cult show that began on Minnesota public access. ``The sort
of thing `Mystery Science Theater 3000' did is a real
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mental Engineering'' is looking strong for its new season.
Forde has just begun taping 13 new episodes, which will be
broadcast on his PBS affiliates starting in May. He has just one
tiny problem: money. ``Mental Engineering'' currently has a
corporate underwriter, a company called Arnan.-com. _ although
calling it a ``corporate underwriter'' may be an overstatement.
``Arnan is my friend Bill,'' Forde said. ``He is an information
technology engineer and MBA. He gave us a tiny amount of money and
an ocean of technical support.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's Web site, mentalengineering.com, is not coy about
Forde's desire to land a real corporate sponsor: ``When you
underwrite `Mental Engineering,' your company will be perceived
just like the show: smart, honest and fun. Exactly the kind of
people the world wants to do business with.''
</P>
<P>
   The language is eerily familiar: it sounds like ... an ad. But
Forde never claimed to be immune to the advertising he pillories.
And he realizes that his show has one other thing in common with
advertising: free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if public TV doesn't want us, we can video-stream,'' he
said, ever the entrepreneur. ``It's like porn or hate speech:
there's nothing anybody can do to stop us.''

WHITE HOUSE, CONGRESS TAKE OPPOSITE APPROACHES TO GUN VIOLENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the first anniversary of the Columbine
massacre approaching, the Democratic White House and the
Republican-controlled Congress are reacting to increasing public
concern over gun violence but in starkly different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Intensifying a Democratic push for new gun-control measures,
President Clinton on Tuesday attended the signing of a Maryland law
requiring trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should follow Maryland's lead,'' Clinton said in
Annapolis as Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat, signed the
legislation that requires external locks on all guns sold in the
state beginning Oct. 1 and mandates built-in locks on new handguns
sold in the state beginning Jan. 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with Republicans claiming Clinton has not enforced gun
laws already on the books, the House passed 358-60 a program to
send $100 million in block grants to states that impose at least a
five-year additional sentence for gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Republicans acted
because ``they feel like they're vulnerable on this. They've got to
do something.'' He faulted the measure, contending that only six
states would be eligible for funds because the other 44 states do
not have the sentencing rules required in the House measure.
</P>
<P>
   Despairing of congressional action on anti-gun measures he
favors, Clinton flies Wednesday to Denver to boost the drive to put
on the Colorado ballot in November a measure to require background
checks for purchasers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to speak at a rally in a convention center just miles
from suburban Columbine High School, where last April 20 two
teen-agers shot to death 12 fellow students and a teacher before
killing themselves _ the deadliest school shooting in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed measure, which needs 62,000 signatures to get on
the ballot, is sponsored by a bipartisan group, SAFE Colorado. The
acronym stands for Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposal would require buyers at gun shows, where some
sellers are unlicensed vendors, to undergo a background check
similar to that faced by a purchaser at a registered gun shop. Some
of the weapons used at Columbine were purchased at a gun show and
then sold to the two students shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the proposal are considering several legal
challenges to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it's written right now, it wouldn't even pass muster
in traffic court,'' Dudley Brown, executive director of the Rocky
Mountain Gun Owners, said.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative process began after the Republican-controlled
Colorado Legislature refused to enact any gun-control measures,
even though the state's Republican governor, Bill Owens, supported
what he called ``common-sense'' firearms controls, such as an end
to the gun show loophole.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Colorado capital, Clinton also is to participate in
a live, hourlong MSNBC ``town hall on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., voicing a view
widely held by Republican lawmakers, questioned if the legislation
supported by Clinton and many Democrat would curb murderous
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of fact, more gun control laws would probably not
have effected what happened in Columbine,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Columbine shootings, the Senate passed a bill to
close the gun-show loophole in federal law, but the House defeated
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the Senate had adopted more sensible measures in a
juvenile justice measure, such as providing federal funds for metal
detectors in schools _ ``devices that could have made a difference
in Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott called for the Clinton administration to adopt a ``zero
tolerance'' attitude toward crimes committed with guns, a step
taken by several federal and state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said many Democrats, although
not enthusiastic about the House measure, voted for it because they
``saw a political trap and decided not to fall for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the House bill was ``a cruel political trick on
the American public'' because only six states would be eligible. He
said Republicans have blocked consideration of gun safety measures
as well as Clinton's more generous enforcement proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton's $280 million package would fund 1,000
new prosecutors and 500 more federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, which has not been considered by the Senate,
uses the same name, Project Exile, as the ``zero tolerance''
program begun by a U.S. prosecutor in Richmond, Va., a city with
one of the nation's highest crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-related crimes have dropped 65 percent and violent crimes 35
percent since the program began. Critics of the House bill said
nearby jurisdictions had seen a similar decline without using the
get-tough program, even though Virginia has since adopted a similar
statewide plan.

 _ SF CHRON   Many Fund Managers View Their Internet Investments From Afar 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Location, location, location may be the three most important words
in the real estate business. But when it comes to managing Internet
funds, location seems not to matter.
<P>
   There are at least 23 open-end, actively managed mutual funds
that invest exclusively in Net stocks, but only two are based in
the Bay Area _ the epicenter of the Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   That might sound pathetically parochial, until you consider that
many blue-chip companies _ including Wal-Mart, Kmart and NBC _ have
planted their Internet subsidiaries in the Bay Area, and Wall
Street firms are moving or hiring scores of technology analysts out
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a global phenomenon, but the Bay Area is
definitely one of the leading if not the leading locations'' for
Internet activity, says Peter Doyle, manager of the Internet Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Yet New York City is home to more Internet funds _ nine,
including five run by Doyle's company _ than anywhere else. They're
also managed out of unlikely places like Atlanta, Tampa, Houston,
Cincinnati and Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest and biggest, Munder NetNet, is based in Birmingham,
Mich., although it has just hired one person for a new Bay Area
office and plans to add a few more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of fund families reside east of the
Mississippi,'' explains Geoff Bobroff, a mutual fund consultant in
East Greenwich, R.I. ``The natural inclination is to put your
portfolio manager in your home office. This makes sense from the
standpoint of compliance and control.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it make sense from an investment standpoint?
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to say. Of the 23 Net funds listed on page D9,
only four are older than 12 months and six were started this year.
None are doing as well as they were a few weeks ago, and that could
squelch another 10 Internet funds in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Some Net-fund managers say where they work doesn't matter,
because the Internet makes the same information available
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But most Internet companies don't have any earnings. And that
makes quantitative, computer-based analysis less important, and
fundamental research _ especially field trips _ more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think you have to be really close to your companies to
understand their businesses,'' says Mitch Rubin, manager of New
York's -based  &LR; Baron iOpportunity fund. ``I come to the West Coast
at least once a week. But there are also tremendous pockets of
Internet companies in and around Boston, Washington, D.C., and
Silicon Alley in New York. Do you have to be in Silicon Valley to
be a good tech investor? I don't think so. But you have to be out
there regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   If visiting the Bay Area is good, then living here is even
better, according to local Net-fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the home-field advantage,'' says Kevin Landis, manager
of the Firsthand e-Commerce fund, in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Landis hires only investment people who have engineering or
technical experience, and most of them grew up in Silicon Valley.
If they have a question about a company, they don't have to rely on
the word of the CEO. They call their friends, family and former
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Callinan, manager of the RS Internet Age fund in San
Francisco, says that ``being here gives us an advantage. We can
network with people at the sandlot games. And we can sniff out a
hype faster than East Coast people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also easier to do ``due diligence on CEOs,'' Callinan says.
``All the personalities out here are recycled.''
</P>
<P>
   Lise Buyer has seen the situation from both sides. She used to
be a buy-side analyst with the T. Rowe Price Science and Technology
fund, in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's a sell-side analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston in
Palo Alto. ``The information you pick up at the dry cleaner,
Saturday soccer practices and the grocery aisle is arguably as
valuable as what you read on the tape,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when she was with T. Rowe Price, ``I spent my
life on airplanes. We had almost as much access (as local fund
managers) to company management, but we had a clearer perspective
on the rate at which the rest of the world was adopting new
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Houlton, manager of the Strong Internet fund in Milwaukee,
is about as far from the madding crowd as you can get. ``In some
ways it's a disadvantage. I'm not in the tight buzz of the
Valley,'' he says. ``But a lot of that can be noise. If one-fourth
is useful, and three-fourths is noise, is that a net positive?''
</P>
<P>
   Some out-of-town fund managers say it's better to be closer to
customers than to companies they invest in. ``Ninety-five percent
of our shareholders are in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky,'' says Lee
Mazler, who manages the tiny ($2 million in assets) Analysts
Internet.fund cq &LR;  in Cincinnati. Because his customers are a tad
conservative, he keeps the fund well-diversified and focused on
bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Sears, manager of the Investors Capital Internet fund in
Lynnfield, Mass., says he could work anywhere because his
quantitative fund invests only in companies that have earnings.
``We don't do IPOs or dot-coms. And we only invest in companies
whose data is readily available through public forums,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   David Alger, manager of the Enterprise Internet fund in New
York, takes an opposite approach. ``We do fundamental bottom-up
analysis,'' he says. This might be hard to do in the Midwest, ``but
if you're in New York, every company you follow will come through
at least once a year,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he adds, ``it's not important for us to be incredibly
early on new technologies. By the time companies become public,
we're pretty much on top of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, where a fund is based is much less important than
what happens to Internet stocks overall. If tech stocks continue to
slide, these funds could get creamed, no matter how many CEOs the
manager takes to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   That's why any money you have in Internet funds _ probably the
riskiest, least diversified investment going _ should be money you
can afford to lose.

GOOD BUILDINGS, AND GOOD FOR YOU  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Ten Shades of Green,'' the new architecture show at
the Urban Center, should not just be seen. It should be enacted
into law. All those pols who march on St. Patrick's Day each year
would perform a public service by lining up for this Green parade.
Especially if non-attendance were construed as a tacit attack on
the right to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of the show is sustainable architecture,
energy-efficient buildings that reduce air pollutants and cut
dependence on fossil fuel. Buildings produce half of all greenhouse
gases, the chemicals that are thought to cause global warming.
Global warming is an imminent problem, not a distant one.
</P>
<P>
   In Great Britain, engineers are designing sea walls to surround
nuclear reactors, in anticipation of the day the icecaps melt. In
Bangladesh, the flood levels. ...
</P>
<P>
   But it is depressing and probably futile to introduce this
compelling show with the sort of alarm bells that Americans long
ago learned to tune out. Perhaps it would be more productive to say
that ``Ten Shades of Green'' presents the 10 Most Beautiful recent
European buildings, that it includes work by Famous Architects and
a handful of Hot Young Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a miniature village of Fabulous Beach Bungalows for
exotic South Pacific living, and an indoor, palm-lined Promenade
des Anglais that allows German students to bask in a balmy Riviera
climate.
</P>
<P>
   All this is true. And it does not distort the message to say
that the 10 projects are packed with style. Organized by the
Architecture League, with Peter Buchanan as guest curator, the show
sets out to demonstrate that environmental priorities are not
antagonistic to the highest aesthetic standards, as they are often
presumed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I would not think of watching a network TV show
about global warming unless Leonardo DiCaprio was the guest host.
He knows how important it is to look your best on sinking ships.
The projects presented in ``Ten Shades of Green'' may be no more
than lifeboats. But they're fine-looking lifeboats, every one.
</P>
<P>
   Success in architecture, as in television, is mainly a matter of
getting other people to show up. Green design is concerned as much
with the comfort of a building's inhabitants as with the state of
the ozone layer. In corporate and commercial buildings, physical
and psychological comfort can translate into slower turnover rates
and less absenteeism among employees.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to move into the Commerzbank headquarters in
Frankfurt, Europe's tallest skyscraper, designed by Norman Foster.
A three-sided tower with a hollow core, the building features a
series of triangular sky gardens that spiral around the building
vertically at four-story intervals. Handsomely landscaped and
furnished, illuminated with natural light, they are refreshing
spaces to gaze upon as well as relaxing oases to visit.
</P>
<P>
   The project makes several key points about the design process.
Green architecture demands close collaboration between architects
and engineers. You don't hire an architect to make a shape and then
retain an engineer to prop it up. A building's environmental
components are not bolted-on attachments, like off-the-peg solar
collectors or windmills on stilts. They are designed for particular
climate conditions and client needs.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture, accordingly, is not just a decorative skin to be
draped over an armature devised by developers and space planners.
It is a process of integrating aesthetic, structural, social and
environmental factors into an organic whole. The integrity of
architecture is the most valuable lesson ``Ten Shades of Green''
has to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy is pure delight,'' William Blake believed.
Energy-efficient buildings can be completely radiant, too. The
Beyeler Museum, in Basel, Switzerland, designed by Renzo Piano, has
been acclaimed for the classical serenity of its design, but it is
also an efficient green machine. Perforated metal panels and a
translucent glass roof modulate light in the galleries. They also
create a thermal buffer that reduces fluctuations in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The Gotz headquarters in Wurzburg, Germany (Webler und Geissler
Architekten), and the Mont-Cenis Training Center in Herne-Sodingen,
Germany (Jourda et Perraudin Architectes, and Hegger Hegger
Schleiff), are rigorously delightful essays in neo-classical style.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch firm Neutelings Riedijk Architekten holds up the
Surrealist shade of green. Its Minnaert Building in Utrecht, which
houses a university geophysics department, is a warm, fuzzy
structure in which Teletubbies would feel at home. From outside,
the laboratory building appears to be molded from Jell-O chocolate
pudding, an effect created by spraying the exterior walls with the
concrete insulation usually concealed behind them. At the corner
entrance, the name is spelled out in giant steel letters that
provide structural support.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnaert Building is another instance in which architecture
is used to aestheticize infrastructure. Rainwater, collected on the
roof, drips into a pool in the building's central hall, a dramatic
interior with bright red booths for seating carved into drab
concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, the building is cooled by pumping the rainwater onto
the roof and letting it circulate through the floors on its way
back to the pool. In winter, it is warmed by heat generated by
computer equipment in the labs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cotton Tree Pilot Housing complex in Queensland, Australia,
is the most romantically utopian project on view. It is a mix of
private houses and low-income rental units within walking distance
of the local beach. These buildings have sand in their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The site plan organizes the units in a series of transitions
from public to semi-public to private space. Balconies, windows and
a communal garden extend the transitions vertically. Overhanging
roofs create shade from the subtropical sun and capture breezes
that circulate between walls and through stairwells. The breezes
also seem to have a deforming effect on the roofs, which are
slightly askew and fitted with tilted drain pipes. The effect lies
somewhere between shantytown and Club Mediterranee.
</P>
<P>
   The most utopian aspect of this project is its atmosphere of
social and spatial informality. It picks up on the direction in
which American architects were headed in the postwar years, when
California's Case Study Houses, designed by Charles and Ray Eames
and others, wove spare, modern design into the West Coast
landscape. Today, Americans are lightening up their office
wardrobes but want to live in ponderous remakes of period-style
houses. Why should the Australians run away with a style of living
that began with Frank Lloyd Wright?
</P>
<P>
   Remember the long lines of cars at gas stations in the '70s?
Even with the latest round of threats from OPEC, many Americans may
find it difficult to recall these events. But for Europeans it was
a different story. They couldn't afford to forget the high cost of
oil dependence. That's why European architects have been practicing
energy-efficient design for a generation. Gas guzzling wasn't an
option.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have allowed themselves two choices: plugging in or
checking out; the power grid or the Unabomber shack. Bill McKibben
called ours ``The Age of Missing Information'' because the media
deprive us of the contact with nature that was once taken for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ten Shades of Green,'' which continues at the Urban
Center, in Manhattan, through May 13, supplies information that
could help break down this dichotomy between rural isolation and
urban artifice. Whether Americans want to hear it is another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest resistance to green design comes from architects
themselves. With a few exceptions, like the Croxton Collaborative,
architects are unfamiliar with environmental technology and have
formed few durable alliances with engineers who practice it. They
are in no position to educate their clients, who incorrectly assume
that green design must cost more green. All those sky gardens
taking up rentable space. Those attractive sun screens requiring
constant maintenance. Add high-end design, and the prospect can
appear suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   Things are even worse in architecture schools, where green
design is routinely demonized. The epithet ``eco-fascist'' is
occasionally heard, usually spoken by academics who fear that their
authority will be undermined by exposure to information they
haven't bothered to learn. Scholarly papers are devoted to proving
that nature is a cultural construct, which no doubt it is.
Retribution is often meted out to the frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Ten Shades of Green'' makes clear is that sustainable
design can help advance the causes many architects have been
working toward on a formal and philosophical level. For one thing,
green design makes it impossible to equate architecture with
building skins. It discourages the practice of mistaking exterior
decoration for architecture that deals with wholes. Exterior
decoration can be as wonderful as the interior kind, but you can
get too much of a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Further, at a time when many architects are preoccupied by the
idea of tradition, green design offers an opportunity to extend
historical awareness beyond the use of reassuring images to evoke
the past. Throughout history builders have used sophisticated if
low-tech methods to control heat, ventilation, light and other
factors affecting human comfort. The show includes several
residential designs that draw on local vernacular to enhance their
quotient of green.
</P>
<P>
   But it is on the philosophical plane that the meaning of these
10 projects resides. They should be seen as paths that extend
contemporary interest in the interplay between subjective
perception and objective reality. Nature, in these buildings, is
simultaneously ``out there'' and ``in here.'' It is not held at bay
by walls, any more than perception is confined within the membrane
of the skin. The metaphoric and material realms merge in this
exhibition. It contemplates the physiognomy of breath.

 _ SF CHRON  
 A World of Pasta-bility  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Two years ago, San Francisco's Pasta Pomodoro was on the verge of
boiling over.
<P>
   The chain of moderate-priced Italian eateries had grown from a
single, tiny North Beach location to eight neighborhood restaurants
in just three years. It doubled in size, from four to eight
locations, in just 12 months during 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The first four Pasta Pomodoros were so successful, ``We thought,
`This is easy. Let's speed it up,''' recounted Adriano Paganini,
the company's 33-year-old founder. ``It's that invincible syndrome
that's so dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Milan-born Paganini, who has been working in
restaurants since he was 17, presides over a successful, 12-outlet
chain that generated about $15 million in sales last year and is
poised to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Paganini expects to finalize Pasta Pomodoro's first
round of venture funding. In the next four years, he plans for
Pasta Pomodoro to grow to 60 restaurants, including its first
locations outside the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adriano is a great chef and a very savvy businessman, and
that's a rare combination,'' said Mark Saltzgaber, a principal with
Dorsett Capital, a San Francisco venture firm that will invest
between $3 million and $7 million in Pasta Pomodoro.
</P>
<P>
   Paganini ``doesn't sacrifice anything when it comes to the food,
but he's created a concept that allows him to (keep prices low),''
Saltzgaber said. ``I think Adriano has created an unmatched
price-value equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples from the current menu include spaghetti with mussels,
scallops, calamari and roasted garlic in white wine sauce ($7.75)
and shell pasta with grilled radicchio, Gorgonzola and pine nuts
($6.95).
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants, which are intimate, averaging 2,000 to 2,500
square feet, tend to be located in neighborhoods rather than in
suburban shopping complexes.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts credit Paganini for attaining a combination of
good food quality and low prices that stands out in a sea of
unremarkable chains.
</P>
<P>
   `It's a very, very tight concept,'' said Pete Mattson of Mattson
&AMP; Co., a restaurant consultancy in Foster City. ``All the (venture
capital) guys have been sniffing around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paganini, the former executive chef at San Francisco's Donatello
restaurant, is the first to admit that today's success comes after
several touch-and-go years.
</P>
<P>
   Paganini opened the first Pasta Pomodoro in 1994 in North Beach
with his then-wife, Deborah Blum. (The couple have has &LR;   &LR; since
divorced.) They also owned the nearby Cafe Adriano; Paganini would
run back and forth between the two kitchens cooking dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not really have a clue what we were doing,'' Paganini
said. ``We just sort of did it.''
</P>
<P>
   They hit their first major bump six months later, in January
1995, when the second Pasta Pomodoro opened on Union Street. Unlike
the first location, the second took a few months to attract a
following, leaving the young restaurateurs financially squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the word `cash flow,' but I learned that concept
very quickly,'' Paganini said. The Union Street location stabilized
after a few months, and his thoughts again turned to expansion.
once again. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Still winging it, Paganini opened six more Pasta Pomodoros and
then found the company teetering. ``On paper, we were generating a
lot of cash, but the bottom line (profit) was getting thinner and
thinner,'' Paganini said. ``The whole operation was shaky.''
</P>
<P>
   Paganini realized that he couldn't run eight restaurants in the
same seat-of-the pants way he had run one, or even four. He began
to slow down the openings, manage his money more carefully and
build a team to help train employees and manage the business. He
closed one underperforming location in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Paganini also gave Pasta Pomodoro a face-lift, renovating its
interiors with a more sophisticated look. Recently, he revamped the
menu, adding slightly pricier dishes such as brasato _ braised beef
and pasta served in a red wine and porcini mushroom sauce ($8.95).
Rotisserie chicken is also being introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Pasta Pomodoro's transformation is nearly complete,
readying the company for its next stage of growth. Paganini expects
to open the first South Bay restaurant this fall in an
as-yet-undetermined location.
</P>
<P>
   A second Marin County Pasta Pomodoro (the first is in San
Rafael) will open this summer in Mill Valley. A San Ramon outlet
will be added to the company's existing East Bay locations in Union
City and in Oakland's Rockridge neighborhood. The other nine Pasta
Pomodoros are in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of next year, Pasta Pomodoro plans to expand
into its first market outside the Bay Area, either Los Angeles,
Denver or Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   As it grows, Pasta Pomodoro faces the challenge of maintaining
its quality. This is the struggle for every restaurant, but it is
particularly difficult during times of rapid growth, industry
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been pretty highly thought of around the Bay Area, but
it's easy to lose it if you're not careful,'' noted Mattson. In
recent years, such well-known chains as Taco Bell and Olive Garden
have undertaken quality initiatives after losing their focus.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta Pomodoro's chances of success are ``pretty good'' if it is
able to maintain its current standards, Mattson said. ``Pasta is
perceived as healthy, it's contemporary and people love Italian
food.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that pasta is inexpensive _ only 45 to 50
cents a pound wholesale, according to Mattson. Saltzgaber said
Pasta Pomodoro's return on investment of 30 percent is on par with
successful chains like the Cheesecake Factory.
</P>
<P>
   For Pasta Pomodoro, volume is the primary key to keeping prices
low. For example, its 1,200-square-foot Castro location serves up
to 500 people a day _ two to three times the number of most
restaurants of that size, according to Paganini.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta Pomodoro's recipes, most of which Paganini develops
himself, are ``simplified to the maximum'' and tested repeatedly to
ensure they can be re-created quickly, on a large scale , &LR; and with
consistently high quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the current menu, Paganini started six months ago with 200
entree ideas and wound up with a total of seven new dishes. ``If
you're really organized, it's quicker to make a pasta than to make
a sandwich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paganini, who has worked as a chef in England, France and Italy
as well as San Francisco, also uses tricks to make his dishes seem
seems  &LR; fresher, such as adding diced fresh tomatoes to the
signature pomodoro sauce and sprinkling dishes with fresh, chopped
basil.
</P>
<P>
   To get diners their dinners as quickly as possible, Paganini has
organized his kitchens into super-efficient stations. Near the
stove top are refrigerated drawers holding ingredients like chopped
eggplant, scallops and partially cooked pasta.
</P>
<P>
   When an order comes in, a line chef pops the pasta into a
special pasta cooker that is made in Italy. Then the chef _ usually
there are two per restaurant, each manning four to six burners _
reaches into pulls from  &LR; the drawers and nearby containers to
assemble the sauce ingredients, which are heated in a pan and
tossed with the pasta before serving.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is hardly lacking in restaurants, but the good
news for Pasta Pomodoro is that Americans are spending more on
eating out. In 1999, restaurant sales rose 5 percent, to $252.6
billion, and another 5 percent increase is expected this year,
according to the National Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   Paganini notes that despite fierce competition in San Francisco,
nine Pasta Pomodoros are thriving in the city.

CHARGING FRAUD, PERU CHALLENGER DEMANDS RUNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) 
By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ President Alberto K. Fujimori's principal opponent,
Alejandro Toledo, said on Tuesday that he would not accept anything
short of a runoff after a first round that election monitors have
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   And Toledo insisted he would take part in a second round only if
the electoral agencies were revamped. The first round, which
Fujimori is on the brink of winning, provoked charges of fraud from
election monitors and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said on
Tuesday that the United States would raise ``serious questions'' if
Peru did not hold a second round of voting. ``We expect there will
be a runoff, and I think serious questions will be raised if the
vote count indicated something otherwise,'' Lockhart said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With 90.8 percent of the official vote count complete, the
central election authority reported on Tuesday evening that
Fujimori had won 49.8 per to Toledo's 40.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate needs 50 percent plus one vote to avert a runoff.
The latest count actually showed a slight decrease in Fujimori's
percentage from tallies earlier in the day, but it could climb
again as ballots come in from remote jungle and Andean villages
where the president is strongly supported by Indian voters.
International election observers also say that election controls
were least stringent in such areas.
</P>
<P>
   The government said final results would be made public on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who is running for a third five-year term, has denied
that anything but minimal irregularities took place, and said he
would resist suggestions by the Clinton administration, several
European governments and Peru's congressionally appointed ombudsman
that a second round vote be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to accept the will of the Peruvian people,''
Fujimori told reporters on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States and several Peruvian and
international election monitoring and polling groups reported that
quick counts of sample vote tally sheets on Sunday night indicated
that Fujimori fell at least two percentage points short of a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls of people leaving the voting sites actually had
Toledo, a business school professor, ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Organization of American States observation team
has criticized long and unexplained delays in the delivery of
ballots and tally sheets to computer centers, and he said monitors
could not determine where the counts were taking place.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports that on some ballots the names of rivals
to Fujimori were waxed over so that only his name could be marked,
that in some cases ballots had been printed without Toledo's
photograph, and that some ballots were pre-marked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, election authorities completed their count by midnight
of election day and released total unofficial results the next day.
In that election Fujimori vanquished several opponents with almost
two-thirds of the official count.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Peruvian election officials said they would deliver a
reliable total vote count, if not the absolutely official count,
within 24 hours of the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said he did not think the
slight decrease in Fujimori's vote percentage necessarily meant
that the government was shifting toward favoring a second-round
vote after all. ``We're doing a lot of work but I don't know if it
is doing any good or not,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Toledo, 54, said he would lead peaceful
demonstrations across Peru. But he also reached out to the
military, appealing to it not to take part in election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``we need a change of chef and waiters'' among
election authorities, he also demanded that he be allowed the equal
access to television networks that he had been denied in the
first-round campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing his words carefully, Toledo appealed to the people to
remain calm, adding, ``I am not going to be responsible for putting
fuel on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's calls for protests came as tens of thousands of
demonstrators gathered in Lima, Iquitos, Arequipa and several other
cities, blocking traffic, honking car horns and picketing
government facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The police stepped up patrols of the cities with armored trucks
mounted with water canon. Army and police units around the
presidential palace were reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to invoke the pride of the Peruvian armed forces so
that they resist the pressures they are now under to block the will
of the people,'' Toledo told a throng of thousands of people who
gathered in downtown Lima on Tuesday afternoon,
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside five other opposition presidential candidates,
he added, ``I call on all Peru to mobilize peacefully so they will
hear our voices.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Toledo replaced the faded jeans and red bandanna he has worn the
last few days with a dark suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   He provocatively suggested that there was a growing level of
discontent over the election process in the armed forces, which
remain a political force in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know I can't reveal,'' he said. Then directing his
remarks to the armed forces, he said: ``I am asking that they not
be pressured to continue breaking the rules. I ask that they not
participate more in the polarization among Peruvians.''
</P>
<P>
   A restructuring of the military command late last year put
allies of Fujimori's intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, in
all the top assignments in the Defense Ministry and in regional
headquarters. But many junior officers, spurred on by retired
senior officers, are said to be upset with the way the election was
handled and the way promotions in the military now depend on
political connections to Fujimori and his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a chorus of criticism by former officers has been Peru's
last military dictator, Francisco Morales Bermudez, who ruled in
the late 1970s. In an interview with the newspaper El Comercio,
published on Tuesday, he was quoted as saying: ``This is the most
fraudulent and aberrant election process in our national history.
Toledo was really the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the campaign, Toledo appealed for support among the army
and police, promising to raise salaries and give soldiers the right
to vote. Aides to Toledo said he was in contact with influential
officers in the army, but they did not disclose the content of the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has never held high government office. His political
party, Peru Posible, is little more than a civic group and does not
have a strong organization. But in his surprising surge in the
final weeks of the campaign, he connected strongly with
working-class urban voters, millions of whom are of mixed Indian
and Latino ancestry like him. He attracted large crowds in the
campaign, even though he did not have the money to offer supporters
food or transportation as is customary in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a bricklayer and fishmonger, he shined shoes as a boy
and won scholarships that enabled him to earn two master's degrees
and a doctorate in the United States. He has promised to be ``the
president of the poor'' even while offering a centrist platform.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo has been criticized for leading tens of thousands of
people on the presidential palace Sunday night before more than a
few official results were even counted. Protesters set bonfires and
some businesses were vandalized.

SAUDI ARABIA TO EASE RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs throughout for additional details and some editing
changes) 
By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Eager to demonstrate a new economic openness that
could help its bid to join the World Trade Organization and expand
private business, Saudi Arabia announced a new law Tuesday that
would permit foreigners to own their investments and property in
the country without a Saudi partner.
</P>
<P>
   The law, approved Monday, also promises to strengthen judicial
protection for investments, foster greater public disclosure in
financial dealings and lower corporate taxes on foreign companies
with profits that exceed 100,000 rials a year, or about $26,000,
the official Saudi Press Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The easing of restrictions on foreign investors has been under
discussion for some time, but it increased in the last six months
after King Fahd told the country that it could not ignore the trend
toward globalization and free markets. The new investment code is
being supported by Crown Prince Abdullah, who has taken on a wide
role in the nation's affairs from his ailing brother, Fahd.
</P>
<P>
   Hashem Yamani, the industry and electricity minister, said in a
statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency that ``this law aims to
improve the investment environment in the kingdom, remove existing
obstacles, improve efficiency and ensure flexibility,''
</P>
<P>
   Yamani's ministry now licenses most direct foreign investment,
but investors in some projects have sometimes had to apply to
several ministries.
</P>
<P>
   The new law would set up a single agency to consider investment
projects and reduce bureaucratic delays. The agency would be
required to act within 30 days on proposals from foreigners, who
would now have the right to appeal its decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For more than four years, Saudi Arabia, a famously insular
country, has been negotiating for entry into the WTO, the
Geneva-based group that makes the rules for global commerce.
Membership in the organization improves a nation's ability to
export goods and services. The Saudi Arabian application for
membership has been hindered by the laws, regulations and
traditions that favor Saudis, impose high tariffs and subsidize
exports like petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, foreign investors in the country needed a Saudi
national in order to do business _ first as a sponsor in order to
obtain a work visa and then as a majority partner in any project.
Foreigners were allowed to hold a maximum stake in any business of
49 percent and could not own property, or engage in distribution or
internal commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A common method for members of the country's extended royal
family to gain extra income has been to act as a paid sponsor for
foreigners, who must relinquish their passports to the sponsor
while in the country,
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, most gulf nations have searched for ways
to diversify their economies and wean themselves away from
near-total dependence on oil revenue, a quest that took on new
urgency when world oil prices fell sharply a few years ago. The
Saudis, too, tried to branch out.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at enormous cost, Saudi Arabia became a major wheat
exporter by investing in agriculture as part of a plan to become
self-sufficient in food. But up to 85 percent of its export
earnings and about 40 percent of its gross domestic product still
come from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment is now centered on oil-related industries
like petrochemicals, and the Saudis are expected to maintain a
government monopoly on exploration and development. But
representatives of 10 oil companies have been invited to Riyadh,
the capital, later this month to discuss proposals for investing in
other areas of the oil industry.

 &HT;    Florida spring training bill advances
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Tax breaks designed to keep Major League
Baseball teams from moving their spring training homes out of
Florida got another boost Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House Finance and Taxation Committee unanimously approved a
$2.5 million annual sales tax rebate. The bill, which has already
been endorsed by two other legislative committees, has one
committee stop in each chamber before a full vote.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is designed to help up to five spring training cities,
including Vero Beach, retain teams that have been courted by
Arizona and Las Vegas. It is expected to cost $75 million over 30
years.

   Last year, Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed a bill that would have given the
Vero Beach Dodgers $7.5 million over two years. And this month,
Bush said he would not support a tax on cruise passengers designed
to pay for a $400 million stadium for the Florida Marlins regular
season home games.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charles Sembler (R-Sebastian) said he worked with the
governor's office in crafting the spring training bill this year
and expects his support.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sets up eligibility and relies on the Office of
Tourism, Trade and Economic Development to hand out the money.

 &HT;    Florida lawyer's record impressive
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're going up against a corporate Goliath like
Coca-Cola Co., some observers say Willie Gary might be a guy you'd
want at your side.
</P>
<P>
   The flamboyant Florida lawyer rose from migrant farm worker's
son to multimillionaire by winning civil verdicts of up to $500
million against large companies on the behalf of accident victims,
patients and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, 52, is described as a crack litigator who uses the lilting
delivery and simple, parablelike phrases of a country preacher to
make his points. He's expected to rely on those techniques in
representing several of the plaintiffs in the racial discrimination
case against Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   He won his first personal injury case in 1975, a year after he
started his firm in Stuart, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Since that $250,000 verdict, he's built a firm with about two
dozen lawyers and a hefty list of victories and multimillion-dollar
settlements. They include a 1985 confidential settlement reportedly
in the $50 million range from Florida Power &AMP; Light for the
accidental electrocution deaths of seven members of a Florida
family.
</P>
<P>
   Gary's biggest win so far is a $500 million verdict in 1995
against funeral home operator Loewen Group. With the verdict in
hand, he negotiated a $175 million settlement on behalf of his
client, a Mississippi funeral home operator who claimed the
Canadian company tried to drive him out of business.
</P>
<P>
   While known for representing plaintiffs in personal injury,
malpractice and breach-of-contract cases, he has had a few
corporate clients. Forbes magazine reported last year that he
represented Flo-Sun Inc. in a class-action wage dispute involving
20,000 migrant farm workers from the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary has also been the subject of investigations over
alleged rules violations since 1993, according to the Florida Bar
Association. The group said he was admonished by its grievance
committee in 1993 and by the Florida Supreme Court in 1994 for
rules violations. Two other inquiries by the bar association into
alleged rules violations were closed last year without action, the
bar association said.
</P>
<P>
   Various profiles paint the picture of a indomitable, 5-foot-8
fighter who has given a share of his wealth to those who helped him
or with whom he shared a bond.
</P>
<P>
   Born the sixth of 11 children a few years after World War II,
Gary said he spent much of his school-age days cutting sugar cane
under the Central Florida sun. In 1967, he talked his way into a
football scholarship at Shaw University, a traditionally black
school in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to law school, despite suffering from dyslexia,
a disorder that makes reading difficult. He still relies on
associates to do most of his legal research and exhaustively
rehearses and prepares before trials using notes printed with large
type.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Gary has amassed enough trappings of wealth _
including a $10 million mansion, luxury cars and extensive real
estate holdings _ to be featured on Robin Leach's ``Lifestyles of
the Rich and Famous.'' He flies around in a Gulfstream jet
emblazoned with his signature and sporting the name ``Wings of
Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Gary donated $10 million to Shaw University.
He has made other contributions to help support disadvantaged
children and migrant workers, including co-founding an educational
foundation in 1998 with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and boxer Evander
Holyfield. Gary is a legal adviser to Jackson and has helped raise
funds for the civil rights activist's RainbowPush Coalition.
Jackson recently has taken a higher profile in the case against
Coca-Cola, calling on the company to settle the suit quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gary spokeswoman Lori Metoyer Brown said the attorney also is
part owner
</P>
<P>
   of Atlanta-based Major Broadcasting Corp. Other part owners in
the cable TV network include Holyfield, former major-league
baseball player Cecil Fielder and Marlon Jackson, brother of singer
Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a network that promotes family values,'' Brown said.

 &HT;    Profiles of plaintiffs opposing Coke
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The movement of three of the eight plaintiffs to new
legal representation in the racial discrimination case against
Coca-Cola creates two legal teams now battling the Atlanta-based
soft drink company.
</P>
<P>
   One group will now be represented by Florida attorney Willie
Gary of the law firm Gary, Williams, Parenti, Finney, Lewis,
McManus, Watson &AMP; Sperando. Those plaintiffs include Motisola
Malikha Abdallah and Gregory Allen Clark, two of the original four
plaintiffs in the case, and Ajibola Laosebikan, one of four
plaintiffs added in December.
</P>
<P>
   The other group of plaintiffs will continue to be represented by
attorney Cyrus Mehri and his law firm Mehri, Malkin &AMP; Ross of
Washington; the Atlanta law firm of Bondurant, Mixson &AMP; Elmore; the
Marietta firm of DeVille, Milhollin &AMP; Voyles; and the newly added
Birmingham, Ala., firm of Gordon, Silberman, Wiggins &AMP; Childs. The
plaintiffs in this group include Linda Ingram and Kimberly Gray
Orton, two of the original plaintiffs, and Elvenyia Barton-Gibson
and George Eddings Jr., the two others who were added to the case
in December.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Tuesday, there was a dispute about which legal team
represented plaintiff Wanda Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at each of the plaintiffs and their allegations
against the company:
</P>
<P>
   MOTISOLA MALIKHA ABDALLAH
</P>
<P>
   Abdallah worked for Coca-Cola for more than three years as an
administrative assistant. She worked in strategic channel
marketing, a division that had only one other African-American
employee, the suit says. The suit says Abdallah had asked to be
promoted to a higher-paying grade level over a two-year period. In
1998, when she applied for her administrative assistant position,
she again asked if it could be upgraded to a higher grade. Her
request was refused, the suit says. Abdallah said her predecessor,
however, was given a higher pay grade. The suit also says managers
made Abdallah feel like their ``black maid.''
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY ALLEN CLARK
</P>
<P>
   Clark has been a security officer at Coca-Cola since 1996. The
suit says that despite his extensive education and experience, he
has been ``consistently denied promotional opportunities given to
his Caucasian counterparts.'' The suit says Clark has been turned
down for promotions in security despite past experience as a
security and correctional officer. During 1997, the suit says,
Clark applied for ``multiple jobs outside of security at Coca-Cola
and did not get interviews for any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   AJIBOLA LAOSEBIKAN
</P>
<P>
   A former information systems specialist, Laosebikan alleges that
he effectively went eight years without a promotion, while white
employees with less experience, education or seniority advanced
more rapidly than he did. He also alleges he was wrongfully
terminated in retaliation for making complaints about race
discrimination and after attending a hearing in the current case.
</P>
<P>
   WANDA WILLIAMS
</P>
<P>
   Williams is an assistant scientist who has been working at
Coca-Cola for about 15 years. She alleges that she has been denied
promotions because of her race. She also says she has been treated
differently from her white counterparts in performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   LINDA INGRAM
</P>
<P>
   Ingram began working at Coca-Cola in 1990 as a customer service
representative in Dunwoody. The suit said she was ``quickly
promoted'' to technical dispatch adviser and by 1993 was project
coordinator in the national accounts department, where she
performed data analysis. In 1995, she was promoted to senior
information analyst. But as a senior information analyst, the suit
says, Ingram has ``never been paid what her position merits'' and
is underpaid when compared with her white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   KIMBERLY GRAY ORTON
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the company in October 1998, Orton was a 13-year
veteran of Coca-Cola. She began in 1985 in a field sales position
and by 1992 was a manager of promotional packaging graphics for
Coca-Cola USA, supervising about 15 workers. In 1994, she moved to
Coca-Cola's corporate headquarters as a company director. The suit
says Orton was ``grossly underpaid'' for her work at the company,
earning ``tens of thousands'' less than her white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ELVENYIA BARTON-GIBSON
</P>
<P>
   Barton-Gibson, who has worked at Minute Maid since 1996, is
currently employed as an executive assistant to the chief marketing
officer. She alleges that she has been denied the chance to compete
for promotions. Barton-Gibson also alleges that eight other
African-American marketing professionals were terminated or left in
frustration over their inability to advance.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE EDDINGS JR.
</P>
<P>
   Eddings is a former Minute Maid employee who left the company in
1997 after he said he was denied a long-promised promotion. He had
worked for the company for five years, most recently as a category
development manager.

PEREZ FRUSTRATED WITH DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Carlos Perez hasn't exactly been left hanging,
but he is growing increasingly frustrated over his tenuous role
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   With ace Kevin Brown scheduled to on the 15-day disabled list,
manager Davey Johnson said he is ``leaning'' towards giving the
struggling Perez -- who was sent down to Triple-A Albuquerque on
Friday but remains with the club -- the start Thursday against the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   It's all but official Perez will be added back to the roster and
start, but he's yet to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is not going to make me crazy,'' Perez said.
``There are lots of places to go. I don't want to go anywhere, but
I'm getting tired of this b-------.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably don't trust my stuff. Then I don't want to be
here anymore. I don't want it to be like last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a dismal season (2-10, 7.43 ERA) and a rough first
start (4.2 innings, eight runs, five earned, seven hits) this year,
Perez is not going to attract much interest -- he has two years and
$12.6 million left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager said Perez was being given a
``reprieve'' with a second start.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for Carlos to step up and hopefully
turn a corner,'' Malone said. ``This is a positive reprieve, and
hopefully we'll get the results we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, however, thinks the Dodgers have reacted too quickly to
his lone start against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``One start?'' Perez said. ``They can't see anything. I don't
know what they're trying to do. If they want me to pitch, they'd
better let me alone and let me pitch my f------ game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will be looking for quick results in a second start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need him,'' he said. ``I need that depth. Clubs we face are
loaded with left-handed batters. But I need him to pitch like he
did a couple of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Malone: ``He knows where he's supposed to be -- he's
supposed to be one of our five starters. But we also have to win
games. If it means sending Carlos out to get more work, that's what
we'll do. We want to do whatever we can to get him back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   KARROS OUT: Gary Sheffield (sprained right ankle) made it into
the lineup, but Eric Karros (strained lower back) did not.
</P>
<P>
   Karros said his back knotted up during the team's lengthy wait
at Shea Stadium after Sunday's game was snowed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just locked up on me, while we sat around and waited,''
Karros said.
</P>
<P>
   Karros reported some slight progress Tuesday, but gave it the
day-to-day routine. He was still moving very stiffly after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's eased a little bit, but he's in no shape to play,''
Johnson said. ``He can't move or bend over.''
</P>
<P>
   Geronimo Berroa, normally an outfielder, started for Karros and
took his fifth spot in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Sheffield was at Pac Bell Park by 7:30 a.m. to
treat the ankle, but it wasn't certain he would start until game
time.
</P>
<P>
   TIDBITS: Johnson won't commit to whom he'll add to the rotation
for Saturday's start against the Reds, but said it would involve a
``young pitcher or two.'' Left-hander Jeff Williams was added to
the roster Tuesday to take the place of right-hander Gregg Olson
(strained forearm) and will likely start Saturday. If the Dodgers
call up a starter from Albuquerque, it is expected to be right-
hander Eric Gagne. ... Despite going to Los Angeles to have his
finger examined on Monday and the team returning there on Friday,
Brown joined the Dodgers in San Francisco on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS VS. GIANTS
</P>
<P>
   TIME: 7:05 p.m. at Pacific Bell Park
</P>
<P>
   TV/RADIO: Fox Sports Net 2, XTRA-1150 and KWKW-1330 (Spanish)
</P>
<P>
   STARTING PITCHERS: Darren Dreifort (0-1, 3.60 ERA) vs. Joe
Nathan (0-0, 1.29).
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS (4-3) UPDATE: With Kevin Brown out, the Dodgers are
again lookin g for a big outing from Dreifort. Eric Karros
(strained back) is also ex pected to remain out. Geroninmo Berroa
filled for Karros Tuesday, but Da ve Hansen will likely get the nod
against a right-hander. Kevin Elster h ad now scored at least one
run in all six of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   GIANTS (3-5) UPDATE: The Giants will take their second stab at
their fir st victory at their new $319-million ballpark. Barry
Bonds went down whe n he fouled a ball of his right foot in the
third, but remained in the g ame. No splash hits yet.

MOTOROLA SHARES PLUNGE ON CONCERN THAT GROWTH MAY BE SLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Shares of Motorola Inc. plummeted 17 percent Tuesday
over concerns that the company's growth could be slowed by
weaker-than-expected profits in its cellular telephone division.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of feasting on stellar sales and earnings
growth and an explosive runup in the company's stock price,
investors ran for the exits in droves Tuesday on news that
Motorola's second-quarter and full-year earnings would come in
below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff, which reduced the company's market value by $20
billion, came a day after Motorola said that first quarter sales
had jumped 19 percent and that its profit had more than doubled
from a year earlier, just exceeding analysts' projections.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also said that profitability was down in its
cellphone division largely because of a component shortage and
because its lower-cost handsets _ which yield lower profit margins
_ were selling better than its more expensive models, particularly
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock
Tuesday, and the stock fell $26, to $124 a share, in heavy trading.
Less than a month ago, shares of Motorola hit a record $184 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said they were worried that tighter margins in the
cellphone unit and stiff competition in lower to middle tier
cellular handset market could upset the company's noteworthy
turnaround in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's not obvious the margins will get meaningfully
better,'' said Todd Koffman, an analyst at Raymond James. ``It
seems the sweet spot of the market is the mass consumer market, and
that's not Motorola's bread and butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials, however, said they were baffled by the sharp
selloff, which came after an upbeat conference call in which top
executives said they were expecting profit of about 67 cents a
share in the second quarter and about $3.14 this year, up from an
earlier company estimate of $3.12 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surprised by the negative reaction to what we thought
was positive news,'' said Albert R. Brashear, a spokesman at
Motorola headquarters in Schaumburg, Ill., near Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street analysts had already been projecting earnings of
70 cents a share for the second quarter and about $3.18 a share for
this year. After the conference call Tuesday, several analysts cut
their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But some Wall Street experts said investors over-reacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly didn't justify the hit it took this morning,''
said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call/Thomson
Financial, which tracks analysts' estimates. ``It's the kind of
fickle market we're in. The littlest thing is a big hit to your
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   According to First Call, second-quarter Wall Street estimates
were revised downward Tuesday, but several analysts actually raised
their year-end projection to $3.20 a share on the strength of
Motorola's other businesses, including its semiconductor products
division.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the company said revenue was up nearly 20 percent to
$8.8 billion in the first quarter, but operating profit in the
cellular telephone unit fell to $49 million from $83 million a year
ago, partly because the company was paying a premium for some
components.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert W. Komer, a point man in the United States' star-crossed
campaign to win hearts and minds in Vietnam, died on Sunday after a
stroke. He was 78 and lived in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   During the war and after, Komer was known as Blowtorch Bob, a
name given to him by Henry Cabot Lodge, the American ambassador in
South Vietnam who had said (in so many words) that arguing with
Komer was like having a flamethrower aimed at the seat of one's
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Komer was indeed a man with a fierce mind behind a mild mien.
With his owlish eyeglasses and briar pipe and his 15 years at the
CIA, he came to President Kennedy's National Security Council in
1961 as the model of what the novelist John le Carre calls an
intellocrat.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where information is power, secret information
can be the means to great power. He wielded it like a weapon in
Vietnam, where his job was to help win the war without firing a
shot through a program known as pacification.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of pacification was that the war could not be won
solely with bombs and bullets. Control of the people of South
Vietnam would be won from the Communists of the north village by
village, hut by hut, by social and political means, with
information and propoganda and the selective use of force, by South
Vietnamese soldiers backed by American civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, as the battle intensified, he became President
Johnson's special assistant for Vietnam, in charge of the political
side of the war. He later told an interviewer that he had warned
Johnson that he had no experience in such matters. ``Well,'' the
president replied, ``maybe what we need is some fresh meat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he said,'' Komer recalled. ``Not fresh blood, but
fresh meat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Komer arrived in Saigon with the rank of ambassador and
the title of chief of pacification, on paper the No. 2 American
civilian in Vietnam, second only in rank to Ambassador Ellsworth
Bunker. He reinforced his reputation as a man with a
take-no-prisoners attitude, a deathless optimism that the war would
be won, and a near-religious faith in the power of facts and
statistics to help win it.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Johnson, John P. Roche, later noted that if Komer had
been asked how many Vietnamese had not been influenced by Vietcong
propaganda, he would have replied ``in 13 hours and 20 minutes''
with a top-secret cable for the president's eyes only,
``definitively stating: 2,634,201.11.''
</P>
<P>
   Komer's ``sensitive antennae were tuned to Johnson's desires,''
said a leading historian of the war, Stanley Karnow, and Komer
produced a steady stream of statistics-laden reports that supported
the Johnson's' vision of a light at the end of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, he stated with confidence that precisely 68
percent of South Vietnam's 17.4 million people were ``relatively
secure.'' In another, he said that as ``slow, painful and
incredibly expensive though it may be, we're beginning to `win' the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Working closely with William E. Colby, the top man for the CIA
in Vietnam, Komer led a village-by-village effort to win hearts and
minds. The pacification program evolved into a more tough-minded
project called Operation Phoenix. Conceived by the White House and
supported by the CIA, Phoenix sought to expose Vietcong agents who
were working in South Vietnam. Colby later testified that Phoenix
killed 20,587 Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1968, Johnson named Komer ambassador to Turkey. His
tenure was short. President Nixon took office in January 1969 and
replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   Komer then worked as a consultant with the Rand Corp., writing
classified studies on NATO and on the need for a rapid-deployment
force for the Persian Gulf, until the next Democratic
administration.
</P>
<P>
   He became undersecretary of defense for policy under President
Carter and put many of those ideas into effect. His staff presented
him with a bronzed blowtorch, a symbol of his past battles.
</P>
<P>
   Komer was born in Chicago. He graduated from Harvard in 1942,
served in the Army in World War II and, after having graduated from
the Harvard Graduate School of Business in 1947, joined the new
CIA. He became a senior intelligence analyst, peering into nations
from Morocco to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Pentagon and in the clear light of hindsight,
he waxed bittersweet about Vietnam. ``I would have done a lot of
things differently and been more cautious about getting us
involved,'' he said. He called the war ''a strategic disaster which
cost us 57,000 lives and a half trillion dollars.''
</P>

NBC MAKES RADIO DEAL WITH EX-CNN PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBC announced another deal with Lou Dobbs, the former
CNN financial executive and anchor on Tuesday, expanding their
relationship into radio in a collaboration with a syndicator of
programming, United Stations Radio Networks.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the latest in a partnership between Dobbs and NBC
that is widely expected to eventually bring him to NBC's
all-business news cable channel, CNBC. CNBC is the leading
competitor to CNNFN, the financial news network operated by CNN
that Dobbs once headed.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs left CNN last year after a dispute with the channel's news
management. Under the terms of his exit, he was forbidden to appear
on any other television outlet for the next three years. NBC has
pushed the boundaries of that agreement by using Dobbs as a regular
guest on its ``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC has also signaled its intention to be in business with
Dobbs whenever he is free to re-appear on television. The network
entered into a partnership with Dobbs last October for both a radio
program and a financial newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   And an NBC executive acknowledged that Tuesday's move was one
more way for NBC to establish its relationship with Dobbs. ``The
play here is, we're beginning to find holes in the mountain pass,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   CNN executives declined to comment on the latest announcement
about Dobbs and NBC, citing a previous statement which said that
CNN expected Dobbs to live up to his contractual agreement. So far,
one CNN executive said, nothing NBC has done with Dobbs seems to
have violated that agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs said on Tuesday that he expected both the radio show and
the newsletter to start up in July. He will appear three times a
day on a one-to two-minute feature called ``The Lou Dobbs/NBC
Financial Report.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be syndicated by the United Stations Radio Networks,
mainly to news, information and talk stations, said Nicholas J.
Verbitsky, the president of United Stations. The company said it
supplies programming to more than 2,600 stations.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he left CNN last year, Dobbs said his chief plan was
to start up a Web site called Space.com. That Web site is now in
operation, and Dobbs said it just raised $50 million in a second
round of capital financing.

 &HT;    Plaintiffs split in case against Coke
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a stunning development just as settlement talks
enter a critical stage, three of the eight plaintiffs in the racial
discrimination case against Coca-Cola have hired a new lawyer after
being dropped by the attorneys seeking class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much this will affect the settlement
negotiations now underway between the soft drink company and the
existing attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good sign _ plaintiff schism in the middle of the
settlement talks,'' said Lee Parks, a legal expert whose Atlanta
firm specializes in employment law. Parks also said it is unusual
for such a split to develop ``this late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs' attorneys already involved in the
settlement talks, Cyrus Mehri, said his legal team withdrew its
representation of the three plaintiffs because they were no longer
acting in the best interest of all members of a prospective class
of employees.
</P>
<P>
   As ``class representatives'' the plaintiffs are supposed to
focus on what is best for the 2,000 current and former black
employees they are seeking to represent. The schism may have been
caused by a disagreement over how a possible monetary settlement
would be divided between the suit's named plaintiffs and the
prospective class members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the right to pursue their individual claims,'' Mehri
said of the plaintiffs he no longer represents. ``The rest of us
have a unity of purpose to fight as hard as possible to achieve the
best possible settlement for the class.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola security guard Gregory Allen Clark, one of the
plaintiffs who left Mehri to retain prominent Florida attorney
Willie Gary, said the shift was made because ``we felt the need to
have at least one African-American lawyer on the team that's
representing approximately 2,000 African-American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri's team, however, recently brought on African-American
attorneys with the Birmingham, Ala., civil rights law firm Gordon,
Silberman, Wiggins &AMP; Childs.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Gary said the plaintiffs have ``suffered grave
injustices'' and that ``Coca-Cola is going to have to answer to the
people of this community.'' He is a trial lawyer who has won civil
verdicts of up to $500 million against large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's statement appears to indicate that Gary will be seeking
to represent the prospective class of employees. But that may be
hard for him to do, according to legal experts. That is because
Mehri's team is the one the federal judge in the case recognizes as
being the representative of the prospective class in settlement
talks. Gary has not been approved by the federal judge in the case,
and he may not be able to get court approval at this late date.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 52-year-old Florida attorney can represent individual
employees who are not attempting to represent the class. And if a
settlement is reached, legal experts said, Gary could be a magnet
for other employees who would rather go it alone in fighting the
company than agree to accept whatever terms are negotiated in the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, if too many employees opt out of a settlement, the
benefits of an agreement could be considerably diminished, legal
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary's representative, Lori Metoyer Brown, said Gary now
represents Clark, information systems specialist Ajibola Laosebikan
and former administrative assistant Motisola Malikha Abdallah.
Brown also said that Gary is representing assistant scientist Wanda
Williams. But Mehri said he has not been informed that Williams no
longer wants to be represented by his team.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
The company has denied the suit's allegations and opposed
plaintiffs' efforts to make it a class-action case.
</P>
<P>
   But, legal experts said, if a settlement is reached, it is
likely to include members of the class. The plaintiffs already have
submitted a detailed settlement proposal to the company.

LARRY LINVILLE, TV ACTOR WHO PLAYED OFFICIOUS MAJOR OF `MASH', DIES
AT 60 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Stars should be placed between letters of `MASH' throughout
story) 
By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Larry Linville, whose comically mendacious character
Maj. Frank Burns made other Army doctors' lives miserable for the
first five seasons of the long-running television hit ``MASH,''
died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
Manhattan. He was 60 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   His manager, Barry M. Greenberg, told The Associated Press that
Linville died of complications of pneumonia; he had part of a lung
removed in 1998 after a malignant tumor was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was one of the ``MASH'' regulars when the show began on
CBS in September 1972, and his officious, tattletale, whiny
personality quickly came to embody the hypocrisy, particularly that
of the military, that the show strove to satirize. After receiving
orders to report stateside, Burns was replaced by Maj. Charles
Emerson Winchester, a more serious character, not to mention a
better doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``MASH,'' at times with comedy and at times with sharp
commentary, detailed life at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical
Hospital. Its ensemble cast also included Alan Alda, Gary Burghoff,
Loretta Swit and Wayne Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The character played by Linville brought a slapstick exube2ance
to the show, which has been broadcast and re-broadcast for decades
around the world in scores of languages.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated adulterous rendezvous between Hot Lips Houlihan and
Frank Burns in her tent were legendary. Then there was the time
that Burns, variously known as ``Ferret Face'' or ``the Lipless
Wonder,'' encountered a group of Koreans learning English. They had
been taught to chant, ``Frank Burns eats worms!''
</P>
<P>
   As word about Linville's death reverberated around the many
Internet sites devoted to ``MASH,'' fans spoke of a deeper
resonance than the slapstick antics. On a British web page,
www.mash4077.co.uk., Christian Anderson wrote: ``In his role as
Frank Burns, Larry Linville was probably the least understood actor
on `MASH.' People equated his character with the person and thus
thought that since he played such an idiot he was therefore one as
well. In fact, to play such a role is doubly difficult and to make
it come off as well as Linville did was masterful.''
</P>
<P>
   Linville was a third-generation Californian born in Ojai, who
began a lifelong hobby of designing and flying gliders as a child.
He majored in engineering at the University of Colorado, where he
performed with a local civic theater group, starring in ``The Glass
Menagerie.'' He was one of three Americans among 300 applicants
selected for a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in
London.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to California, where he acted in repertory theater
for eight years. He played Iago in ``Othello'' in San Diego's
Shakespeare Festival and appeared with Ingrid Bergman in ``More
Stately Mansions'' in Los Angeles and on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   He had numerous roles on television shows ranging from ``Marcus
Welby, MD.'' to ``Bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``MASH,'' Linville was a guest star on many television
series and had roles in ``Grandpa Goes to Washington,'' ``Checking
In'' and ``Paper Dolls.'' Among his movies were ``Rock `n' Roll
High School Forever'' in 1990 and ``Fatal Pursuit'' in 1994. Along
with other members of the ``MASH'' cast, he appeared in television
commercials for IBM in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Linville, who is survived by his wife, Deborah, attended a
ceremony three years ago in South Korea at the closing of the
mobile hospital that inspired the television show and the novel and
movie that preceded it. He said it was humbling to think of the
real doctors who sometimes operated on more than 150 patients in a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like a plastic representation of the real people,'' he
said.

DEAL TO TRADE KEYSHAWN TO TAMPA BAY ON HOLD UNTIL WEDNESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: LEADS with 2 grafs with talks ending Tuesday without a deal;
Pickup 4th graf, According to ...; adds some optional material with
background on contract dispute.)  
By JUDY BATTISTA and MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiations between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the agent for
Keyshawn Johnson ended late Tuesday night without a final agreement
that would have led to a trade sending the All-Pro wide receiver to
Tampa Bay for the Buccaneers' two first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets, in the latest upheaval of their tumultuous
off-season, remained on the brink of completing a trade, with talks
between Jerome Stanley, the agent for Johnson, and Buccaneers
officials scheduled to resume Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   According to a National Football League official, the parameters
of the deal are intact. Johnson would receive a new long-term
contract that would pay him almost $7 million a year, and would
include a signing bonus of between $12 million and $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   The differences that remain are largely in the language of the
complicated deal, and the official said that no one left the
bargaining table angry. But the official said the deal could
collapse at any time.
</P>
<P>
   According to the league official, several teams tried to get in
on the deal within the last 48 hours, telling the Jets to hold off
on finalizing the trade until they could make offers. The Jets
declined, and the Bucs have a self-imposed deadline of Wednesday to
complete the deal with Johnson or end negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade _ which only one month ago seemed unfathomable _ is
made, the Jets would have four picks in the first round of the
draft, including their own (16th and 18th) and the Bucs' 13th and
27th. That would put them in position to either make a blockbuster
trade to move up to nab one of the draft's premier players, or to
stockpile young talent by using all four picks.
</P>
<P>
   But it means the Jets, handicapped by salary cap woes and
determined to avoid what seemed an increasingly likely holdout by
Johnson, would also be bereft of their best player and one of the
critical members of a team that was thought to be in position to
make a run at the Super Bowl next season.
</P>
<P>
   And if they dump their most visible star, the Jets will have
crafted a deal that will surely bewilder some Jets players and many
fans. Johnson has been a controversial figure from the start of his
career _ he held out for 24 days before his rookie season and wrote
a book critical of some of his teammates. But he is also a top
playmaker. Last season was his best as a pro, with 89 receptions
for 1,170 yards and eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The team's next most productive receiver was Wayne Chrebet, one
of the subjects of Johnson's rookie season ire, who had 48
receptions for 631 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's draft is generally regarded as having four premier
players: defensive lineman Courtney Brown, linebacker LaVar
Arrington, receiver Peter Warrick and offensive lineman Chris
Samuels. With four first-round picks the Jets could offer a package
to any of the teams holding the top four picks. But the Cleveland
Browns, who hold the No.1 pick, would likely demand at least three
of those picks to make a trade, the team's director of football
operations Dwight Clark has said. And the Redskins seem intent on
trying to grab Arrington and Samuels with their picks, No. 2 and
No. 3. The Bengals, with the No. 4 selection, have said they would
listen to offers to move down. The Baltimore Ravens at No. 5, have
entertained offers for their fifth overall pick. But Ravens Coach
Brian Billick wondered yesterday whether the Jets could offer
enough to pry the fifth pick from his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they'd have enough juice,'' Billick said. ``If
they were trying to go to the fifth, they'd give us the 13th and
they'd probably to have throw in one of those later ones and then a
fourth-round pick.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Jets Coach Al Groh indicated that the Jets might
be wary of pursuing a high draft pick because signing him might put
as much of a cramp on the salary cap in future years as
restructuring Johnson's deal would have. Instead, the Jets might
choose to use all four picks to fill numerous needs in an attempt
to continue what Groh called the ``success cycle'' without forcing
the team into future dire financial straits. In addition to trying
to acquire a receiver to replace Johnson in the receiver-deep
draft, the Jets need a tight end, a pass-rusher and help in the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson situation began just four weeks ago, when the Jets
began quietly talking to a handful of teams about trading him.
Johnson, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1996 draft, had made it
clear to the Jets that he was unhappy with his current contract,
which had two years remaining and which would have paid him about
$2 million, well below the current market value. The Jets told
Johnson that, with just a few million dollars remaining under the
$62.17 million salary cap, they were in no position to renegotiate
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has not attended the Jets' off-season conditioning
program and has made it clear that he would likely hold out during
training camp and perhaps for the start of the season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the Jets issued a surprising announcement: that
Johnson was off the trading block for the time being, but that they
would not renegotiate his contract. At the owners' meetings two
weeks ago, the Jets' owner, Robert Wood Johnson IV, made it clear
that he expected Johnson to abide by the deal he signed four years
ago and Groh infuriated Johnson by comparing his demands to a child
seeking an increased allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in a conference call with reporters, came close to
demanding a trade then, saying he was close to not wanting to play
for the Jets. And last week, in a predraft news conference, Groh
put Johnson back on the trading block, saying the Jets would listen
to offers this week. Late last week, the Jets gave the Bucs
permission to negotiate directly with Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Bucs General Manager Rich McKay flew to Los Angeles and spent
Friday and Saturday negotiating with Stanley. &QL;

ELSTER ANSWERS THE BELL FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 SPELLING OF RUETER-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- He was supposed to be back in Las Vegas,
building a bar and getting his second career underway, not spoiling
the Giants' little lovefest with their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there Kevin Elster was Tuesday, the all-time party spoiler,
rocketing three home runs to lead the Dodgers to a 6-5 victory over
the Giants in the debut of Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Elster was the last guy the Giants figured would add to their
long Dodgers misery, a No.8 hitter who sat out all of last season.
A 35-year-old shortstop who didn't decide to try one last swing at
the majors until January, getting a late non-roster invite with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Elster had never hit three home runs in a single game at any
professional level.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the third home run, I think I was the most shocked guy
in the ballpark,'' Elster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time was Little League.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster hit Pac Bell Park's first home run in the third off Kirk
Rueter, added a two-run shot off Rueter in the fifth and a final
solo shot off reliever Felix Rodriguez in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with four RBI, plenty of stunned looks among the
dotcom crowd of 40,920 and a new found appreciation for those in
early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a remarkable day,'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Elster had some help along the way -- Chan Ho Park pitched six
effective-enough innings to earn his second victory, Jeff Shaw
survived a shaky ninth to earn his second save, Geronimo Berroa
filled in for the injured Eric Karros at first with two hits and an
RBI, Devon White had three hits and Gary Sheffield shook off his
sore ankle to start in left.
</P>
<P>
   But the guy who left San Francisco weeping in its Brie and
sourdough was Elster. A guy released by the Rangers in the middle
of the 1998 season, who went home a career .228-hitter and figured
it was time to move past this baseball thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I was retired,'' Elster said.
</P>
<P>
   Elster returned to his home in Henderson, Nev. and started
making plans to build a bar off the Vegas strip. He lifted weights,
but stayed away from playing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Then he started to get that itch. Johnson had been his manager
while he was with the Mets. He was raised in Huntington Beach. He
saw the Dodgers trying to build a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a real nice, full circle,'' Elster said. ``When
I decided to come back and play for Davey, I didn't want to do it
unless I could contribute. A day like today makes me feel like I
can, and hopefully kick starts the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants actually started the scoring Tuesday when Barry Bonds
doubled in Bill Mueller. Elster's first home run in the third tied
it, but the Giants took back the lead on a Bonds' solo homer in the
bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Then Elster put the Dodgers on top for good with his two-run
homer in the fifth. Shawn Green's bloop RBI single gave L.A. a 4-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Park, the closest thing the Dodgers may have to a stopper with
Kevin Brown nursing a broken pinkie finger, allowed three runs in
six innings,surrendering one more run in the sixth a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho pitched well,'' Johnson said. ``He was consistent the
whole game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big key for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Berroa's RBI single in the sixth, Elster gave the Dodgers
one more run to work with when he drilled a 3-2 pitch from
Rodriguez out in the eighth for his third home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get production like that from the bottom of your order and
it helps everyone else relax,'' Sheffield said. ``We feel like we
don't have to do everything all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added home runs from Doug Mirabelli off Terry Adams
in the eighth and J.T. Snow off Shaw in the ninth, but there would
be no memorable comeback on the opening of their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants threw this really big party, but the unexpected guest
ruled the day.

 &HT;    ELIAN'S MIAMI FAMILY TO TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON FOR MEET WITH
FATHER
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Miami relatives of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez may travel to Washington D.C. Wednesday in hopes of
meeting with the boy's father, Cuban exile leaders said late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The last-ditch effort to keep the boy in the United States comes
as federal immigration officials are expected to send a letter to
the family _ also on Wednesday _ outlining the timetable for when
and where Elian will be handed over to be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Several media outlets reported late Tuesday that a draft of the
letter being prepared by U.S. Justice Department officials calls
for Elian to be brought to the U.S. Coast Guard Station at
Opa-Locka Airport a few miles north of downtown Miami on Thursday
at 10 a.m. (EST).
</P>
<P>
   Also late Tuesday, a Wednesday trip by U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno to Miami to meet with Elian's Miami relatives and local
officials was apparently called off, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
   The late developments come as the Miami relatives who want to
keep the boy in this country are clearly running out of options.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, offered to
meet with Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, at a South Florida
location. In a letter released to the media, Lazaro Gonzalez said
that a meeting between the family's adults could quickly be
followed by a meeting that would reunite Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has repeatedly said he would only take
custody of his son if there were no conditions attached by the
Miami relatives. He has also been reluctant to travel to South
Florida, saying that if he did, it would only be to pick up his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Jorge Mas Santos, of the Cuban American National
Foundation, announced at a Washington press conference that the
Miami relatives and Elian would meet alone with the boy's father on
Wednesday at a neutral location in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``After four and a half months, the private meeting that this
family has yearned for tomorrow will be a reality, `` Mas Santos
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the family members, the only people present at the
meeting will be Deputy U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Sen.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the family summit could resolve the months of bad
blood and anger that have built over the case remained to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter feelings between the branches of the family probably
weren't helped Tuesday when lawyers for the Miami relatives filed a
brief in a Florida family court alleging Juan Miguel has abused his
son. The brief asked for a hearing on the matter, but Judge
Jennifer Bailey said she was unlikely to grant such a hearing
because she feels federal law supersedes any state jurisdiction in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Reno met in her Washington office with Miami-Dade
County Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who asked
her to delay the boy's transfer and help set up a Gonzalez family
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that really should be decided between family
members,'' Penelas said, adding that he felt Miami's Cuban exiles
would respect whatever the family decides. Penelas has done a
dramatic about-face since he blasted federal officials two weeks
ago, warning that they were provoking Miami's exiles with their
insistence on returning Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Reno called the meeting ``productive,'' but again
stressed ``that the transfer of Elian to the care of his father
must move forward without delay.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether Juan Miguel Gonzalez would remain in
the United States if his son is returned to him. He has stated that
he would be willing to remain here until an Atlanta federal appeals
court rules on the Miami relatives' lawsuit, but he has also said
he would prefer to return to Cuba immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta is scheduled to
hear arguments in the case May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's case also drew another flurry of attention in Congress,
with Florida's two senators urging that the hand-over of the boy be
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Connie Mack said he was upset that the
government would turn the boy over before the family had a chance
to work the issue out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is better equipped than Elian's own family to decide what
his future will be,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the House Republican leadership and two Cuban-American
members of Florida's congressional delegation invited Juan Miguel
Gonzalez to meet privately Wednesday in the Capitol. ``We want to
be sure that you are aware of all the options available to you as
you make your decision,'' they wrote in a letter delivered by
representatives of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.

 &HT;    ELIAN'S MIAMI FAMILY TO TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON FOR MEET WITH
FATHER

<P>
   MIAMI _ The Miami relatives of 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian
Gonzalez may travel to Washington D.C. Wednesday in hopes of
meeting with the boy's father, Cuban exile leaders said late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The last-ditch effort to keep the boy in the United States comes
as federal immigration officials are expected to send a letter to
the family _ also on Wednesday _ outlining the timetable for when
and where Elian will be handed over to be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Several media outlets reported late Tuesday that a draft of the
letter being prepared by U.S. Justice Department officials calls
for Elian to be brought to the U.S. Coast Guard Station at
Opa-Locka Airport a few miles north of downtown Miami on Thursday
at 10 a.m. (EST).
</P>
<P>
   Also late Tuesday, a Wednesday trip by U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno to Miami to meet with Elian's Miami relatives and local
officials was apparently called off, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
   The late developments come as the Miami relatives who want to
keep the boy in this country are clearly running out of options.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, offered to
meet with Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, at a South Florida
location. In a letter released to the media, Lazaro Gonzalez said
that a meeting between the family's adults could quickly be
followed by a meeting that would reunite Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has repeatedly said he would only take
custody of his son if there were no conditions attached by the
Miami relatives. He has also been reluctant to travel to South
Florida, saying that if he did, it would only be to pick up his
son.

JAMES MARSTON FITCH, ARCHITECT AND PRESERVATIONIST, DIES AT 90

 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Marston Fitch, an architect whose writings and
teaching helped transform historic preservation from a dilettante's
pastime into a vigorous, broadly based cultural movement, died on
Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Less interested in where Washington slept than in how ordinary
people built their homes and workplaces _ and what lessons modern
architects could draw from the most modest and common building
types _ Fitch was the outspoken antithesis of a freeze-it-in-amber
sentimentalist.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he argued that a respect for older buildings made
environmental and economic sense. He broadened the notion of what
constituted important historical resources to include
``vernacular'' buildings, structures like the 19th-century
cast-iron industrial lofts of SoHo, which were not designed in high
style yet spoke eloquently about the cultures that created them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate task of architecture is to act in favor of human
beings,'' Fitch said in the newly revised and updated edition of
his 1947 work, ``American Building: The Environmental Forces That
Shape It'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), written with William
Bobenhausen.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Jacobs, a central figure in the movement that repudiated
the clean-slate planning strategies of the 1950s and '60s, said
Tuesday of Fitch, ``He was the principal character in making the
preservation of historic buildings practical and feasible and
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened people's eyes,'' Jacobs said by telephone from
Toronto, where she now lives. ``He didn't just relegate the need
for preservation of the built environment to early examples, sacred
styles and so forth. He was one of the first to see the value of
Art Deco.'' But his enthusiasms were wide-ranging; he was also a
founding member of the Victorian Society in America and was
instrumental in saving the South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made people understand that whole districts _ even with
undistinguished buildings in them _ were worthy of preservation and
appreciation,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Now taken for granted, such concepts were almost unheard of in
1964, when Fitch and the architect Charles Peterson founded a
graduate program in restoration and preservation at Columbia
University. Fitch headed the program until 1977, seeking as diverse
a student body as he could find in the belief that preservation
touched many lives and could profit from many different kinds of
expertise and passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great forces in American preservation have always been the
lay people,'' he said in a 1998 interview. ``Professional designers
have, time and time again, retreated from the scene of battle.
Preservationists are the people who fought tooth and nail.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his former students are Frank Sanchis, the executive
director of the Municipal Art Society; John H. Stubbs, the vice
president of the World Monuments Fund; and Adele Chatfield-Taylor,
the president of the American Academy in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   As a man who led architectural tours with the cry ``Andiamo!''
(``Let's go!'') _ in the cadences of Tennessee _ Fitch was scarcely
the kind to retire at 68, when he stepped down from Columbia's
Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   His next career was as the director of historic preservation at
the Manhattan architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle.
</P>
<P>
   In the firm's recently completed renovation of Grand Central
Terminal, Fitch advocated construction of a new staircase on the
east end of the concourse to complement the existing staircase on
the west.
</P>
<P>
   A preservation purist might have disputed such an intervention.
But Fitch said: ``I tell you the logic of the plan suggested that
there could have been a balancing stair there. That's the essence
of the Beaux-Arts planning philosophy. We didn't violate the
intentions of the builder.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say he was a pushover for alterations. When his
own firm came up with a plan for Donald J. Trump to reclad the St.
Moritz Hotel on Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas,
Fitch was opposed.
</P>
<P>
   When the firm was restoring the Cathedral of the Madeleine in
Salt Lake City, Utah, Fitch ``got into incredible dialogues,
telling the bishop how Catholic services should work,'' recalled
Richard L. Blinder, a partner in Beyer Blinder Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch was born in Washington on May 8, 1909, and grew up in
Chattanooga. He attended the University of Alabama and the school
of architecture at Tulane University. The Depression prevented him
from finishing school but he was granted five honorary doctorates
later in life.
</P>
<P>
   As an Air Force meteorologist in the second world war, he traced
the effects of climate on people, information he later used to
study how buildings relate to their environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an environmentalist when we were doing glass buildings
that had no relation to their environment,'' Blinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the war, Fitch was an editor at Architectural
Record, Architectural Forum and House Beautiful in New York; he was
appointed an associate professor at Columbia in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch's other books include ``Walter Gropius'' (1960),
``Architecture and the Esthetics of Plenty'' (1961) and ``Historic
Preservation: Curatorial Management of the Built World'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Cleo Rickman Fitch, an archaeological
researcher, died in 1995. He is survived by his second wife,
Martica Sawin, a critic and art historian, and three stepdaughters,
Martica Douglas of Portland, Me.; Maggy Wolf, of New Orleans; and
Gina Sawin, of New Gloucester, Me.
</P>
<P>
   Between spells together on the preservation battlefield in the
1960s, fighting the Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have
run along Broome Street, Jacobs recalled many evenings of
conversation in their West Village homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great educator,'' she said, ``even when he wasn't in
the classroom.''

UNIONS TO JOIN PROTESTERS IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  BY JOSEPH KAHN with STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American labor unions, worried that the world
economy is destroying many good jobs, are descending on Washington
to mount street demonstrations against a China trade bill and to
lend support to students, environmentalists and religious groups
protesting globalization.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive effort comes as labor's leadership has hardened
its opposition to liberalized trade, and its ties with the Clinton
administration have frayed. President Clinton's trade policies have
done serious damage to American workers, they argue, adding that
all new trade initiatives should be rejected unless they seek to
improve working conditions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on last year's anti-trade demonstrations in
Seattle, union leaders have also forged alliances with some
environmental and student groups gathered this week in Washington
to protest against actions of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund. The ``blue-green'' alliance is unusual for labor,
which until five years ago largely avoided ties with such groups.
</P>
<P>
   The labor campaign kicks off on Wednesday with a rally on
Capitol Hill and will continue in Washington and key congressional
districts during the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Labor pressure has also caused problems for Vice President Al
Gore, the likely Democratic nominee for president. Gore, who has
long supported free trade initiatives, has tiptoed around the China
trade measure because of unexpectedly strong labor opposition. Gore
won an early endorsement for his presidential candidacy from unions
this year, and has told union leaders that he would take a
different approach to trade than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is asking Congress to extend
permanent trade ties to China, a step that would allow U.S.
companies to benefit fully from market-opening measures that China
agreed to take as the price of admission to the World Trade
Organization. Unlike some other trade deals that labor unions have
opposed, this one does not require the United States to open its
market wider to foreign-made products.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say that the measure could help close American's
gaping trade deficit with China by allowing companies to export
more goods there, a situation that would presumably be good for
American workers. Separately, union officials are opposing another
Clinton administration trade initiative that would grant lower
tariffs to many of the poorest African countries, a measure that
has support from many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials insist that they have not become knee-jerk
protectionists, a reputation they worked hard to shed in recent
years. But they do say that they are now opposed to trade accords
unless they raise labor standards in foreign nations. That stance
leaves them in opposition to almost all trade liberalization
measures around the world these days.
</P>
<P>
   Some union officials now even argue that increased export
opportunities are ultimately bad for American workers because
multinational companies exploit every market opening to shift union
jobs to less heavily regulated nations.
</P>
<P>
   Unions are taking out advertisements this week citing a study by
the Economic Policy Institute, a union-oriented policy group, that
predicts hundreds of thousands of job losses even if China joins
the World Trade Organization and American companies get new export
and investment benefits. Clinton administration officials call
those predictions baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization works only for multinationals, not for
workers,'' said George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers
of America and one of the most active labor leaders in rallying
workers against China trade. ``The main reason companies are
interested in the China market is the repressed labor and low
environmental standards there.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker said that many unions, especially since the Seattle
demonstrations, have found common cause with some nongovernment
organizations and college students who want to rewrite the rules of
globalization to protect the environment, upgrade labor standards
and alleviate poverty abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not traditional allies,'' Becker said. ``But when I saw
those kids in Seattle who knew that something was wrong in the
world, I knew we should stand together in the trenches.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker, whose union is based in Pittsburgh, said he is staying
in Washington through Sunday so that he can speak at an rally
against the World Bank and the IMF that day. John J. Sweeney,
president of the AFL-CIO, spoke at a rally in favor of forgiving
third world debt last Sunday and announced an alliance with the
Sierra Club, an environmental group, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The United Auto Workers, the International Association of
Machinists, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile
Employees and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters are also
busing in members for the rally and lobbying effort against China
trade, which may draw 20,000 protesters. Many say some of their
members will stay on through the weekend to join the protest
against the financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's broad campaign against 1990s-style globalization is
deeply worrying for Democrats. Labor is perhaps the party's single
most active political constituency. Its heavy lobbying effort
against the China trade measure has split the party and hindered
its efforts to present a moderate, united front in this year's
presidential elections. Especially in seeking money and votes from
high-tech workers, Democrats are eager to present an
internationalist image, not a protectionist one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts Democrats in a tough position because they have to
break ranks with a key constituency or risk hurting our leadership
on an important issue,'' said Rep. Calvin M. Dooley, D-Calif. ``I
think labor has demagogued so much on the trade issue that even
when we get one that's clearly in the U.S. interest, they can't get
comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thea Lee, an international economist with the AFL-CIO, said
labor's opposition to the China Trade bill is principled, asserting
that trade should not be normalized with China because it is known
for violating human rights, workers' rights and many past trade
agreements that have been signed.
</P>
<P>
   How much political power labor can bring to bear is debatable.
But in an era of low voter turnout, many Democrats are convinced
that labor-proven get-out-the-vote efforts can make the difference
between victory and defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of labor pressure, no top Democratic leader in
the House has publicly supported the China trade bill. Some in the
party fear that stance will cost them business donations and
possibly hurt their chances of winning back the House this year.

GIULIANI GIVES POLITICAL EVENTS A RAIN CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani abruptly postponed four
upstate political events for his Senate campaign on Tuesday, saying
unapologetically that he wanted to go to Wednesday's rescheduled
Yankee opening game instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long before I was a politician, I was a Yankee fan,'' Giuliani
said at his daily City Hall news briefing as he grinned broadly and
put on a Yankee cap. ``What can I tell you? This is me. I'm a
Yankee fan. I love the Yankees. I haven't missed an opening day
since I've been the mayor. I'm not going to have another opening
day as the mayor, maybe, if I get my wish, right?''
</P>
<P>
   At least one of Giuliani's upstate Republican hosts reacted
plaintively. ``I hope in the future that he'll find some time for
us up here,'' said Stephen Minarik, the Republican Party chairman
in Monroe County, who was expecting the mayor in Rochester on
Tuesday at a Lunch With Rudy for more than 400 women. ``I'm not
going to kid you and say that there's not disappointment. A lot of
people did put a lot of time into this event.''
</P>
<P>
   One was Minarik's wife, Renee, a chairwoman of the event. She
and the other organizers called 400 people Tuesday and told them
not to come. The other upstate events _ a women's forum, a
question-and-answer session at a center for the elderly and a
$1,000-a-person fund-raiser _ were planned in the Buffalo area
Wednesday. In Rochester, some organizers of the lunch first heard
of the cancellation from New York City reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans reacted with astonishment to Giuliani's
decision. ``If he keeps this up, it won't be his last chance to go
to opening day as mayor of New York,'' said one state Republican
political consultant. ``And that's all I can say, because otherwise
it's like tossing a match into a fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to admire him, though. Because nobody else would
admit it, that `I'm blowing it off to go to opening day.' They'd
come up with come cockamamie excuse like `I've got to go to a
ribbon cutting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the mayor's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
reacted to the decision with astonishment and then delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know he's had a tough couple of weeks,'' Clinton
said, alluding to the mayor's sagging polls. ``It might be good for
him to go to a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added brightly: ``And you know, I've had a great couple
of weeks traveling around upstate New York. Last week I was in
Binghamton and Greene and Rochester and Corning and Albany, and I'm
back in Albany today. I'll be back in Buffalo tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans north of the Bronx County line have been complaining
for months that the mayor is ignoring them and that Clinton is
receiving alarmingly lavish news coverage from her frequent trips
upstate. Last week, when a New York Times/CBS News poll showed that
Clinton was 8 points ahead of the mayor overall and was even with
him upstate _ an unusual situation for a Democrat _ Republicans
consoled themselves that at least the polls might propel Giuliani
out of City Hall and into Broome County.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently did, even though Giuliani says he pays no
attention to polls, even though the mayor left a Broome County
dinner last Friday after a 22-minute speech, before dessert. But he
stayed long enough to plead for understanding from the 1,000
guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've felt I haven't been here enough, I ask you to please
give me a break: I have a fulltime day job,'' Giuliani said to
laughter and applause. ``Tell your friends and neighbors that. Tell
them that the mayor of New York City is like them. He works for a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has frequently said that the first lady has no fulltime
job and that she is free to campaign as much as she chooses.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department officials are preparing a letter
to the relatives of Elian Gonzalez ordering them to hand over the
boy to authorities on Thursday morning at an airport north of
Miami, government officials said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, aides to Attorney General Janet Reno said
Tuesday night that she had canceled plans to fly to Miami on
Wednesday to meet with Cuban-American leaders and relatives of the
boy in what would have been an attempt to persuade Elian's family
to peacefully surrender the 6-year-old Cuban boy to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The order to hand over the boy was contained in a letter being
written by Justice Department officials, who plan to order Elian's
relative to bring the child to the general aviation terminal at
Opa-Locka Airfield, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian would then be flown immediately to a reunion with his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, although the precise location of the
arrival has not yet been decided. The letter, is likely to be sent
to the relatives on Wednesday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While the officials said the time and place of the transfer were
unlikely to change, they cautioned that the specifics were
contained in a final draft of the letter, which could be altered by
senior officials before Reno gives her approval.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has told aides at the Justice Department for several days
that she was convinced that her direct intervention could soothe
the fiery passions within the Cuban-American population of Miami,
where Reno grew up and where she served for 15 years as the elected
local prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Reno has spoken emotionally and emphatically at
news conferences and television interviews about her sympathy for
the many Cuban-Americans who vehemently oppose sending Elian back
to the homeland ruled by of Fidel Castro, whom Reno has said she
unequivocally opposes.
</P>
<P>
   But she has also said that international politics should not
block the reunion of father and son, an outcome that she said was
correct as a long-established matter of immigration law and family
values. Pediatric psychiatrists, she said, have recommended turning
over Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possibility of an angry confrontation over the boy
has haunted negotiations between the government and Elian's Florida
relatives ever since fishermen plucked him from the Atlantic Ocean
off Florida on Thanksgiving after his mother drowned in their
ill-fated voyage from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have said they would obey the law, including a
court order allowing the government to transfer custody to Elian's
father, but they have never agreed to turn the child over to his
father, repeatedly asking for further legal review of whether the
child should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seemed headed to a showdown when last week, Elian's
father arrived in the United States to retrieve his son from the
Miami relatives, who were granted temporary custody until federal
authorities ordered that the boy be reunited with his father.
Gonzalez has told authorities he intends to take his son back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision to fly to Miami seemed to add yet another
unpredictable element to the international custody case, giving the
Miami relatives a slim hope that they might argue their case for
keeping the child to the country's highest legal officer. But Reno
has insisted she will not waver in her determination to reunite
Elian with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the boy's relatives offered a proposal that was
officially ignored by the Justice Department. In a letter
distributed outside the Miami home of Lazaro Gonzalez, the
great-uncle with whom Elian has been living, the family said it
would be willing to meet Elian's father at any ``neutral place in
South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter added that the session would be followed immediately
by a second meeting with the father that would include Elian. The
relatives sought an assurance from the government that Elian would
not be forcibly taken from them at the proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who is staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat
in a Washington, D.C., suburb, has said he does not want to meet
the Miami relatives, but would fly to Florida if necessary to pick
up his son. Afterward, the father has said, the adult members of
the Gonzalez family might seek a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department Tuesday, two Miami area mayors, Alex
Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Joseph Carollo of Miami, met with
Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the immigration service,
and urged the attorney general to arrange a meeting between Elian's
father and the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Reno issued a statement saying that she
welcomed their suggestions. She added, ``The mayors have asked me
to speak with leaders of the Miami community and I have indicated
my willingness and desire to do so. We agreed to continue working
together to seek an outcome that allows Elian to be reunited with
his father in the best way possible for him, his family and for the
Miami community as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Juan Miguel Gonzalez has said he does not want to
defect to the United States, the House Republican leadership and
Cuban-American lawmakers Tuesday invited him to a private meeting
on Wednesday in the Capitol. The lawmakers said in a letter to
Elian's father, which was delivered by congressional aides, that
they wanted him ``to be sure that you are aware of all the options
available to you as you make your decision.''

   GORE AT FUND-RAISER
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore kicked off another week of
multimillion-dollar fund-raising for the Democratic National
Committee with a dinner last night at the Mayflower Hotel in
Washington. Andrew Tobias, the financial writer and gay activist
who is treasurer of the committee, was the host of the dinner,
where 50 people paid $20,000 each, raising $1 million for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AD ON YAHOO!
</P>
<P>
   For months, Gov. George W. Bush has had a link on his Web site
(www.georgewbush.com) called a ``tax calculator.'' Put in marital
status, number of children, annual income and percentage of income
from a second earner, and it tells how much would be saved under
Bush's proposed $483 billion tax cut. With tax returns due on
Monday, the Bush campaign has begun to advertise the tax calculator
on Yahoo, the popular Internet portal. A caution: The calculator
only accepts income up to $100,000; more than half the savings
under the Bush plan would go to taxpayers with incomes above that.
</P>
<P>
   THREE SURVEYS FAVOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Three recent nationwide surveys show George W. Bush leading Al
Gore. In a poll conducted by the Gallup Organization for CNN and
USA Today, Bush was preferred by 50 percent, Gore by 41 percent; 8
percent of the 502 likely voters surveyed April 7-9 were undecided.
Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., surveyed 817 registered
voters in a nationwide poll April 3-5. Bush was the choice of 45
percent, and Gore 40 percent; 15 percent were undecided. The Zogby
America Poll, conducted April 1-4 with 842 likely voters, found 46
percent backing Bush, 42 percent for Gore and 12 percent undecided.
The advantage Bush has in each poll is within its margin of
sampling error. The margin for the Zogby and Marist polls was plus
or minus three percentage points and for the Gallup Poll, plus or
minus five percentage points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SENATOR FIGHTS LAWYERS GROUP
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota, a Republican facing a tough
re-election battle from a crowded field of opponents, has also had
to contend with tough television advertising in the Twin Cities.
Issue ads sponsored in part by the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America attack Grams for supporting legislation that would make it
harder for victims of asbestos-related illnesses to sue asbestos
companies. This week, Grams held news conferences in Minnesota and
Washington to accuse the trial lawyers of attempted blackmail and
bribery, saying a lobbyist for the group left a taped telephone
message for the senator's campaign aide suggesting that the ads
would not run if Grams dropped his sponsorship of the bill. Kurt
Zellers, Grams' campaign press secretary, said the tape had been
turned over to the Justice Department for possible investigation.
The president of the trial lawyers' group, Richard Middleton,
dismissed Grams' charge as ``not only absurd, but libelous on its
face.''

PROSECUTORS SAY IBF DEMANDED BRIBES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Robert W. Lee Sr., the founder of the
International Boxing Federation, corrupted the sport by demanding
bribes from boxers and their managers and promoters in return for
favored rankings and shots at championship bouts, federal
prosecutors contended Tuesday during opening statements in Lee's
trial on charges of racketeering and bribery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about the boxers who got left behind, who had
managers or promoters unwilling or unable to pay bribes,'' said
Jose Sierra, an assistant U.S. attorney as he ticked off a list of
promoters who would testify about the alleged bribes to Lee, who,
he said, ``never broke a sweat in the gym or took a punch.''.
</P>
<P>
   But in his own opening statement, Lee's lawyer painted a
contrasting picture, in which he described Lee as the ``proud
creator'' of the only major boxing sanctioning organization run by
African-Americans. The defense lawyer, Gerald Krovatin, said that
Lee had been operating a private business in an arena that was more
entertainment than sports _ one in which sanctioning bodies like
the IBF were locked in a ``love-hate relationship'' with promoters
and cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   Krovatin told jurors that in such an atmosphere, what is
considered a bribe depends on ``your perspective and your agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are the promoters, television all aligned with the
government in this case?'' Krovatin asked. ``Some of these
promoters have been trying to get rid of the sanctioning
organizations for years. That's why I say agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxing itself seemed to be on trial here Tuesday in U.S.
District Court as Lee, 66, and his son, Robert Lee Jr., 38, faced
35 counts of bribery, racketeering, money laundering and tax
evasion, allegations that have rocked the sport and sullied its
already tarnished image. Testifying for the prosecution will be a
half dozen promoters and managers who are unindicted
co-conspirators in the case and who, under nonprosecution
agreements, are expected to describe what they said were bribes
paid to Lee and others in the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Indicted with Lee and his son were Donald W. Brennan, 86, of
Warsaw, Va., who was chairman of the IBF championship committee,
and Francisco Fernandez, of Columbia, the IBF South American
representative. Brennan's trial was severed because of his ill
health; Fernandez has not been taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge John W. Bissell turned down
a defense challenge of the government's planned use of hours of
videotapes taken in motel-room meetings in which Lee appears to
accept and talk about bribes with C. Douglas Beavers, the former
IBF rankings chairman and a cooperating witness for the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in addition to describing some of the videotapes,
Sierra, the federal prosecutor, described in great detail the
workings of boxing's sanctioning commissions, specifically the IBF,
which is based in East Orange. The coin of the realm in boxing,
Sierra said, is a shot at the championship, because ``to paraphrase
a bank robber, `that is where the money is.''' But access to such
fights is determined by rankings and, Sierra said, Lee structured
the IBF so that he had absolute control of the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Among those from the boxing world expected to testify under
immunity from prosecution are Beavers, who prosecutors say was the
intermediary in many of the bribes, as well as a beneficiary; Ivan
Ferris Chadid, a Colombian promoter who allegedly paid to have his
fighters ranked for lucrative bouts; and Stan Hoffman and Wilfred
Sauerland, promoters who figured in nearly $200,000 in alleged
bribes in connection with a June 1995 heavyweight championship bout
between George Foreman and Axel Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Krovatin said the case was really not about the fighters, but
about the business of boxing and promoters. ``They are the ones at
the top of the food chain,'' he said. ``And they are fickle lot,
who one day love you and the next day talk about you like a dog.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the days of the Babe, Mickey and even Reggie,
going to Yankee Stadium usually meant being seated by an old-timer
in a red suit and cap who took your torn ticket and showed you to
your seat. After giving the chair a quick wipe, he handed back the
ticket stub, and maybe dispensed a bit of Bronx baseball wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Ushers were once as familiar a sight at the Stadium as players'
pinstripes, but when the Yankees take the field Wednesday for their
home opener, there will only be eight of the traditional
seat-finders.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be, more than 300 ushers worked a sold-out game at
Yankee Stadium, but over the years, the Yankees organization
allowed the staff to dwindle through attrition, steadily replacing
them with security guards. Now, it is likely that Yankee Stadium
ushers will be extinct when their latest union contract expires
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Schifren, an usher since 1954, said that when he started
working at the Stadium, the team gave each usher a snappy uniform,
a fluffy mitt for wiping seats and a measure of respect.
</P>
<P>
   But things have changed. The uniform _ red slacks and blazer, a
peaked cap and a blue tie _ has given way to the nondescript khaki
slacks and windbreaker. In the old days, six-man crews often worked
a single section of seats. Now, ushers stand at the openings of the
tunnels. A`ter the game, they used to line up on the field. Now
they can leave after the third inning. They may no longer accept
tips, walk fans to seats or even brush seats off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're the ones getting brushed off,'' said Schifren, 78,
who asked that other critical remarks against the club not be
printed ``because I love Yankee baseball.'' He thought it best to
stick to the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   For the ushers, the good old days were over by 1987, when the
club renamed the 20 remaining ones ``directors'' and reduced their
role to pointing out seats to fans. By last year, there were 10
ushers left, and when their contract expired last month, Yankee
management met with leaders of Local 366 of the Ushers and Ticket
Takers Union to talk about eliminating their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The team wanted to replace the last of the ushers with security
guards, said Douglas Menna, a lawyer for New York State's Central
Labor Council who helped the ushers negotiate. ``They said they
needed the money to pay the salaries of the ballplayers,'' he said.
``I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ushers make about $72 per game. The players' payroll is
about $92.5 million, the highest in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Menna argued that eliminating the jobs _ which all belonged to
men in their 60s, 70s and 80s _ might violate age discrimination
laws. In the end, the two sides agreed to a new two-season contract
through the fall of 2001, with the union agreeing to give up two
spots held by ushers who were ready to retire.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The ushers fear this will be their last contract, Menna said.
``The elimination of the jobs over the years has left a sense of
bitterness in these old-time New Yorkers that have been loyal fans
and employees and true to the Yankee tradition.''
 &UR;  &LR;  END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Rick Cerrone, a spokesman for the Yankees, would not comment on
the negotiations or the team's handling of the ushers, other than
confirming that security guards were taking over their role. ``I've
been here five years, and this is the first time anyone has asked
me about the ushers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Across town at Shea Stadium, the Mets still have more than 100
full-service ushers on staff. Most ballparks around the country
still have them, said Roger Hayden, director of ballpark operations
for the Baltimore Orioles, who attends annual conventions for
major-league stadium directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our convention in Seattle this year,'' Hayden said, ``most
of the directors I spoke to around the league said they still have
a full usher corps.'' The Orioles, who opened a new stadium in
1992, have kept roughly 200 ushers since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Yankee Stadium ushers declined to be interviewed
for fear of endangering their jobs, and others, like Schifren,
stuck mostly to baseball, insisting that their most critical
comments not be printed. During his first season, Schifren said, he
was assigned to tend the bleachers. From there, he watched Mickey
Mantle patrol center field and saw his favorite Yankee moment: Don
Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Schifren worked the mezzanine when Reggie Jackson hit his three
home runs in one World Series game against the Los Angeles Dodgers
in 1977. He tended the box seats when David Wells pitched his
perfect game in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, we were part of history,'' Schifren said. ``We
enjoyed a certain rapport with the fans. It was a real family
thing. We offered a service because we knew the city and had a
history of what New York was like, all the old ballparks. You felt
like you were wanted there, and you felt proud that you were part
of the Yankee organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Stepman grew up five blocks from Yankee Stadium and began
working as an usher there in 1947, when the salary was $3 a game. A
good day of tips netted an additional $15.
</P>
<P>
   The longest batted ball he ever saw was hit by Mantle. Stepman,
80, a linen supply manager by day, was working in the right field
seats. The Mick knocked a ball that shattered lights mounted on a
support beam over the right field wall, Stepman recalled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shot has remained frozen in my memory,'' he said. ``If
that ball was hit six inches to the left, it would've landed on
River Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominick Bamburi, 70, grew up in the Bronx, 10 minutes by bus
from the Stadium, where he has worked as an usher for 42 years. His
days working in a steel mill on East 116th Street in Manhattan have
become a blur, he said, but he still recalls watching from his
section in the right field stands when the fans swarmed the field
when Chris Chambliss hit the home run that won the 1976 pennant. He
also recalled Tommy John's often having coffee with the ushers,
whose locker room was near the players' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The need for ushers is as vital as ever at the Stadium, Bamburi
said, since there are more first-time fans than ever visiting. ``So
many people still ask to be taken to their seat,'' he said. ``You
know, not everyone comes here from the Bronx anymore. People come
from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepman agreed: ``Without us, they get sent in 10 different
directions.''
</P>
<P>
   The ushers were the keepers of Yankee lore, Bamburi said, with
older ushers passing down stories to the younger ones. ``They used
to say, `If you had a question about the Yankees, ask the ushers,
because they've been here from Day 1,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Steiner, 77, on the job since 1947, said the ushers
continue to serve that role: ``We still have kids coming up to us
asking, `Wow, did Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig really play here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what will happen when the ushers themselves fade into
history, Stepman said, ``The team is winning and attendance is up,
but the fans will be poorer.''

BLAME THE COMMISH: HIS SIGNATURE IS ALL OVER THIS SEASON'S HOME RUN
DERBY

<P>
   It's the signature; it has to be the signature. The pitchers are
the same, the hitters are the same. Oh, there's a new park that's
smaller than its predecessor, but not all the games in the first
week or so of the season have been played in Houston's Enron Field.
So it has to be the signature.
</P>
<P>
   Allan H. Selig, the baseballs say this season. Not Leonard S.
Coleman Jr. or Gene A. Budig, as they did last season, when the
balls were also identified as National League or American League.
The league distinction has been obliterated, first by the
elimination of the league presidents' jobs, then by the unification
of the separate league umpiring staffs, then by the signature on
the balls.
</P>
<P>
   Allan H. Selig.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be the reason.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for what? The reason for all of the balls' being
launched over fences in these early games of the season. They're
flying out so fast the statisticians have had to work overtime to
keep track of the numbers. Here a home run, there a home run,
everywhere a home run.
</P>
<P>
   More home runs _ 262 _ were hit in the first week of the 2000
season than were hit in any week of any previous season, Elias
Sports Bureau has determined. More home runs _ 57 _ were hit last
Friday than on any other day in major league history. The St. Louis
Cardinals hit more home runs in their first seven games than any
team had previously hit in its first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Tuesday's schedule, major league players had hit 23
percent more home runs than they did in the corresponding period a
year ago, and that period, the first eight days of the season,
ignited a cascade of home runs that didn't ebb until the record for
a season was shattered.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins, for Bud's sake, hit six home runs in a game
the other day. That would have been a good week for the Twins last
season. In fact, they had a week last September when they didn't
hit any home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins' uncharacteristic barrage produced one of 15 instances
when teams hit four or more home runs in a game in the first eight
days. Last year at this time, that type of outbreak had occurred
only twice.
</P>
<P>
   The home run theme of this season seems to be a variation of the
Ernie Banks exhortation of ``let's play two.'' Hitters have been
saying, ``Let's hit two.'' One is not enough. Twenty-two times
players have slugged two home runs in a game, more than triple the
seven times it happened in the first eight days last season. On the
ninth day Tuesday Carl Everett added his name to the list, which
included Jeromy Burnitz of Milwaukee twice.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Elster, the Los Angeles shortstop who had retired from
baseball before the 1999 season, went all 23 of those players one
better Tuesday. He hit three home runs on opening day Tuesday at
Pacific Bell Park, the San Francisco Giants' new home.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew of St. Louis is on the list, too. Drew, in fact, had
hit four home runs in his 11 times at bat entering the Cardinals'
game Tuesday night in Houston, where Enron Field is far friendlier
to hitters than the Astrodome ever was. Come to think of it, the
Astros pitchers may want to stage a wildcat strike on the ground
that they never had an opportunity to negotiate that change in
their working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little scary in this park,'' Walt Jocketty, the
Cardinals' general manager, said Tuesday by telephone from Houston.
``The ball just really jumps out of here. We had a one-run lead
going into the ninth inning last night and luckily we got out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, the commissioner's chief of baseball operations,
attended the Pacific Bell Park opener and said, ``The ball was
jumping out of there today.''
</P>
<P>
   The new parks, however, are not the sole reason for the early
eruption of home runs. Looking for reasons, some pitchers
apparently have cited the silver ink on the 2000 baseballs. They
say it smudges easily and gets into the seams, making it difficult
to grip the balls.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said he hadn't heard that one. The home run
explosion, however, had not escaped his attention. He said he
talked about it the other day with Alderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Sandy,'' Selig said by telephone from Detroit,
``because people keep talking about the ball. But they don't have
any evidence that the ball is juiced up.'' He said tests done on
the balls last year showed they were the same as they had been.
Tests will most likely be done again this year just to silence the
conspiracy theory about the souped-up ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoughts are not any different than the last year or two,''
Selig said. ``I really believe it's a combination of things. I
think it's the smaller ballparks; players are bigger and stronger;
you've had two expansions in the '90s. There's no question we've
had an offensive explosion. I don't think people can pinpoint one
particular reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he was told, there might be one reason. Given a hint, he
said, ``Because my signature's on it?''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the owners enhanced the powers of the
commissioner. The additional potency apparently extends to the
commissioner's signature. &QL;

WITH CLEAN SLATE, TEAMS FACE OFF FOR A POLISHED CUP  
 BY JOE LAPOINTE  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hockey people like to think that players and teams can redeem a
bad or mediocre regular season with a good showing in the Stanley
Cup playoffs. In this spirit, perhaps the National Hockey League as
a whole can use the tournament, which begins Wednesday night, to
burnish an image left smudged by some events of the 1999-2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everything was negative during the last six months. The
St. Louis Blues, an emerging power in the West, won the
regular-season championship with an emerging star in goalie Roman
Turek.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Pavel Bure regained his superstar status by scoring
58 goals to lead the league. In Los Angeles, the Kings returned to
the playoffs in a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York area, Scott Gomez of the Devils and Mike York of
the Rangers were among the best of a promising crop of rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the veteran stars, Steve Yzerman of the Detroit Red Wings
and Brett Hull of the Dallas Stars crossed the 600-goal threshold,
and Hull also tied his father, Bobby Hull, at 610 goals.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime this season, the four-on-four format led to fewer
ties and more excitement. On television, ABC took over from Fox and
immediately improved upon the incomprehensible telecasts of the
previous seasons. Chugging along steadily were ESPN and ESPN2,
which produced the ABC product on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But television also transmitted disturbing images that damaged
the public perception of a sport still struggling for recognition
as it prepares to expand to 30 teams. In the first week of the
season, Mike Modano of the defending champion Stars left the ice on
a stretcher after taking a hit into the boards and sustaining a
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the season, Marty McSorley of the Boston Bruins was
suspended by the league and also charged with assault with a weapon
by Canadian authorities for his stick attack against Donald
Brashear of the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   In nonhostile accidents, Trent McCleary of the Montreal
Canadiens nearly died after he was struck in the throat by a puck
and Bryan Berard of the Toronto Maple Leafs lost sight in one eye
after being poked with a stick. Many players have complained about
ice quality in many places, and that is unlikely to improve during
the warming weather of spring.
</P>
<P>
   In television ratings, the audience growth was ``flat,'' to use
the euphemism of the industry. And the playoffs begin without major
markets such as New York and Chicago or traditional teams like the
Canadiens and the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   While the Zambonis repair and prepare the playing surfaces,
medical experts tend to the physical injuries and spin doctors tend
to image wounds. Among those in sell mode is Commissioner Gary
Bettman.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, this has been an excellent season,'' Bettman said
recently in a conference call with reporters. ``Scoring is up.
Penalty minutes are down. A little perspective is in order.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone noted that David Letterman recently mocked hockey
violence with a Top 10 list on his television show, Bettman said:
``If he thinks we're important enough to be worth talking about,
that's not terrible. I like it better when David Letterman invites
the Stanley Cup champions on with the Stanley Cup, which he does
now on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the possibility of the Stars repeating as
champions, Bettman said: ``Whatever happens is great as long as we
have a terrific playoffs. And that's what we're looking forward
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there is promise for an interesting tournament. The
Stars, defending their first championship, represent the Western
Conference, which has the better teams. The Stars open against the
Edmonton Oilers, a difficult opponent in recent years. Because the
Colorado Avalanche's Peter Forsberg is out with a shoulder injury
until further notice, the Stars' toughest competition could come
from the Detroit Red Wings, who won the trophy in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders for the Red Wings are Coach Scotty Bowman and
defenseman Chris Chelios, both experienced and ornery as the
occasion demands. The Red Wings open against the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Turek, the Blues boast two top defensemen in Chris
Pronger and Al MacInnis and a forward line called the Slovak Pack.
Pierre Turgeon has revived his career as the best center of the
Blues. But it is difficult for a team such as St. Louis to surge to
the championship level so suddenly. Those seeking a dark horse in
the West might consider either the San Jose Sharks, who face the
Blues, or the Phoenix Coyotes over the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, the lower-seeded teams have a better chance, as the
Buffalo Sabres and the Washington Capitals demonstrated in the last
two seasons. The eighth-ranked Sabres open against the Philadelphia
Flyers, the top-seeded team in the bracket, and the Sabres have the
best angle for an upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres finished strong; they added good players through
trades; and their goalie, Dominik Hasek, got healthy and back to
top form. Plus, the Sabres will play a traumatized Flyers team.
</P>
<P>
   Flyers Coach Roger Neilson is being treated for cancer. He hopes
to return for the second round. The team's former captain, Eric
Lindros, is being treated for a concussion. He hopes to return for
the second round, although the team demoted him from captain during
his feud with General Manager Bobby Clarke. The veteran goalie John
Vanbiesbrouck has been replaced on the first string by Brian
Boucher, a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils squandered the conference lead, which they held until
the final week of the season. They open against the Florida
Panthers, who have not won a post-season series since reaching the
finals in 1996. But the Devils have won only one round since taking
the Stanley Cup in 1995. According to NHL rules, one of these teams
has to win this series.
</P>
<P>
   Another upset looms in the Pittsburgh-Washington series. The
Capitals have been dull but efficient since the turn of the
millennium. The Penguins have rebuilt from bankruptcy under the
ownership of Mario Lemieux. General Manager Craig Patrick changed
coaches, traded players and has done much with little.
</P>
<P>
   North of the border, they will not play ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' before the Ottawa-Toronto games, but everyone, including
the news media, will wave one team flag or another in the first
ever ``Battle of Ontario.''  &QL;

IN RETRIAL, DOCTOR ACQUITTED OF SEXUALLY ABUSING A PATIENT
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID ROHDE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Griffin was something of a prodigy. He
received a full scholarship to attend Columbia University at age
16, he said, and was appointed director of medicine at St. Luke's
Hospital in Manhattan at 33.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, a patient accused Griffin, a gastroenterologist
with a lucrative practice on Central Park West, of sexually abusing
her while she was sedated. He denied the charge, but in 1996 he was
convicted of sodomy and falsifying business records, stripped of
his medical license and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Released on bail while he appealed the conviction, Griffin spent
the next several years working on a horse farm and driving a truck
to support himself. In 1998, an appeals court ruled that Griffin's
first trial was unfair and ordered him retried.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's second trial _ and his legal odyssey _ ended on
Tuesday with a jury in State Supreme Court in Manhattan acquitting
him of all charges. Griffin, 45, wept in court after the verdict
was read and vowed to regain his medical license. ``I don't know
what to say,'' he said. ``I'm still a little bit numb. It's been
something indescribable that's happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had no comment on the acquittal, which cannot be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, the patient said she had gone to Griffin's
office for a colonoscopy and endoscopy on Jan. 13, 1995. She was
given a combination of two sedatives, Versed and Demerol, in
preparation for the procedures. When she woke up, the patient said,
she found Griffin performing oral sex on her.
</P>
<P>
   A juror at the second trial who would not give his name said
doubts emerged after the panel heard testimony that those sedatives
can block patients' memory and cause them to experience sexual
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's lawyer, Paul F. Callan, said the case showed the
dangers posed by the sedatives, which are widely used by doctors.
``This case is a nightmare example of what can happen,'' Callan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down Griffin's conviction, the Appellate Division of
the State Supreme Court voted 3 to 2, finding that Justice Marcy L.
Kahn improperly prevented defense lawyers from asking the victim
about a $10 million civil lawsuit she filed against the doctor,
Callan said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Bridget Fleming, also asked a series of detailed
questions in the first trial about an alleged affair between
Griffin and another patient, despite being told by the judge not to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's accuser was not in court on Tuesday, and prosecutors
have not released her name, as is customary in sexual abuse cases.
Callan said her civil lawsuit is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of evidence in the case was a secretly recorded
conversation where the doctor repeatedly denied sodomizing the
woman but admitted kissing her. In his testimony, Griffin denied
kissing the woman and said he made the false admission to calm her
before she created a scene in his office. Griffin, who once lived
in a luxurious condominium on Manhattan's Upper West Side, has
recently been sleeping on his great-aunt's living room couch in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, I never used to question people,'' he said.
``Now, I know this is a world where you have to be on guard every
minute of every day.''

COMMENTARY: TONY BLAIR'S BABY _ SOME DECISIONS LAST LONGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA BELKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last we heard, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain was deciding
(and deciding, and deciding) whether or not to take paternity leave
when his fourth child is born in May. ``I've got a country to
run,'' he sputtered to the BBC. ``I honestly don't know what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   That has led to the predictable jokes about nappies and a less
predictable debate over the importance of paternity leave _ a
spanking new concept in Britain, which just passed a law allowing
parents up to 13 weeks of unpaid time off from work during the
first five years of each child's life.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest voices seem to think Blair should go for it. ``Show
new dads the way, Tony,'' screamed a front-page headline in The
Mirror, which argued that the prime minister had a duty to spend at
least one week at home. His wife, Cherie Blair, seems to agree. A
powerful lawyer with ambitions to be a High Court judge, she has
praised Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of Finland for taking six
whole days off for the birth of a daughter last month. ``I, for
one, am promoting a widespread adoption of this fine example,''
said Blair, who, for the record, plans to take at least 13 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Here on this side of the Atlantic, certain circles are watching
closely. We too have a law (the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act)
that was intended to encourage paternity leave, but so far it has
not sent men home to their newborns in droves. A poll by Oxygen
Media and the Markle Foundation found that although a decisive
majority of us believe fathers should take more than two weeks of
paternity eave, 71 percent couldn't think of any male friend or
relative who had actually done this.
</P>
<P>
   That is mostly because here (as in Britain) the law fails to put
any money where its mouth is, providing only for unpaid leave. But
it is also because changing the law is not the same as changing the
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who take time off are seen as responding to a higher
calling,'' said Suzanne Braun Levine, the author. ``Men who take
time off are seen as being henpecked and letting the operation
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine spoke to scores of men for her new book, ``Father
Courage: What Happens When Men Put Family First'' (Harcourt), and
found that those who do stay home with their newborns disguise it
as something else _ unused vacation, comp time, sick leave. What
men need, she has decided, is a good role model, and she thinks the
British prime minister would do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   But what is he to be an example of? To hear some of the talk on
this side of the Atlantic, you'd think he was to be lauded simply
for being so darn supportive. ``He should take some time off and
help his wife with the wee one,'' suggested one editorial. Hmm. How
nice of him to help. And how helpful his wife has been, earning an
estimated three times his salary these last few years.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more constructive to focus for a moment on the ``wee
one.'' In her forthcoming book, ``Flux: Women on Sex, Work, Kids,
Love and Life in a Half Changed World'' (Doubleday), Peggy
Orenstein cites studies showing that the more time a man spends
alone with a baby during the early months _ and we're talking
full-time here, not ``helping'' Mom when she takes an hour off to
run to the supermarket _ the more involved he is as a parent for
all the years afterward. ``Paternity leave has lifelong benefits to
a child,'' she says. ``Why aren't women storming the ramparts over
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Why indeed? And why, while we're asking, aren't men? After all,
this is about men. Women take maternity leave because they want to
be with their new babies. If they didn't want to, they would
recover physically, then dash back to work. Yet nothing I've read,
no talk show chat that I've heard, has suggested that time with his
baby is a gift that Blair should give to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it because I couldn't imagine not doing it,'' Ed
Tagliaferri, a vice president at Dan Klores Associates, said of the
three weeks he cobbled from vacation time and comp time seven years
ago when his son was born. ``I wanted to experience it all and
throw myself into it from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, Tony Blair should take paternity leave because someone
needs to set a good example. And yes, he should take paternity
leave because studies show it will be good for his child. But
wouldn't it be something if this man could take time with his baby
because he passionately wanted to? What better role for the rest of
us to model?

DEAL SECURES A BALLPARK FOR CONEY ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIAN E. BARNES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leaders of the City Council and the Giuliani
administration agreed Tuesday to build a new minor league stadium
in Coney Island and return professional baseball to Brooklyn as
part of a $91 million redevelopment plan for the area.
</P>
<P>
   The deal removes the last obstacles to a $31 million, 6,500-seat
stadium and kills a nearly decade-old plan to build an amateur
athletic arena on Coney Island's Steeplechase Park, where the new
ballpark is now planned. In return for the council's support of the
stadium plan, the city's Economic Development Corporation agreed
Tuesday to spend another $30 million to improve the boardwalk and
build playgrounds, bathhouses, retail shops and volleyball courts.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and the City Council also agreed to create a
local development corporation to plan sports, recreation and
entertainment programs in Coney Island and surrounding
neighborhoods. Council officials said that the group would be given
the $30 million that the city had earmarked for the amateur arena,
commonly called Sportsplex.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plan would mean the return of a professional team
to Brooklyn for the first time since the Dodgers moved to Los
Angeles in 1958, council members talked more Tuesday about economic
rejuvenation than shagging fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a plan that was dying on the vine and we made it into
a package that will result in the redevelopment of Coney Island and
all of south Brooklyn,'' said Herbert Berman, the chairman of the
council's finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   The deal swells the price tag of what was once advertised by
administration officials as a $20 million ballpark, and comes after
the council approved a $71 million minor league ballpark for Staten
Island. But Michael G. Carey, the president of the city's Economic
Development Corporation, said the latest deal would do far more to
reverse the economic decline of Coney Island, which has failed to
reverse its sagging fortunes even as once-faded gems like Times
Square have rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall effect here is to rejuvenate the neighborhood,''
Carey said. ``We are bring back an area that has been neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, fought the
plan for the minor league stadium, saying the borough deserved
better than a low-level minor league team. Greg Brooks, his chief
of staff, said the city should have made improvements like the new
bathrooms and pavilions without foisting the team on Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The borough president wouldn't argue against funding for the
boardwalk,'' Brooks said. ``But such funds could have been
appropriated without bringing a short-season minor league team to
Coney Island, which will provide minimal economic benefit at a very
high cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The city and the New York Mets organization, which owns a Class
A minor league team that will play at Coney Island, hope to open
the stadium at Steeplechase Park in June 2001. This year, the minor
league team hopes to play at St. John's University's baseball
field.
</P>
<P>
   After Carey, Berman and other City Council leaders worked out
the details of the agreement Tuesday afternoon, the council land
use committee voted 16-0 to approve the plan for the stadium and
improvements to Coney Island. Council leaders said they expected
the full body to approve the deal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to build the stadium has been contentious. The Mets
had wanted to make a temporary home in the Parade Grounds, a park
deluged with soccer and Little League players each weekend, but
Golden filed suit and stopped the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Golden and Brooklyn Community Board 13 had also opposed the
Coney Island proposal during the city's land use review procedure,
forcing Tuesday's City Council vote. Community Board members had
argued that the stadium should not be built unless the city also
committed to Sportsplex.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the community board dropped its demand for the
arena in return for the city's promise of neighborhood improvements
and a commitment from the Mets to provide scholarships to baseball
clinics and job opportunities to neighborhood schoolchildren.
Martin Levine, the chairman of Community Board 13, said that even
with the approval of Giuliani, which was not forthcoming, it would
have taken at least two years to begin Sportsplex, and that was too
long to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Peter J. Kiernan, who had led the effort to build the Sportsplex
as chairman of the Brooklyn Sports Foundation, said he expected few
new amateur athletic facilities to be built as a result of
Tuesday's deal. ``One thing that is painfully clear is that there
is no constituency for amateur sports,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: JOHN HINCKLEY'S REQUEST 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 12:
</P>
<P>
   The criminal trial of John Hinckley Jr. for shooting President
Reagan and three others in 1981 ended with a jury verdict of not
guilty by reason of insanity. Since then, the would-be assassin has
been confined to St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington for
treatment of his severe mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a disconcerting Washington Post report that officials
at the facility are recommending that he be released for
unsupervised daylong visits with his parents. The hospital's recent
letter to the court that oversees his case notes that Hinckley has
been living without incident in a minimum-security ward, has been
walking unescorted around hospital grounds for years, and
cooperates with every aspect of his treatment. It also says that
for the past six months Hinckley has taken field trips to several
restaurants and shopping malls under the watchful supervision of
hospital staff. ``In our opinion,'' the letter concludes, ``
Hinckley has sufficiently recovered from his mental illness to be
granted a limited conditional release without danger to himself and
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet granting Hinckley that kind of freedom is a risky step not
warranted by the full public record. Hospital officials say they
believe the disorders that led to his obsession with the actress
Jodie Foster and his violent assault on Reagan are now in remission
and that he requires no medication. But a psychiatrist called in by
prosecutors when the issue last arose, in 1997, warned the court
that Hinckley had the ability to hide serious problems, appearing
fine even to those treating him. Moreover, the hospital has been
wrong before. In the late 1980s the hospital withdrew its request
for Hinckley's conditional release after learning that he had
corresponded with Ted Bundy, the convicted serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office, which opposes the request, has asked
Senior Federal District Judge June Green for a hearing. It is right
to do so. The decision should not be based solely on the advice of
hospital doctors. The judgment of the court and respected outside
psychiatrists not involved in Hinckley's treatment should be
brought to bear. Green, who has shown skepticism in the past about
claims of Hinckley's progress, should not abandon that skepticism
now.

PROSECUTORS, PUBLIC DEFENDERS MAY GET STUDENT LOAN RELIEF 
BY WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On most days, John M. Ryan, a senior prosecutor in
Queens, and Susan L. Hendricks, who oversees criminal defense
lawyers for the Legal Aid Society, make their living on different
sides of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, they and scores of district attorneys and
senior public defenders around the state have formed an unusual
alliance to support legislation they hope will halt the attrition
that is draining experienced lawyers from the ranks of prosecutors
and public defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, pending before the Senate and Assembly budget
committees, would appropriate $3 million to pay for loans incurred
in law school by assistant district attorneys and Legal Aid
lawyers, most of whom start out earning less than $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, where the district attorney, Richard A. Brown,
oversees 320 assistant district attorneys, 68 percent of the
lawyers hired between 1992 and 1996 have left, said Ryan, the chief
assistant district attorney. Lawyers hired in those years make up
the core group of felony trial assistants who have enough
experience to handle serious crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing too many talented young prosecutors because
they're drowning in their student loans,'' said Brown, who is
leading the effort for the legislation. ``It would be a shame if
the great strides that we've made in the fight against crime were
to be compromised by a lack of experienced professional
prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's office surveyed hundreds of assistant district attorneys
around the state and found that about two-thirds have outstanding
student loans averaging $60,000, and that nearly 70 percent owed
between $50,000 and $125,000. Many have been unable to lower their
indebtedness during their tenure as prosecutors and have seen the
total actually increase, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Law school tuition hovers around $20,000 a year, and entry-level
jobs at the city's better law firms pay roughly triple the starting
salary offered by the city's five district attorneys, so it is
becoming harder and harder for prosecutors to retain the lawyers
beyond the usual three-year commitment they demand.
</P>
<P>
   The loan burdens are affecting prosecutors' offices in the city
and across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, a union that represents
the lawyers, surveyed members on their loans and found that on
average, they spent nearly 30 percent of their annual income on
loan payments. ``For the vast majority of law school graduates,
this is an enormous issue, and it deters them from taking
public-interest jobs, or they do it but can't continue that for the
rest of their careers,'' Hendricks said.

KINGS COACH AND FAMILY LEARN TO SACRIFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT - Andy Murray had great news.
</P>
<P>
   After a life as a coaching gypsy, with frayed passports stamped
from Nashville to Nagano, Japan, Murray gathered his family last
June to say he had been offered the head job of the Los Angeles
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne? Ice cream and cake? How about some bronzed hockey
skates?
</P>
<P>
   How about, ``We are not going to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that after 20 years of room service, the Murrays
finally had found a home. The only problem? It was one stop short
of the big time.
</P>
<P>
   His three children had grown up in Florida, Switzerland and
Calgary. They saw the world from the back of a Zamboni but barely
saw their father for two years while he coached the Canadian
National team. When they arrived in Faribault, Minn., and a
hockey-mad boarding school named Shattuck-St. Mary's, everyone fell
in love.
</P>
<P>
   So while the revitalized Kings prepared this week for Thursday's
playoff opener against the Detroit Red Wings, Murray's biggest fans
are 2,000 miles away. He hasn't seen his wife, Ruth, and youngest
son Jordy since early February. His oldest son, Brady, came last
month with his daughter Sarah and got to work out with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone on the Kings how they got to this point after missing
the postseason five of the previous six years and they point to the
48-year-old Murray, his attention to detail and his obsession with
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   But as the NHL steps on to its biggest stage this week, it's
easy to forget he is somebody's dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works because we're always talking, maybe four or five
times a day on the phone,'' Ruth Murray said Tuesday as she was
getting Jordy ready for a hockey tournament. ``Even if it is only
for five minutes at a time. It is the most important thing.
Sometimes we talk too much. The phone will ring as we're rushing
out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We send faxes, use cell phones, and we're going to get E-mail.
But it isn't easy. Sometimes you just want a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, a career NHL assistant who coached a year at Shattuck to
get reacquainted with his family, says the distance is the hardest
part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Murray lives in Hermosa Beach but rarely strays from his big-
screen TV and satellite dish. There aren't many who watch eight
hockey games at once on their night off and even fewer who can
match his intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Murray has willed his team to withstand lengthy injuries to top
players Luc Robitaille, Ziggy Palffy, Jozef Stumpel and Stephane
Fiset. He has helped rebuild an organization often ignored by the
city of Los Angeles until playoff time.
</P>
<P>
   Murray spent much of Monday planning strategy with his
assistants. He also checked the final edit of a motivational tape
he planned to show the players later that night at a team dinner.
At the beginning of an interview, Murray asks if it is OK to keep
writing while he talks about the season.
</P>
<P>
   Then he stops to pull out a faxed piece of paper diagramming a
play to use against Detroit. There are a few too many players on
the ice and its hard to tell the x's from the o's. But at the
bottom it said, ``Love, Jordy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotty Bowman doesn't stand a chance,'' he said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Murray led the Kings to 94 points this season, fourth best in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he was leading Shattuck to the national championship
in his only year as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard being away from your family, and I live here,''
Kings assistant Ray Bennett said. ``But I don't know if I've met
anybody more focused on a job than Andy. During (this season's
national tournament in which Shattuck lost in the semifinals),
there was a couple of times he turned to me and said, `That's where
a father should be.' But he never let on to anybody. He was so
tuned in to getting us into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Murray understands, and said she knew what she was getting
into.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth and Andy met in 1972 when he was a physical education
instructor at a school outside Winnipeg and she was a student
teacher. He had taught several of her eight brothers and sisters.
Word on his fast-pitch softball team was Murray was a little high
strung, but she didn't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   During one of his first coaching jobs, Murray won a national
championship at Brandon University in Manitoba. He also taught
sports management and psychology at night and ran his father's auto
dealership during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he not only coached in Europe, he learned German, French
and Italian.
</P>
<P>
   There were minor-league jobs and assistant positions with the
Winnipeg Jets, Minnesota North Stars and Philadelphia Flyers. He
took the Canadian National team to an Olympic gold medal in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Team Canada was based in Calgary and prepared with an 82-game
schedule. Eighty one of those were on the road, including several
months in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Shattuck, he moonlighted as the general manager of a
team in Germany. After Shattuck played on Saturday afternoons,
Murray would hop a plane to Berlin, then return Monday afternoon
for practice.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the frequent-flyer miles, the job at Shattuck offered a
chance to get off the treadmill. Murray told the family and the
school he would only leave for an NHL head coaching job. Even when
he was offered an associate head coaching job in Vancouver, Murray
turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be a little controlling,'' Ruth Murray said with a
laugh. ``Of course, you want him there, but when he wasn't for so
long, we learned to get along without him. That took some
adjusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray gushes about his Shattuck experience, but realizes how
difficult it was to rejoin the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way my wife kept things together really is the story
here,'' he said. ``When you come back after not being around, you
want to direct things. They look at you like `everything is fine.'
But she is absolutely amazing. I can't imagine any of this without
her.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Murray is back on the road, replacing Larry
Robinson. Ruth said her husband wasn't sure he'd ever get a head
coaching job because he wasn't a former player and didn't have a
marquee name.
</P>
<P>
   But she remembers how proud she felt at the introductory news
conference last summer. Brady Murray said he was a little surprised
how good his father was on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Murray is hoping to bring the kids to Los Angeles for some
of the later first-round games. As a coach's wife, she says it
saddens her that she hasn't bonded with the players' wives or
gotten to know many of the front-office personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The family will split time this summer between Minnesota and
Hermosa Beach. Brady will work out at the team's training facility
in El Segundo and play in Europe. But he also will skip soccer this
summer, a big decision in a busy household that was made without
his father's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could see him more,'' Ruth Murray said. ``I haven't
seen him in so long. But you do what you have to do.''

BREAST CANCER IS PINPOINTED BY ZIP CODE IN STATE MAPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The State Health Department on Tuesday published
breast cancer rates by ZIP code for the entire state, the first
time such widespread mapping of a cancer has been produced in such
detail.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the data show that the highest rates of breast
cancer occurred on Long Island, where the disease has become a
potent political and public health issue and local survivors'
groups have, on their own, pioneered the creation of cancer maps.
The department will produce ZIP code maps for other common cancers
over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the state, many advocates of the mapping project
said that it was too long in the making and complained that the
state still had not achieved one of the project's original goals:
to compare spots where cancer rates are elevated to the locations
of known sources of pollution. Officials in the Health Department
and elsewhere in the Pataki administration have said they intend to
produce maps matching cancers to pollutants but would not say when.
</P>
<P>
   Through analysis of the figures _ which include cancer cases
diagnosed from 1993 through 1997 by the ZIP code of each patient's
residence _ the Health Department identified several regions around
the state as ``areas of elevated incidence not likely due to
chance.'' Most of Suffolk, Nassau and Rockland Counties fell into
this classification. Not counting ZIP codes with such small numbers
of cases that statistical anomalies could easily occur, the four
ZIP codes with the highest rates of breast cancer statewide were in
Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas designated with ``elevated incidence not likely due
to chance'' included swaths of central and southern Westchester
County, the Upper East Side of Manhattan, southern Brooklyn,
eastern Staten Island, Rochester and its suburbs, and Buffalo and
its suburbs. Over all, New York City had a below-average rate of
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The areas with high breast cancer rates correlate strongly to
known risk factors like affluence, having children relatively late
in life and Jewish heritage. But in many cases, they also match
known sources of industrial air emissions, toxic waste sites and
contaminated ground water wells.
</P>
<P>
   The full data are available on the department's Web site, at
www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/-cancer/csii/nyscsii.htm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must tell you that the maps do have limitations,'' said Dr.
Antonia C. Novello, the state health commissioner, at a news
conference where she released the maps. ``They can suggest the
areas for more research, but they cannot by themselves tell us the
causes of the cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the project, under way since 1998, had moved slowly in
part because the state's cancer registry, which keeps detailed
reports on every cancer case, had some sloppy record-keeping and
had to be cleaned up. ``I want to do it as fast as you guys do, but
I want to do it well,'' she said. ``Give a little bit of trust to
the department.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat who has been the
primary advocate of cancer mapping in the Legislature, said that
the data should be much more refined and he accused the department
of dragging its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``These maps are useless,'' said Brodsky, who is chairman of the
Environmental Conservation Committee. ``They don't really identify
cancer clusters, which occur at the neighborhood level, well below
the ZIP code level. And they haven't told us anything about
environmental factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Maureen C. O'Connell, a Nassau County Republican
and a former oncology nurse, said, ``The delay in getting this map
done was of concern to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   David Momrow, senior vice president of the American Cancer
Society's New York chapter, reacted cautiously to the maps but
called them ``a significant achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   As originally conceived by the Legislature two years ago, the
maps would have compared high cancer rates to known sources of
pollution and would have been produced in a few months. Places
where the two factors matched, advocates said, could be places for
epidemiologists to look for environmental causes for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, vetoed financing for that
project. Later, under fire from cancer survivors' groups, he said
the Health Department would take on the project, using available
money, and the department promised the first maps by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The first maps came, instead, more than a year later, and they
showed rates of various kinds of cancer at a county level _ data
the department had already been publishing for several years.

 &HT;    CLINTON, BARAK DISCUSS MIDEAST PEACE PROGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak huddled for nearly four hours in the Oval Office Tuesday
night, trying to press a difficult set of Middle East peace talks
toward a so-far elusive finish line.
</P>
<P>
   In extended talks that touched on all aspects of the peace
process _ including Israeli negotiations with the Palestinians, the
Syrians and Lebanese _ Clinton and Barak made apparent headway in
clarifying areas of agreement and defining the remaining gaps.
</P>
<P>
   After talks wrapped up at 10:20 p.m. (EST), though, a White
House official designated to brief journalists on background
indicated that the substance of any progress would be kept private
at least until Clinton meets with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat here on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good, productive, serious discussion about all
facets of the Middle East peace process,'' the official said,
speaking on background in the White House briefing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Clinton) feels very encouraged there is intensification,
renewed energy in the Palestinian track,'' the aide said, but he
warned that substantive differences continue to divide Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the midst of dealing with the real heart and soul of
the hardest issues,'' dividing the two sides, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Clinton apparently won a pledge from Barak to not go
ahead immediately with the proposed sale of advanced airborne radar
equipment to China.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials worry that the sale of the $250 million
PHALCON system could give China a strategic edge in controlling air
strikes against neighboring Taiwan, a close U.S. economic and
strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Defense Secretary William Cohen has said the sale of
sophisticated weaponry to China could boomerang on Israel,
particularly if China were later to share it with Israel's Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton voiced U.S. concerns directly to Barak, who agreed to
discuss the issue further with U.S. officials, said the senior
White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister indicated that he understood our concern
and that it would be something we would talk about further,'' the
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak left Washington and was scheduled to return on Wednesday
to Israel, where he was to host Chinese President Jiang Zemin for
the first-ever visit to Israel by a Chinese head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Originally slated as an hour-long conversation, Tuesday's
session turned into an Oval Office mini-summit when, after an hour
and a half of businesslike talks, the two leaders grew hungry and
had the White House mess bring in hamburgers and mixed vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later aides saw trays of cookies being ferried into
the Oval Office, where Clinton and Barak met with only notetakers
accompanying them.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the men emerged at 10:20 p.m. (EST) _ nearly four
hours after their meeting began _ Clinton was in a jovial frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had a big smile on his face,'' the White House
official said, ``and, standing next to the prime minister, he said
'We've solved everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak are working against a self-imposed May 13
deadline for agreeing to a blueprint for peace. They have set a
Sept. 13 deadline for wrapping up the so-called final status issues
dividing their two peoples _ including the contentious matters of
the future of Jerusalem, the question of Palestinian statehood and
the right of Palestinian refugees to return to lands controlled by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of any peace accord between the two call for
Israel to relinquish control of certain territories in the Gaza
Strip and the occupied West Bank in exchange for security
guarantees and an end to anti-Israel attacks from Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hosted Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa for a week of peace talks last January in nearby
Sheperdstown, W.Va. The talks broke down, however, over issues near
the heart of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the first time Clinton had met Barak since
Sheperdstown. It was the first time the two leaders had spoken
since a pair of telephone calls two weeks ago.

TROJANS TO SIGN POINT GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC is expected to sign just one basketball player
today after losing out on a pair of recruits this week. Today is
the first day players can sign national letters-of-intent.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans will sign 5-foot-10 point guard Robert Hutchinson
from Okaloosa-Walton Junior College in Niceville, Fla. Hutchinson
averaged 13.5 points, 7.2 assists and 2.6 rebounds per game this
season. He will enter USC as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   The player USC coveted most - shooting guard Travis Hanour of
Laguna Beach High - selected Arizona on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made the decision (not to go to USC),'' Laguna Beach
coach Bret Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanour committed to USC in late February but changed his mind
and began visiting other schools in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also lost out on Hanour's teammate, 6-foot-9 forward
Chris Manker, who has committed to Oregon State. USC still has
three scholarships available.

COWBOYS RELY ON LACEWELL'S DRAFT EXPERTISE

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Pound for pound, Larry Lacewell is the most
valuable person in the Cowboys' organization.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old director of college and pro scouting _ all
5-foot-6, 174 pounds of him _ has coordinated Cowboys drafts since
1993, one year after walking away from a 30-year college coaching
career that included two national championships (1974 and 1975) as
defensive coordinator at the University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell, from Fordyce, Ark., is a disciple of the late Paul
``Bear'' Bryant, who grew up in nearby Moro Bottoms, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Arvel ``Chink'' Lacewell, Larry's father who died
when Larry was in the ninth grade, were teammates on the Fordyce
High School Redbugs. In giving young Larry his first coaching job
(''I was in charge of just the left guard _ ``seriously'''') on
Alabama's 1959 football team, Bryant became the more influential
person, before or since, living or dead, on Lacewell's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world lost a lawyer because I fell in love with
coaching,'' Lacewell said during a lunch break this week at Valley
Ranch, where evaluations by 19 scouts and coaches are being made
for this weekend's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have five picks, beginning Saturday in the second
round with the 49th selection overall, then not another selection
until the fourth round, 109th overall, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Two wall artifacts particularly stand out inside Lacewell's
executive-size office. One is an oval-shape painting of Bryant. The
painting, which was signed in December 1982 just before Bryant's
death, hangs directly over Lacewell's desk. Across the room is a
framed newspaper account of the 1930 state champion Fordyce
Redbugs, including full-length uniform photos of Bear' Bryant and
Chink Lacewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team beat Don Hutson's team,'' Lacewell said proudly,
referring to the Hall of Fame great from Arkansas, who starred with
the 1935-45 Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   To trace Lacewell's background is to explain his success in
coaching and now scouting. He is truthful in a business where
hiding behind the truth is common and usually considered safer. He
knows talent. He appreciates speed. He knows what he does is not
brain surgery, but you do need to use your brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were geniuses doing this,'' Lacewell said, ``they'd
be making more money than Troy Aikman.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in a mill town. He honed his people skills by working
in the local pool hall. He bonded well with blacks and later used
those experiences to recruit players of all color at a time when
many parts of America were segregated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the last of a generation with my kind of
background,'' Lacewell said. ``We were mill people. We were poor
... but everybody was poor. I drove a truck at the mill because my
mom had been left to raise four children on her own. On Saturdays,
I'd drive 110 miles, all inside the Fordyce city limits. Let me
tell you now, that's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell is a natural-born storyteller and humorist. He draws
from both his small-town upbringing and his big-arena
accomplishments to make points. Lacewell is the first to admit that
his background has allowed him to knock on doors in small towns
across America in search of quality football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Allen is a great example. If you're from Fordyce, Ark.,
you don't walk away from a trip to Sonoma State very well,''
Lacewell said of the Cowboys' 1994 second-round pick (46th overall)
who has been selected to five consecutive Pro Bowls as a starter at
three different offensive-line positions for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell, meanwhile, is considered by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones
to be more than just a war-room confidant at draft time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Lacewell is a treasure, just a tremendous asset to the
organization, because of his experiences and his background at
every level,'' said Jones, who has numerous business ventures aside
from the Cowboys. ``To me, Larry is as valuable a person with whom
I can consult, on a wide range of subjects, as I have available to
me in any walk of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones describes Lacewell as a closet intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   Because while Lacewell doesn't come across as a scholar, he
knows as much about Civil War history as he does the 40-yard times
of cornerbacks in this weekend's NFL draft. He has coached and
taught at the college level. As a student, he received his
bachelor's degree in three years and his masters in one. His
favorite TV shows are A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' and just about anything
on Documentary or the History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking Lacewell's coaching career becomes something of a blur
after 1959 with Bryant at 'Bama: Arkansas State, Arkansas A&AMP;M and
Kilgore Junior College, Oklahoma, Wichita State, Iowa State, and
back to Oklahoma under Barry Switzer and two national
championships, plus three near misses. He finished at Tennessee in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Kilgore Junior College in 1964 for $10,000, I
thought it couldn't get better than that,'' said Lacewell, only
half-jokingly. ``I was single. I had money in pocket, and I had the
Rangerettes in my classroom. It just don't get better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was working with Jimmy Johnson at Wichita State (1967)
and Barry Switzer at Oklahoma (1966 and 1969-78) that paved his way
to success in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry has had the respect of Jimmy, Barry, Chan \RGailey\S and
now Dave Campo,'' Jones said. ``Because he has been a coach, he has
that perspective, and they know it. And because of his background,
starting at such a young age and achieving success at such high
levels, Larry Lacewell makes no excuses. Yet, he has a tolerant
side when it comes to seeing talent and letting others inside the
\Rwar\S room have a voice on matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he does his homework,'' Jones added. ``He's a grinder. In
what the Dallas Cowboys do, he is invaluable.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not engage in predatory lending practices,'' said Anne
Duffield, a lawyer for Centex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The borrower was not happy with the performance of the home
improvement dealer. But we are not involved or connected in any way
to the home improvement dealer,'' she said. ``I think that we are
very honest and up-front with our borrowers.''
</P>
<P>
   By September 1999, Anderson's lawsuit was settled and her case
dismissed. Settlement terms are confidential. Poulikidis said he
paid nothing toward the settlement. Another contractor completed
the improvements.
More safeguards needed
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Anderson was lucky. Not all cases end with the
homeowners getting their repairs, or even keeping their homes,
despite legal protections.
</P>
<P>
   The federal truth in lending law requires creditors to explain
the cost of borrowing so customers can shop for the best deal. In
recent years, Congress amended the law to give borrowers
disclosures in writing at least three business days before loan
closing _ including a warning that they could lose their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Missouri and Kansas legislators are considering new laws.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri would make it a felony to arrange home improvement
loans for consumers without regard for their ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will emphasize the fact,'' said Rep. May Scheve, a
Grantwood Village Democrat, ``that we in Missouri aren't going to
allow these haphazard businesses to set up shop and take advantage
of our senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas Senate committee considered a similar bill: The Unfair
Home Improvement Loans for Senior Citizens and Disabled Persons
Act. But that proposed legislation is likely to expire this year
for lack of interest among elected officials, according to banking
and insurance committee staff.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's bill, meanwhile, has been passed by the House and has
a good chance of Senate approval, sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, the mayor's staff recognized similar problems in
home-improvement lending. It was the story of a widow and her son
that spurred Mayor Kay Barnes' staff to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Williams and her son, who has cerebral palsy and uses a
wheelchair, faced foreclosure because she unwittingly had signed up
for a $14,000 home improvement loan. Eventually, she fell behind in
payments and faced eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends began working in her behalf, calling various
agencies. Neighborhood advocates in the mayor's office enlisted
Legal Aid lawyers. Concerned citizens set up a fund, and Legal Aid
attorneys bought back Williams' home with $9,000 in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Now a city-sponsored task force _ of lawyers, credit counselors
and city staff _ is ready to take up the cause by educating
homeowners and fighting unscrupulous contractors and lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard about people within certain ZIP codes getting
hit with this stuff,'' said task force leader Donovan Mouton. ``We
can use the same methods, get the same lists and get people this
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson still gets mail from other home improvement
contractors, but she's more cautious now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust them,'' she said. ``I throw their letters in the
trash.''

EDITORIAL: FLAWED ELECTION IN PERU 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 12:
</P>
<P>
   Peru's presidential election reeks of fraud. This is not
surprising, given President Alberto Fujimori's disdain for
democratic principles, but even he should recognize that the
balloting irregularities invalidate the re-election victory he is
eager to claim. There must be a new, independently monitored
election.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote was marred by unexplained counting delays,
credible allegations of fraud and a suspiciously rising vote total
for Fujimori. His main opponent, Alejandro Toledo, stormed out of
obscurity in recent weeks to challenge the incumbent. Election Day
exit polls and counts organized by the Organization of American
States and Transparencia, a private monitoring group largely
financed by the United States, showed that Toledo had apparently
forced Fujimori into a runoff. A day later the government released
partial returns showing Fujimori with 49.6 percent of the vote, and
by Tuesday it had climbed to 49.8 percent, just short of the 50
percent required to avoid a second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, first elected in 1990, revived a moribund economy and
defeated two dangerous terrorist groups. But throughout his
presidency he has governed autocratically. In a 1992 army-backed
coup, he closed down Congress and the supreme court. In their place
he created a more subservient legislature and judiciary, while his
intelligence service intimidated critics.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori amended the Constitution to permit a second term in
1995. He then unwisely decided to seek a third term and forced the
dismissal of three judges who insisted such a bid would be
unconstitutional. During this year's campaign his allies conducted
smear campaigns against his opponents and disrupted their rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a business school professor and former World Bank
official, benefited from a backlash over Fujimori's manipulations
and his identification with the country's Indian majority, which
has long been excluded from power. Only a fresh vote can produce an
outcome the people of Peru and the rest of the hemisphere can
trust. The United States and Latin American governments should
refuse to recognize Peru's election results until a scrupulously
fair and carefully monitored runoff is conducted. &QL;
