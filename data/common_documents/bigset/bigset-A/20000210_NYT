   LONDON _ About 85 hostages were freed from the hijacked Afghan
airliner at Stansted airport in the early hours on Thursdayy, after
a day of intense negotiation between the police and hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 65 people, hostages and hijackers, remained on board the
plane, which has been sitting on the remote runway at Stansted,
outside London, since Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 a.m., two men in flowing robes _ later identified as
hijackers _ left the plane. Fifteen minutes later, as police
officers converged, passengers began to stream out of the rear
exit, many with their hands held in the air. They were picked up by
two buses and taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those released were women and children, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three days of almost constant negotiation, I am
delighted to announce that about 85 more passengers have been
released by the hostage takers,'' said Assistant Police Constable
Joe Edwards. ``Talks are continuing with the people on board the
craft to ensure the release of the passengers and crew.''
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers' demands have not been disclosed publicly, and the
police have not revealed the nature of the negotiations with the
hijackers, who seized the plane on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There has been widespread speculation that they are seeking
political asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negotiations are at a fairly critical stage,'' Edwards
said. ``We've worked hard throughout the day to build on the trust
which has grown between the negotiators and those on board the
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks are continuing, he said, as the authorities work ``to
secure the safe release of everyone on board the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers, who appear to be armed, seized the Ariana
airlines Boeing 727 shortly after it took off from Kabul on Sunday
night on a domestic flight. They forced the plane on a hectic
journey across central Asia and Russia before landing many hours
later at Stansted.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday, a few passengers were freed, and Tuesday
night, four crew members escaped by breaking the cockpit window and
lowering themselves down a rope. The police said they were the
captain, second captain, first officer and a flight engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, the police had been in near constant radio
contact with the hijackers, who speak English and are believed to
number about 10. The hijackers cut off communications in the middle
of the night, though, apparently out of anger over the escape. At
one point, they pushed a steward down the stairs of the plane. He
suffered a minor cut on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Contact was later restored, and quiet returned for the rest of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   John Broughton, an assistant chief constable, insisted that the
crew's escape had not made matters worse. ``Any people who are
released from the aircraft represent a positive step,'' he told
reporters Wednesday in a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   According to some experts, pilots are taught to try to escape
from a hijacked plane to prevent another takeoff. But pilots often
feel a personal responsibility to stay with the plane and hostages.
</P>
<P>
   About nine crew members remained on board after the escape, but
the police said they did not know whether any knew how to operate
the plane, should the hijackers suddenly demand to leave Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A representative from the United Nations high commissioner for
refugees, Hope Hanish, arrived at the airport on Tuesday night, but
the British government would not comment on speculation that the
hijackers were seeking asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said it was best not to speculate about motives. ``It
is possible that they may be listening to a radio, or that some
passengers have mobile phones,'' he said. ``We will not do anything
to put these people at risk.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Blass didn't retire. He just came back as
Michael Kors.
</P>
<P>
   From fedora hats and ropes of pearls to gangster chalk stripes
and the Gershwin soundtrack, Kors was doing Blass Wednesday at his
fall 2000 show _ the Blass of the 1970s, when the look was an
uptown gal in mannish gray trousers and a slinky silk blouse with a
fox-trimmed chesterfield tossed over her shoulders and a hat tilted
rakishly on her pretty head.
</P>
<P>
   So Kors wasn't straying too far from the apple tree. He stated
in his program notes that his references were ``cocktails at the
Carlyle,'' ``dinner at 21,'' ``opening nights at Radio City.'' He
was hitting all the glamorous chords except the right one.
</P>
<P>
   It was Blass, more than any other designer of his era, who
defined the dressy sportswear look that became synonymous with
big-city American glamour, and which is now returning, with red
lips and stiletto heels, to the runways. For Kors, at the height of
his own career and social success, to have chosen a style so
plainly associated with another designer and another era was not
only silly and unnecessary, it was also oppressive.
</P>
<P>
   It's great that designers want to give clothes a sense of polish
by proposing, as Kors did at his best , such believably modern
looks as a pinstriped gray vest over a matching slim skirt or a
smart salt-and-pepper tweed suit fluffed at the neck with ostrich
feathers. And there is no doubt that Kors, who travels around the
country and knows what his customers want, is right to embellish
his clothes with a conspicuous sense of luxury and importance. No
one wants another safe black suit.
</P>
<P>
   But does anyone really want to go back to the days of swinging
in the Carlyle dripping with pearls, chinchilla and other forms of
fake significance? Come to think of it, does anyone dress for
opening nights at Radio City anymore? For modern clothes to look
convincingly glamorous and urbane, they have to have some genuine
connection to the life of these times. Otherwise, the result is
just parody. And being both young and talented, Kors certainly has
within his own repertory of references the means to avoid such a
deadly trap.
</P>
<P>
   It's relatively easy to sit at a fashion show and be lulled into
thinking there is something wonderful, even novel, about a heathery
green crew-neck sweater worn with a brown crocodile skirt. Such was
the feeling Wednesday at t Ralph Lauren's show in SoHo. There was
the atmosphere of expectation that Lauren, with his front row of
retail and magazine bosses _ and this season, Prince Andrew _ can
always been counted on to deliver. There was the drowsy but
comforting pop music, Annie Lennox singing, ``Hey, hey, I saved the
world today. ...''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there were the clothes. Lauren can romance the
obvious like nobody in this business, making you think a black
V-neck vest worn over a white ladylike charmeuse blouse and tucked
into a black skirt with a narrow belt and matching patent leather
boots is what is happening. The man is a genius at making you wish
for, among other things, a pair of taupe suede pants, now worn
slightly below the waist and with a brown crocodile blazer, or
perhaps a long, straight evening skirt in glen plaid. He can do all
that beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the trouble with suggesting that a woman can look chic in
something as understated as a turtleneck and a skirt is that Lauren
is merely stating the obvious. He needs to push things further. And
this doesn't mean being outrageous or doing his version of Prada
karaoke couture. But he's coasting, giving people what they expect
rather than what they never knew they wanted. And that, after all,
was his great strength _ to reinvent prairie clothes, Western chic,
the hip bohemian in Paris. You name it. Admittedly, it's hard to
expect established designers to do things that are ahead of the
curve, rather than simply on it, but Lauren is neither so old nor
so settled that he still can't pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing: his company's image is too classy to send the
bosomy model Gisele twice (this season and last) out onto the
runway in a tiny bikini top. The purpose was not only transparent,
it was exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   On their way out of Lauren's show, guests instantly saw another
collection. Lola Faturoti, who staged a beautiful show last season
but didn't get much attention, decided to bring her clothes to
editors and retailers, and anyone who happened to be walking down
West Broadway in SoHo at 11 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually piggybacking on Ralph Lauren,'' Faturoti said,
answering reporters' questions as her models, dressed in the manner
of a traditional African princess with traces of England, stood on
the steps in front of the Smith &AMP; Hawken gardening store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' someone shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Lola Faturoti,'' she replied with a smile, ``and here's my
card.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It's a thoroughly different experience getting into a Betsey
Johnson show. First of all, there is the mayhem at the door. On
Tuesday night, the scene outside the restaurant Lot 61 on West 21st
Street recalled for an older member of the fashion press what was
thrilling about fashion 10 years ago, when the crush of groupies
practically lifted you off your feet and swept you into a Vivienne
Westwood or a Claude Montana show.
</P>
<P>
   At Johnson's show, a woman in a white fur coat who was minding
the door was screaming at some photographers _ ``Not one more
photographer is getting in here!'' _ and telling the security
guards to do their jobs. They started puffing up hilariously like
the Incredible Hulk.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, people were mashed together on the banquettes laughing
and talking and sipping Champagne out of little bottles through
straws. Then, at 9:50 p.m., there was a clang of rock 'n' roll, and
from behind a black curtain out stepped a tough-looking woman in a
black fur motorcycle jacket, vinyl hot pants and fishnets. Johnson
was doing her rocker thing, with flaring tutus, slinky neon knits,
sequins a go-go and big matted hair. But it was fun.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the runways on Tuesday, Nicole Miller sent out a
solid, on-the-money collection of clingy striped knit tops,
decorated bustiers over chiffon blouses in mulberry and olive, and
some terrific little 1980s-style belted georgette dresses edged
with ruffles.
</P>
<P>
   What was Vivienne Tam up to on Tuesday night? Hard to say. She
opened with gold distressed leather, a simple cap-sleeve dress in
dark brown iridescent silk embroidered with wild flowers, and some
of those novel zigzag knits that are a trend this season. But with
velvet-flocked chiffon tops following distinctly down-market
dresses with gold sequined star bursts, it was hard to tell which
direction Tam was taking.

NEIL ARMSTRONG RECALLS ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF SPACE PROGRAM FOR KC
AUDIENCE

<P>
   Calling himself ``just a nerdy engineer,'' former astronaut Neil
Armstrong on Wednesday reminded members of the Heavy Constructors
Association of the accomplishments of the American space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago, the world was changing,'' Armstrong said to
an audience of about 200 at the Kansas City Downtown Marriott,
where the association was celebrating its 50th anniversary.
``Enormous advances in flight were made. It was the beginning of
the space age.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts at the time were skeptical that the United States
could rocket a man into space _ let alone land him on the moon and
return him to Earth, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an expert, no matter how brilliant, tells an engineer
what he cannot do, it lights a fire under his belly,'' Armstrong
said. ``Nothing feels better to an engineer than to prove an expert
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   After his tour of duty with the Navy ended, Armstrong earned a
bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from Purdue
University. He was accepted by NASA as an astronaut in 1962. On
March 16, 1966, he flew his first space mission as command pilot of
Gemini 8, surviving an emergency landing in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, 1969, Armstrong, who was 39, became the first man to
walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the wonderful privilege of taking a trip that even just
a few months before I never would have dreamed of making,'' he
said. ``I do believe that all natural laws have not been
discovered. I believe great challenges remain to be met.''

MOVIN' ON: AC TIVE ADULTS TOO FIT FOR `SENIOR' LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, Margaret Corbellini runs a mile, swims laps and
climbs stairs. At 62, she also qualifies for Denny's senior
special, a $3.75 movie and AARP membership.
</P>
<P>
   Although Corbellini may be an overachiever, she and her less
active friends over 60 share a concern: They don't feel old.
</P>
<P>
   As people live longer and stay active, many find that the
``senior citizen'' label doesn't fit. It often suggests frail,
elderly people hitting early-bird dinners and passing time in
rocking chairs.
</P>
<P>
   So, many older people, from church group leaders to Sun City
residents, are searching for a new way to define themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gerlich, 68, found that many people weren't joining the
``senior'' activities at his Phoenix church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like it's for your grandma or grandpa,'' says
Gerlich, a retired corporate trainer. ``I think people would get
more involved in activities if they didn't think, `Oh, it's a bunch
of old people.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to create new names, including ``west of 60'' _ but
that sounded like directions off the Superstition Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Other names have been suggested but haven't caught on, either.
Third Age is the name of a group devoted to issues for older
people.
</P>
<P>
   Many dismiss ``golden'' as sounding too Disneyesque. And
psychologists have coined the term ``explorers'' for people in
their 70s and 80s at full steam and in good health.
</P>
<P>
   One gym calls its seniors ``the silver sneakers.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey of journalists who cover aging found older readers
disliked ``senior citizens'' and ``elderly.'' The most preferred
term was senior, followed by older Americans, adults or people.
</P>
<P>
   And MatureConnections.com, an Internet magazine, is taking a
poll, asking people over 50 to vote for ``senior citizen'' or
``mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some experts on aging would prefer not to label people,
reality calls for it. And often, coming together as a group brings
power, such as senior lobbying organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are living so much longer that these terms are losing
their utility,'' says James Birren, associate director for the
Center on Aging at UCLA. ``That's the question: `When is old, old?'
When we live to be 150, will senior life begin at 85? Will 60 be
middle age if people live to be 120?''
</P>
<P>
   The average life span now is 76, and some scientists say it
could double by the end of the 21st century. Already, an estimated
70,000 Americans are 100 years old or older, triple the number in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   And in the next 20 years, an expected 40 million baby boomers
will retire and become seniors, or whatever they will be called.
</P>
<P>
   Birren says he tries not to say senior or senior citizen when he
talks to his autobiography class where most students are over 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``When referring to myself, I just say I'm 81,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Zuckerman, founder of one of the nation's best-known spas,
Tucson's Canyon Ranch, is trying to create a community for those
over 55, focusing on health and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'll call it, maybe optimal living,'' says
Zuckerman, 71. ``But it won't have the name senior in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketers have gotten involved, calling AARP's magazine,
``Modern Maturity,'' and gently referring to restricted-age
communities like Sun City as ``active adult'' communities.
</P>
<P>
   Corbellini, who lives in Sun City Grand, says she feels younger
now since she's retired from work.
</P>
<P>
   Corbellini says although she doesn't think of herself as a
senior citizen and would prefer a different label, it's not that
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I still look good in a bikini,'' she says, after
finishing her morning exercise routine. ``That's what matters.'' &QL;

BOEING URGES INSPECTION OF STABILIZER JACKSCREWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Boeing Co., with the backing of the Federal
Aviation Administration, last night recommended operators of planes
like the Alaska Airlines MD-83 jetliner that crashed off the
California coast last week inspect the mechanism that moves a key
control surface on the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Only planes undergoing maintenance need to be inspected at this
time, Boeing said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, while ``strongly encouraging'' inspections, said it
would not make them mandatory at this time. The agency will get
reports on the inspections and is prepared to take immediate action
if a safety problem is found, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least three airlines that fly planes related to the
MD-83 said they were planning or doing inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines lead the way, announcing early Wednesday
afternoon that it would check all 34 of the MD-80s in its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is purely precautionary,'' airline spokesman Greg Witter
said. ``We don't want to worry anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska checked most planes in Seattle Wednesday, and Witter said
there would be some delays during the two-hour inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sea-Tac has it easy, because so many planes cycle through
there, we have more flexibility when it comes to substituting
equipment,'' he said. ``We do expect slight delays in the system,
though we're trying to minimize them.''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines announced it would also inspect its 284 MD-80s
and MD-90s over the next week, while Continental Airlines plans a
rolling inspection of its fleet. Delta Air Lines also said it would
perform inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The area to be inspected includes a component known as the
jackscrew, which adjusts the horizontal stabilizer atop the plane's
tail. The jackscrew is basically a 22-inch threaded rod that passes
through a large nut. When turned by an electric motor, the
stabilizer moves up or down to balance the plane in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer has become the focus of the investigation into
the Jan. 31 crash of Alaska Flight 261 off the coast of Southern
California. In all, 88 people were killed, including about 50 from
the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of Flight 261 were troubleshooting a stabilizer
problem for more than 30 minutes before the plane crashed. The
problem grew progressively worse until the stabilizer jammed in its
full-up position, which sent the jet into a steep dive from its
cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   This latest development in the fast-moving investigation came
after the U.S. Navy recovered Flight 261's jackscrew from the
Pacific. The screw showed signs of damage.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board metallurgists will examine
the jackscrew to determine if the damage came before the crash, or
as a result of the tremendous impact of the plane slamming nearly
straight into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was before the impact, then it is very significant in
terms of determining what caused the crash,'' NTSB Chairman James
Hall said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the jackscrew assembly from Flight 261, the
safety board decided to inspect the same assembly on three MD-80
series aircraft currently undergoing heavy maintenance. The
condition of the assembly from flight 261 will be compared to the
in-service units.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83 that crashed was built by McDonnell Douglas in Long
Beach, Calif. Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997, and ended
production of the series in December, delivering the last plane to
TWA.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's recommendation, sent to all operators worldwide,
applies not only to the MD-80 series but also the MD-90 and the new
717, as well as older DC-9s. All use a similar stabilizer control
system.
</P>
<P>
   The 717 was known the MD-95 until Boeing changed the name. Only
12 have been delivered to customers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,100 of the MD-80 series planes are in service
worldwide, including about 700 in the U.S. fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said there are 800 DC-9s still in service. Northwest
Airlines is one of that plane's biggest operators. About 111 MD-90s
are in service worldwide, with production expected to end this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we just want to gather data to determine if further
action is necessary should we see issues arising in certain
patterns,'' said John Dern, Boeing's spokesman for safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing recommended five areas of inspection:
</P>
<P>
   Check the jackscrew and nut for wear;
</P>
<P>
   Test the trim-indicating system and shut-off controls;
</P>
<P>
   Inspect lubrication of the jackscrew assembly;
</P>
<P>
   Check the general condition of the mechanical stops;
</P>
<P>
   Check the general condition of the jackscrew assembly
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing is asking airlines to provide any
maintenance information related to jackscrew damage or wear. That
recommendation came at the request of the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   If the voluntary inspections uncover damage or unusual
wear-and-tear of the jackscrew or other parts of the stabilizer
moving mechanism, the FAA could make such inspections mandatory
throughout the U.S. fleet by issuing what's known as an
airworthiness directive.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the matter said neither the safety board nor
the FAA has identified a specific safety concern that would warrant
an emergency airworthiness directive at this time, though that
could quickly change.
</P>
<P>
   Eliott Brenner, chief spokesman for FAA boss Jane Garvey, last
night told the Post-Intelligencer the agency was working closely
with the airlines and with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right and prudent thing to do,'' Brenner said.
``It's important that we take every opportunity to gather all the
information we can that will help us decide whether any additional
action might be necessary. We have been talking with carriers and
strongly encouraging them to make these inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was on a flight from Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, to Seattle, with a planned stop in San Francisco, when it
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after take off, the plane's autopilot was disengaged
and the pilots flew the plane by hand for nearly two hours. Experts
said this strongly suggests a stabilizer trim system developed
early in the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is moved up or down _ ``trimmed'' _ to help keep
the plane stable. A jetliner's nose has a tendency to pitch up or
down in flight because of the aerodynamics of the wing.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261's flight data recorder shows the stabilizer never
moved into the down position, which would have trimmed the plane's
nose up. It only moved in the up position, meaning the pilots would
have had to constantly pull back on the control column to keep the
nose of the MD-83 from pitching down.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 minutes before the crash, the stabilizer jammed in the
full-up position and the plane, cruising at 31,000 feet, suddenly
dropped 7,000 at three times its normal descent rate.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots recovered after about a minute and were able to
maintain some control while descending to 18,000, where the wing
flaps began to extend to 11 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the plane began to fall out of control. Its nose
pitched down at 26 degrees-per-second, eventually reaching 70
degrees. The jet subsequently rolled into an inverted dive and
plunged into the ocean without regaining level flight. The final
dive from 17,900 feet lasted about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane began its final dive, several ground radar sites
showed what could have been pieces coming off. Aviation experts
have speculated that part of the stabilizer broke off. It's
possible, they said, that so-called ``stops'' on the jackscrew
assembly, which are designed to prevent the stabilizer from moving
further than it is supposed to, may have failed, allowing the
stabilizer to move even further in the up position, pushing the
plane into the steep dive from which the pilots were unable to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   Several pieces of the stabilizer have already been hauled up
from the ocean at the main crash site. Investigators should be able
to tell by examining the wreckage if part of the stabilizer broke
off, or if the stabilizer moved past its design limits.

 BATTLE OVER RESTORING BAD-FAITH LAWSUITS  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Insurance companies and personal injury lawyers are
clashing in an all-out battle over a pair of March 7 ballot
initiatives that ask voters to overturn two laws that allow people
injured in accidents to sue insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Propositions 30 and 31 would keep the laws on the books and
allow the lawsuits. Insurance companies led the drive to place both
measures on the ballot in hopes of overturning the legislation, and
the industry has spent $44 million urging voters to reject the
measures. More than $30 million of that money came from just two
companies _ State Farm and Farmers insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The laws, which were passed by the Legislature last year but put
on hold pending the outcome of the election, apply to all liability
insurance, including auto and home. For example, the laws, which
were supported by personal injury lawyers, would allow people
injured in a car accident to sue the other driver's insurer for bad
faith if they believe the company has unfairly and fraudulently
denied or delayed payment of their legitimate claims.
</P>
<P>
   Among the groups opposing the measures are taxpayers
associations and the California Chamber of Commerce. The California
Trial Lawyers Association, whose members specialize in representing
injured people, is leading and largely financing the campaign in
support of the measures, backed by groups including the American
Association of Retired People and the California Nurses
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say that without the potential for consumer lawsuits,
insurance companies have no incentive to settle a claim in a timely
manner. They cite examples of companies taking as long as four
years to settle a claim stemming from an accident. In other cases,
elderly or seriously injured people have died before their cases
were settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance companies routinely delay claims if they think
people are too old, too sick or too undereducated,'' said Kelly
Hayes-Raitt, the spokeswoman for the Yes on 30 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But a study by Californians for Affordable Insurance Rates, a
broad coalition of business and other groups opposing the
legislation, said restoration of bad-faith lawsuits could boost
auto insurance premiums by $1.3 billion, or an average of nearly 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should vote against this because it will increase their
insurance premiums, whether homeowner, auto or business
liability,'' said John Sullivan, president of the insurance
industry-backed Civil Justice Association of California. ``But
mostly, they should realize that all this does is benefit trial
lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws would reinstate a narrow version of what is known as
the Royal Globe doctrine. Royal Globe dates back to 1979 when the
state Supreme Court ruled that a person could file a bad-faith
lawsuit against another person's insurance company over justified
claims that were delayed or denied.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1989, the court threw out that rule, citing ``undesirable
social and economic effects'' in the form of high insurance rates
and crowded courts.
</P>
<P>
   The laws were modified last year during the legislative process,
with Davis insisting on changes that include a six-year sunset
date, which means the laws expire in six years; a limit restricting
claims to cases in which the net judgment does not exceed $1
million; exclusions for business and class action suits; and
increases of possible penalties for insurance companies from $5,000
to $50,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between opponents and supporters of the laws has
often been nasty. When the opponents of the laws tried to claim
that the legislation would allow drunken drivers to sue insurance
companies, supporters had Attorney General Bill Lockyer issue an
opinion that the law specifically prohibits drunken drivers from
any legal recourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (opponents) are being downright deceitful,''
Hayes-Raitt said. ``The insurance companies were at the table as
these laws were being crafted. They got things in them that, as a
consumer advocate, I find distasteful, but that's part of the
process. Now they are forcing voters to approve what the
Legislature and the governor already agreed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it took so long to get the measures on the ballot, they
were not included in the large voter guide sent out by the
California Secretary of State. A smaller guide with these two
propositions will be mailed before the election.

AS INTERNET SITES STAGGER UNDER ATTACKS, RENO PROMISES 
 INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno opened a federal investigation
Wednesday into the hacking incidents that have shaken the Internet
this week, saying that ``preventing cyber crimes is one of our top
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's remarks came at a Washington, D.C., press conference a
few hours after two more Bay Area Web sites _ E-Trade and ZDNet _
were shut down or slowed down by so-called denial-of-service
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto, Calif.-based E-Trade, one of the biggest online stock
brokerages, was unavailable to many users between 5:15 and 8 a.m.,
according to Keynote Systems, an Internet monitoring firm in San
Mateo, Calif. Hackers also attacked San Francisco technology site
ZDNet, which was completely or partially shut down between 4:15 and
7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday, leading sites including Yahoo, Amazon,
eBay and CNN.com were attacked by hackers who hijacked computers to
inundate them with messages that shut out legitimate users.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the machines that have been hijacked are believed to be
workstations running some version of the Unix operating system, not
ordinary PCs or Macs, said Lloyd Taylor, vice president of
operations with Keynote. Taylor said he heard that the largest
attacks this week involved 230 machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software tools the hackers are now using are very nicely
written _ brilliantly designed to avoid detection,'' he said. ``The
communications between the handler (the machine that controls the
attack) and the daemon (the software on other machines that
actually carries out the attacks) is designed so it can't be
traced.''
</P>
<P>
   At its press conference Wednesday, the FBI seemed to have little
idea of who or where the hacker or hackers might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we are not aware of the motives behind these
attacks, but they appear to be intended to interfere with or
disrupt legitimate electronic commerce,'' Reno said. All the sites
attacked are involved in e-commerce. ``That is the reason why the
FBI has initiated a criminal investigation into these matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors, the National Infrastructure Protection
Center and even the intelligence community, secret service and
military would help search for the hackers, said Ron Dick, chief of
the computer investigations and operations section of the National
Infrastructure Protection Center
</P>
<P>
   Reno pointed out that the Clinton administration requested an
extra $37 million to fight cybercrime last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has changed not only the way we do business, it
has changed the way criminals do business too,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI reiterated what computer security experts have been
saying for days: Distributed denial of service attackers take over
computers without their owners' knowledge, and use those ``slave''
computers as battleships to attack major Web sites. The best way to
stop the attacks is for ordinary computer users, small businesses
and small networks such as universities to install software
preventing their computers from being hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Alan Phillips, ZDNet's vice president of
operations and technology, said FBI agents were in his office to
discuss the case. ZDNet was also in contact with other victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with other large Web sites that have been
attacked to form a coalition to heighten the fence, identify
patterns and keep researching,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts say it may be impossible to find the people
responsible for shutting down ZDNet, Yahoo and the other targets.
</P>
<P>
   The hackers have ``the ability to masquerade, spoof and hide
behind a couple layers of networks and service,'' said Fred Rica, a
computer security expert with PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rica said the victims and law enforcement are
doing the right thing by trying to track down the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give it your best shot. I just think it's going to
be hard to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge scale of this week's attacks, Hal Varian, dean
of Berkeley's School of Information Management, said he doesn't
think it will seriously undermine confidence in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who use and invest in the Internet are sophisticated
and understand that it is still a young technology and that there
are risks,'' Varian said. ``That's why the rewards from investing
in the Internet have been so great.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, society needs to catch up with technology to
resolve issues raised by these attacks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``If you leave a computer unguarded which could
potentially be used for this kind of attack, there could be some
liability associated with that,'' Varian said.
</P>
<P>
   And who is responsible for financial losses if a stock traders
are unable to complete transactions on E-Trade? The investor? The
company? The Internet service provider? Those questions remain to
be answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, the problem isn't that the Internet is
immature,'' says Varian. ``It's that the legal system and the
policies are immature.''

 AIRLINES INSPECTING KEY PART IN TAIL  &HT;     By MICHAEL TAYLOR 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines said Wednesday it is inspecting a key part in
the horizontal stabilizers of all 34 of its MD-80 jetliners after
federal investigators recovered the part from the wreckage of
Flight 261 and found it was stripped.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came shortly after National Transportation
Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said a two-foot section of the
jackscrew, which drives the stabilizer back and forth, was found
damaged. The section of jackscrew was lying in the main wreckage at
the bottom of the Santa Barbara Channel, about 10 miles off the
Ventura County coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared to investigators who looked at the mechanism ...
that there was some damage to it,'' Hall said. ``It was unclear
whether the damage was pre-impact or from hitting the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew is a threaded shaft similar to that used in some
electric garage-door openers. When the shaft turns, it stays in
place, but a nut that is on the shaft moves backward or forward,
depending on the rotational direction of the shaft itself.
</P>
<P>
   When the nut goes in one direction, the leading edge of the
stabilizer goes up and the nose goes down. When the nut goes in the
other direction, the nose of the plane goes up.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines said its inspection of all 34 MD-80s in its
fleet of 88 planes was scheduled to be completed by the end of
Wednesday. Airline spokeswoman Donna Hartman said no plane would
leave the ground until it had been inspected.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, American Airlines, whicrHperates 284 MD-80s, the
world's largest fleet of these twin-engine jets, said it, too, is
inspecting ``key parts of the stabilizer'' on its airplanes.
American said it will take about one week to inspect all its
MD-80s. The inspection takes about half an hour for each plane.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Delta Air Lines said it is conducting similar
inspections on its 136 MD-80 airplanes. All the planes should be
inspected by the end of this week, according to airline spokeswoman
Kimberly King.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a few hours after the plane crashed on January 31,
killing all 88 passengers and crew members, attention has focused
on the horizontal stabilizer, a 40-foot wing that sits on top of
the plane's tail. The stabilizer's job is to keep the plane level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happens to that jackscrew _ in the worst-case
scenario, it breaks _ there's nothing to prevent the leading edge
of the stabilizer from going to its full limits, up or down,'' said
Ned Clarke, an aviation safety analyst. ``If it were to break or
come loose, it might go too far and damage some structure (in the
tail). Whatever's holding the stabilizer from flying off the
aircraft may gradually weaken and let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, the safety board chairman, said Tuesday that an
examination of radar information during the frantic moments when
the pilots were trying everything they could to control the plane
indicates parts may have flown off the plane. Hall asked Navy
search teams to look for possible pieces in an area four miles away
from the main wreckage site.
</P>
<P>
   Another aviation safety consultant, retired TWA pilot Barry
Schiff, said that although it is not yet clear whether the
jackscrew was damaged before or after the plane hit the water after
free-falling from 17,900 feet, ``it's more likely that it happened
before that impact. The plane was already out of control in its
nose-up, nose-down attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he agrees with other experts who have analyzed the
crash of Fight 261, Schiff said, he also thinks there may be more
to it than just a failed jackscrew.
</P>
<P>
   What puzzles Schiff and other analysts, he said, is that after
the plane started having trouble, flying along with its nose going
up and down, sometimes in control, sometimes not, there still is no
explanation ``for the erratic behavior of the aircraft just before
it went into the sea _ the wallowing and gyrations it went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three pilots flying nearby at the time of the crash
reported seeing Flight 261 corkscrewing and tumbling, sometimes
upside down, its final minute before hitting the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Schiff said, ``leads many of us to believe (the
overall cause) was something else. I'm convinced the stabilizer is
part of it, but maybe it's not just the jackscrew. There may be
something else in the structure of the horizontal stabilizer.''

 FAA NEGLECTED TO DISCLOSE $70,000 FINE AGAINST AMWEST  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
The Federal Aviation Administration fined America West $70,000 in
1999 for carrying oxygen canisters, a banned hazardous material
linked to a ValuJet crash that killed 110 people.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fine was never disclosed by the FAA despite a policy of
reporting fines that exceed $50,000, a pledge that was made soon
after the ValuJet crash to restore public confidence in the
agency's oversight of air safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic learned details of the violation Tuesday
after filing a Freedom of Information Act request.
</P>
<P>
   America West paid the fine in June 1999, a month before FAA
officials in Washington waived a $2.5 million penalty over previous
safety and maintenance violations.
</P>
<P>
   The fine of Tempe-based America West was not disclosed because
the Los Angeles FAA office, for an unknown reason, did not report
it to the regional public affairs office in Seattle, FAA spokesman
Mitch Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a large organization, there is going to be
papers lost and misplaced,'' he said. ``We were wrong. It's one of
those things that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine was for two incidents that occurred in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to disclose the America West violation doesn't
surprise Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S.
Department of Transportation and a frequent FAA critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has fallen through the cracks at the FAA that public
notification of a violation is just one more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said the airline has ``a
very comprehensive hazardous-material preventive program that was
reviewed and approved by the FAA.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is confident that the program will prevent other
such incidents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When America West paid the $70,000 penalty eight months ago, FAA
officials in Phoenix were recommending that the agency not
immediately waive the $2.5 million fine until the airline did more
to resolve safety and maintenance problems.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of carrying oxygen canisters in the cargo hold of
passenger aircraft is that the containers can fuel a fire if they
are accidentally activated, according to airline safety expert Todd
Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen canisters on ValuJet Flight 592 initiated a deadly fire
aboard the aircraft, according to the National Transportation
Safety Board report on the 1996 accident.
</P>
<P>
   America West was cited for two violations involving the oxygen
canisters, according to an FAA civil penalty letter obtained by The
Republic. The first was on June 21, 1998, on an America West flight
from Phoenix to Las Vegas. The second was four days later when
America West shipped oxygen canisters on another airline, Southwest
Aircraft Charter, from Phoenix to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Both involved shipments of fiberboard boxes that were marked
``Crewmember Protective Breathing Equipment,'' the emergency oxygen
systems used by pilots in the event of a rapid aircraft
decompression.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA originally sought a $260,000 fine against America West,
but agreed to settle for $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Al Bieber, a now-retired FAA supervisor who oversaw the Phoenix
office when the violations occurred, said America West ``got lots
of warning'' and training from the FAA on how to prevent
hazardous-materials shipments, including the oxygen canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Other hazardous-materials violations are more common on major
airlines. Southwest Airlines, the other dominant carrier in
Phoenix, paid nearly $44,000 last year for carrying a container of
cesium on a passenger flight. &QL;

REDS AND MARINERS AGREE ON TENTATIVE GRIFFEY DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it appeared that the Seattle Mariners and the
Cincinnati Reds had exhausted their attempts to work out a trade
that would send Ken Griffey Jr. to the Reds, the clubs reached
agreement on a contingency deal on Wednesday, a baseball official
said on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of contingency trades, the official said, the
commissioner's office had granted the Reds a 72-hour period in
which to speak with Griffey and his agent, Brian Goldberg. If the
Reds and Griffey work out a new contract in that time, the deal
would be completed. If they do not, the Reds would have to decide
whether to make the trade anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came just as Major League Baseball was
investigating the Mariners and the Reds for improperly allowing
Goldberg to speak to the Reds without a trade in place. Another
official said on Wednesday that representatives of the
commissioner's office had talked with both clubs about reports that
the Mariners had given the agent permission to speak with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said in a telephone interview Tuesday that Chuck
Armstrong, the Mariners' president, had told him that morning he
could talk to the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning,'' Goldberg said, ``the Mariners said: `Brian,
you try to break this thing. If you can do something in the next
couple days, fine. If not let's shut it down.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the agent's involvement had any impact on
the ability of the teams to reach agreement on a trade. It was also
not clear if the commissioner's office would proceed with their
investigation and possibly fine the teams for straying beyond the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been reports that the teams were working on
a three-team trade, the official who told of the agreement said
this deal was strictly between the Mariners and the Reds. He
declined to identify the players who would move to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Reports had circulated earlier in the week that the players the
teams had most recently discussed were two pitchers, Brett Tomko, a
right-handed starter, and Dennys Reyes, a left-handed reliever, and
a minor league infielder, Antonio Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had previously insisted on getting Pokey Reese, the
Reds' good young second baseman, but Jim Bowden, the Reds' general
manager, refused to include him. Last Dec. 11, at the winter
meetings in Anaheim, Calif., Bowden called off talks with the
Mariners, saying there was no sense continuing to talk because
there was one player _ he didn't identify him as Reese _ that the
Mariners wanted and he would not give up.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bowden did not hide his lust for Griffey. He called
Griffey his favorite player in baseball and said he wanted no one
in the Reds' lineup more than the extremely talented center
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, 30, began his wild winter when he told Mariners
officials in November that he planned to leave them as a free agent
at the end of the 2000 season, and it was decided that a trade
would be in everyone's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey, who has hit 398 home runs in his career, had the
right to veto a trade because he has been in the major leagues 10
years, the last 5 with the same team. He initially gave the
Mariners a list of anywhere from four to seven teams he would
accept a trade to but later reduced the list to one team _ the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were in position to make a trade with the Mets at
the winter meetings, but Griffey said he would not approve a trade
to them.

 NBA OWNERS DELAYING APPROVAL OF CUBAN'S
PURCHASE OF MAVS (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By DWAIN
PRICE c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mark Cuban is accustomed to getting what he wants,
including the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cuban will have to wait for final approval from the 28
other NBA owners. Sources said the NBA Board of Governors has
decided not to vote this weekend on Cuban's bid to purchase a
controlling interest in the team from Ross Perot Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Perot has turned over operation of the team to Cuban, but
sources said some NBA owners have disapproved of Cuban's
high-profile handling of the team.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said the owners won't vote on Cuban's bid until
March 1 at the earliest. Cuban said he is aware the vote will not
occur this weekend, but declined further comment last night.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners have privately questioned Cuban's catering to the
Mavericks players.
</P>
<P>
   When an ice storm hit the area on Jan. 27, Cuban sent private
limos to each of the players homes to make sure they arrived safely
to Reunion Arena for a game against the Los Angeles Clippers and
returned safely back to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks guard Greg Buckner is renting one of Cuban's cars for
$15 a day, and Dennis Rodman is renting Cuban's 1,800-square-foot
Preston Hollow guest home for $3,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban also threw a Super Bowl party for the players and coaches
at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban is familiar with some of the other owners' disdain for his
generous treatment of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated'' quoted Cuban as saying, ``I've met some
of them, and they made it very clear I'm still just a prospective
owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Ross Perot Jr. is still the official owner of the
Mavericks, although Cuban and his minority owners signed a letter
of intent on Jan. 3 to purchase the team for an NBA record $280
million.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the NBA Board of Governors votes on the Mavericks'
sale, Cuban must receive 22 of the 28 votes from the owners for the
sale to be completed. Otherwise, operation of the Mavericks will
revert to Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who attended last night's game, said he believes the
owners will approve the sale to Cuban. He also said he's going to
the All-Star Game with Cuban so he can personally introduce him to
all of the NBA owners.
</P>
<P>
   Perot also said he did not approve of the Mavericks signing
Dennis Rodman before he sold controlling interest to Cuban. But
when Cuban broached the idea, Perot gave his blessings along with
some conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that Mark wanted to do, so I gave Mark a couple
of conditions,'' Perot said. ``The main thing I wanted was the
players to approve it, and they did. And I'm here to help Mark make
it happen.''

LEWIS, SONICS UPSTAGE RODMAN'S RETURN WITH MAVS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ His hair dyed blonde and his body covered with perhaps
more tattoos than anyone remembers, Dennis Rodman did what he does
second-best in life.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentric power forward and rebounding machine stepped back
onto a basketball court and electrified an NBA arena with his mere
presence. At age 38, Rodman, who made his season debut Wednesday
night with the Dallas Mavericks, turned Reunion Arena into a
big-top circus.
</P>
<P>
   What the Mavericks did not count on was the Sonics bringing
their own show-stopper: Rashard Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis scored 16 of his career-high 30 points in the fourth
quarter as the Sonics beat the Mavs 117-106 and snapped a two-game
losing streak. Despite the hype and fanfare surrounding Rodman's
first game, Lewis left the biggest impression on an announced
sellout crowd of 18,203.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my intention. I knew he was going to bring a lot of
intensity to the game,'' Lewis said, smiling. ``I just wanted to
pump my team up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis did more than energize the Sonics. He blew the Mavs away
by attacking the basket and playing with poise down the stretch. At
the final buzzer, after Lewis scored nine of the team's final 13
points, the Sonics mobbed the 20-year-old as if he were a rock
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was awesome. We saluted him when he came in the locker
room,'' guard Brent Barry said, fanning both arms. ``And he was
classic Rashard. He didn't say a word. He just stood there
smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny. Lewis is really the antithesis of Rodman. He is a
soft-spoken, well-mannered young man who is often encouraged to
play with a mean streak. He normally would not have even played 34
minutes off the bench. But Ruben Patterson fell hard to the floor
in the first quarter and suffered a right knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's absence gave Lewis his chance. He converted 13 of
his 20 shots and was arguably the most active player on the boards.
Lewis had 12 rebounds, and seven of those were gathered cleaning up
his teammates' misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing but confidence,'' Lewis said. ``I do that in practice,
but I feel that when you come off the bench you have to lift the
team up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, ahead by 11 points after the first quarter,
controlled the game but had to fight off several Dallas runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 96-92 with 6:24 left, Lewis grabbed an offensive rebound
and scored. He followed that play by stealing the ball at midcourt
from Dallas' Michael Finley. Lewis then drove the lane, scooped
another layup and was fouled. His three-point play put the Sonics
in control for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rose to the occasion,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.
``The reason I think he's going to make it in this league is
because he's so good in the clutch. Rashard has shown that over and
over in crunch time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis kept the game ball and presented it to his mother,
Juanita, afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had one of those games you dream about,'' Mavs coach Don
Nelson said. ``He looks like a fine young player. Dennis Rodman
played well when he played, definitely a little rusty, but I see
possibilities here. I liked what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman finished with 13 rebounds, five fouls and no points in 32
minutes, missing the only shot he attempted. He wasn't at full
speed and wasn't a factor in the fourth quarter, but he did fill
Reunion Arena. It was just the second time the Mavs had sold out a
home game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who wore No. 70, had been scheduled to come off the
bench and play no more than 15 minutes. But he started at power
forward and center Shawn Bradley came off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was still the same old Dennis,'' said Sonics center Horace
Grant, who defended Rodman. ``He's still the same pushing Dennis.
He wasn't in basketball shape. I would give him another week and
then you will see the old Dennis.''

 TIME AWAY HASN'T CHANGED RODMAN (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) By JIM REEVES c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Other than getting a ticket to the game _ it was the
first Mavs sellout since Junior Perot got out of knee pants or the
Portland game last month, whichever came first _ the toughest thing
about Dennis Rodman's Mavericks' debut last night at Reunion Arena
was deciding what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   I spent an hour and a half wondering what would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In my wife's closet.
</P>
<P>
   Never could figure out where she keeps the feather boas, but
when she caught me studying a chic little black number with
matching heels, she chased me out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   See, Mark Cuban, what you have wrought?
</P>
<P>
   Cuban seemed almost embarrassed by the circus-like atmosphere
that permeated Reunion Arena, but he wasn't blushing over the
sellout. Perot, the soon-to-be-ex-owner, and Emmitt Smith sat
elbow-to elbow in the front row, just a few seats from Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Fans wearing multi-colored wigs, their faces painted blue and
green, carried ``Rodman for President'' signs. They must have read
the dog-eared pages in Dennis' book.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we win, that's all that matters,'' said Cuban, who
might actually benefit from a trip to Rodman's hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   That victory will have to come another night, and against a
lesser team than the Seattle Supersonics.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics got 30 points off the bench from Rashard Lewis, who
was playing for Aleif Elsik High School two years ago, and 25 from
Gary Payton to put a chill in the Mavs' big night, 117-106.
</P>
<P>
   Do not, however, blame Rodman for that.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, whose youthful exuberance and bottomless billions have
imbued the Mavs with a new fire, has countered those positive steps
by dropping the team's already ragged image to a new low by hiring
the multi-pierced, multi-tattooed, cross-dressing Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it's in feather boa, pink negligee or brand new Mavs
uniform, the man can still play a little basketball.
</P>
<P>
   At least on one end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman will turn 39 in May, he had only played 23 games combined
over the last two seasons and his roughest workout since signing
with the Mavs has been making the trek from limo to locker room
through the phalanx of cameramen and photographers who dog his
every step, but coach Don Nelson never hesitated last night.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie shamelessly started Rodman at power forward. Nellie said
he made the decision yesterday. Or maybe Cuban made that decision
for him. Whatever, did you really expect anything else? He wasn't
brought here to sit on the bench with his shoes off, though they
did have a guard hired to keep an eye on Rodman's nearby stationary
bike.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get to the bike until after the game, keeping the
waiting media cooling its heels. Nelson had kept the controversial
Rodman plenty busy on the court.
</P>
<P>
   He picked off 13 rebounds, scored zero points and played an
impressive 32 minutes, mostly lingering on the defensive end of the
court, which didn't bother the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Dennis played well when he played,'' said Nelson,
who should be forced to endure several painful body piercings of
his own after having the gall to mention Rodman in the same
sentence with the great Bill Russell earlier in the week. ``There
was definitely a little rust. There'll be some adjustment time but
I'm still excited that he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman had nine rebounds in the first half and was a force
defensively until the Sonics began taking advantage of a mismatch
with the over-sized Vin Baker in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too short, Vin,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal shouted at
one point after Baker had scored over Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   He was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same old pushing, holding Dennis,'' shrugged Horace Grant.
``He wasn't in basketball shape, but give him a week and he'll be
the same old Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration of being unable to stop the 6-foot-11 Baker led
to the most Rodman-like moment of the game. After being whistled
for his third foul, Rodman started to kick the ball, then carried
it as far away from the officials as he could and placed it on the
floor. He walked back to the Mavs' timeout huddle, glaring at the
refs.
</P>
<P>
   The fans ate it up.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman dove for loose balls, battled for rebounds and refused to
give ground defensively, though he was confused and out of position
at times. He was obviously focused and ready to play, but how long
that lasts is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is notorious for having the attention span of a cocker
spaniel, and that's when he's playing with contending teams. Once
he realizes that he's not going to carry the Mavs to the playoffs,
the smart money says he'll again lose interest and become an ugly,
controversial distraction, just as he has so often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   No downside, Cuban keeps telling us.
</P>
<P>
   He's young. He'll learn.

 MAVERICKS FALL ON NIGHT OF PROMISE (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) By CALVIN WATKINS c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _Cedric Ceballos shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Nowitzki kicked the scorer's table.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful opportunity slipped away from the Mavericks last
night.
</P>
<P>
   And they knew it.
</P>
<P>
   With the largest crowd of the season at Reunion Arena, mostly
there for newcomer Dennis Rodman, the Mavericks failed to take
advantage and lost to Seattle, 117-106.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was here for us but a win,'' forward Michael Finley
said. ``The crowd was into it, we were into it at first, but
Seattle got into it as well. We did everything right but get the
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks (20-28), who played their last game before the
All-Star break, saw their three-game winning streak come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little frustrated,'' Nowitzki said. ``We should have
won the game. We had a bad night, but Seattle is a great team and
that's all you can say.''
</P>
<P>
   With a crowd of 18,203 yelling at every move by Rodman, the
Mavericks didn't put the energy to good use.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle jumped out to a 36-25 lead after the first quarter as
the SuperSonics made 16 of 25 field-goal attempts. The Mavericks,
meanwhile, made 12 of 28 shots.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Mavericks played catchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle shot the ball very well and we didn't get to the line
until the second half,'' said Ceballos, who finished with 26
points.''They are a good basketball team and the opportunity
slipped away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first game in 10 months, Rodman finished with 13 rebounds
in 32 minutes. But foul problems and a lack of understanding of the
offense didn't provide Rodman with a dominating effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all right considering I had 13 rebounds,'' he said as
reporters followed him out of the locker room. ``I don't think a
lot of guys can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And not a lot of guys, for the exception of Shaquille O'Neal,
Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson, can pack an arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little rusty,'' Rodman said. ``My body was good, but
my hands were bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman started the game. And coach Don Nelson liked a matchup
with Rodman and Shawn Bradley in the game simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision \Ryesterday\S,'' Nelson said. `` I like
Shawn coming off the bench, and I thought some of our best play was
when Rodman and Shawn Bradley played together.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Mavericks have won 11 of their last 16
games. The overall record at the All-Star break is the best since
1989-90, when they went 26-22.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Finley scored 26 points, Nowitzki had 14 and Erick
Strickland added 21 for the Mavericks, but it still wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get a couple of players playing along with
\RRodman and Bradley\S,'' Nelson said.''We were uphill the whole
game ... the whole night.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of reasons for that was Gary Payton's 25-point, 14-assist
effort and Houston native Rashard Lewis scoring a career-high 30
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle played a terrific game,'' Nelson said. ``Rashard Lewis
just killed us. He had one of those games you dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were hoping for a dream ending to the first half
of the season with Rodman starring in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what he had to do when he came in,'' Finley said.
``He's a little bit out of sync but we expected that. And hopefully
with a few more practices, he'll be OK. I thought he was thinking a
little bit too much. He didn't know the schemes of what we wanted
to do and we were a little behind.''

REDS AND MARINERS AGREE ON TENTATIVE GRIFFEY DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs to add 2 grafs at end of story) 
 (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it appeared that the Seattle Mariners and the
Cincinnati Reds had exhausted their attempts to work out a trade
that would send Ken Griffey Jr. to the Reds, the clubs reached
agreement on a contingency deal on Wednesday, a baseball official
said on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of contingency trades, the official said, the
commissioner's office had granted the Reds a 72-hour period in
which to speak with Griffey and his agent, Brian Goldberg. If the
Reds and Griffey work out a new contract in that time, the deal
would be completed. If they do not, the Reds would have to decide
whether to make the trade anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came just as Major League Baseball was
investigating the Mariners and the Reds for improperly allowing
Goldberg to speak to the Reds without a trade in place. Another
official said on Wednesday that representatives of the
commissioner's office had talked with both clubs about reports that
the Mariners had given the agent permission to speak with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said in a telephone interview Tuesday that Chuck
Armstrong, the Mariners' president, had told him that morning he
could talk to the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning,'' Goldberg said, ``the Mariners said: `Brian,
you try to break this thing. If you can do something in the next
couple days, fine. If not let's shut it down.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the agent's involvement had any impact on
the ability of the teams to reach agreement on a trade. It was also
not clear if the commissioner's office would proceed with their
investigation and possibly fine the teams for straying beyond the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been reports that the teams were working on
a three-team trade, the official who told of the agreement said
this deal was strictly between the Mariners and the Reds. He
declined to identify the players who would move to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Reports had circulated earlier in the week that the players the
teams had most recently discussed were two pitchers, Brett Tomko, a
right-handed starter, and Dennys Reyes, a left-handed reliever, and
a minor league infielder, Antonio Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had previously insisted on getting Pokey Reese, the
Reds' good young second baseman, but Jim Bowden, the Reds' general
manager, refused to include him. Last Dec. 11, at the winter
meetings in Anaheim, Calif., Bowden called off talks with the
Mariners, saying there was no sense continuing to talk because
there was one player _ he didn't identify him as Reese _ that the
Mariners wanted and he would not give up.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bowden did not hide his lust for Griffey. He called
Griffey his favorite player in baseball and said he wanted no one
in the Reds' lineup more than the extremely talented center
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, 30, began his wild winter when he told Mariners
officials in November that he planned to leave them as a free agent
at the end of the 2000 season, and it was decided that a trade
would be in everyone's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey, who has hit 398 home runs in his career, had the
right to veto a trade because he has been in the major leagues 10
years, the last 5 with the same team. He initially gave the
Mariners a list of anywhere from four to seven teams he would
accept a trade to but later reduced the list to one team _ the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were in position to make a trade with the New York
Mets at the winter meetings, but Griffey said he would not approve
a trade to them.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey had two reasons for wanting to go to Cincinnati. His
father is a coach with the Reds and is thought to be their
manager-in-waiting, and Griffey grew up in Cincinnati when Ken Sr.
played for the Reds. Griffey graduated from Moeller High School in
Cincinnati in 1987, the year the Mariners made him the first player
selected in the amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has one year left on a four-year, $32 million contract.
The Mariners last year offered him a new eight-year contract worth
$148 million, but he rejected it. Goldberg was quoted earlier this
week as saying that Griffey would take less money to play for the
Reds than he would want elsewhere.

 COWBOYS TURN TO COAKLEY, 19 OTHERS
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By RAY BUCK c.2000 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys have squeezed under the $62.17
million salary cap and have turned their attention to tendering
offers to 20 unsigned players with three or fewer years of NFL
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Weakside linebacker Dexter Coakley, who made the Pro Bowl in his
third season in the league, is expected to receive a qualifying
offer of$1,027,000 or $1,371,000 by today's deadline. Either would
make him the highest-paid linebacker in team history.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying offer would assure the Cowboys of retaining their
``right of first refusal'' privileges and compensation if Coakley
receives an offer sheet from another NFL team and the Cowboys
decline to match it. The compensation would be a first-round pick
if the Cowboys offer $1,027,000 or first- and third-round picks if
they tender the higher offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, a source said, have ruled out submitting a low-end
qualifying offer ($472,000) because Coakley is worth more to them
than the third-round pick that they would get in compensation under
that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have nine other restricted free agents, including
punter Toby Gowin, cornerback Kevin Mathis, offensive lineman Tony
Hutson, safeties Kenny Wheaton and Singor Mobley, and No. 3
quarterback Mike Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Restricted free agents who are tendered qualifying offers have
until April 10 to sign offer sheets with other teams, and their
current teams have until April 14 to exercise their right of first
refusal. ] The Cowboys also have 10 unsigned first- or second-year
players _ including fullback Robert Thomas and wide receivers Jason
Tucker, Chris Brazzell and Jeff Ogden _ who are eligible for the
minimum ($193,000 and $275,000, respectively) that would keep from
negotiating with other teams. Stephen Jones, vice
president/director of player personnel, said it was considerably
easier for the Cowboys to get under the salary cap than it was a
year ago. He said they have to restructure ``three or four''
contracts of top-end players this year, down from 11 last February.
</P>
<P>
   Jones would not specify which contracts would be restructured,
but the leading candidates are those with the biggest cap numbers
for 2000: Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Larry Allen, Darren Woodson,
Kevin Smith, Leon Lett and Erik Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The signing period for unrestricted free agents begins tomorrow.
The Cowboys have 14 unrestricted free agents, including middle
linebacker Randall Godfrey, defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman,
defensive end Kavika Pittman and free safety George Teague.

AID TO CRAWFORD TIED TO SEATTLE MAN IN NCAA PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TED MILLER and ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ University of Michigan basketball player Jamal
Crawford received aid in 1998 from a non-profit group headed by
Seattle businessman Barry Henthorn, the person at the center of an
NCAA investigation involving Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   A brochure for the Academic Assistance Foundation, which lists
an address and phone number identical to Henthorn's
telecommunications company, Innovative Communications Technology,
identified Crawford as its 1998 ``recipient.'' It did not say what
benefits or considerations Crawford would receive, nor did it list
any past winners or history.
</P>
<P>
   AAF's brochure listed nine corporate supporters, including ICT.
Six of those companies do not exist. Representatives of two other
businesses on the list, Phil Smart Mercedes and Performance
Mortgage, denied any relationship with Henthorn or the AAF.
</P>
<P>
   A short list of AAF's individual supporters is topped by NFL
player Eric Metcalf. Through his agent, Brig Owens, Metcalf denied
any knowledge of AAF.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn did not return phone calls when contacted by the
Post-Intelligencer. He has denied acting as an agent for Crawford
or a booster for Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, a graduate of Rainier Beach High School and Michigan's
leading scorer, was suspended for six games _ five by the NCAA, one
by Michigan. The NCAA also ordered Crawford to repay Henthorn
approximately $15,000, the estimated value of the benefits Crawford
received from Henthorn.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA penalties focused on violations of Crawford's amateur
status when he was supported and presented gifts by Henthorn, 33, a
family friend who had no legal relationship as Crawford's guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn, who lives in a $3.5 million home in Edmonds, is
married and has no children. He is a 1985 graduate of Issaquah High
School and went to college at the University of Puget Sound,
Seattle University and Bellevue Community College.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about the relationship, Crawford's mother,
Venora Skinner, reportedly told Michigan officials she was trying
to establish Henthorn as Crawford's legal guardian. Efforts to
reach Skinner were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Percy Bates, faculty representative for Michigan, contends
university officials were convinced Henthorn was acting in good
faith as a guardian and not an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the paperwork we saw, the mother clearly intended
for (guardianship) to be legal, but it did not go to the courts and
therefore was simply not legalized,'' Bates said in a statement
about Crawford's troubles with the NCAA. ``But the intent was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, however, whether Michigan officials knew of
Henthorn's foundation and the benefits it provided to Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn told the Detroit Free Press he doesn't want or expect
Crawford to repay him. ``He doesn't have any money,'' Henthorn
said. ``I'm his sole source of income.''
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn also faces a civil lawsuit brought against him by his
former administrative assistant, Darcienne LeRoue. LeRoue claims
she was ``coerced and induced'' into cosigning on two loans ``for
the benefit of a basketball prospect, Jamal Crawford,'' in the fall
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The loans, according to the lawsuit filed in November 1999, were
for a Chevy Blazer and gold jewelry. LeRoue claims Henthorn agreed
to reimburse her but still owes her less than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The AAF registered with the secretary of state last September _
a year after it had named Crawford its recipient. However, the only
name listed with the secretary of state in connection with the
foundation is Henthorn's. The AAF has not filed with the Internal
Revenue Service as a non-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Marta Cano-Hinz, the principal at Rainier Beach, said she
received information from the AAF, but paid it no heed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was nonsense,'' she said. ``Unless we know it is
bona fide and sanctioned by the school district, we don't touch it
with a 10-foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainier Beach athletic director Dan Jurdy and basketball coach
Mike Bethea both denied any knowledge of the AAF.
</P>
<P>
   The AAF brochure lists six objectives, including ``support youth
in achieving high levels of academic and personal excellence'' and
``raise funds to provide learning aids and resources that are vital
to student success.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes on to state its mission: ``The AAF targets youth that
(sic) have experienced hardship yet exhibit a desire to achieve
high levels of academic and personal success. ... It is possible to
make dreams a reality with the provision of tutors, mentors,
educational aids and financial assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate supporters' list included Dancing on the Water
Racing Company, Name That Lick L.L.C., One's Design, Performance
Auto Body and Try-R-Designs. None of those companies have a listed
telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Video Marketing Production, had a listed number but it
is disconnected. No forwarding number was provided.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn's status as a benefactor for Crawford falls into a gray
area in state regulation. The state Legislature last year repealed
the law that established rules and regulations governing sports
agents because so few agents had registered under the 1991 act.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the old law, Henthorn could have been exempt from
regulation if he represented or advised no more than one athlete in
any given year, said Joyce Roper, assistant state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any kind of sanction as a result of that conduct,
it would be coming from the private sanctioning authorities,'' she
said. ``... It's been completely deregulated under state law.''
</P>
<P>
   Roper could not say what action, if any, could be taken against
Henthorn if he was using false information to promote or run his
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association became
aware of Henthorn during the 1998-99 school year, the year after
Crawford led Rainier Beach to the Class 3A championship. At the
time, Jurdy, the Rainier Beach athletic director, asked the WIAA to
look into a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee that Henthorn had provided to
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   The WIAA found that Henthorn did not appear to be an agent at
that time and that Crawford's use of the vehicle did not violate
his amateur status. But Crawford reportedly stopped driving the
Cherokee to school after the WIAA looked into Henthorn's
relationship with the basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason (Crawford) quit using the vehicle was that we felt
he was pushing the envelope a little bit,'' said Mike Colbrese, the
WIAA's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But Colbrese said the WIAA investigation never got into whether
Henthorn's activities and relationship with Crawford constituted an
athlete-agent relationship. Colbrese also had not heard of
Henthorn's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't design any specific rules that address agents. We
just address actions that would potentially jeopardize the amateur
standing of a particular student participant,'' Colbrese said.

 By JAYNE CUSTRED  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Byron Nelson's winning streak has always been one of the great
untouchables in golf.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Referred to in reverent tones and compared in invincibility to
some of the greatest accomplishments in sports, such as Joe
DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, Nelson's 11 consecutive
tournament victories have always left modern-day players a little
awed.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed this year is that the golfing world is equally
awed by the fact there is someone who might actually match the
feat. Or beat it.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods has won six consecutive PGA Tour events, a streak
that began last August at the NEC Invitational and continued into
the 2000 season, right up to his unbelievable come-from-behind win
Monday at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Woods was seven
shots behind leader Matt Gogel with seven holes to play during the
final round and still managed to come up with the victory.
</P>
<P>
   That put Woods in the company of one legend, matching the six
straight wins by Ben Hogan in 1948. And now it's on to bigger and
more impressive records _ Nelson's magic 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely more intriguing, there is no doubt about it,''
Woods said of the streak.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguing, yes. But possible? There was a time when the answer
would have been an unanimous ``No.'' But not any longer. Not the
way Woods is playing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his six straight victories, Woods has won eight
of his last nine events and 17 PGA Tour events in four years as a
pro. This week he is the defending champion at the Buick
Invitational at Torrey Pines, a course where he also won the Junior
World title when he was just 15.
</P>
<P>
   In his 72 tournaments on the PGA Tour since 1996, Woods has
already earned more than $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who would argue that Woods' six straight wins
are already more impressive than Nelson's 11, considering the
competition and depth of field Woods must face each week. In fact,
Nelson's streak is rarely mentioned without someone pointing out
that Nelson's wins came during World War II, against fields that
were depleted by war and during a period when there weren't nearly
the number of talented players there are today.
</P>
<P>
   While all of that may be true, the most impressive statistic of
Nelson's streak is one that stands firm regardless of the field's
size or talent. Nelson's scoring average during his 11-win run was
an amazing 67.86.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, for all his accomplishments, has posted a 68.20 scoring
average during his victory stretch.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. In Nelson's golden year of 1945, he won a
total of 18 times out of 30 tournaments and finished second in six
more. The names of some of his competitors weren't too shabby,
either, such as Sam Snead, Hogan and Ray Mangrum.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also won a non-sanctioned event, the Spring Lake
Pro-Member, the week after his 11th straight triumph at the
Canadian Open. And by the time the season was over, Nelson had set
single-season records for lowest scoring average (68.33) and most
consecutive rounds under 70 (19).
</P>
<P>
   With a scoring average of 68.33, Nelson could be competitive on
any tour against any golfers of any era.
</P>
<P>
   This week at the Buick Invitational, the watching begins again
in earnest. Will Woods be the one to finally reach one of golf's
most unreachable numbers? Will Woods catch up with the elusive
Nelson? His fellow tour players, at least, are ready to believe he
might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about destiny,'' said Gogel. ``He's just damned
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ernie Els: ``I think he's a legend in the making. He's 24.
He's probably going to be bigger than Elvis when he gets into his
40s.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the new magic number is five.

 fixes coding glitch on resume NINE-TOED
DEION SEEKS NEW DIGS AS DALLAS PLAYS OUT (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) By RANDY GALLOWAY c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a big-name week in the local jock kingdom for coming
and going.
</P>
<P>
   Coming: One freak.
</P>
<P>
   Going: One ungrateful fraud.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what about Dennis Rodman, and there's a ton of
``what'' on his tattooed resume, there's no fraud involved. This
freak is an open book, and an easy read. Strange, but easy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the Worm did Dallas last night, another worm had already
laid the groundwork for his departure from the local sports scene.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-Toed Deion made public comments this week that I assume
ended his lovefest with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Be advised,
however, of no guarantees. Jerry rarely admits mistakes,
particularly mistakes where he played the fool for five long years.
</P>
<P>
   Take notes here, Mark Cuban. The player is never your friend.
</P>
<P>
   No jock in sports history has ever been treated better by an
owner than Nine-Toed was by Mr. Jones. But in the end, it was all
about fraud, and fraud is the life story of Deioness in
professional sports. Nine-Toed is the epitome of me, myself and I.
</P>
<P>
   Why Jones allowed himself to be used and abused ... Oh, well,
the chuckles you now hear are from those who think they were on the
other end when a hardball businessman like Jones was doing the
using and abusing.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, Nine-Toed collected just under $30 million in
cash from Jones for services rendered on the football field. Until
this season, Sanders earned his money when he played. Except he
didn't play often enough to justify that kind of financial reward.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 1999 season, and even before the football disaster
was over, Sanders first insulted Jones by agreeing to return to
baseball as a full-time player. Which would make him part-time with
the Cowboys again. Jones read about that baseball decision in the
newspaper. There wasn't even the courtesy of Deioness first
informing Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, Nine-Toed delivered more public insults.
</P>
<P>
   What he said was typical: Don't blame him for anything that went
wrong with the Cowboys. That he always did his job. That the
failures were elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were at least three losses last season _ New
Orleans, the Jets and the Colts _ when Deioness' failures at
cornerback played a significant role in close defeats. But Sanders
is blessed with selective memory.
</P>
<P>
   Moving along with his comments, Nine-Toed advised us that since
the Cowboys were no longer a Super Bowl contender, then playing
here was beneath him. Therefore, it was his decision that he should
leave.
</P>
<P>
   One other shot was delivered right at Jones, this when Sanders
was critical of the offensive hires for Dave Campo's new coaching
staff. Even if Deioness is right, common decency says he should
have kept his mouth shut out of loyalty to Jones, if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   All of this stuff coming from Nine-Toed at this time, was mainly
a cover-up. He realizes that if the Cowboys release him June 2, as
expected, then he can twist it by saying the release was a result
of him having said goodbye in early February.
</P>
<P>
   Why June 2? By waiting until then, the Cowboys soften the
salary-cap blow attached to Sanders. But even then, they will still
be docked $2.2 million in 2000 and $3.2 million in 2001. Because of
Jones' foolishness over Deioness, the cost continues for two years,
even with Sanders gone.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Deioness who played four quarters in the Pro
Bowl a year ago after missing regular-season games in December 1998
with a mysterious toe ailment. And then this year, Sanders did
everything to avoid the Pro Bowl, including mysterious knee surgery
the week before that game. This medical ``excuse'' still allowed
Nine-Toed to collect a $1.5 million contract bonus from Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A personal opinion is the Cowboys would not have won their last
Super Bowl without Jones having lured Sanders to Valley Ranch with
a $13 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four years since, the luxury of paying so much to a
cornerback backfired immensely. Still, however, the Jerry paychecks
continued to line Sanders' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Since money is all that Nine-Toed understands, there should have
at least been a personal appreciation of Jones. The class way to
handle all this would have been to shut up and leave. But as we
already knew, Deioness is totally void of class, and he proved it
again.
</P>
<P>
   I'll take the freak anytime. You can have the fraud.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ Dennis Rodman has defied the odds again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Mavericks fans will be lucky if that is all Rodman defies
while employed by his hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, a Dallas native, kicked off his Mavericks career
Wednesday night, starting the game, but he was overshadowed by
former Elsik star Rashard Lewis, who had career highs of 30 points
and 12 rebounds to spark Seattle to a 117-106 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The game brought the fans streaming into Reunion Arena, with
Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith and Deion Sanders among
the sellout crowd of 18,203. From the looks of things, the
almost-yearlong layoff did little to affect Rodman's game.
</P>
<P>
   He played 32 minutes, grabbing 13 rebounds and drawing four
fouls, one of which had the Sonics carrying Ruben Patterson off the
floor toward the end of the first quarter. The crowd had to wait
until the third quarter for one of Rodman's signature belly-flop
dives for a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   It was vintage Rodman, who has carved out a career by playing
the league's angry young man _ defying rules, authority and at
times the law. But in the past, Rodman has at least been able to
back up most of his bad-boy act with his rebounding and work on the
defensive end of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   At 38, however, the oft-traveled Rodman is now an angry old man,
more like the Andy Warhol of professional basketball _ either an
eccentric, misunderstood genius; a lovable scoundrel; or a
shameless, calculating self-promoter who is most interested in
making sure the spotlight is shining squarely on Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly what new Mavericks owner Mark Cuban had in
mind when he signed Rodman for the remainder of the season _
promotion. Tired of seeing all of the empty seats in Reunion Arena,
Cuban decided the Mavericks needed a drawing card. And he found
exactly that in Rodman, who magnetically draws fans to arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is to see the game or the freak show is another
issue, but Rodman said he cares little about perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about winning, right?'' said Rodman, who wore jersey
No. 70. ``It's all about filling seats and having a good time. Win
or lose, just play a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, there are times when Rodman can still play a
good game.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Rodman owns five NBA championship rings, two with the
Detroit Pistons and three more with the Chicago Bulls. And he has
led the league in rebounding seven times, an astounding number for
someone who stands just under 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodman has since worn out more welcomes than backboards.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Rodman, for whom attention is like a drug,
has gone out of his way to strut his carefully crafted
idiosyncrasies or eccentricities. Many have called them an act,
like the time Rodman announced his wedding _ then showed up in full
makeup, wearing a wedding gown, saying he was going to marry
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Some are now grumbling that even stranger is this marriage with
the Mavericks, a team that had won 10 of its previous 13 games
before Rodman suited up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing well, but I don't think that in itself is
enough to create excitement,'' Dallas coach/general manager Don
Nelson said. ``But along with somebody like Dennis Rodman joining
our team, I think the excitement is going to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   But for how long?
</P>
<P>
   Rodman lasted only 23 games with the Lakers last season, when he
was chased and eventually signed by team owner Jerry Buss, another
high-life partier of note who considered Rodman a soulmate and
late-night running buddy.
</P>
<P>
   But when Rodman made it abundantly clear that the rebounds he
was most interested in retrieving were the dice off a craps-table
wall in Las Vegas, Buss and Lakers president Jerry West abruptly
ended the Rodman's stay in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So here he is, back home in Dallas, where Rodman showed up with
a list of demands that would embarrass any self-respecting
terrorist _ riding a stationary bike instead of practicing, no
shootarounds and showing up 25 minutes later than every other
Mavericks player _ and sets of rings through his ears, nose and
lips large enough to be used by an Olympic gymnast.
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly what Cuban, who paid $280 million for the
Mavericks, wanted when he signed Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the owner and management in Dallas think Dennis can help
the ballclub and sell some more tickets, more power to them,''
Seattle's Horace Grant said. ``I could (not) care less either way.
I'm just happy that the media horde is not surrounding this team.''

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The Rockets did not want to wait for today's trendy,
NBA-sanctioned start of the All-Star break. Anyone can kick back
when the NBA says it's OK. The Rockets got there first.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets took on the last game before the midseason break
with all the focus of grade-schoolers counting the minutes until
Christmas vacation. They took the fortunate scheduling that sent
them to the hometown of several team members and played as if back
on the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   The only saving grace in the Rockets' 116-100 loss to the Hawks
on Wednesday was that the well-heeled patrons who fill the towers
of suites in Philips Arena, the Hawks' new Roman Colosseum of a
venue, could not signal a Romanesque thumbs down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was,'' said Rockets guard Steve Francis,
who showed no signs of last week's knee injury other than
rustiness. ``We definitely handed it to them. We didn't play hard.
They were on fire, but it really hurt us not to come out and play
hard against a team like this. Before the All-Star break, this was
a game we should have won. And that (looking ahead to the break)
could have been what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Slapped to attention long enough, the Rockets did put forth some
effort in the second half, at least on the offensive end. But by
then, the Hawks had built a 30-point lead and had begun to lose
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of two things _ us not having any zip and
them shooting the heck out of the ball,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``We didn't have any energy until that last (run)
at the end when we went real small. I don't want to believe we were
on vacation already.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Hawks scored more easily than any other
team had all season against the Rockets, rolling up 65 points and a
lead as large as 25 in the second quarter. They shot well, to be
sure, making 30 of 47 shots (63.8 percent). Jim Jackson made nine
of 10 shots in the half for 19 of his 23 points. And the Rockets
shot poorly, going just 14-of-36 (38.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets' greatest problem was not the Hawks' dead-eye
shooting. The Hawks got good, open looks usually with just one
pass. Occasionally, they had to dribble once to be wide-open. On
rare occasions they even had to drive the lane, though they often
found it as open as a runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came off of screens, and guys were wide-open and had great
shots, great looks at the basket,'' Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich pointed to a Rockets schedule crowded with six games
in nine days heading into the All-Star break. The Rockets have
played more games, 50, than they ever had before the break. Only
the SuperSonics have played more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready,'' Rockets forward Kenny Thomas said. ``Being home
(Thomas grew up in Thomasville, Ga.), I had my family here. I was
pumped up. But being a rookie, I'm starting to see back-to-back
games can have a big toll on you. I felt it. I don't have any
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing the Rockets did in the first half with any
consistent intensity was blame the officials. They did not earn
technical fouls until the second half, when Kelvin Cato got two,
allowing him the opportunity to pay $1,500 to leave early.
</P>
<P>
   By then, there was little left to stick around for. The Rockets
had trailed 65-44 at halftime, with Cuttino Mobley ending the half
with a three-point play on his way to a career-high 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   But if that was a signal for the Rockets to make a run, they
missed it. The Hawks scored the first nine points of the second
half to push their lead to 74-44. By the time Francis took a steal
for a full-court drive, the Rockets had missed their first six
second-half shots, ending any remaining delusions of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks eventually cooled off. They made just eight of 21
shots in the fourth quarter, with their starters combining to play
just seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time they led by 30, they had made 34 of 54 shots.
And even after coasting to the finish, the Hawks, also playing the
second game of a back-to-back, matched their most prolific scoring
night of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how they play a lot,'' Tomjanovich said of the Hawks'
rapid-fire offensive beating of the Rockets' defense. ``They have
lot of individual one-on-one players. A lot of them, we were right
there, and they just pulled up. We always say, Try to make them go
over us. When they're going, it's hard to beat a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was so out of control that it brought the end of both
benches to the court early. Moochie Norris, the Rockets' newest
12th man on a 10-day contract, got his first call with 8:17 to play
and the Hawks leading 104-73.
</P>
<P>
   The odd combination of the 6-1 Norris, Bryce Drew, Mobley, Devin
Gray and Thomas combined for a 33-point fourth quarter. But that
was the only time the Rockets showed any real fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being down 30 points, that's no fun,'' Mobley said. ``When I
came in (in the second half), we were down 27. I was trying to get
it back. But they kept making shots. We were just dead as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be nothing a good All-Star break can't fix. But to be
certain, the Rockets got an early start on the treatment.

but a waste water ditch would become his master work. This vast
landscape park, Duisburg Nord, is at the northern tip of Emscher
Park, a nice name for the industrial wasteland that stretches 434
miles along the Emscher River. In 1989 this part of the river was

audience was briefly stunned to silence as they heard the
minutely-detailed guidelines for what is being billed as the first
green (that is, environmentally sensitive) residential high-rise in
the country. The impetus for this ambitious, politically correct
plan came from Governor George E. Pataki, who has made
environmental issues a cause and is soon expected to propose a tax

HIJACKERS OF AFGHAN JET FREE HOSTAGES AND GIVE UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The tense standoff between police and the hijackers of
an Afghan airliner ended peacefully early on Thursday morning, the
police said, with the hijackers releasing the 150 or so people
aboard the plane and surrendering to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few minutes, we brought the last people off the
hijacked Afghan airliner,'' said Joe Edwards, an assistant police
constable with the Essex police in a news conference at Stansted
airport just after 6 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were released in two waves. The first group of
about 85 people, many of them women and children, left the plane
about 3:15. Three hours later, the 65 or so remaining passengers,
crew members and hijackers left as well, filing one by one down the
back stairs of the plane, their robes blowing in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   They were then loaded onto police buses and driven away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start the process of identifying the hostages and
the hostage takers, and to make sure that the plane itself is safe
to enter,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   But he refused still to address the central mystery of the
hijacking: what the hijackers were demanding.
</P>
<P>
   The men seized the Ariana airlines Boeing 727 moments after it
left Kabul, the Afghan capital, for a domestic flight on Sunday.
After an odyssey across Central Asia, Russia and Western Europe,
the plane finally landed at Stansted, outside of London.
</P>
<P>
   There has been widespread speculation that the hijackers, who
negotiated in English and were armed with handguns, were seeking
political asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But police and government officials, in a country acutely
sensitive to the perception that it is a soft haven for immigrants
seeking a better life outside their own countries, have repeatedly
refused to comment on the hijackers motives.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would they say what finally ended the deadlock, as the
hijacking entered its fifth day on Thursday. But they did say that
all the hostages appeared to be in good health and had been taken
somewhere safe.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday, a few passengers were freed, and Tuesday
night, four crew members escaped by breaking the cockpit window and
lowering themselves down a rope. The police said that they were the
captain, second captain, first officer and a flight engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, the police had been in near constant radio
contact with the hijackers, who spoke English and were believed to
number about 10.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers cut off communications in the middle of the night,
though, apparently out of anger over the escape. At one point, they
pushed a steward down the stairs of the plane. He suffered a minor
cut on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Contact was later restored, and quiet returned for the rest of
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Broughton, an assistant chief constable, insisted that the
crew's escape had not made matters worse. ``Any people who are
released from the aircraft represent a positive step,'' he told
reporters in a briefing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to some experts, pilots are taught to try to escape
from a hijacked plane to prevent another takeoff. But pilots often
feel a personal responsibility to stay with the plane and hostages.
</P>
<P>
   About nine crew members remained on board after the escape, but
the police said that they did not know whether any knew how to
operate the plane.
</P>
<P>
   A representative from the United Nations high commissioner for
refugees, Hope Hanish, arrived at the airport on Tuesday night, but
the British government would not comment on speculation that the
hijackers had been seeking asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said it was best not to speculate about motives. ``It
is possible that they may be listening to a radio, or that some
passengers have mobile phones,'' he said. ``We will not do anything
to put these people at risk.''

WOMEN'S SUCCESS IMPORTANT TO BIG WEST

 BIGWEST PACKAGE-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

   LOS ANGELES _ Cindy Spiro remembers the dark days of women's
athletics, when the female teams fought for gym time, shared
uniforms with the other women's teams and traveled in broken-down
vehicles, stopping to eat fast food.
</P>
<P>
   That was the mid-1970s, when Spiro was a basketball player at
the University of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Spiro, an associate athletic director at her alma mater,
sits as a witness of the last decade, where women's intercollegiate
athletics have grown so rapidly that no one gives any thought to
women seeking scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the Big West Conference, opportunities for female
athletes are plentiful. It might be because of federal legislation
(Title IX) or by lawsuits (the Cal State system's agreement with
the state National Organization of Women chapter), but regardless,
women's sports are strong, well-funded and successful.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cal State Northridge, many of the conference's schools fund
their women's sports at higher levels than their male counterparts.
Schools with Division I-A football programs (Idaho and Utah State)
must fund the women's sports at high levels to meet Title IX
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conference membership has a responsibility for funding at high
levels,'' Spiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference considers its two strongest women's sports to be
women's volleyball and softball, with women's basketball on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Member schools brag that UC Santa Barbara and Pacific have
reached every NCAA women's volleyball tournament since the first in
1981, with Pacific winning national titles in 1985-86. Long Beach
State has won three titles, the last in 1998. Last season, two
conference schools reached the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Softball is in the shadow of the Pac-10, but Cal State Fullerton
has a 1986 national championship.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 10 of the conference's 17 national championships have
been won by women's sports.

IT'S OVER IN SEATTLE; GRIFFEY GOING HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The one thing that will make acceptable this historic
day in sports _ not just Seattle sports but way, way beyond _ is
this notion that at least The Kid, even if he isn't quite a kid
anymore, is going home.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. is heading for Cincinnati, where he grew up,
where he drove his first car, where he was scouted by all those
major league teams and where his dad will be on the bench and his
grandmother will be in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   All of us dream this dream of going home. Even those of us who
doubt whether things can ever be as good as we imagined.
</P>
<P>
   For Griffey, who has given every indication that his world is
all about getting back to his family and his roots and his people,
we can only hope the reality is even half of what he envisions.
</P>
<P>
   In going where he wanted to be so badly, Griffey was willing to
sever an 11-year relationship with the only team for whom he had
ever played major league baseball, just to get to where he wanted
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, after too many days of relentless speculation,
time seemed to stand still.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners asked Major League Baseball for a 72-hour window
during which Griffey and the Reds could work out a long-term
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The request by the M's _ and the discussions between Griffey's
agent, Brian Goldberg, and the Reds _ are simply a footnote to a
landmark moment.
</P>
<P>
   It is the relocation of one of baseball's brightest stars from
this end of the constellation to another.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth called his homers.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey called his orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, which thought itself tired of the Griffey talk, will
wake up Thursday and give this a good, hard moment of reflection.
</P>
<P>
   He is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The realization is numbing.
</P>
<P>
   We know our modern-day superstars too well these days. We know
their every quirk and every personality trait, or at least we think
we do.
</P>
<P>
   We certainly have gotten into the nitty-gritty of this ordeal,
ever since Griffey reluctantly drove over to a meeting with Mariner
officials in Orlando in November and set the stage for Thursday's
news.
</P>
<P>
   And if the trade talks are being reported correctly and it is
Jim Edmonds who stands in center field for the Mariners this
summer, there isn't a soul who won't look out there and think
something is missing _ no offense to Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that Ken Griffey never said he liked Safeco
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter that history will prove that the Mariners will
move on without him, as surely they will.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere deep down was a belief that Griffey would be the sort
of loyalist who wanted to spend his entire career with one team.
And looking out to center field, it's going to be disorienting with
him not there.
</P>
<P>
   But let us say this from Seattle, with no malice:
</P>
<P>
   It turns out to be a good baseball story.
</P>
<P>
   The kid is going home. Not to Orlando, where he built a house
and makes a life, where his wife and children live in the seclusion
of a gated golf community. We can be cynical. We can ask, who told
him to go there?
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the breakdown of Griffey's departure from Seattle had
seemed like a referendum on what's wrong with him. Maybe, though,
there is just as much right with him.
</P>
<P>
   He's going home to the place where, somewhere in his imagination
and his hopes, things are going to be great. Or maybe it is the
next step and like anyone, he is entitled to that, too.
</P>
<P>
   If Ken Griffey Jr. can't be a lifelong Mariner, then going to
the Reds is the next best thing. It's a destiny thing. Even if
Griffey will one day find as much to loathe in Reds GM Jim Bowden
as he now seems to find in Mariners GM Pat Gillick.
</P>
<P>
   He never gave Gillick a chance to show him how much better it
could get here. He was too far gone to even consider the idea.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, Cincinnati is Griffey's nirvana. They're making
jerseys for him and, hate to say it, No. 24 in red looks pretty
good. A natural.
</P>
<P>
   The people in Cincinnati will make Griffey feel loved and
wanted. We have lost him here in Seattle, no doubt about it.
Seattle is a cold, distant place to Griffey. Cincinnati is where
his heart is.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, as this deal comes to pass and the emotions
of it fade, Seattle will move on to to examining who and what the
Mariners are going to become.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample reason to think this year's team will be
interesting, competitive. The AL West is still out there for
Gillick's Mariners to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much rancor and restlessness surrounded
Griffey's final months as a Mariner, the eyes will look east to see
what Griffey is doing.
</P>
<P>
   It will be impossible not to notice. He was one of the biggest
shows in baseball when he was a Mariner. He might even be bigger
when he hits home, wearing the Reds jersey he always dreamed of
wearing, playing with a team that was one game away from the NL
Division Series last October.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in Cincinnati is going to be special, especially
when the Cubs and Cardinals come to town.
</P>
<P>
   If Griffey thought about what it would be like to go
head-to-head with Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa for home-run contests
during pennant chases, well, he had the right.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the breakup was inevitable, it doesn't make it easier to
digest, now that Griffey is gone.

DEAL STRUCK TO SEND GRIFFEY TO REDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ken Griffey Jr. wanted Cincinnati. He's got 72 hours
to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, the Cincinnati Reds and the Anaheim Angels reached
accord on deal late Wednesday night that hinges on Griffey and his
agent, Brian Goldberg, working out a multi-year deal with the Reds,
Griffey's hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came together late Wednesday when the Mariners formally
asked the commissioner's office for permission to allow Goldberg to
negotiate directly with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can do is confirm that the 72-hour clock is running,''
Sandy Alderson of the commissioner's office said. ``It's a
requirement by rule that before this kind of negotiation can start,
it has to come through my department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's fairly routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Routine? Nothing is routine when a player the stature of Griffey
is involved. And this three-way deal would see Griffey go to the
Reds for a package of players reportedly to include pitchers Brett
Tomko, Dennis Reyes and Scott Williamson and minor league
infielders Travis Dawkins and Antonio Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko and a second reliever would then be sent to Anaheim, which
would ship center fielder Jim Edmonds north to the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners and the Reds were told to zip their lips about the
deal. Seattle president Chuck Armstrong would not confirm or deny
the deal late Wednesday. And he was stunned that Alderson did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've been instructed to make no comment, it seems
bizarre to us Sandy Alderson, who has not been involved in the
discussions, would be commenting for the media,'' Armstrong said.
``What I can say is that after the comments of Ken Griffey's agent,
Brian Goldberg (Tuesday), the Mariners and the Reds have been
instructed and directed by the commissioner's office to have no
comment regarding the possibility of the Reds and Griffey and his
agents talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said Tuesday that he'd been given the go-ahead by the
Mariners to talk with the Reds. That quickly brought down the wrath
of the commissioner's office, which is, Alderson said,
investigating both teams for possible rules violations.
</P>
<P>
   None of which matters much to the Mariners, who now are ready to
start the new millennium without the man who has spent over a
decade as the heart and soul of the Seattle baseball franchise. It
was Griffey who was at the heart of the team's 1995 run that
captivated the Northwest and led to the club moving into Safeco
Field in the middle of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the pitcher-friendly spaciousness of Safeco
that led to some of Griffey's unhappiness in Seattle. The ball
didn't fly out of Safeco nearly as easily as it did in the
Kingdome, and Griffey was displeased with the change.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey hit .299 at the Kingdome and .278 at Safeco after the
midseason change of venue, although his power numbers (13 homers in
37 games in the Kingdome and 14 homers in 42 games at Safeco)
actually were nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is more than a matter of ballparks involved.
Griffey has cited death threats he's received in the last few
months as a major reason for wanting to leave, and he said he wants
to be closer to his family. Griffey, raised in Cincinnati, now
lives outside Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The trade is a continuation of a series of changes that have
remade the face of the Mariners since general manager Pat Gillick
came on board at the end of the 1999 season. Gillick, who did not
return telephone calls Wednesday, has brought in John Olerud to
play first base, Aaron Sele to bolster the starting rotation and
Japanese reliever Kazuhiro Sasaki to beef up the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle will need major contributions from all three plus the
power and glovework for which Edmonds is known to defray the loss
of Griffey, possibly the preeminent player of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who turned 30 in November, is at the peak of his
career. In the last four seasons he's hit 209 home runs, giving him
398 for his career. At the same time, however, his batting average
the last two seasons has been just .285 after he'd hit .300 or
better in the previous seven full seasons, leading to some comment
that he was just swinging for the fences.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has two Gold Gloves for his defensive work, but he comes
with the baggage of three consecutive injury-plagued seasons. He
has the ability to hit for power _ including four consecutive
seasons of 25 or more homers _ but had just five homers in 204
at-bats after missing the first two-thirds of the 1999 season.

DUCKS TAKE STEP BACKWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- It took only one night for the Mighty Ducks to
realize that the best place for them might be on the road -- at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   After going 3-0-2 in five games away from home, the Ducks
returned to The Pond where the defending Stanley Cup champion
Dallas Stars were waiting. Anaheim had won three of the first five
games against Dallas, but Wednesday they took too many penalties,
committed untimely turnovers, allowed two power play goals and lost
5-3 before 13,684.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Ducks lose to the Stars, they lost the ground
in the standings. The Kings defeated Phoenix and dropped Anaheim
(23-25-8-1) three points out of a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no down time or up time,'' said Duck coach Craig
Hartsburg. ``There is no time to dwell on the negatives, you just
have to get ready for the next game.'' The next two games are in
St. Louis (Saturday) and Chicago (Monday) and that might be a plus
for Anaheim which is now 12-12-4 at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Playing at home or on the road, perhaps it was too much to ask
the Ducks to win the season series against the Stars for the first
time since Anaheim's debut campaign of 1993-94. Dallas, after all,
is a team that came into the game leading the all-time series
21-10-1 and seems capable of overcoming almost any obstacle thrown
in its path.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, already without mainstays Derian Hatcher, Jere
Lehtinen, Shawn Chambers, Joe Nieuwendyk and Brian Skrudland, lost
Brett Hull to a fractured nose midway through the first period when
he was hit by Jeff Nielsen's stick after Hull pulled down the
Anaheim winger.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody plays system hockey better than Dallas. It's boring
... but very effective.
</P>
<P>
   With most of their big guns sidelined the Stars were content to
sit back and wait for the Ducks to make mistakes, and Anaheim made
just enough of them to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that cost us was a bunch of stupid
penalties,'' said Paul Kariya, whose 31st goal of the year and
200th of his career teased the Ducks and their fans by pulling
Anaheim within 4-3 with just over eight minutes to play. ``That
(killing penalties) takes a lot of energy out of you.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the penalties are foolish ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took a 2-1 first-period lead as Anaheim players sat in
the penalty box. Jaime Langenbrunner scored the first of his two
goals at 6:46 and Brendan Morrow scored at 15:58.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were three penalties we never should have taken,'' said
Hartsburg, who watched his penalty killers give two of more goals
for the 11th time in 56 games this season. ``We had some jump and a
lot of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredrick Olausson scored on the power play at 11:55 of the first
period to tie the game 1-1, but as usual Dallas had response
(Morrow's goal after an especially foolish penalty by Pascal
Trepanier) and the Stars kept responding all night long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for most of the game it was pretty even,'' said
Hartsburg. ``I thought we did a good job in the third period, but
it just wasn't meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Dallas' goals were scored within 10 feet of the net as
the Stars crashed the net and goalie Guy Hebert all night long. On
their fourth goal (scored by Sergei Zubov) Guy Carbonneau ran over
Hebert, but referees Blaine Angus and Dan Marouelli told Hartsburg
that the Ducks had trapped the center in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a long point shot by Dave Manson that all but doomed
the Ducks. Manson, playing his first game since being picked off
the Chicago scrap heap two days agao, beat Hebert with a drive
through a huge traffic jam in front of the Anaheim net at 7:50 of
the second period. Manson's first goal of the season gave Dallas a
3-1 lead, and when the Stars score three or more goals they just
don't lose. Dallas has now won 42 straight games when it scores
three or more times.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks tried their best to end that streak -- Matt Cullen
scored with 37.3 seconds left in the second to pull them within
3-2, but Zubov scored at 2:53 of the third period. Kariya brought
the Ducks within one again at 11:53, scoring off a feed by Teemu
Selanne, who extended his point-scoring streak to nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen was robbed by Dallas goalie Ed Belfour a little over a
minute later and Langenbrunner put the game away when he took
advantage of Mike Keane's centering pass bouncing off Oleg
Tverdovsky and shoved the puck through Hebert's legs at 15:39.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what it takes to win,'' said Kariya. ``They played
smart, didn't turn the puck over and scored on their chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who outshot Dallas 26-22, weren't an equal in any of
those departments, but Kariya said the team can't afford to get
down on itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stay on an even keel,'' he said. ``We realize we
made some mistakes, but we know we played real well at times.'' &QL;

UCLA HOLDS OFF USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was everything the first game was not _
intense, competitive, thrilling and, to the delight of the raucous
home crowd, a UCLA victory.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for success, the Bruins got 25 second-half points from
freshman forward Jason Kapono and a career game from guard Earl
Watson to snap their three-game losing streak and repel USC 83-78
Wednesday night before 11,076 at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed by double-digits early, but they shot 68
percent and scored 46 points in their best second half of the
season to avenge a 12-point loss in the Sports Arena last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed us in that game,'' said Kapono. ``Tonight, we
tried to play with heart, play hard and play as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA took control with a 9-2 surge late in the second haf,
turning a 60-60 tie into a 69-62 advantage. The Trojans got as
close as 78-76, but Kapono and Ryan Bailey made enough free throws
in the final seconds to survive. Suddenly, the Bruins have a speck
of momentum entering Sunday's showdown at No. 4 Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose three in a row at UCLA, it's easy to get down
and get fragile,'' said Bruins coach Steve Lavin. ``I'm proud of
the way our guys fought their fannies off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (13-8, 4-6) now need five wins in their last nine
games to reach the 18-victory plateau that probably would secure an
NCAA Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (13-9, 6-4) are in a similar bind after their
seventh consecutive loss in Pauley. They've played better than UCLA
in the Pac-10, but worse outside. Because of a 7-5 nonconference
record, they need five victories in their last eight to attain 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can still reach our goal,'' Trojans point guard Brandon
Granville said. ``The loss tonight just puts added pressure on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as every day, Kapono was UCLA's hero. In the second
half, he made 9-of-10 shots, grabbed five rebounds and scored 25 of
the Bruins' 46 points. He also made the most important basket,
converting an offensive rebound to give the Bruins 75-70 lead with
less than a minute left. After USC closed to 76-74, Kapono calmly
drained two free throws with 27 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``(At halftime) I just told myself I had to come out and play
better,'' Kapono said. ``I'm not the kind of guy who gets down on
himself and starts weeping and pouting. I was just trying to get a
victory, because we definitely need wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Three tactical adjustments by the UCLA coaching staff were as
essential to the victory as Kapono's second half.
</P>
<P>
   - The Bruins scrapped the structured 1-4 offense they've used
all season and returned to the freewheeling motion game they ran in
previous seasons. The motion had an immediate impact on their
rhythm and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played like we did the last two years,'' assistant Jim Saia
said. ``We freed their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   -The Bruins inserted reserve point guard Ryan Bailey into the
lineup, which took the ballhandling pressure off Watson.
Unshackled, Watson ran the court, attacked the basket and finished
with 22 points, seven assists and (begin ital)zero turnovers(end
ital).
</P>
<P>
   ``Having (Bailey) in there allows me to use all my abilities,''
Watson said. ``It was like the last two years when Baron (Davis)
and I played together.''
</P>
<P>
   -Helpless against USC's man-to-man offense in the first half,
the Bruins switched to a matchup zone in second. The difference was
dramatic: USC made 15-of-27 shots in the first half and 11-of-30 in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as good a rhythm offense team as I've seen in 10 years
at UCLA,'' Lavin said. ``They were less effective setting screens
(against the zone), and they didn't get as many catch-and-shoot
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Using their motion attack exclusively in the second half, the
Bruins moved the ball like they have not moved it all season. Their
much-maligned offense actually (begin ital)looked good.(end ital)
In addition, their pressure defense and rekindled fast break
generated easy baskets - so rare in recent weeks - and wore down
the injury-ravaged Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got a little winded with 10 minutes to go,'' said
Trojans coach Henry Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins scored on five consecutive possessions and took a
53-52 lead with 12 minutes left on Kapono's 3-pointer. The teams
exchanged baskets and turnovers for several minutes, then UCLA
edged to a five-point lead when Ray Young swiped the ball from Jeff
Trepagnier and raced for a layup.
</P>

   Brian Scalabrine quieted crowd with a nifty layup, but the
Bruins kept attacking. Kapono converted a Jerome Moiso miss, then
fed Moiso for a reverse dunk that gave the Bruins a 69-62 lead with
five minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kapono and Moiso had too many easy baskets,'' Bibby said.

KINGS WIN WITH HIGH FIVE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX -- The night after getting embarrassed by the last-place
Mighty Ducks, the Kings trailed the first-place Phoenix Coyotes by
two goals just eight minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the ice was melting around them.
</P>
<P>
   But to figure how they scored the next five goals to defeat the
Coyotes 5-2 on Wednesday in front of 14,029 at America West would
be like trying to explain the Pacific Division, clearly NHL's
toughest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been very easy to just lay down at that point
after we got behind,'' said former Coyote Bob Corkum, who scored
the Kings' fourth goal. ``Tough game the night before and then
this. I think it says something about how resilient this team can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   For a team that easily could have been looking at a two-game
losing streak heading into Friday's matchup against Dallas,
Wednesday's victory was extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who have not beaten the Stars in their last 22
meetings, knocked Phoenix out of the top spot by making the little
things count.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake's power play goal with 25 seconds left in the second
period broke a 2-2 tie and let the Kings head to the dressing room
with their heads up.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings also killed off almost four consecutive minutes in
penalties earlier in the period, just when the Coyotes seemed ready
to break out.
</P>
<P>
   Ziggy Palffy continued to dazzle offensively with his second two
-goal performance in the last three games. Palffy, who also had two
assists, had one of two power play goals for the Kings, who had
just three in the previous six games.
</P>
<P>
   But there also was goaltender Jamie Storr, who settled down
after a shaky start to beat the Coyotes for the second time here
this season .
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps there was nothing more satisfying about this game
than the goal by Corkum, who was unwanted by the Coyotes this year
after playing in Phoenix the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His goal gave the Kings a 4-2 lead, but also came one shift
after they killed off another penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird how things happen,'' said Storr, who stopped 31
shots, including the last 25.. ``One night things can be awful and
the next everyone is smiling. We played great.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other time the Kings won a game this year when they
trailed by two goals was Oct. 28 in a 5-3 victory over Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look good at the beginning. Just 77 seconds into the
game, the Coyotes had a 2-on-1 break an Dallas Drake with the puck.
Both Blake and Storr guessed Drake would take the shot, but they
guessed wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Drake slid a cross-ice pass to Carney, who fired at a near empty
net with Storr sprawled on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes made it 2-0 on a power play goal with just 8:05 gone
. With Glen Murray off for interference, Teppo Numminen lifted a
soft pass into the middle and off the stick of Greg Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, a former King who has made a career in front of the
net, took the loose puck off his chest, then fired it between
Storr's legs for his 11th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Palffy started the comeback with 12:44 gone in the first
period, when he scored a power play goal after a slick pass in
front by Jozef Stumpel. It was Palffy's 20th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With just two minutes remaining in the first period, the Kings
tied the game on a goal by Jozef Stumpel, another hot hand who has
four goals in the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   But Blake, who represented the Kings at Sunday's All-Star game
in Toronto, provided the momentum shift when his slap shot struck
the cross bar before dropping behind Phoenix goaltender Sean Burke
at 19:35.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a moment we will remember,'' Storr said. ``But there
was a lot of other stuff, too.''

LAKERS FIND A RHYTHM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They don't have the best record in the league.
They're not in firs t place in their division. And some of them
won't even get much of a bre ather in the next five days the NBA
loosely terms a ``break.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers take high spirits and a renewed sense of rhythm
into the All-Star break that begins today.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since early January, they have a discernible
winning streak -- three in a row after dismantling the Minnesota
Timberwolves 114-81 at Staples Center on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The newfound momentum is interrupted only by the league's
regularly scheduled weekend of self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' Kobe Bryant said after scoring 24 points in
the rout . ``It's imprtant to win at home because we have a long
road stretch (af ter the break), so it was good to get these three
wins under our belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found our rhythm a little bit now. It's a matter of
getting through levels. ... We hit kind of a low point, now we're
picking it back up to a high level.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Stars Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal warmed up for the weekend
by combining for 61 points against the overmatched Timberwolves. It
was a blowout by halftime, when O'Neal had 27 points, and it was
over long before he finished with a game-high 37 points and 16
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guys were looking for me, I was hitting the (free) throws,
everything was going pretty good,'' said O'Neal, who was 11 for 16
from the field and 15 for 20 from the line. ``If they had looked
for me a little more in the second half, I'd have had 60. ... I'm
changing my name to The Big Havlicek because of my free-throw
shooting ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota All-Star Kevin Garnett got 29 points but little help
from his teammates as the Lakers held the Wolves to 34 percent
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played very well to take Minnesota out of what
they were trying to do early in the game,'' said coach Phil
Jackson. ``When Shaq is moving with the energy he plays at in a
game like this, it's very difficult to handle for a team like that.
He was the energy behind the club tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy, but satisfying, and as significant a win as any.
The Lakers hadn't won three in a row since their 16-game streak
ended Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers thus enter the break with an impressive 37-11 record
but had to settle for second best in the NBA, and their division --
the Portland Trail Blazers (38-11) took a half-game edge with their
107-100 victory over the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   After a 3-6 slide, the Lakers seem close to regaining the level
of proficiency they once displayed, but Jackson said the last week
of play won't mean much when his team opens a six-game road trip
through the East on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's tough to maintain any momentum after an All-Star
break,'' he said. ``When you come apart and come back together
again, it's four or five days later, we'll be in snowbound country
at that time, so it will be difficult. It will be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, the Timberwolves were one of the hottest
teams in the league, winners of nine of their last 11 games and 20
of their last 25 -- the best record in the NBA over the last seven
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They cooled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal quietly rumbled to seven points in the first quarter,
then explo ded for 20 in the second as the Lakers opened a 19-point
lead. When O'Neal took his first breather, with 5:58 left in the
first half, O'Neal and the Timberwolves were tied with 25 points
each, and the Lakers were up 44-25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq's probably the best player in the NBA,'' said Garnett.
``Ain't n othing you can do if Shaq has 40, 50. You've got to
compare him to Wilt and Jabbar. If he makes free throws, it's hands
down that he's the best player in the NBA -- if he isn't already.''

CLINTON BLASTS GOP INACTION ON COURT NOMINEES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALLEN, Texas _ President Clinton renewed his criticism
Wednesday of extended delays by the Republican-led Senate in
considering Hispanic nominees to federal court vacancies, including
a Texan he named to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   While on a swing through McAllen and Dallas to raise an
estimated $1 million for the Democratic Party, the president
accused Senate Republicans of ``deliberately slow-walking and
refusing to have hearings'' on his court nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming them, Clinton singled out the state's two
Republican senators _ Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison _ for not
signing-off on his appointment of Enrique Moreno to one of three
vacancies on the 5th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, a Harvard-educated lawyer in El Paso, was nominated in
September to replace Judge Will Garwood of Austin, who left active
status in May 1997. Moreno is one of 43 judicial nominees awaiting
Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the shortage of judges on the appeals court and its
backlog of cases, the president told a group of South Texans that
their two senators should ``give (Moreno) a hearing and give him a
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   If the senators ``are not for him, have the courage to vote
against him,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Texans dismissed Clinton's assertion, denied any effort
to hold up Moreno's nomination and accused Clinton of unnecessary
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that the president would come to the border
to attack the two Texas senators at a political fund-raiser when
he's been ignoring our border concerns for five years,'' Hutchison
said, mentioning specifically Clinton's inaction on a congressional
mandate to hire more Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said a panel of lawyers that advises
the two senators on judicial appointments in Texas is scheduled to
meet with Moreno in Fort Worth next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only President Clinton could leave a judgeship vacant for a
year and complain that somebody else is stalling,'' Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear that in President Clinton's final year in
office that bipartisan agreement is going to be needed to pass
anything. Smart cracks like this just poison that well.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks at a fund-raiser in McAllen, the president
stopped short of accusing Senate Republicans of acting out of
ethnic bias. However, the only nominees he mentioned have Hispanic
surnames.
</P>
<P>
   One of the others _ U.S. District Judge Richard Paez _ has been
awaiting a Senate vote for 3 1/2 years on his appointment to the
3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in California. Also mentioned by
Clinton was Philadelphia lawyer Julio Fuentes, who is awaiting
confirmation for a district judgeship.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that continues to bother me in my efforts to
build one America is the problem in the United States Senate in
getting judges confirmed ... particularly judges who come from
diverse backgrounds,'' Clinton told the predominantly Hispanic
group of Democratic donors.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the liberal group People for the American Way
indicates that seven of the 10 candidates whose nominations have
been delayed the longest by the Senate are women or minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, which normally
holds hearings on all judicial nominees, cleared 101 Clinton
appointees last year, and almost half were women or minorities. The
full Senate approved 19 of Clinton's court appointments last year,
including four women, four Hispanics and one African-American.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the U.S. Hispanic Institute in Chicago in
October, Clinton fired a rhetorical broadside at the Senate after
it rejected, along party lines, Missouri Supreme Court Justice
Ronnie White for a federal judgeship. White, an African-American,
was the first presidential nominee to the court that the Senate had
refused to confirm in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Hispanic appointments to the courts and other
positions in the executive branch of government is expected to be a
particularly sensitive issue as the 2000 elections approach.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's Hispanic vote is likely to become a focal point in
the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential frontrunner _ Texas Gov. George W.
Bush _ received about half of the Hispanic vote when he won
re-election in 1998. Hispanics traditionally vote Democratic by
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a growing backlog of cases and the Senate delays in
confirming judges, the chief judge of the 5th Circuit issued an
order allowing more cases to be assigned to visiting judges.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans-based court hears appeals from federal courts in
Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Of the 17 appellate judges
authorized for the court, three slots are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has yet to schedule a hearing on
Moreno's appointment, or for Alston Johnston II of Baton Rouge,
La., who was named to fill another 5th Circuit vacancy.

   WASHINGTON _ Political pundits usually live in the world to be.
Like stock market touts, we discount past performance and
fast-forward to handicap the next supposedly climactic primary
races.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists build up and tear down candidates, sometimes on
flimsy evidence. When the story line inevitably takes an unexpected
turn, we tend to duck, shed blame for having been wrong and move on
to frame our next set of forgettable misjudgments.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, as a rule, live in the world that was. By nature a
cautious lot, they stick to the tried and true, hoping to avert a
big boo-boo that could undo their careers.
</P>
<P>
   These divergent outlooks always spark tensions. But there are
more of them when there's no dominant single issue in the campaign.
In such times, political contests tend to become tests of
character.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on the issues, most folks mention family values or
education, neither of which are particularly federal concerns, long
before they cite welfare reform or tax cuts, which are legitimate
presidential matters.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any active politician, I believe, could benefit from
the counsel of a good psychiatrist to help him or her deal with
today's dislocating climate, to say nothing of the anxiety-spawning
cycles of adoration and rejection that infuse the political trade.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, just about any working pundit could benefit
from a session with a good historian or philosopher. Since such
people take the long view, they rarely fall into the common
journalistic error of seeking to carve the big picture out of the
latest poll numbers or primary results.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent pit stop in the Swiss Alps, at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, I got a chance to tune out President
Clinton (who was also there) and listen to Umberto Eco, a renowned
professor of semiotics _ the study of the meaning of language _ at
the University of Bologna in Italy. Eco's fiction, essays, academic
texts and children's books have brought him recognition as one of
the most vital authors of the past century.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans glory in a seemingly unending millennial run of
peace and prosperity, Eco sees a long-term political future that
combines the dark vision of George Orwell with the false idols of
celebrity worship.
</P>
<P>
   The coming decline of the nation-state, he fears, will augur the
fall of representative democracy. Then ``a leader chosen for his
communication skills will be elected _ probably online _ to govern
each great global territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Eco: ``Powerful groups will support candidates who have
exactly the same qualities and the same programs as the opposing
candidate. Thus the citizen's vote _ which will be motivated not by
political choice but by the requirements of show business _ will
become a formal gesture which will only sanction a choice made
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, as Lord Keynes, the late British economist,
once said, we are all dead. But Eco, in scanning recent political
contests, including the one now absorbing Washington, says
mischievously: ``I've a tiny suspicion that we've already got
there.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The president's new clothes
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the list of kinky practices already laid at the door of
President Clinton, add another: political cross-dressing.
</P>
<P>
   For with his 2000 budget, it is the Democratic president who is
insisting on a fiscally cautious agenda while a Republican Congress
clamors to take up a profligate one.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans still sputter that Clinton is a tax-and-spend
Democrat, but the new revenue in the president's budget comes from
only a 25-cent levy on packs of cigarettes, as much an anti-smoking
move as a money generator, and from closing several tax loopholes
Congress has bored into the code for its corporate keepers.
</P>
<P>
   At basic issue is whether we're headed toward a nearly $2
trillion surplus over the next decade, as the Congressional Budget
Office says is possible and congressional Republicans want to
believe, or a surplus of rather less than half of that, as the CBO
and the White House think is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   For either estimate to pan out, the economy will have to defy
the law of averages and continue its record expansion, but for the
higher boon Congress also would have to stick to the domestic
spending caps in the 1997 balanced-budget act. It didn't last year,
won't this year and, with surpluses, needn't, really.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in contrast, assumes a certain amount of fudging on the
caps, and figures that inflation, at levels like recent ones, also
will nibble into the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP needs the rosier forecast to accommodate the big tax cut
that has become the main raison d'etre of the party. Indeed, with
the Cold War won, the economy purring and crime way down, big tax
cuts sometimes seem the party's only reason for being _ and never
mind that the biggie pushed in Congress last year flopped with the
public or that the one Geo. W. is hawking is winning him, at least
so far, no landslides even among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (Amusingly, John McCain seems to be prospering, not despite but
in part thanks to Bush's charge that the smaller cut McCain favors,
targeted to middle and lower earners, is _ egads! _ like
Clinton's.)
</P>
<P>
   President and Congress alike would bolster Social Security and
Medicare, but Clinton, with only a modest tax cut, would dedicate
the rest of the surplus, after nicking some current programs for
offsetting money, to his familiar purposes: support to education,
help for the elderly with prescription costs, health coverage for
some of the uninsured and, crucially, federal debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   In the current political deadlock in Washington, that amounts
more to a platform for the Democratic nominee to run on than to a
real to-do list. Either way, though, its fiscal prudence is
striking.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget does increase military and domestic spending a
bit, but the Center for Budget Priorities and Policy calculates
that by 2010, spending under the White House budget would drop from
18.7 to 16.7 percent of gross domestic product, lowest since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who came into office as a New Democrat, is going out
more like an old Republican.

<P>
   Alex, age 23, and Griffin, age 4, are hell on decor. Thanks to
them, the laboratory-cum-home of these impish African Grey parrots
looks as if a miniature tornado has blown through.
</P>
<P>
   Strewn about are pieces of fruit from discarded snacks, mangled
toys and a huge mound of cardboard cartons demolished with great
relish by Alex.
</P>
<P>
   Animal behaviorist Irene Pepperberg, the birds' caretaker,
tolerates her two charges, partly because they have richly rewarded
her serious scientific inquiry into the intelligence of animals.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, her research has implicitly challenged
the idea that humans alone are capable of real thought and real
communication. In a series of experiments, Alex and Griffin have
shown themselves intelligent enough to comprehend and juggle
abstract images of the objects that make up their world _ skills
once thought to be the exclusive property of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pepperberg's tutelage, the parrots have learned to speak
English so clearly they'd delight even a fussy speech expert.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of this work goes far beyond experiments in voice
training. These parrots associate specific words with specific
objects, and they have learned to identify a number of different
colors, shapes and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pepperberg began this research in the 1970s, few
scientists had studied intelligence in parrots, and few do today.
Most inquiries have instead focused on monkeys, chimpanzees,
gorillas and dolphins, all of which are much more difficult to
raise, feed and handle.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg especially likes parrots because, like humans,
they're smart, long-lived (often up to 50 years), social animals
that depend on communication for survival.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, to communicate with people, parrots don't need
devices built with buttons to push, and they don't need to be
taught sign language: They can learn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Although Irene Pepperberg has always loved animals, she chose
chemistry as her field in graduate school at Harvard University.
There, in the early 1970s, she happened to see a TV documentary
about how animals learn. She became fascinated by the question of
just how smart animals are and whether they can learn to
communicate with humans.
</P>
<P>
   While finishing up her chemistry degree, she began taking
courses in animal behavior, psychology and communication. In 1977
she acquired 1-year-old Alex. He became the center of her research
in a small lab at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the animal-intelligence research of that era ultimately
foundered before an onslaught of skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to overinterpret when you have a bird that says,
`I'll see you tomorrow,''' Pepperberg says. ``I've got enough
anecdotal data like that to fill a book. But what's really
referential?''
</P>
<P>
   What, in other words, constitutes proof that the bird knows what
it is saying?
</P>
<P>
   The history of science is littered with animals that seemed to
be displaying extraordinary brainpower but were just responding to
unconscious prompts from owners and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such pitfalls, Pepperberg designs experiments with the
care of a hard-nosed skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when an experiment demands that Alex learn a new
word like ``none,'' Pepperberg waits until the parrot's
pronunciation is so unambiguous that different observers agree 90
percent of the time on what he's saying. That ensures that an
experimenter eager for Alex to succeed won't mishear a slurred
random utterance as a correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   She also strives to avoid the possibility that a correct
response is merely conditioned _ automatic behavior generated by
the anticipation of a reward. So experimenters vary their
repertoire of questions to make sure that Alex is responding to the
content of the question and making intelligent discriminations.
</P>
<P>
   And to avoid the possibility that the experimenter's body
language might be prompting Alex's answers, students who test Alex
are never the same ones who taught him the words and concepts
involved.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pepperberg's work has won accolades for its
persuasiveness from the likes of Oxford University animal
behaviorist Marian Stamp Dawkins, an authority on animal
consciousness and a skeptic about many studies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, human error offers the birds an opportunity to show
how smart they are. Roughly 5 percent of the time, for example,
student questioners slip up and scold Alex with a ``No!'' when he
has in fact given the correct answer. When this occurs, Alex tends
to stick to his guns and repeat the correct answer. Eventually the
examiner comes to her senses, and Alex gets the reward he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's training technique is interactive, using a
model/rival mode. And it is simple: Both animals and people learn
more readily when they can observe and even compete with others
learning at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The best results come if the pupil watches a tutor coaching
someone else. The pupil learns by noting that the teacher rewards
the student for correct answers and gives rebukes for wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, pioneered by Dietmar Todt at the University of
Freiburg, Germany, in the 1970s, worked quickly when Pepperberg
tried it with Alex. He caught on rapidly as she taught the
undergraduate who served as a model. Alex began competing with the
student for Pepperberg's attention and approval.
</P>
<P>
   The model/rival strategy worked so well for Alex that it has
been successfully adapted for helping developmentally disabled
children learn.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, Alex had learned the names of more than 50
different objects, five shapes and seven colors. He'd also learned
what ``same'' and ``different'' mean _ a crucial step in human
intellectual development. Show Alex two objects of different shape,
color and material, and then ask him, ``What's same?'' He'll
answer, ``None!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus he appears to understand not only similarities and
differences but also an even more abstract concept _ absence.
</P>
<P>
   Alex has become so skilled that, in one of Pepperberg's
projects, he has been promoted to the position of tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see if Alex can work as a tutor for Griffin,''
Pepperberg explains. ``Partly we got Griffin to replicate our work
with Alex, to prove he wasn't some kind of avian Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, Justin, one of Pepperberg's undergraduate
assistants, instructs Griffin and Alex to hop up on the work perch.
</P>
<P>
   But things get off to a balky start. Griffin seems cranky,
insistently croaking, ``Wanna go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin displays a ring and asks: ``What toy, Griffin?'' Griffin
answers ``Wood!'' and Alex unhelpfully pipes up with ``Rock! Rock!
Rock!'' A couple more trials follow, in which Griffin correctly
identifies cork, wood and wool. Alex sits taciturnly by.
</P>
<P>
   As the experimental session progresses, both Alex and Griffin
seem to slide into the spirit of things, falling almost naturally
into the model/rival mode.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's research is forcing psychologists to rethink the
boundaries between animals and humans. The thought processes of
Alex and Griffin may approximate our own a lot or a little,
Pepperberg says, but it's getting well-nigh impossible to deny
their intelligence. &QL;

   Trouble is brewing beneath the waves. Biologists report that
marine diseases are on the rise, and the ocean's inhabitants _
fish, mammals, plants and invertebrates alike _ are suffering.

   Nobody knows the exact cause of the ocean epidemics, but human
activity undoubtedly plays a role.

   Untreated sewage is thought to feed outbreaks of toxic algae,

   Over the past few years, astronomers have spotted signs of
ancient coastlines on Mars, the remnants of a vast, possibly
life-harboring ocean. But those Martian seashores now seem to be a
hopeful illusion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor snapped more than
1,000 pictures of the Red Planet. Geologist Ken Edgett and
geomorphologist Michael Malin of Malin Space Science Systems in San
Diego scrutinized 14 images containing purported shorelines.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists saw no wave-cut cliffs or sediment shaped by
waves. Instead, they found boundaries between lava flows and
highlands, or disconnected features that looked continuous in
earlier, poorer images.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the real Mars is still plenty interesting. Pictures
from the Global Surveyor show evidence of giant floods, including
boulders that ended up stacked on top of one another when the
waters receded.
</P>
<P>
   All being well, the Polar Lander that reached Mars last month
will dig for remnants of that water buried frozen in the soil,
monitor clouds, and send back sounds of the Martian winds. If the

<P>
   Alex, age 23, and Griffin, age 4, are hell on decor. Thanks to
them, the laboratory-cum-home of these impish African Grey parrots
looks as if a miniature tornado has blown through.
</P>
<P>
   Strewn about are pieces of fruit from discarded snacks, mangled
toys and a huge mound of cardboard cartons demolished with great
relish by Alex.
</P>
<P>
   Animal behaviorist Irene Pepperberg, the birds' caretaker,
tolerates her two charges, partly because they have richly rewarded
her serious scientific inquiry into the intelligence of animals.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, her research has implicitly challenged
the idea that humans alone are capable of real thought and real
communication. In a series of experiments, Alex and Griffin have
shown themselves intelligent enough to comprehend and juggle
abstract images of the objects that make up their world _ skills
once thought to be the exclusive property of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pepperberg's tutelage, the parrots have learned to speak
English so clearly they'd delight even a fussy speech expert.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of this work goes far beyond experiments in voice
training. These parrots associate specific words with specific
objects, and they have learned to identify a number of different
colors, shapes and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pepperberg began this research in the 1970s, few
scientists had studied intelligence in parrots, and few do today.
Most inquiries have instead focused on monkeys, chimpanzees,
gorillas and dolphins, all of which are much more difficult to
raise, feed and handle.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg especially likes parrots because, like humans,
they're smart, long-lived (often up to 50 years), social animals
that depend on communication for survival.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, to communicate with people, parrots don't need
devices built with buttons to push, and they don't need to be
taught sign language: They can learn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Although Irene Pepperberg has always loved animals, she chose
chemistry as her field in graduate school at Harvard University.
There, in the early 1970s, she happened to see a TV documentary
about how animals learn. She became fascinated by the question of
just how smart animals are and whether they can learn to
communicate with humans.
</P>
<P>
   While finishing up her chemistry degree, she began taking
courses in animal behavior, psychology and communication. In 1977
she acquired 1-year-old Alex. He became the center of her research
in a small lab at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the animal-intelligence research of that era ultimately
foundered before an onslaught of skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to overinterpret when you have a bird that says,
`I'll see you tomorrow,''' Pepperberg says. ``I've got enough
anecdotal data like that to fill a book. But what's really
referential?''
</P>
<P>
   What, in other words, constitutes proof that the bird knows what
it is saying?
</P>
<P>
   The history of science is littered with animals that seemed to
be displaying extraordinary brainpower but were just responding to
unconscious prompts from owners and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such pitfalls, Pepperberg designs experiments with the
care of a hard-nosed skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when an experiment demands that Alex learn a new
word like ``none,'' Pepperberg waits until the parrot's
pronunciation is so unambiguous that different observers agree 90
percent of the time on what he's saying. That ensures that an
experimenter eager for Alex to succeed won't mishear a slurred
random utterance as a correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   She also strives to avoid the possibility that a correct
response is merely conditioned _ automatic behavior generated by
the anticipation of a reward. So experimenters vary their
repertoire of questions to make sure that Alex is responding to the
content of the question and making intelligent discriminations.
</P>
<P>
   And to avoid the possibility that the experimenter's body
language might be prompting Alex's answers, students who test Alex
are never the same ones who taught him the words and concepts
involved.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pepperberg's work has won accolades for its
persuasiveness from the likes of Oxford University animal
behaviorist Marian Stamp Dawkins, an authority on animal
consciousness and a skeptic about many studies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, human error offers the birds an opportunity to show
how smart they are. Roughly 5 percent of the time, for example,
student questioners slip up and scold Alex with a ``No!'' when he
has in fact given the correct answer. When this occurs, Alex tends
to stick to his guns and repeat the correct answer. Eventually the
examiner comes to her senses, and Alex gets the reward he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's training technique is interactive, using a
model/rival mode. And it is simple: Both animals and people learn
more readily when they can observe and even compete with others
learning at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The best results come if the pupil watches a tutor coaching
someone else. The pupil learns by noting that the teacher rewards
the student for correct answers and gives rebukes for wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, pioneered by Dietmar Todt at the University of
Freiburg, Germany, in the 1970s, worked quickly when Pepperberg
tried it with Alex. He caught on rapidly as she taught the
undergraduate who served as a model. Alex began competing with the
student for Pepperberg's attention and approval.
</P>
<P>
   The model/rival strategy worked so well for Alex that it has
been successfully adapted for helping developmentally disabled
children learn.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, Alex had learned the names of more than 50
different objects, five shapes and seven colors. He'd also learned
what ``same'' and ``different'' mean _ a crucial step in human
intellectual development. Show Alex two objects of different shape,
color and material, and then ask him, ``What's same?'' He'll
answer, ``None!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus he appears to understand not only similarities and
differences but also an even more abstract concept _ absence.
</P>
<P>
   Alex has become so skilled that, in one of Pepperberg's
projects, he has been promoted to the position of tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see if Alex can work as a tutor for Griffin,''
Pepperberg explains. ``Partly we got Griffin to replicate our work
with Alex, to prove he wasn't some kind of avian Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, Justin, one of Pepperberg's undergraduate
assistants, instructs Griffin and Alex to hop up on the work perch.
</P>
<P>
   But things get off to a balky start. Griffin seems cranky,
insistently croaking, ``Wanna go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin displays a ring and asks: ``What toy, Griffin?'' Griffin
answers ``Wood!'' and Alex unhelpfully pipes up with ``Rock! Rock!
Rock!'' A couple more trials follow, in which Griffin correctly
identifies cork, wood and wool. Alex sits taciturnly by.
</P>
<P>
   As the experimental session progresses, both Alex and Griffin
seem to slide into the spirit of things, falling almost naturally
into the model/rival mode.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's research is forcing psychologists to rethink the
boundaries between animals and humans. The thought processes of
Alex and Griffin may approximate our own a lot or a little,
Pepperberg says, but it's getting well-nigh impossible to deny
their intelligence. &QL;

what ``same'' and ``different'' mean _ a crucial step in human
intellectual development. Show Alex two objects of different shape,
color and material, and then ask him, ``What's same?'' He'll
answer, ``None!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus he appears to understand not only similarities and
differences but also an even more abstract concept _ absence.
</P>
<P>
   Alex has become so skilled that, in one of Pepperberg's
projects, he has been promoted to the position of tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see if Alex can work as a tutor for Griffin,''
Pepperberg explains. ``Partly we got Griffin to replicate our work
with Alex, to prove he wasn't some kind of avian Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, Justin, one of Pepperberg's undergraduate
assistants, instructs Griffin and Alex to hop up on the work perch.
</P>
<P>
   But things get off to a balky start. Griffin seems cranky,
insistently croaking, ``Wanna go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin displays a ring and asks: ``What toy, Griffin?'' Griffin
answers ``Wood!'' and Alex unhelpfully pipes up with ``Rock! Rock!
Rock!'' A couple more trials follow, in which Griffin correctly
identifies cork, wood and wool. Alex sits taciturnly by.
</P>
<P>
   As the experimental session progresses, both Alex and Griffin
seem to slide into the spirit of things, falling almost naturally
into the model/rival mode.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's research is forcing psychologists to rethink the
boundaries between animals and humans. The thought processes of
Alex and Griffin may approximate our own a lot or a little,
Pepperberg says, but it's getting well-nigh impossible to deny
their intelligence. &QL;

   Over the past few years, astronomers have spotted signs of
ancient coastlines on Mars, the remnants of a vast, possibly
life-harboring ocean. But those Martian seashores now seem to be a
hopeful illusion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor snapped more than
1,000 pictures of the Red Planet. Geologist Ken Edgett and
geomorphologist Michael Malin of Malin Space Science Systems in San
Diego scrutinized 14 images containing purported shorelines.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists saw no wave-cut cliffs or sediment shaped by
waves. Instead, they found boundaries between lava flows and
highlands, or disconnected features that looked continuous in
earlier, poorer images.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the real Mars is still plenty interesting. Pictures
from the Global Surveyor show evidence of giant floods, including
boulders that ended up stacked on top of one another when the
waters receded.
</P>
<P>
   All being well, the Polar Lander that reached Mars last month
will dig for remnants of that water buried frozen in the soil,
monitor clouds, and send back sounds of the Martian winds. If the

   According to statistics compiled by the American Society of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, 9,023 of these operations were
performed in 1998, more than double the figure for 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Solomon, a Philadelphia plastic surgeon whose clientele
includes many men, points to the growing number of bodybuilders
downing anabolic steroids to increase muscle bulk. The drugs can
trigger breast growth when the body converts them into estrogenlike
compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductive endocrinologist Claude Hughes of Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles says poor diet and lack of exercise
help send men to surgeons as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our population is more obese than it's ever been, and it's
reasonable to think that would increase demand for this
procedure,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a more sinister possibility. Many common pollutants,
including some PCBS, also mimic the effect of estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Could these compounds cause men to develop breasts?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plausible hypothesis,'' says Hughes, who studies
environmental estrogens.
</P>
<P>
   To test it, he suggests examining fat tissue removed during male
breast reduction and comparing its levels of estrogen-mimicking
contaminants to those of fat removed from men undergoing a neutral
operation, such as cardiac surgery.

 &HT;    Old friends gather again to talk politics and football
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We have gathered at Guero's, where the wait for
a table on this weeknight is over an hour, even at 7:30 p.m. _
leading me to once again wonder if anyone in Austin actually eats
supper at home. If you don't have to wait for a table in an Austin
restaurant, you can assume one of two things:
</P>
<P>
   _ The food is terrible.
</P>
<P>
   _ You're at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, no hurry. This is a reunion of friends who haven't
seen each other in some time, though e-mail keeps us in touch. In
attendance are two lawyers; a long-time teacher and poet; his wife,
who's finishing up at LBJ School of Public Affairs in a midcareer
change from working for government; their daughter, who's my
goddaughter; my daughters and their boyfriends (who are there for
the free meal _ free to them, that is); and two friends from back
home who I invited along.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher/poet, one of the lawyers and I go back 30 years or
so. We all grew up on the south side of Longview. Evan (the lawyer)
played second base on my little brother's Dixie League team. Frank
(the teacher/poet) and I met at this crisis hotline where we both
volunteered while in high school. Even now, it amazes me that a
church would donate an old house to host a crisis hotline run by
long-haired high school students who were generally in a state of
crisis themselves _ often self-induced, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis line was called T.H.I.S. Line, which stood for Teen
Help and Information Service. Teens would actually call, depressed
about breaking up with a boyfriend, complaining about strict
parents and on occasion even more serious matters. I don't recall
any genuine crises while I was working, though once an
ex-girlfriend called and started telling me about how she still had
a crush on her former beau, which turned out to be me. That was
weird. I took her out for a subsequent date on my motorcycle, since
I wasn't old enough to drive a car, but the spark wasn't there.
Always wondered what happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   To say we were unsupervised is an understatement. I learned to
drive a standard shift by driving Frank's sister's Rambler station
wagon around the house, circling in the yard. There was a mural,
badly done, of Che Guevera on the wall. T.H.I.S. Line became our
hangout even when not working, and it wasn't unusual to find
someone crashed on the bed who never quite made it home to their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Several of us ended up migrating to Stephen F. Austin after high
school and remained friends there, picking up a few more who have
stayed in the circle all these years. Over quesadillas and Shiner
Bock at Guero's, we told hair-raising college stories from
Nacogdoches, about the time a friend (who was absent from this
gathering) drove his pickup truck on the sidewalk near some faculty
apartments, sideswiped a light pole and got back on the road
without ever noticing what he'd done. We witnessed this because we
were riding in the bed of the truck at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I wonder how we survived those wild years, and it
makes me grateful that I'm a distance away from my two college-age
daughters who no doubt are creating some of their own memories.
Ignorance is bliss, in my view.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of the same gang has migrated to Austin, while somehow
I ended up back in the Pine Curtain after a brief stint in River
City and elsewhere. A few are active in local politics, working for
candidates and causes. We're all more conservative than we used to
be but still more liberal than our parents. The sight of my
grown-up daughters made a couple of these friends feel old. They
haven't seem then since they were wearing braces and playing with
Cabbage Patch dolls. Good. I shouldn't be the only one feeling old
for having a daughter who is now older than I was when the
aforementioned pickup incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pleasant evening. We retired early, work beckoning the
next day. It may be a few years before we're all back together
again, but that's OK. We'll slip right into the old routine,
arguing politics and sports, cussing the Cowboys and trying to
outdo one another with bad jokes. That's what friends are for.

 &HT;    The right _ and responsibility _ of free speech
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Those around here who fancy themselves Athenians
on the Colorado talk a lot about their right to free speech. Of all
rights embraced around here, we squeeze sounding off the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   Austinites love to express themselves, and, fortunately for
everyone, public bodies around here provide them ample opportunity.
The City Council, the commissioners court and the school board all
have time set aside for public comments, which run a gamut one
would expect in a city filled with high school valedictorians on
antihistamines.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Jesus Garza can't scratch his nose without holding
a public hearing first. Local cable has several channels devoted to
people who love to hear themselves talk. The most appropriate
T-shirt slogan for an Austinite reads: ``Everyone is entitled to MY
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   We have civic arguments about who is trying to squelch's whose
right to self-expression. The entertainment value of watching all
that go on is priceless, and I wouldn't change a thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Except ...
</P>
<P>
   It would be refreshing to hear all the free-speech advocates pay
attention to _ or at least acknowledge the existence of _ the
responsibilities that accompany a free-speech right.
</P>
<P>
   Exercising a free-speech right responsibly demands a certain
amount of civility and intellectual honesty. What we like to do a
lot around here is question motive, engage in ad hominem attack and
then act surprised and hurt if the target responds in kind.
</P>
<P>
   One observer of the local scene once commented that Austinites
wanted a hard-hitting newspaper as long it was the other side that
was getting hit hard. Like most humor, that little nugget has a
high truth content.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an exchange of views over the cancellation of
Henry Kissinger's speech on the University of Texas campus. You'll
recall that champions of free speech thought it would be a blow for
freedom to shout down an old man whose politics don't suit theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both sides have weighed in on the issue and, of
course, neither side is going to convince the other.
</P>
<P>
   I got a blistering letter from a fellow who defended the
self-styled radicals who planned to protest Kissinger's remarks
about our editorial on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   This fellow said he had been in an airplane recently and saw the
results of the illegal bombing of Cambodia during Kissinger's stint
in the Nixon White House.
</P>
<P>
   While I deplored that bombing at the time (but was restrained by
the Army uniform I was wearing then from expressing myself freely),
I can also see why the secret campaign was undertaken. If that
fellow had been a GI on the ground at the time instead of a
civilian whose insight was enhanced by elevation and 30 years of
hindsight, his viewpoint might be different. Cambodia was being
used by North Vietnamese military forces as a safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   But what the heck, he's entitled and so am I. I would have been
interested in hearing Kissinger's uninterrupted version of the
events leading to the decision to wage illegal military operations,
but that opportunity has been denied me and anyone else who might
have been interested.
</P>
<P>
   Was that exercising the right to free speech responsibly?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the fellow who has a program running on cable
access who alleges _ with no solid evidence _ that a prominent
local attorney was head conspirator in a mass murder. It is not
this guy's first brush with conspiracy theories, nor will it be his
last.
</P>
<P>
   I would wager that if he was taken seriously enough to be held
accountable for his wild accusations, he would whine and cry that
the establishment was squelching his right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech is not free. It carries responsibilities, and there
can be consequences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you have every right to tell that big bruiser on
the next stool that he and his mother are both ugly, but you'd
better be willing to accept the responsibility for what happens
next.
</P>
<P>
   We are very good about asserting our right to free speech and
not always as adept with handling the responsibility and
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But then, that's just my opinion.

 &HT;    Bush's loss has started a flood of questions
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Face it, George W. Bush: New Hampshire was more
than a speed bump.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush's 19-point loss to John McCain in Tuesday's GOP
primary, McCain has raised more than $1 million on the Internet,
Bush has told his backers to stop trying to keep McCain off the New
York ballot and McCain has jumped ahead in some South Carolina
polls where he had trailed by 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously interfered with the coronation,'' an ecstatic
McCain said.

   Now, the Bush campaign must re-evaluate. He had coasted to the
GOP nomination for governor on a sense of inevitability bolstered
by his name and family Rolodex. The same strategy was supposed to
work nationally.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part it has. The Bush camp's strategy from the
start was to amass so much money and so many endorsements that a
Bush win seemed a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush raised so much money so fast that he could avoid taking
federal matching money, with its accompanying spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   He also assembled a Chinese water torture of endorsements
dripped out day by day over reporters' fax machines: legislators
from Wyoming, another U.S. senator, governors from states across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to fly Bush's campaign plane so high and so fast
that he never had to join the fray at lower elevations, where other
candidates were elbowing for attention. Duck the debates. Talk to
reporters no more than necessary. Stay on message: Tax Cuts,
Compassionate Conservative, I Care.
</P>
<P>
   By the Iowa caucuses last month, Bush's juggernaut of big bucks
and party support had made opposing him seem fruitless, and indeed,
several candidates dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, who focused his insurgent campaign on New Hampshire,
ran a campaign that was the antithesis of Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's vociferous criticism of the Washington political money
machine focused attention on Bush's huge campaign treasury.
</P>
<P>
   His stream-of-consciousness availability to voters and reporters
was a stark contrast to Bush's guarded, rote campaign _ short on
open-ended issue discussion and long on pressing the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The chinks in the Bush armor began to show several weeks ago. He
had to drop his plan to avoid debates until 2000. He put in more
time in New Hampshire than he'd planned.
</P>
<P>
   His call for a large tax cut, while McCain talked about Social
Security and paying down the national debt, raised the question of
who was the true conservative. And is a mild tax cut in Texas that
no one really noticed, while overseeing a state government during
the nation's longest sustained economic growth in history, really
enough qualification to lead the Free World?
</P>
<P>
   The question seemed to become: Is there any there there? If
retail campaigning is Bush's strength, why didn't he win in the
retail state? Did the son inherit more from dad than the name? Have
his handlers screwed up by having Bush too contained, or is there
genuine fear that Letting Bush Be Bush would show he's an empty
suit?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hungry to take back the White House, who gave W. the
benefit of the doubt because it was his dad who had been kicked out
by the immoral Clinton, began to take it back. Can this guy go
one-on-one with the Democrat? Are we launching a Titanic?
</P>
<P>
   When W. brought mom and dad to New Hampshire, and Barbara
referred to her ``boy,'' it ironically underlined that the younger
Bush was where he was mostly due to dad's name ID and inherited
campaign machinery. What got him there to begin with, if
illuminated too clearly, could be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters wrote that Bush was homesick for his dog and bed
in Texas, he gave New Hampshire's independent-minded voters the
chance to say, ``We can help cure that, cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Bush is still the favorite. All the bucks and
backing are calculated to give him a big advantage when the
campaign explodes into several states in March.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, The Underdog McCain has caught the nation's
attention _ despite Bush's endorsement by Dan Quayle. Stay tuned.

   When most people meet her, Sigourney Weaver says, in her erudite
way, they expect her to be ``a butt-kicker.'' She is, after all, 6
feet tall, and her alter ego, Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley of the
four ``Alien'' movies, is one of the screen's all-time
take-no-prisoners broads.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am the least like a butt-kicker of anyone I know,''
Weaver says crisply.
</P>
<P>
   And sitting opposite her in a back room of L.A.'s Smashbox
Studios, it's easy to believe her. She is long, lithe and seemingly
hipless in black Celine pants, her delicate cheekbones and skinny
lips tweaked by a tinge of ladylike makeup. She looks like a strong
wind could blow her over _ and she never raises her voice beyond an
audible but polite whisper.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, there is a new excitement about Weaver's career,
which, over the course of 28 film roles in 20 years, has had its
natural ebbs and flows. But now she finds herself in three vastly
diverse roles: as an airhead sitcom actress in space in ``Galaxy
Quest,'' as a Midwestern mother experiencing meltdown in ``A Map of
the World'' and as a '50s housewife in Doug McGrath's bizarre
comedy, ``Company Man.''
</P>
<P>
   But diversity isn't new to her. Weaver has had an enviable
screen career, earning three Oscar nominations and starring in
everything from blockbuster comedies such as ``Ghostbusters'' to
critically acclaimed films like ``Working Girl'' and ``Gorillas in
the Mist.'' Still, it's Ripley of the ``Alien'' movies she's best
known for _ and, according to her, least like.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver (who was named Susan, but picked the name Sigourney from
the pages of ``The Great Gatsby'') went to Stanford and got her
master's degree at Yale in 1975. Then she struggled through a long
maze of New York showcases and acting coaches, despite being the
daughter of Pat Weaver _ who was president of NBC in the '50s _ and
actress Elizabeth Inglis.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's first major film role, 1979's ``Alien'' (she had a
brief six-second scene before that in ``Annie Hall'') sent her
career into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it's luck that got me to the `Alien' audition,''
Weaver says. The actress didn't have any desire to make a
futuristic action movie. Her upbringing had led her to an acting
agenda of Mike Nichols and Woody Allen-style urbane comedies.
</P>
<P>
   She cared so little about playing Ripley that she was almost
snippy with director Ridley Scott. Somehow, it paid off, and he
hired her. By the fourth installment, ``Alien: Resurrection'' in
1997, her paycheck was $11 million. That's more than the budget of
most Woody Allen movies.
</P>
<P>
   The tight shots in ``Alien'' of Weaver in BVDs didn't hurt when
she went up for the part opposite Mel Gibson in ``The Year of
Living Dangerously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to play small, act petite,'' she says mysteriously.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, ``Ghostbusters'' sealed her fate as a star with
box-office clout, and the contrast of her keen intelligence with
her sense of the absurd earned her ``Working Girl'' and ``Dave.''
</P>
<P>
   When Roman Polanski offered her a challenging role in 1994's
``Death and the Maiden,'' it was her husband, director Jim Simpson,
who convinced her to take it on.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver met Simpson in the summer of 1983 when she was starring
in a production of Harold Pinter's ``Old Times,'' with Dianne Wiest
and Edward Herrmann, at the Williamstown Theater Festival, and
Simpson was directing a smaller production on the non-Equity stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months later, I was giving a big Halloween party,''
she remembers. ``I found Jim's number from the summer contact sheet
and called him up. His machine said, `Leave a number for Dave, Jim,
Mike or Debbie.' I thought, great, is he with Mike, Dave or Debbie?
Turns out, he wasn't with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   They decided to get married three months later and have been
married 15 years. The couple and their 9-year-old daughter live in
New York, and Weaver tries to work near the city as much as
possible, ``A Map of the World'' being a recent exception.
</P>
<P>
   The movie took her to rural Wisconsin, where author Jane
Hamilton lives and sets her novels. It's probably Weaver's most
grueling role to date, though she calls it ``without a doubt, the
most fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver plays Alice Goodwin, who experiences a nightmarish fall
from grace when a friend's daughter drowns while she's looking
after her. Spiraling downward in grief, Goodwin, the school nurse,
doesn't fight back when a student subsequently accuses her of
sexual abuse. She eventually winds up in jail, forced to sell her
dairy farm to pay legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Director Scott Elliott says he cast Weaver against type.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had loved Sigourney in `The Ice Storm,''' he says, ``and we
usually see her play tall and strong, because that's what she is.
But I suspected she had the fragility I wanted for Alice _ and I
knew she did once I saw her with her daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   To research the role, Weaver not only visited dairy farms, where
she learned to milk goats, but she also stopped by the local jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them to book me,'' she says. ``Surprisingly, they took
me very seriously, even though they hadn't read the novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hamilton remembers accompanying Weaver to the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I expected at the jail was to see my character
realized, right there, in the cell block,'' Hamilton says, ``but
Sigourney became Alice before my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``A Map of the World'' sounds heavy, ``Galaxy Quest'' is
light as air. Weaver says she made it so her daughter could finally
watch one of Mom's movies. She plays aging sex-symbol actress Gwen
DeMarco, shaking her cat-suited booty along with a big fake mane of
blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Director Dean Parisot was incredibly pleased, but very
surprised, by her extreme transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking her, `Are you sure that wig isn't on too
tight?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great for me, coward that I am, to finally play someone
who's afraid all the time,'' Weaver says. ``To play the babe and to
look like such a babe is really enjoyable. It's such a
traditionally womanly image _ nothing intimidating. It was nice to
be un-angular.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the way,'' she adds, no doubt referring to those
juttingly angular women she played in ``The Ice Storm,'' ``The Year
of Living Dangerously,'' ``Copycat'' and ``Jeffrey,'' ``those
angular women still care about the way they look.'' &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   How far is too far?
</P>
<P>
   John Galliano is finding out. The furor over the couture
collection he showed recently for Christian Dior, inspired, he
said, by the ``wet world'' of tramps and hobos he discovered while
jogging around the Seine, just won't go away. In terms of
controversy, it's the biggest thing to hit fashion since Heroin
Chic.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 23, two of The New York Times' most high-profile
columnists have addressed the issue _ Maureen Dowd, who compared
the collection to Rudolph Giuliani's street-sweep of the homeless,
and Cathy Horyn, in a piece on the power of spin.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy took yet another turn on Jan. 27, when riot
police were called in to fend off a small but vocal group of
homeless activists in front of the Dior headquarters and store on
the Avenue Montaigne.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Le Figaro, Dior chairman Bernard Arnault went
on the record about the whole affair for the first time. He
defended the collection vigorously, calling it ``the strongest
presentation since John started at Dior.'
</P>
<P>
   Galliano, he said, ``had transcended his status as a couturier,
and had shown that he was a veritable artist. A gust of genius blew
through the room.''
</P>
<P>
   However, by the end of the day, Galliano himself seemed to
retreat from his defiant stance, when he said that his critics are
``bourgeois people, condescending and smug.'' At the time, Galliano
refused to apologize for anything about the collection, saying, ``I
really, really saw nothing wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, Dior issued a more conciliatory statement, in which
Galliano said, ``I never wanted to make a spectacle of misery, nor
did I intend to do a sociological collection that would be a
documentary of poverty in the street. In no way did I mean it to be
offensive to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This collection is but the latest of many examples in which a
designer or the industry at large has been accused of tossing out
responsibility in pursuit of hype.
</P>
<P>
   Did Galliano go too far? Many would say no, since one of the
roles of fashion is to provoke and unsettle.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man coming to Paris with his first collection, Yohji
Yamamoto recalled, his point was ``to break the rules, to question
traditional beauty,'' and certainly, there has always been a
faction, usually those on the avant-garde edge, which has continued
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, with media such a focus and so all-pervasive, the
ante has been increased. And anyone who goes the shock route who
claims a lack of interest in potential publicity can be accused of
being either delusional or disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, some high-profile brouhahas have broken
out on the fashion front. Everybody's all-time favorite, Heroin
Chic, wound up with President Clinton chastising the fashion
industry on the front page of The New York Times. Remember Calvin
Klein and kiddie porn? Now there's Benetton and its merry band of
murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers have caused stirs with their runway themes _
Alexander's McQueen with his ``Highland Rape,'' for example, or
Jean Paul Gaultier and his Hasidic collection.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Rei Kawakubo's fall '95 men's collection for
Comme des Garcons, presented on the 50th anniversary of the
liberation of Auschwitz, for which she was accused _ but denied _
dressing gaunt-looking models to resemble concentration-camp
prisoners. And the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The king of controversy himself, Calvin, thinks that the market
should decide the boundaries of taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make a comparison between John Galliano and Rudolph Giulani
is just nonsense,'' Klein said, referring to Dowd's column. ``One
is a very creative, artistic fashion designer, and the other, a
public servant. Creative people find inspiration in everything
around them, and to have the courage to explore that and show it to
the world _ I applaud John. He's not making a political statement.
He's looking at an unfortunate situation in the world as an artist
and is inspired by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing wrong with someone putting his work out there
for the world to see,'' Klein continued. ``People have the freedom
to express themselves. And this is a business that targets a
market. If John goes in a direction that no one understands, the
company might suffer the consequences in terms of business,
although I would add that all this coverage is probably creating
business for Dior.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Galliano's LVMH compatriot Marc Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand them,'' Jacobs said of the collection's
critics. ``I'm not one for the story-telling school of fashion.
Inspiration doesn't make a good piece of clothing. I didn't see the
show, but it sounds very `Let them eat cake' to me, and they cut
off (Marie Antoinette's) head over that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion isn't art. I'm pretty open-minded; I don't take
offense easily. But I think that, whenever you touch on someone's
misfortune or seem to be caricaturing their culture, you're likely
to be misconstrued. Gaultier made the Hasidic Jews furious. Comme

   ``Inspiration is a personal thing; you can find it anywhere. The

parading on other people's plight.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, underscoring the whole debate is that the venue was
couture, creating the juxtaposition of unimaginable wealth against
unimaginable poverty. That's a tough one to get past, no matter how
much respect one has for Galliano's brilliance. And there's no
question, ``let them eat cake'' is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt John was honoring the homeless,'' said Mouna Ayoub,
currently couture's most editorial client. Ayoub purchased five of
the collection's looks for her personal wardrobe, and bought one _
the ``burnt coat'' made to look, Galliano said, as if the wearer
had ``gotten too near a fire'' _ for her couture collection. She
will house it in a 12-room Paris apartment she has converted into a
veritable museum, just for her own collection of haute couture.
</P>
<P>
   ``By bringing the homeless on the podium, it's an homage. He
brought them on the podium, and we cannot forget them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayoub then turned to Galliano's critics. ``If they took one
close look at these dresses, everyone would understand. They didn't
see these dresses close up like I did. The workmanship is
fantastic. Chapeaux off to the seamstresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not everyone would agree with Ayoub.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Cohen, president and ceo of the Partnership for the
Homeless in New York, believes that an olive branch can be wielded
more effectively than a sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to extend an invitation to John Galliano,'' he said.
``Let's use this as an opportunity to raise some funds, support our
programs, work with the Partnership, putting an end to all this
uproar. Use this as an opportunity to raise public awareness about
how homelessness devastates lives the lives of men, women and
children on the streets, especially now in this bitter cold. I'd
love to work with John Galliano and put together an event.'' &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   How far is too far?
</P>
<P>
   John Galliano is finding out. The furor over the couture
collection he showed recently for Christian Dior, inspired, he
said, by the ``wet world'' of tramps and hobos he discovered while
jogging around the Seine, just won't go away. In terms of
controversy, it's the biggest thing to hit fashion since Heroin
Chic.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 23, two of The New York Times' most high-profile
columnists have addressed the issue _ Maureen Dowd, who compared
the collection to Rudolph Giuliani's street-sweep of the homeless,
and Cathy Horyn, in a piece on the power of spin.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy took yet another turn on Jan. 27, when riot
police were called in to fend off a small but vocal group of
homeless activists in front of the Dior headquarters and store on
the Avenue Montaigne.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Le Figaro, Dior chairman Bernard Arnault went
on the record about the whole affair for the first time. He
defended the collection vigorously, calling it ``the strongest
presentation since John started at Dior.'
</P>
<P>
   Galliano, he said, ``had transcended his status as a couturier,
and had shown that he was a veritable artist. A gust of genius blew
through the room.''
</P>
<P>
   However, by the end of the day, Galliano himself seemed to
retreat from his defiant stance, when he said that his critics are
``bourgeois people, condescending and smug.'' At the time, Galliano
refused to apologize for anything about the collection, saying, ``I
really, really saw nothing wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, Dior issued a more conciliatory statement, in which
Galliano said, ``I never wanted to make a spectacle of misery, nor
did I intend to do a sociological collection that would be a
documentary of poverty in the street. In no way did I mean it to be
offensive to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This collection is but the latest of many examples in which a
designer or the industry at large has been accused of tossing out
responsibility in pursuit of hype.
</P>
<P>
   Did Galliano go too far? Many would say no, since one of the
roles of fashion is to provoke and unsettle.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man coming to Paris with his first collection, Yohji
Yamamoto recalled, his point was ``to break the rules, to question
traditional beauty,'' and certainly, there has always been a
faction, usually those on the avant-garde edge, which has continued
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, with media such a focus and so all-pervasive, the
ante has been increased. And anyone who goes the shock route who
claims a lack of interest in potential publicity can be accused of
being either delusional or disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, some high-profile brouhahas have broken
out on the fashion front. Everybody's all-time favorite, Heroin
Chic, wound up with President Clinton chastising the fashion
industry on the front page of The New York Times. Remember Calvin
Klein and kiddie porn? Now there's Benetton and its merry band of
murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers have caused stirs with their runway themes _
Alexander's McQueen with his ``Highland Rape,'' for example, or
Jean Paul Gaultier and his Hasidic collection.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Rei Kawakubo's fall '95 men's collection for
Comme des Garcons, presented on the 50th anniversary of the
liberation of Auschwitz, for which she was accused _ but denied _
dressing gaunt-looking models to resemble concentration-camp
prisoners. And the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The king of controversy himself, Calvin, thinks that the market
should decide the boundaries of taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make a comparison between John Galliano and Rudolph Giulani
is just nonsense,'' Klein said, referring to Dowd's column. ``One
is a very creative, artistic fashion designer, and the other, a
public servant. Creative people find inspiration in everything
around them, and to have the courage to explore that and show it to
the world _ I applaud John. He's not making a political statement.
He's looking at an unfortunate situation in the world as an artist
and is inspired by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing wrong with someone putting his work out there
for the world to see,'' Klein continued. ``People have the freedom
to express themselves. And this is a business that targets a
market. If John goes in a direction that no one understands, the
company might suffer the consequences in terms of business,
although I would add that all this coverage is probably creating
business for Dior.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Galliano's LVMH compatriot Marc Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand them,'' Jacobs said of the collection's
critics. ``I'm not one for the story-telling school of fashion.
Inspiration doesn't make a good piece of clothing. I didn't see the
show, but it sounds very `Let them eat cake' to me, and they cut
off (Marie Antoinette's) head over that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion isn't art. I'm pretty open-minded; I don't take
offense easily. But I think that, whenever you touch on someone's
misfortune or seem to be caricaturing their culture, you're likely
to be misconstrued. Gaultier made the Hasidic Jews furious. Comme

 &HT;    Where ends justify means, purity is as simple as ordering it
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Sounds like in the High Plains town of Lockney,
Texas, they're making a bad sequel to a good movie.
</P>
<P>
   The good movie is ``Pleasantville,'' where the rule is black and
white and Technicolor is a crisis. In the sequel ``Lockneyville,''
life is even more clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the town fathers want, they order.
</P>
<P>
   Lockney is in the news because it requires drug tests of every
student starting at grade 6 _ with ``parental consent,'' of course.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's a twist to ``parental consent.'' When the parents
don't consent, the student effectively is presumed guilty, put on
in-school suspension, forced to have drug-abuse counseling and to
have monthly drug tests for a year. But thanks for asking.
</P>
<P>
   Which gives us a hero to our story. He's sixth-grader Brady
Tannahill. He refuses to take a drug test out of principle. His
parents back him. Rather than have their son become the villain,
they seem anxious to put the Lockney ISD policy on trial.
</P>
<P>
   This is a character we can root for.
</P>
<P>
   Drug tests may be reasonable tools when actual consent is
involved and the test-taker enters into an arrangement knowingly.
That person has the choice to say, ``No thanks. I'll take my bodily
fluids elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But children, unless homeschooled, are required to be in school.
Shy of being forced out of the school system, the children and
families of Lockney ISD have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, brethren, the civic intent is pure: keeping Lockney children
drug-free. But someone must challenge the means.
</P>
<P>
   You go, Brady. If Lockney is so serious about being drug-free,
it should have roadside Dixie Cup drills. For every citizen. You,
too, Granny. Zip down or zip up.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they'll say, 12-year-olds are different. Brady's a captive
audience. He has no privacy. He's no person with rights. He's a
bladder with legs.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of possibilities to this ends-justify-means
mischief. I'm wondering if the town fathers of Lockney just aren't
using their imagination. Maybe it's prohibited. Or maybe they're
still thinking.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, undoubtedly a large number of students in Lockney
are on the Internet. Just imagine the filth at their fingertips.
Why hasn't the school district required that all homes have a
district-approved filter? Maybe it will.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine what TV shows those children are watching _ stuff
with allusions to sex, violence and Pokemon. The school district
surely should monitor this, or at least ban cable from each home.
Maybe it will. Families that refuse to go along would be presumed
to be watching smut and be required to have ministerial counseling,
or leave the district.
</P>
<P>
   What about stuff that might arrive in the mail _ like girlie
magazines and WWF paraphernalia? The district needs to protect the
children. It should have every home's mail funneled through the
administration office to glean, to make sure all's clean.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, seizing on one of the pop quick-fixes of the day,
Lockney might have the children wearing student uniforms, not the
ones that allow a slim range of colors, collars or fabrics, but one
fashion for all, the orange jump suit, to better identify all.
</P>
<P>
   And the truth is, that like those roadside urine tests, what's
good for children has got to be good for adults. In
``Lockneyville'' oppressive means don't matter, only the ends.
</P>
<P>
   So expect someone to be before the town fathers and urge that
all adults (and pre-schoolers) be required to wear those orange
jump suits, too, except for authorized law officers.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pleasantville,'' color is the symbol of subversion. In
``Lockneyville'' the color orange is the symbol of one town coming
together, all for one, one for all, and in step with the aid of
matching leg irons.

each a pivotal turn in the making of the modern world. It is a
large claim to make, and not one that Wright quite substantiates.
If anything, she undermines it by her vivid portrayal of a proud

   EYMAN-COLUMN _ The tears began welling up in my eyes on the
first page of Eugene O'Neill's ``The Last Will and Testament of an
Extremely Distinguished Dog'' (Holt, $15). I am sentimental about
animals, and so, it seems, was O'Neill, otherwise distinguished by
being a truly great playwright and one of the meanest SOB's in the
writing fraternity. It begins: ``I, Silverdene Emblem O'Neill
(familiarly known to my family, friends and acquaintances as
Blemie) because the burden of my years and infirmities is heavy
upon me, and I realize the end of my life is near, do hereby bury
my last will and testament in the mind of my Master. He will not
know it is there until after I am dead. Then, remembering me in his
loneliness, he will suddenly know of this testament, and I will ask
him then to inscribe it as a memorial to me.'' (Eyman, Palm Beach

   BOOK-VALENTINES _ BETHESDA, Md. _ It's a winter morning and a
foot of snow covers the back yard where Cokie Boggs and Steve
Roberts were married on a warm September evening in 1966. Cokie and
Steve Roberts still live in that house. Their daughter, Rebecca,
was married in the back yard. In the springs and summers, Steve
tends the vegetable garden first tilled by his father-in-law nearly
half a century ago. For years, Steve's parents timed their drives
from Florida to New Jersey to coincide with the Seders that their
Catholic daughter-in-law prepared for Passover in this house. Such
are the seasons of a marriage. ``So far, we've lived for better,
not worse; richer, not poorer; in health, not sickness,'' concludes
Cokie. ``Still, after 33 years, we can't anticipate what will
happen from this day forward.'' ``From This Day Forward,'' a phrase
from traditional wedding vows, just so happens to be the title of a
new book by the journalist couple. Fittingly, publisher William
Morrow has set a publication date of Valentine's Day for the
351-page volume. (Dart, Cox News Service). 38. WITH PHOTOS.

   BOOKS-BUSH _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Rosemary, an obese ex-con with an

Rosemary realizes that this is true. ``If it were, I'd be a 1973

author says a typical millionaire is 54, married with three
children, wa an average student, and gets his shoes resoled. Other
notes: Liza Nelson's new novel, ``Playing Botticelli,'' was
inspired by a wanted poster that the Atlanta writer saw in a
neighborhood post office. The fugitive was a stranger, but he
reminded her of all the radical activists she had known in college.

that way in a new book, ``The Millionaire Mind.'' The Atlanta
author says a typical millionaire is 54, married with three
children, wa an average student, and gets his shoes resoled. Other
notes: Liza Nelson's new novel, ``Playing Botticelli,'' was
inspired by a wanted poster that the Atlanta writer saw in a
neighborhood post office. The fugitive was a stranger, but he
reminded her of all the radical activists she had known in college.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: When is a Kennedy not a Kennedy?
 &HT;    (For release Feb. 13, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Headlines in the Sacramento Bee and London Independent said a
``Kennedy cousin'' was charged with murder. USA Today's headline
said the charged Kennedy was a nephew. The Montreal Gazette's
headline was more generic; he's identified as a Kennedy relative.
And the Vancouver Sun's headline called accused murderer Michael
Skakel a ``Kennedy clan member.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's it going to be? Cousin? Nephew? Relative? Cabalist?
</P>
<P>
   Well, technically, there is a link between Skakel and the family
that grew out of the seed of Joe and Rose Kennedy. But not a drop
of blood is intermingled in the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel is absolutely no relation to John Kennedy, to Ted Kennedy
or to any Kennedy other than Ethel Skakel Kennedy, Bobby's widow.
That's the link: Michael Skakel's father, industrialist Rushton
Skakel, was Ethel Skakel's brother. That makes him Ethel's nephew.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, end of connection.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the headlines drawing the Kennedy family through more
mud?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's easy to do. The Kennedy family has been caught in
so much notoriety over the years, it becomes easy (and provocative)
to link them to anything remotely resembling another family
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys, on their own, have enough problems _ from a
lecherous president who was assassinated, to the Chappaquiddick
coverup, to the murder of Bobby, to a rape trial; it never seems to
end.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, here is Michael Skakel, recently arrested for a 1975
murder. Because there was the thinnest of tethers to the Kennedy
clan _ relationship to a woman who married into the family _ Skakel
abruptly is portrayed as a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany (N.Y.) Times-Union was among those that headlined its
story more accurately: ``Kennedy widow's nephew to face murder
charge.'' To be more precise, however (and shorter), it should have
read, ``RFK widow's nephew to face murder charge.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not an unconscious supporter of everything Kennedy. My
idealism about that family faded with news of JFK's sexual
escapades, and when Teddy swam away from Mary Jo Kopechne at
Chappaquiddick.
</P>
<P>
   But a Skakel is not a Kennedy. Only by a stretch of our
imagination can it be so construed. Yet, there are all those
headlines, topping juicy stories about how yet another member of
the Kennedy clan is in trouble. The press just won't let go because
the Kennedy name always is grist for provocative stories.
</P>
<P>
   I'm certain, because of his relationship to Aunt Ethel, that
Michael Skakel and others of the Skakel family have trafficked with
the Kennedys. Both families, from New England, have great wealth.
Lord knows how many glasses of punch they may have had together at
social events.
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder just how much play the stories about the Skakel
arrest would have received were it not for that
thin-as-microfilament link to the Kennedy family?

 &HT;    WINDOWS ON THE UNIVERSE: ASTRONOMY GAINS 'STAGGERING' INSIGHTS
 &HT;    With UNIVERSE-TOOLS. For release Sunday, Feb. 13.
 &HT;    Eds: This is the first part of an occasional series on
astronomical discoveries.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard Mushotzky stared at his computer screen
with a mixture of excitement and scientific caution.
</P>
<P>
   Although he could not be sure _ and now, several weeks later, is
still not absolutely certain _ he believed the image on the screen
was likely that of an enormous black hole at the far edge of the
universe, from a time so long ago that light may not have begun to
shine.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence suggested the ancient body was sucking in gas at
nearly the speed of light from a surrounding cloud, a sort of dark
``galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the hole's gravity likely would have drawn the gas cloud
into billions of dense clumps, which would have grown hot and
become stars, bursting into light from hydrogen-fueled
thermonuclear reactions. If so, that light has not yet reached
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mushotzky's scientific excitement over a thing that may be older
and farther away than anything previously seen through human eyes
was typical of moments astronomers are now experiencing more often.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries of planets looping along elliptical paths around
other ``suns;'' strange, naked black holes that drift alone and
invisible through interstellar space, and new insights into the
behavior of quasars and dark matter and mysterious pulses of gamma
radiation are lighting up the science like the primordial stars
that will someday appear from Mushotzky's dark galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful new telescopes, both ground-based and in Earth orbit,
have opened new windows on the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Even while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
studies the mishaps that led to the recent loss of two Mars probes,
astronomers are happily talking about a ``golden age'' for their
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a revolution,'' said astronomer William Cochran of the
University of Texas at Austin. ``We have a lot of really valuable
new data that has allowed us to rethink a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Mushotzky, an astronomer at the NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md., agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have learned in the past several years, along with
what we expect to learn in the next few years, is staggering,'' he
said last week. ``Exciting is just not a strong enough word to
express it.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientific revolution is reflected by an explosion in
amateur astronomy. Popular astronomy magazines are booming, fed
largely by page after page of advertisements for amateur telescopes
that range in price from under $100 to $8,000 and more.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Meade Instruments Corp., founded in 1972 as a
one-person mail order operation on the kitchen table of a
single-room apartment, reported sales of $76 million last year, a
threefold increase over 1995 figures.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Atlanta last month of the American Astronomical
Society, scientists presented more than 1,600 research papers, the
output of the final year of the century in which modern astronomy
was born.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries of ``extrasolar'' planets are an example of the
rapid accumulation of knowledge. Until 1995, the only known planets
were Earth and its eight sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we put together an understanding of our solar system, it
was obvious that planet formation is just a natural result of star
formation,'' said Cochran. ``The sun is a very common star, so it
stood to reason that all the others out there like it should have
had the same opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Through exquisite measurements of a star's light, astronomers
can now detect minute ``jerky'' motions induced by the gravitation
pull of planets the size of the Earth's giant neighbor, Jupiter, or
larger. They can plot the orbits and even measure the size of the
planets.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, they had announced discoveries of 29
planets in orbits around stars and another four in orbit around
different bodies called pulsars.
</P>
<P>
   More planet announcements are coming soon, Cochran said.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers like Geoff Marcy of the University of California at
Berkeley and Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution in Washington
are now talking about techniques for finding Earth-size planets and
learning whether our solar system is a quirk or a common type of
planetary system.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley and Butler predicted confidently in a recent magazine
article that the time is ``not far off when we can replace the
artists' conceptions of extrasolar planets with photographs of the
planets themselves and gaze upon landscapes as bizarre and
unexpected as those of our nine planets.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Astronomical Society meeting in Atlanta, Mushotzky
described the apparent discovery of the objects that existed before
stars began lighting up. The observation was possible because of a
new orbiting instrument, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which NASA
placed in orbit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra ``sees'' objects by the X-rays they emit, rather than
light. Because X-rays do not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, they
can be detected only by an orbiting instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have waited for Chandra since the early days of the
U.S. space program, when a small X-ray telescope detected a uniform
glow of X-rays throughout the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The 1962 satellite was not powerful enough to see through the
glow and identify its sources.
</P>
<P>
   But aiming Chandra at a small patch of space _ so small that it
would be covered by a nickel held at arm's length _ Mushotzky and
collaborating astronomers at the University of Maryland and the
University of Hawaii transformed the X-ray glow into numerous
individual objects.
</P>
<P>
   After the objects were identified by Chandra, astronomers at the
new Keck telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii looked at the same
spots for visible objects.
</P>
<P>
   Some were easily visible, probably early galaxies that
surrounded supermassive black holes, the astronomers said in
Atlanta. Others were faint, their light possibly dimmed passing
through billions of light years of dust and gas.
</P>
<P>
   And some were invisible, the apparent pre-light black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the papers presented in Atlanta was a study by Donald
Walter, an astronomer at South Carolina State University in
Orangeburg, of a ``bubble nebula'' that surrounds a large star
7,000 light years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Walter presented dramatic photographs from NASA's 10-year-old
Hubble Space Telescope of the swelling bubble of stellar wind and
radiation as it moves like a snowplow through the cosmos, pushing
along the gas and dust in its path.
</P>
<P>
   The star is destined to explode one day in a supernova, Walter
said. His research is aimed at better understanding the events
leading up to the brilliant explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Walter and NASA research astronomer and author Stephen Maran
agree that the revolution is being driven primarily by technology,
the kind represented by Hubble, Chandra, the Keck telescope and
other instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 13,000 professional astronomers in the world,''
Maran said. ``They can't all be Einsteins or Newtons, but a lot of
them can be Galileos, in a sense. Like him, they can see things and
measure things that couldn't be seen before.''

 &HT;    TECHNICAL ADVANCES CLARIFY MAN'S VIEW OF THE COSMOS
 &HT;    With UNIVERSE. For release Sunday, Feb. 13.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of several technological breakthroughs that helped
revolutionize modern astronomy, two events in the 1990s stand out.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the launching of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in
April 1990. Initially nearsighted because of a design error, the
Hubble was repaired when a pair of space shuttle astronauts
installed a corrective lens.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the city bus-sized telescope has radioed to Earth
more than 259,000 images, ranging from the surface of the moon to
deep space objects.
</P>
<P>
   The images astonished astronomers with their clarity and
revealed heavenly details that have rewritten many astronomical
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   The second innovation was a spin-off of former President
Reagan's ``Star Wars'' dream, the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI).
</P>
<P>
   In order to guide the program's huge ground-based lasers, which
SDI planners hoped would one day zap enemy missiles out of the sky,
Air Force scientists set out to find a way to overcome the
distortions the atmosphere imposes on ground-based observations of
space.
</P>
<P>
   These distortions, caused by the fact that the air is not a
uniform fluid but contains areas of varying density, had plagued
astronomers for centuries. In fact, the problem was a prime
justification for launching the Hubble.
</P>
<P>
   One astronomer said studying a ``twinkling'' star through
Earth's atmosphere was like looking at something ``through a
fishbowl that someone is stirring.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution was a laser beam aimed at the stratosphere, where
it reflected off a layer of sodium molecules and came back to
Earth. The distortion imposed on the reflected beam could be
measured and compensated for.
</P>
<P>
   The technique was declassified by the Air Force in 1991 and made
public the following day by Dayton, Ohio, native Robert Fugate at a
meeting of the American Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   It is now used to control precise adjustments that can be made
to thin, flexible telescope mirrors in order to correct for
atmospheric distortion. It made possible a new generation of
ground-based telescopes that rival the Hubble in the precision of
their imagery.

<P>
   I know it's wrong. I'm not supposed to get my thrills this way.
Still, the recent spate of hacker attacks on major American
corporate Web sites brings a smile to my face _ and to the faces of
almost everyone I speak to about it.
</P>
<P>
   Why should we get so much pleasure from what amounts to an
intentional and vicious campaign of cyber-terrorism?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's refreshing, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong: However much I'd like to, I can't condone
cyber-terrorism. In the long run, we all pay for it. But the mere
fact that our initial response is not fear, but rather perverse
joy, means that on some level we resent the companies that now
dominate our information space.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, a rather simple program has temporarily
paralyzed the most established and profitable Web sites in the
world. The attack program works by asking the target Web site for
more information than it is capable of dispensing. With all its
resources tied up, the Web site is forced to deny service to the
millions of users who want access. The site goes down.
</P>
<P>
   This digital molotov cocktail was distributed widely on hacker
bulletin boards, so the perpetrator could be anyone, or even
different hackers working independently. First, they incapacitated
the most popular Web site in the world, the Yahoo search engine,
which went down for hours as engineers struggled to restore order.
Then, they hit Amazon, CNN, Ebay and Buy.com.
</P>
<P>
   These are not randomly chosen Web sites. The hackers didn't
attack schools, charities or communities. They attacked commerce.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who were enjoying the Internet back in the '80s and
early '90s remember a time when this technology was about
communication. Businesses weren't even allowed on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the interactive mediaspace felt like a cross
between a college campus and the Wild West. It was a level playing
field, where the size of your computer and the contents of your
wallet meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changed the way people thought about media and
power. The Net didn't feel like a particularly ``safe'' place _ but
since when are revolutions safe?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of business to the Internet changed all that.
Corporate behemoths ignored the indigenous Net population as they
colonized our space.
</P>
<P>
   Companies conducting commerce online needed to make the online
environment more secure _ in reality and in appearance. They're
asking for our credit-card information, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The look and feel of the Internet changed as users were
converted into consumers. Buy more, talk less. This is not a
playground, they meant to say; this is business.
</P>

   I know it's wrong. I'm not supposed to get my thrills this way.
Still, the recent spate of hacker attacks on major American
corporate Web sites brings a smile to my face _ and to the faces of
almost everyone I speak to about it.
</P>
<P>
   Why should we get so much pleasure from what amounts to an
intentional and vicious campaign of cyber-terrorism?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's refreshing, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong: However much I'd like to, I can't condone
cyber-terrorism. In the long run, we all pay for it. But the mere
fact that our initial response is not fear, but rather perverse
joy, means that on some level we resent the companies that now
dominate our information space.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, a rather simple program has temporarily
paralyzed the most established and profitable Web sites in the
world. The attack program works by asking the target Web site for
more information than it is capable of dispensing. With all its
resources tied up, the Web site is forced to deny service to the
millions of users who want access. The site goes down.
</P>
<P>
   This digital molotov cocktail was distributed widely on hacker
bulletin boards, so the perpetrator could be anyone, or even
different hackers working independently. First, they incapacitated
the most popular Web site in the world, the Yahoo search engine,
which went down for hours as engineers struggled to restore order.
Then, they hit Amazon, CNN, Ebay and Buy.com.
</P>
<P>
   These are not randomly chosen Web sites. The hackers didn't
attack schools, charities or communities. They attacked commerce.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who were enjoying the Internet back in the '80s and
early '90s remember a time when this technology was about
communication. Businesses weren't even allowed on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the interactive mediaspace felt like a cross
between a college campus and the Wild West. It was a level playing
field, where the size of your computer and the contents of your
wallet meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changed the way people thought about media and
power. The Net didn't feel like a particularly ``safe'' place _ but
since when are revolutions safe?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of business to the Internet changed all that.
Corporate behemoths ignored the indigenous Net population as they
colonized our space.
</P>
<P>
   Companies conducting commerce online needed to make the online
environment more secure _ in reality and in appearance. They're
asking for our credit-card information, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The look and feel of the Internet changed as users were
converted into consumers. Buy more, talk less. This is not a
playground, they meant to say; this is business.

 &HT;    AFTER LEBANON FLARE-UPS, ISRAELIS WONDER WHAT COMES NEXT
 &HT;    Optional trim at 800
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 13 
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEVASERET ZION, Israel _ Stopping in a coffee shop after
exercise class last week, three Israeli friends talked about
whether they had been right to vote for Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for change,'' said Nili Israel, 47, who has a son in
the Israeli army and a daughter who will serve in a few years. She
hoped Barak could bring peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised us a lot of things, but he turned out to be
completely the opposite person of what I thought he was,'' said
Ella Naimi, a 50-year-old professional mediator. She says Barak has
ignored the Israeli economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we are in a fog,'' said Nurit Persitz, a 49-year-old
architect.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday (Eds: Feb. 13) was supposed to be a landmark, when
Israelis and Palestinians would map out a general plan for settling
their final disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the peace process is stalled and bitter. Israeli talks
with Syria also are at a standstill. And worse still for these
mothers in suburban Jerusalem, fighting between Israel and Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas claimed six Israeli lives in the last two
weeks. There were no Hezbollah casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Israel responded with repeated air raids on Lebanese power
stations and Hezbollah camps, wounding about 15 civilians. Barak
found himself visiting Israelis in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting the ``fog'' that Persitz sees will require a return to
the details of peacemaking. American officials, convinced they are
on the verge of stability in the Middle East, will need to be
closely involved, preparing all sides for tough concessions.
</P>
<P>
   When there are crises here, if often means that people are ready
to deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you get down to the real tough issues, there is
always a real crustiness,'' said Kenneth W. Stein, a professor of
Middle Eastern history at Atlanta's Emory University. ``Both sides
still want an agreement, they just don't like the contours.''
</P>
<P>
   Success will hinge largely on Barak, the man who raised hopes in
the first place when he campaigned for election last May. The
former general's image as the can-do commando, the self-proclaimed
``number one soldier,'' is suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really disappointed,'' said Israeli journalist Shimon
Shiffer, who happened into the coffee shop. ``He really has a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's deadline for a peace outline with the Palestinians came
up at Barak's insistence to renegotiate the Wye River Plantation
agreement, which was signed by his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
The deadline would have been a major milestone in the 6-year-old
Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Under Oslo, the Palestinians agreed to drop their armed struggle
against Israel in exchange for control of land in the Gaza Strip
and West Bank, which Israel captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   But, Barak put off the latest land transfers while he conducted
negotiations with Syria. Then, the Palestinians rejected the barren
land he was offering and halted the talks.
</P>
<P>
   By this weekend, Israelis and Palestinians were supposed to
outline solutions to the toughest issues in the process _ who
should control Jerusalem, where will the final borders of Israel
stand, what happens to Palestinian refugees? While no one expected
Sunday's (Feb. 13) deadline to be met, most thought the two sides
would at least be meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Oslo Israelis hoped Barak could lead the country to make a
deal with the Palestinians, but they are not so sure anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stuck in a kind of limbo,'' said Israeli Ron Pundik,
who helped design the Oslo accords. He said Barak does not seem to
know what concessions to make for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that his maximum at this stage would not be
enough to meet their minimum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats will need to reassure Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat that it's worth it to him to return to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is under tremendous pressure internally and cannot make
a deal that is seen as a sellout,'' said University of Pennsylvania
Middle East expert Ian Lustick. ``Arafat wants Barak to share some
of the political costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is in limbo with the Syrians, too. Israeli hopes were
almost euphoric in December when Barak reopened talks with Syria
for the first time in nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians want the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from
them in 1967. Israel wants normal diplomatic relations and
assurances that Syria will not use the Golan plateau to launch
attacks on Israel. Israelis also want peace on their border with
Lebanon, which is in large part controlled by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak predicted when the talks started in December that
agreement could come within months and showered Syrian president
Hafez Assad with praise. But the Syrians walked out on those talks
last month and many Israelis felt Barak's flattery had gone too
far.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immediate problem here is a kind of Catch 22 about the order
in which the topics will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians do not want to offer anything until Israel agrees to a
complete withdrawal from the Golan first. Israelis do not want to
promise the Golan until Syria states what it will give up.
</P>
<P>
   American mediators can serve here to bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they could promise the Syrians that, if they return
to negotiations, America would press Israel to return all the
Golan. They could promise Israel that, in exchange for the Golan,
America would keep an eye on the Syrian military and press Syria to
open full relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, it could all still hinge on Barak's relations with people
in the malls and coffee shops of Israel. He has promised to let
them vote on any peace deals he initials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Referendum results could depend on Barak's credibility, which is
suffering these days with his first political scandal. Police are
investigating his campaign fund-raising after a government
comptroller reported that his party flagrantly violated election
laws.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll last week showed only 45 percent of Israelis
supporting Barak when asked if they would vote for him again over
Netanyahu. That's down from the 56 percent he received in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Stein suggests that Barak turn to core political issues, such as
fulfilling campaign promises to fix Israel's lagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   That appeals to people like architect Persitz. She's willing to
give Barak another chance, but says the scandal has shaken her
faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Netanyahu's party was corrupt, but now we're seeing
the same thing,'' she said. ``We feel like we are a banana
republic. I didn't believe it could happen.''

&HT;     FOR GUYS ONLY: HOW TO MAKE HER HAPPY ON VALENTINE'S DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CELINA OTTAWAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like it or not, guys still have more at stake on Valentine's
Day. Expectations are higher that you will come through with
something. So here's how to do it right.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   FLOWERS
</P>
<P>
   _ In most cases, you can triple your points by sending a woman
flowers at work instead of home. This allows her to not only enjoy
the flowers, but to show them off and make it clear to everyone
that someone remembered her on Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   There are some risks in this strategy. Avoid it if you are in a
tenuous relationship or if there is any chance of embarrassing her
with your display of affection. (In these instances, you will be
docked triple the points, which can put you in the red for a long
time.) Also, avoid if the woman is an intensely private person or
in an uncomfortable situation at work.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are women out there who love carnations, but chances are
you aren't dating one.
</P>
<P>
   _ While we're on the subject of cheap flowers, stay away from
grocery store bouquets.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you can only afford a small bouquet, you can stretch it by
spreading the flowers around the house. Put two or three flowers in
a small vase on the dining room table, then put another three in
the bedroom, another three in the bathroom, etc. This gives the
feeling that you've filled the house with flowers. Light a few
candles in each of the rooms to heighten the effect of a house full
of romance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay attention to her. Some women have strong feelings or
associations with certain kinds of flowers. Roses remind her of
funerals, or the scent of lilies is an aphrodisiac. This tendency
is more likely if she is the gardening or flower-arranging type.
Listen for hints.
</P>
<P>
   _ Include a card with a romantic note from you in it. It doesn't
have to be long or poetic. Straight to the point and honest will do
just fine. (Big-time brownie points here.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATE
</P>
<P>
   The first and most important point to figure out is if she is a
Chocolate Person or not. For some people chocolate is a flavor,
like vanilla or pumpkin or hazelnut, with no special significance.
Do not confuse this type of person with a Chocolate Person.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate People have a deep personal relationship with the
sugary brown stuff. It can make them laugh, cry, sigh with pleasure
and cringe with withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how to maximize brownie points when buying for a
chocolate lover.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first step is to determine tribe membership.
</P>
<P>
   Is she a milk chocolate or dark chocolate person? Does she like
her chocolate with or without nuts? Is white chocolate a treat or
disgusting?
</P>
<P>
   _ Show some respect for her obsession _ avoid drugstores.
Smaller amounts of quality chocolate (eight to 12 pieces) are
better than a huge box of stuff that may have been sitting on a
shelf for weeks. Godiva and Lindt are usually safe bets, although
serious addicts usually have a special favorite. A trip to a local
chocolate maker shows extra thought and effort.
</P>
<P>
   _ Again, attached love notes are good.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   JEWELRY
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry is tough and not for the casual or unobservant giver.
Here are some things to look for.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most women have a strong preference for either gold or silver.
If she's a platinum-or-nothing girl, you either need a great job or
a new girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the relationship is relatively new, stay away from the
hands. Rings are a big deal, and can get complicated fast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lots of guys try the earring route. What they fail to
understand is that earrings, perhaps more than any other piece of
jewelry, are an expression of one's individual personality. Some
things you should look for: Does she wear traditional mall jewelry,
or does she like funkier, more artsy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, women tend to be either big-earring
women or small-earring women. Don't mix them up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consult her mother, sister and/or close friends for advice.
This will help on two fronts. You will likely give a gift more to
her liking. And the fact that you asked everybody will get back to
her, scoring you extra brownie points in the effort category.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   PRESENTATION
</P>
<P>
   Presentation matters _ think major point maximizer. Here are
some places to start. Nice boxes, bows, ribbons, special bags.
Wrapping heightens the effect and more importantly shows you took
the time to make it special (or paid someone else to do it). And,
please, remove the price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Next, try a little surprise. Under a plate, behind her cereal
box, on her pillow. Or if you take the straightforward approach and
hand it to her, pick a special moment. Yes, these things really
count! Put on some nice music, wait till you're both off the phone.
Focus on her.
</P>
<P>
   And love notes make everything sweeter.

   The systematic overuse of antibiotics by doctors, especially in
the United States, has helped breed ``superbugs'' _ bacteria
resistant to even the most potent antibiotics, like vancomycin.
That's why today, the West is paying renewed attention to an
unheralded therapy called ``phages,'' created behind the Iron
Curtain. The reason: antibiotic resistance.

 &HT;    
 By JEFFREY GOLDBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``The thing is,'' says His Majesty Abdullah II, the 38-year-old
king of Jordan and 43rd-generation direct descendant of the prophet
Muhammad, ``is that I've become a bit like Elvis.''
 &HT;    People see him where he ain't, in other words.
 &HT;    ``There are sightings all over the place,'' he says. Since
ascending the Hashemite throne last February, Abdullah has made it
a habit to inspect his kingdom in mufti. ``The bureaucrats are
terrified. It's great.''
 &HT;    Today, Elvis is flying to Zarqa, outside of Amman, in one of the
Royal Squadron Black Hawk helicopters _ like his father, the late
King Hussein, he is his own pilot. Once in Zarqa, he will execute a
quick costume change and then pay surprise visits to the city's
public hospital and to the local offices of the finance ministry.
 &HT;    We land at a paratrooper base outside the city. Prince Ali, the
king's 24-year-old half brother and chief bodyguard, jumps out
first. A second Black Hawk, filled with more bodyguards, lands a
minute later. King Abdullah waves to the paratroopers who watch as
he steps out of the helicopter. When his father was king, Abdullah,
then a general, commanded these men.
 &HT;    We enter the office of the brigade commander, Maj. Gen. Ahmed
Sirhan, who has become only semi-accustomed to the scene now
unfolding.
 &HT;    Before our eyes, the vibrant young king of Jordan transforms
himself _ no point in mincing words here _ into a fat, old,
one-eyed gimp in beat-up New Balance sneakers and a red-checkered
kaffiyeh. The king first reaches into a gym bag and pulls out a
pillow.
 &HT;    ``Excuse me for a minute,'' he says. ``I have to put my padding
on.'' He steps out of a bathroom a moment later with a tire of fake
fat ringing his abdomen.
 &HT;    Out of another bag he takes a plastic-foam head that keeps his
wig properly stretched. He holds up the wig, which has been styled
into a sort of Bedouin Jheri curl. ``Kind of gives me the Qaddafi
look,'' the king says.
 &HT;    Before the wig goes on, though, he pulls out a tray of fake
mustaches and picks one. Then he takes out a beard extension. The
long beard gives him the appearance of a Hamas sheik, which I
mention to him with some trepidation, since he and Hamas are
fighting a cold war at the moment.
 &HT;    ``Wait till you see you me with the wig,'' he says. He pulls the
wig over his short-cropped hair. Before me stands neither a Hamas
sheik nor a Libyan strongman, but Samuel L. Jackson in ``Pulp
Fiction.''
 &HT;    Then come the glasses, thick plastic glasses with one lens
completely blackened out. An aide hands him a cane, and then His
Majesty steps into the sunshine. The soldiers are not sure where to
direct their salutes.
 &HT;    Prince Ali too is in mufti _ fake beard, sunglasses, a kaffiyeh.
Very '70s, I say.
 &HT;    ``Like a terrorist?'' Prince Ali asks, smiling.
 &HT;    This is the plan: The king and Prince Ali will travel by taxi to
the local offices of the finance ministry. I will follow in a
second car with two of the king's aides. A Nissan pickup will carry
the bodyguards.
 &HT;    The king cautions me not to blow his cover by staring at him too
overtly. He suggests, rightly, that a pale-faced American in khakis
will draw more attention in Zarqa than a half-blind Arab, even a
half-blind Arab wearing New Balance sneakers.
 &HT;    A rust-bucket yellow taxi pulls up, and the king of Jordan hops
into the back seat. By the obsessive security standards of Middle
Eastern royalty, he is quite alone.
 &HT;    But Abdullah, like his father before him, is one of a handful of
Middle Eastern leaders who are unafraid of their own people. He has
no particular reason to fear them. One year after ascending the
throne, the king has reached a level of popularity no one in Jordan
could have reasonably expected.
 &HT;    After all, his father was revered the world over as ``the plucky
little king'' who reigned for nearly 47 years and, by the standards
of the region, gave his country a remarkable degree of peace,
stability and modernity. Abdullah, though, was an unknown.
 &HT;    King Hussein named his oldest son crown prince only two weeks
before his death. The next king was supposed to be Crown Prince
Hassan, youngest brother of King Hussein.
 &HT;    Prince Abdullah had a reputation as a bit of a lightweight, a
Prince Hal with a vaguely Falstaffian cast of friends who drove
fast cars and enjoyed the company of women.
 &HT;    A friend of Abdullah's from his Massachusetts prep-school days,
Perry Vella, told me: ``Right at the beginning, Abdullah said, 'You
know, everybody's underestimating me.' But he said: 'I can do this
job. I was born to do this job.' ``
 &HT;    Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who has been paying
close attention, is impressed by the job he's doing. ``I have to
tell you, it's been quite amazing to watch him,'' she says. ``I
hate to sound patronizing about a king, but he has quickly
understood the possibilities of his role.''
 &HT;    The possibilities are endless, and so are the challenges. He
faces longstanding problems on the political front. Thirty years
after the civil war known as Black September (White September to
Jordanian nationalists), Palestinians, who make up 60 percent of
Jordan's population, are still politically disenfranchised, grossly
underrepresented in Parliament, the government and the army.
 &HT;    It will be up to Abdullah _ and his wife, the 29-year-old Queen
Rania, who is of Palestinian descent _ to define who is a
Jordanian.
 &HT;    There is also the matter of Islamic fundamentalists, at home and
abroad, who opposed his father's brand of moderate, outward-looking
Islam and now oppose his. But the king's most pressing challenge _
at least if you accept his list of priorities _ is reviving
Jordan's comatose economy.
 &HT;    ``We're not concerned about threats on our borders,'' he told a
group of American high-tech executives in October. Queen Rania, who
worked for Apple Computer before marrying the king, sat by his side
_ a bold spot for the wife of an Arab potentate _ and whispered
suggestions in his ear.
 &HT;    ``The only problem Jordan has ahead of it is its economy,'' the
king continued. ``We produce thousands of computer graduates, but
we don't have the jobs to give them.''
 &HT;    Then there is the quandary of how to honor his father's legacy
while casting aside his method of governance. King Hussein built
modern Jordan, but modern Jordan isn't modern enough, as the new
king sees it, to survive.
 &HT;    King Hussein, his obvious attributes notwithstanding, played
tribe against tribe, showered cronies with duty-free Mercedeses and
allowed state enterprises to be run like fiefs. The question is
whether King Abdullah can convert his kingdom into a modern
meritocracy.
 &HT;    The king has spent a good deal of time on matters of Middle East
peace. He was instrumental in brokering the talks between Syria and
Israel, Albright says, and he has spoken regularly with President
Clinton on the subject.
 &HT;    And he has repaired his country's strained relations with its
Arab neighbors, visiting every Arab country except Iraq. He is
regularly on the phone with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, one
of his father's traditional rivals.
 &HT;    Abdullah's energetic diplomatic efforts took the Egyptians by
surprise. But to Abdullah, Mubarak, along with Yasir Arafat and the
aging Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad, are yesterday's news. He is
more interested in attracting Steve Case and Bill Gates.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The taxi pulls up to the front gate of the finance offices, and
the king and Prince Ali alight. They blend in with crowds of
obviously frustrated taxpayers, who wait in line for clerks who
aren't there or who, when they are there, do not seem all that
interested in assisting the public.
 &HT;    The king and Prince Ali spend five minutes banging on the closed
door of the land-assessment office, which should have been open at
this hour. Not a soul at the finance ministry even guesses he's
here. At one point, the king, leaning on his cane, stands directly
under his official portrait, the one that graces all government
buildings in Jordan.
 &HT;    He spends an entirely unnoticed hour at the finance ministry
before we move on to the government hospital. There, a fake
television crew, sent by the royal court to stir up the crowd,
interviews angry patients.
 &HT;    The king's idea is simply to stand in a corner and listen to the
complaints elicited by the crew. This works for quite a while.
 &HT;    ``The doctors are OK, but the CAT scan never works!'' one old
man yells over the din.
 &HT;    Then something happens. Maybe it's the large number of very fit,
very serious men in a sick ward, or maybe it's the presence of the
television crew, but a ripple of excitement moves through the
crowd.
 &HT;    ``I think the king of Jordan is here,'' a teen-age boy tells me.
 &HT;    The bodyguards get antsy. The king walks down a hallway,
followed by an increasingly sizable, increasingly confused crowd.
No one knows precisely what to say.
 &HT;    Finally an old woman yells out, ``May God grant you long life!''
and the jig is up.
 &HT;    Elvis leaves the building, and we drive back to base.
 &HT;    Later, in General Sirhan's office, I ask the king if the
bureaucrats of Zarqa are by now aware of their unannounced visitor.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I think so.''
 &HT;    What should they be feeling about now?
 &HT;    ``Panic,'' he says dryly.
 &HT;    How bad was it?
 &HT;    ``You saw how people were being treated,'' he says. ``There was
a complete lack of organization. There was one old man who was
complaining that his form hadn't been dated, and he was getting
sent to one office and then another. They should be sweating,
because a report is going to go to the prime minister and then on
to the relevant ministers about the problems.''
 &HT;    What he saw in Zarqa, he wants me to know, is not unique. ``You
get this in a lot of bureaucracies, all over the place,'' he says.
``I was just watching 'Dharma and Greg' the other day and she was
being sent up and down somewhere _ I think it was a registrar's
office, and she wanted to solve a problem on a street she lived on.
It's not unique.''
 &HT;    ``'Dharma and Greg'?''
 &HT;    ``It's a sitcom,'' he explains.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Utterly casual, disdainful of sycophancy and steeped in American
culture, King Abdullah II is one of the Three Kings of what
optimists might call the new Arab progressivism. Like King Mohammed
VI of Morocco and the emir of Bahrain, Sheik Hamad bin Isa
al-Khalifa, he ascended his country's throne in 1999, promising
economic reform and modernization.
 &HT;    Like growing numbers of young Arab technocrats, he is
Western-educated. And like his peers, he is frustrated that the
West's power brokers haven't yet paid sufficient attention.
 &HT;    ``We're at a very interesting crossroads,'' the king says.
``Madeleine Albright asks, 'What can we expect of the younger
generation in the Middle East?' And I always return by saying:
'Well, the younger generation was all educated in the West. We
understand the West, so all of us are saying, what can we expect
from the West?' ``
 &HT;    In 10 or 15 years _ when Mubarak and Arafat and Assad and
Qaddafi are all gone _ Abdullah may well be the senior Arab
statesman, and already there is talk that he could emerge as a kind
of ``king of the Arabs'' (which was, in fact, the self-proclaimed
title of his great-great-grandfather, Sharif Hussein, the ruler of
Mecca).
 &HT;    When I ask him if he seeks such a role, he chastens me (not
aggressively, because Abdullah is too polite to administer an
enthusiastic chastening), denying any pretensions of pan-Arab
leadership.
 &HT;    He does, however, offer up his hope that Jordan could emerge as
a yardstick other Arabs use to measure their own level of freedom.
 &HT;    ``What I keep asking my friends in the States is, 'The U.S. had
a long-term approach in Europe, a doctrine that worked in Europe,
so how can we do the same thing again for these modern, progressive
countries in the Middle East?''' the king says. ``You have to
strengthen them, invest in them. We can be symbols for someone
sitting in Yemen, who can say: 'I don't want my country to be like
it is now. I want to be like the Jordanian model or the Bahraini
model or the Moroccan model.'''
 &HT;    ``People in Baghdad,'' he notes, could also ``benefit from
seeing this. How did the wall fall? East Germans looked into West
Germany and said, 'Enough is enough.' We're trying to say the same
thing.''
 &HT;    Though he has been king for only 12 months, Washington views him
as an emerging heavyweight. He played a major role in bringing the
Syrians and Israelis together, carrying messages between Assad and
Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, whom he talks to regularly.
 &HT;    ``I told the Americans, 'Look, Assad is sincere, he wants to
have peace and he wants you to know that,''' the king recalled.
``They were very skeptical throughout the summer. They thought that
I was new, maybe I was being naive. But if there's anything I know,
I have at least some understanding of people, and the guy came
across as genuine.''
 &HT;    A short time later, the Syrians and Israelis were sitting face
to face in West Virginia.
 &HT;    In fact, anti-Israel feeling runs deep in Jordan. And somewhat
surprisingly, Queen Rania is turning into a force for normalized
relations with Israel. She is Palestinian _ her father is from
Tulkarm and her mother from Nablus, both in the northern West Bank,
and when she spoke to me about Israel, she was quite withering
about people who are removed from the conflict but who counsel
against peace.
 &HT;    ``I'm close to the issue,'' she says. ``I have a higher
appreciation for peace because I've seen what goes on there. It's
very easy for people outside, Jews and Palestinians, to say they're
against the peace process. They're not the ones who are suffering,
both on the Israeli side and on the Palestinian side.''
 &HT;    As a child, she said, she would visit the West Bank, and she
would also visit Israel proper.
 &HT;    ``I used to visit Netanya, I'd visit all these Israeli cities,
and I'd see how much pressure the Israelis were under because of
security threats, and I'd see how much pressure Palestinians were
under. I just don't have high regard for people who are very far
away but make these judgments without knowing the true dimensions
of the problem.''
 &HT;    King Abdullah has not yet visited Israel, and the Israelis, at
least for public consumption, have expressed annoyance at his
hesitancy. Some Israeli pundits have suggested that Abdullah seems
more interested in developing a relationship with Qaddafi than with
his next-door neighbor Barak.
 &HT;    Asked about this, the king said: ``I had to establish my
relationship with the Arab world first. What I'm doing will benefit
Israel. If Arab countries look at Jordan with respect and Jordan
has peace with Israel _ my friends in Israel have to understand
that what I was doing was in their best interests.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' the king says, mindful that his adversaries, even
his friends, still underestimate him, ``I understand the game.''

 By DAVID RAKOFF  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Eighteen years ago, I worked as a researcher on a psychiatric
ward. One of the central diagnostic indices used to determine the
severity of patients' illnesses was to assess their ``insight.''
Did they understand how and the degree to which they were not well?
They usually did not.
 &HT;    But over the course of their treatment, the cure was frequently
more painful than the affliction, never more so than when patients
first became aware of their past behavior, their dementia-fueled
outbursts against loved ones, staff and themselves.
 &HT;    They now found themselves stranded in a no-man's land between
delusion and clarity _ often sad, occasionally humorous. One
psychiatrist picked up the phone one day to a panicked,
unidentified voice warning of an impending attack at a certain
foreign embassy.
 &HT;    ``Why call me?'' asked the doctor. ``Why not tell the embassy?''
 &HT;    ``Because I'm crazy!'' screamed the caller, briefly stricken
with lucidity.
 &HT;    Now two social psychologists, Justin Kruger of the University of
Illinois and David Dunning of Cornell, have taken these questions
of self-assessment out of the realm of serious mental disorder and
into our daily lives.
 &HT;    Their recent study, ``Unskilled and Unaware of It,'' reveals
that few people have any idea how incompetent they really are.
Subjects were tested, and were also asked to assess their skill
level, in a number of areas. Those who scored lowest on the
objective tests scored highest in their own self-evaluation. The
same held true in reverse: High-scoring subjects underestimated
their skills and how well they compared with others.
 &HT;    At first glance, the Cornell study _ which launched a thousand
knowing conversations around dinner tables and water coolers _
seems merely to prove what anyone who has held a job, picked up a
prescription or indeed ever left his or her apartment has known for
a long time. Not only is ignorance bliss, so to speak, but on some
days the world seems as if it's run by a veritable conspiracy of
perfectly self-assured dunderheads.
 &HT;    But it has not always been thus. The societal uses of
incompetence have changed over time. Sun Tzu wrote in ``The Art of
War,'' ``Even though you are competent, appear to be incompetent.''
Ineptitude, or the appearance thereof, was a tactical feint to lull
your enemies into a false sense of security.
 &HT;    Over 2,300 years, that brilliant strategy has devolved into the
``never let them see you sweat'' mentality of today, by which, with
enough braggadocio and spin, the gravest limitations become
invisible not just to the outside world, but also to yourself.
 &HT;    Consider Donald Trump: apparently unsatisfied by his success in
the world of real estate, he has launched an at least semi-serious
bid for fame in the political arena _ despite his admitted germ
phobia, which would make shaking even a single voter's hand a most
unlikely prospect. (His bid for fame as a sex symbol is best left
unremarked upon.)
 &HT;    In this age of almost willful overconfidence, there may be only
one figure who still adheres to Sun Tzu's philosophy of
concealment, his benign visage merely a guileless facade behind
which his formidable power resides: Pikachu, the sassy, mouselike
star in the Pokemon cartoon series.
 &HT;    But beneath the surface, the Cornell study touches on a truth
far more complex than the notion that it's the idiots who are
always most certain they're right. Indeed, what's most telling is
the very ease with which the study lends itself to carping zingers
about everyone else's stupidity. It speaks directly to our anxious
desire to distance ourselves, as loudly as possible, from
incompetent people _ as if incompetence were subject to that same
you-are-or-you-aren't dichotomy as pregnancy. But of course, you
CAN be a little bit incompetent. All of us are.
 &HT;    My father often says (in a reversal of the adage), ``If
something's worth doing, it's worth doing badly.'' What he means
is, there is no shame in being a beginner. There has never been an
expert who didn't start out as a rank novice. Without initial
blindness to our own ignorance, we'd all be so paralyzed by
self-doubt that we would never be able to start any new venture.
 &HT;    Blithe incompetence has its developmental uses too. In fact,
there is a vast sector of the population that, though marked by an
intrinsically inferior proficiency in any number of arenas, enjoys
an unearned sense of confidence. They are called children, and
their unearned confidence is the very source of their self-worth.
 &HT;    It is also the reason that we protect them; it's precisely why
we don't let them drive cars, practice medicine or carry guns.
(Well, at least we don't let them drive cars or practice medicine.)
The hope, of course, is that with age and experience comes the
hard-won recognition of our limitations.
 &HT;    The Cornell study demonstrates this as well. Subjects initially
overrated their abilities in several areas. But after they received
instruction in those areas _ that is, after their actual competence
rose _ their sense of their competence diminished. Education and
experience showed them how much more there was to learn.
 &HT;    For the noncertifiable, and that includes Dunning and Kruger's
sample, self-deception takes you only so far. But you can't get
anywhere without it.
 &HT;    Think of Wile E. Coyote, the archetype of delusional
persistence, whose single-minded pursuit of the Road Runner, causes
him to rush off cliffs. It is only moments later, when the merry
cartoon character realizes his mistake, that he plummets down the
canyon and lands in a puff of dust. Certainly the rapid acquisition
of insight at 32 feet per second squared is a terrifying thing, and
those loony contusions suffered upon impact will no doubt be
painful.
 &HT;    But how sublime that brief interval before you fall, when it
seems as though you can do anything.

 PLOTS FOR HIRE: Media mercenaries join the war on drugs

   The politicians and propagandists who wage our war on drugs have
really outdone themselves. After bloating the prisons and creating
a vast antidrug industrial complex, they have now bribed our TV
networks to deliver prime-time audiences for indoctrination and
even corralled many newspapers as do-good collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   Not even during the Cold War, with our faith in democracy at
stake, did federal authorities dare so to subsidize and subvert our
media. Back then, Congress explicitly forbade the agencies
promoting anti-communism _ notably the U.S. Information Agency, its
Voice of America and even the CIA _ to aim their propaganda at
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because everyone understood that the government's heavy
hand on the scale of public opinion could distort the weight of any
argument and diminish the public's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   That principle seems in urgent need of reinforcement. For it has
been shown that the bait of a few million dollars was all it took
to get our once fiercely independent broadcasters to submit to
government tutelage and to lure many papers, including The New York
Times, into taking government rewards for what appeared to be
independent public service.
</P>
<P>
   The furtive broadcast scheme was discovered by Daniel Forbes, a
writer for Salon.com, the Internet magazine, and covered with due
concern by a few newspapers. In response, President Clinton and the
television industry made light of their collusion and disclosed the
lesser involvement of their newspaper critics. Just a bit of chummy
cooperation in a good cause, they argued when their two years of
secret dealing became known. (The Times, for its part, explained
that it was rendering only advertising and circulation services,
without affecting its news coverage or content.)
</P>
<P>
   I would like to believe that the broadcasters' collaboration,
though deplorable, had nothing to do with government's recent gifts
to them of spectrum space worth about $70 billion and of
regulations permitting unprecedented concentrations of station
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   And I know the newspapers think they merit praise, not blame,
for disseminating socially useful messages. But it is odd that an
industry usually quick to wrap itself in the First Amendment would
so readily invite the government to read and influence the content
of TV programs and accept government rewards for community service.
</P>
<P>
   This sad bending of principle began in 1997, when Gen. Barry R.
McCaffrey, who heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy at
the White House, was authorized by Congress to spend up to $1
billion over five years to buy television time and newspaper ads to
agitate against drug use. To take the curse off this media subsidy,
Congress insisted on paying only half-price; for every ad
purchased, it wanted another run free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   But when a booming economy made commercial time scarce and
expensive, the networks longed for relief from their commitment to
discounts. So they were told they could meet their obligation by
another route. Rather than matching the government's paid ads one
for one, the broadcasters were invited to plant antidrug messages
in their prime-time dramas and sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   And newspapers were allowed to exchange ad space for things like
teaching guides and pamphlets. (In the case of The Times, pamphlets
were distributed with a sales pitch for school subscriptions).
</P>
<P>
   In belatedly hinting at all these deals at a little-noticed
congressional hearing last fall, McCaffrey never let on that his
office had been turned into a full-blown script-review board. It
decided which TV stories and newspaper programs were ``on message''
and ``on strategy,'' which needed ``guidance'' and improvement and
how much relief from matching ad time or space each message and
activity was worth.
</P>
<P>
   Without apparent hesitation, the networks showered the White
House with scripts and tapes that could qualify for reward,
including even unfinished scripts that could still be altered.
Though their producers and writers were never told of the practice,
almost all major shows were at some time offered for credit _ ``The
Simpsons,'' ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Law and Order,'' ''The Drew Carey
Show,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' ``Cosby,'' ``Home Improvement''
and many more.
</P>
<P>
   A show that portrayed parents confronting a joint-smoking child
in ways the White House deemed effective could redeem the
equivalent of two or three 30-second ads, worth at least $100,000.
An even larger amount might be earned by showing a youth resisting
peer pressure to take up cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   And if a whole story line were judged helpful, well, then shows
like ``E.R.'' or ``The Practice,'' to offer just two examples,
recouped commercial time worth a million dollars or more.
</P>
<P>
   Some network executives accepted the government's ``guidance''
to reshape a script. Some badgered unsuspecting writers to insert
antidrug messages into their plots. One producer, John Tinker,
recalls being urged to rush ahead with an antidrug script of
``Chicago Hope'' even though it had been kicking around
unappreciated for years.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred newspapers and their Web sites also took in
White House ads and matched them in different ways. Besides running
a free ad for every paid one, The Times won credits for its schools
pamphlets, which the White House checked ``simply for accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The best proof that the arrangement was dangerously misguided is
that it was long treated as secret. When the story broke, ABC
announced that it had stopped participating after the government
had asked it to submit all scripts in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this a ``misconception,'' the White House promised to
end all ``previews'' and to settle for post-broadcast ''reviews.''
This may dispel the odor of censorship, but it leaves in place the
payments of government payola for propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   If that represents high-minded media service, why stop with
antidrug scenarios? Why not pay the media for shielding young minds
from sex and gunplay? And one day soon _ depending on which party
controls the government purse _ why not subsidize scripts and ads
that sanction, or discourage, abortion?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton artfully distinguished the antidrug payola from any
effort ``to regulate content.'' And McCaffrey's spokesman said:
``We do not clear scripts. ... Our objective is to provide a better
understanding of the drug issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A much better use of public money would be to re-educate all
concerned in the values of First Amendment independence. Our public
officials obviously need reminding that they belong in front of the
camera, not behind it. And our media executives should have learned
long ago that those who feed at government honeypots inevitably get
stuck.

secret dealing became known. (The Times, for its part, explained
that it was rendering only advertising and circulation services,
without affecting its news coverage or content.)
</P>
<P>
   I would like to believe that the broadcasters' collaboration,
though deplorable, had nothing to do with government's recent gifts
to them of spectrum space worth about $70 billion and of
regulations permitting unprecedented concentrations of station
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   And I know the newspapers think they merit praise, not blame,
for disseminating socially useful messages. But it is odd that an
industry usually quick to wrap itself in the First Amendment would
so readily invite the government to read and influence the content
of TV programs and accept government rewards for community service.
</P>
<P>
   This sad bending of principle began in 1997, when Gen. Barry R.
McCaffrey, who heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy at
the White House, was authorized by Congress to spend up to $1
billion over five years to buy television time and newspaper ads to
agitate against drug use. To take the curse off this media subsidy,
Congress insisted on paying only half-price; for every ad
purchased, it wanted another run free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   But when a booming economy made commercial time scarce and
expensive, the networks longed for relief from their commitment to
discounts. So they were told they could meet their obligation by
another route. Rather than matching the government's paid ads one
for one, the broadcasters were invited to plant antidrug messages
in their prime-time dramas and sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   And newspapers were allowed to exchange ad space for things like
teaching guides and pamphlets. (In the case of The Times, pamphlets
were distributed with a sales pitch for school subscriptions).
</P>
<P>
   In belatedly hinting at all these deals at a little-noticed
congressional hearing last fall, McCaffrey never let on that his
office had been turned into a full-blown script-review board. It
decided which TV stories and newspaper programs were ``on message''
and ``on strategy,'' which needed ``guidance'' and improvement and
how much relief from matching ad time or space each message and
activity was worth.
</P>
<P>
   Without apparent hesitation, the networks showered the White
House with scripts and tapes that could qualify for reward,
including even unfinished scripts that could still be altered.
Though their producers and writers were never told of the practice,
almost all major shows were at some time offered for credit _ ``The
Simpsons,'' ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Law and Order,'' ''The Drew Carey
Show,'' ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' ``Cosby,'' ``Home Improvement''
and many more.
</P>
<P>
   A show that portrayed parents confronting a joint-smoking child
in ways the White House deemed effective could redeem the
equivalent of two or three 30-second ads, worth at least $100,000.
An even larger amount might be earned by showing a youth resisting
peer pressure to take up cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   And if a whole story line were judged helpful, well, then shows
like ``E.R.'' or ``The Practice,'' to offer just two examples,
recouped commercial time worth a million dollars or more.
</P>
<P>
   Some network executives accepted the government's ``guidance''
to reshape a script. Some badgered unsuspecting writers to insert
antidrug messages into their plots. One producer, John Tinker,
recalls being urged to rush ahead with an antidrug script of
``Chicago Hope'' even though it had been kicking around
unappreciated for years.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred newspapers and their Web sites also took in
White House ads and matched them in different ways. Besides running
a free ad for every paid one, The Times won credits for its schools
pamphlets, which the White House checked ``simply for accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The best proof that the arrangement was dangerously misguided is
that it was long treated as secret. When the story broke, ABC
announced that it had stopped participating after the government
had asked it to submit all scripts in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this a ``misconception,'' the White House promised to
end all ``previews'' and to settle for post-broadcast ''reviews.''
This may dispel the odor of censorship, but it leaves in place the
payments of government payola for propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   If that represents high-minded media service, why stop with
antidrug scenarios? Why not pay the media for shielding young minds
from sex and gunplay? And one day soon _ depending on which party
controls the government purse _ why not subsidize scripts and ads
that sanction, or discourage, abortion?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton artfully distinguished the antidrug payola from any
effort ``to regulate content.'' And McCaffrey's spokesman said:
``We do not clear scripts. ... Our objective is to provide a better
understanding of the drug issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A much better use of public money would be to re-educate all
concerned in the values of First Amendment independence. Our public
officials obviously need reminding that they belong in front of the
camera, not behind it. And our media executives should have learned
long ago that those who feed at government honeypots inevitably get
stuck.

 By LAWRENCE OSBORNE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In a barely heated ward for newborns on the top floor of the
Georgian Republic Children's Hospital, Tamila Gogitidze carefully
opens a glass ampul filled with amber liquid.
 &HT;    The hospital, in the Degomi suburb of Georgia's decaying capital
city, Tbilisi, is a spartan affair.
 &HT;    Its radiators are ramshackle, the electricity intermittent and
the raw concrete heavy on the eyes. A few American posters of
babies cavorting in cabbages seem direly out of place.
 &HT;    The liquid trapped inside the ampul, meanwhile, can be
identified from a box on the floor. Its label is Latin:
``Bacteriophagum Intestinalis Fluidum.''
 &HT;    Gogitidze, a nurse on the intensive care unit for newborns,
cracks open the ampul, pours the liquid onto a teaspoon and
prepares to administer it to one of her babies, a 3-month-old boy
abandoned at the hospital a few days before by his impoverished
family. He is screaming lustily.
 &HT;    ``Look,'' Gogitidze says, holding up a tiny wrist. ``The parents
made a kind of crude tattoo so that they can identify him later on.
But for now, we must focus on his intestinal infection.''
 &HT;    The fluidum is tipped like any cough syrup into the boy's
blubbering mouth. His face contorts into a horrible wince; I look
apprehensive.
 &HT;    But Dr. Tamar Gotua, head of the intensive care unit, takes my
arm and says: ``We use them with almost all our children. Don't
look so worried!''
 &HT;    It's hard not to feel worried in Georgia. After years of bloody
civil war following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the republic
is in free fall. Electricity runs for only part of the day.
Blackouts are a daily, if not hourly, occurrence.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, in this dilapidated neonatal ward a possibly
revolutionary medicine, one essentially unknown in the West, is
being casually administered on a simple teaspoon: bacteriophages,
or microscopic viruses that actually ``eat'' bacteria.
 &HT;    Downstairs in the same hospital, I talk with Dr. Irakli
Pavlenishvili, head of pediatrics, in an office so cold that our
breath mists. The doctor offers me some Greek brandy and warms his
hands by a portable electric heater. We chain-smoke furiously.
 &HT;    ``We've been using phages for years,'' he says briskly, looking
up nervously at the flickering lights. ``There are no major side
effects. They're a living, natural force, not a toxic chemical. I
wish our electricity were as reliable!''
 &HT;    Today, the West is paying renewed attention to this unheralded
therapy created behind the Iron Curtain. The reason: antibiotic
resistance.
 &HT;    Although drugs like penicillin have held killer bacteria at bay
for half a century, the bugs keep genetically adapting to them,
evolving into tougher, smarter variants of ancient adversaries. The
systematic overuse of antibiotics by doctors, especially in the
United States, has helped breed ``superbugs'' _ bacteria resistant
to even the most potent antibiotics, like vancomycin.
 &HT;    Last year The New England Journal of Medicine published an
alarming editorial about superbugs. ``The outlook is rather grim,''
it wrote. ``The adaptive potential of the microbial world is such
that for each new antibiotic that is introduced, several escape
mechanisms are soon devised.''
 &HT;    Alexander Tomasz, a leading microbiologist at Rockefeller
University, agrees: ``The miracle days of antibiotics are over. We
simply didn't think enough about the evolutionary consequences of
drug use.'' With leading medical researchers in the West looking
anxiously for antibiotic alternatives, bacteriophage therapy is
suddenly looking ``very promising,'' as Tomasz puts it.
 &HT;    ``I'm convinced that bacteriophages will work,'' says Carl
Merril, chief of the biochemical genetics laboratory at the
National Institutes of Health. ``But there's the psychological
obstacle of a new treatment coming from the former Soviet Union.
It's unusual, to say the least.''
 &HT;    They may sound exotic, but bacteriophages are in fact among the
most common organisms on earth. (The word derives from the Greek
phagin, ``to eat.'')
 &HT;    Viral predators only one-fortieth the size of the average
bacteria cell, they swarm unseen around us, busily searching and
destroying their favorite food: germs.
 &HT;    In electron microscope images, phages show up as ghostly,
spiderlike creatures with transparent box-shaped heads, rigid tails
and a tangle of legs for gripping their prey. They are so tiny that
a single drop of tap water may contain a billion of them.
 &HT;    How do phages kill bacteria? The answer is, with chilling
efficiency.
 &HT;    Latching onto the walls of a bacteria cell, the phage injects it
with the genetic material stored in its very own head. Like a
living syringe, it gradually empties itself into the victim and
takes over its genetic machinery.
 &HT;    Inside the helpless bacteria, bits and pieces of ``daughter''
phages begin to appear with sinister rapidity: rows of little
heads, lines of tails, then legs. These different body parts
assemble into miniphages, using the host cell as a kind of factory.
 &HT;    As the phages multiply exponentially inside it, the bacterium's
walls weaken _ then explode like a soap bubble. Scientists call
this rather nightmarish process ``lysis.'' It is the flash point of
a gigantic microbial war between phages and bacteria, in which
humans are a mere side issue.
 &HT;    These deadly microscopic hit men were discovered independently
during World War I by the English microbiologist Frederick Twort
and the flamboyant Canadian biologist Felix d'Herelle, then working
in a laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. It was d'Herelle
who gave them their name in a 1917 paper that predicted a
revolution in the treatment of infectious diseases.
 &HT;    D'Herelle first discovered bacteriophages while working in the
Mexican state of Yucatan in 1910. He noticed them in the most
unlikely of places: the diarrhea of locusts. During an invasion of
these insects, d'Herelle collected sick specimens and observed
their abundant stools. He concluded that the locusts were suffering
from septicemia caused by coccobacilli bacteria.
 &HT;    D'Herelle smeared some of the diarrhea onto plates of agar to
grow cultures, but then noticed something odd. After a while, clear
circular spots a few millimeters across had appeared in the agar,
suggesting that something was munching away at the coccobacilli.
 &HT;    What were these tiny bacteria-eaters?
 &HT;    Back at the Institut Pasteur, d'Herelle repeated the experiment
in 1915 with stools taken from a Paris-based squadron addled with
dysentery. In the excrement of the officers, d'Herelle again
detected agents that consumed the bacteria spontaneously.
 &HT;    Nature, d'Herelle boldly announced to the world, had provided
humankind with a living, natural weapon against germs.
 &HT;    Phages were popularized by Sinclair Lewis in his 1925 novel
``Arrowsmith,'' about a young doctor who goes to the West Indies to
use them against an epidemic of bubonic plague.
 &HT;    ``You may,'' says one of the novel's characters to Martin
Arrowsmith, who was inspired by the real-life d'Herelle, ``have hit
on the supreme way to kill pathogenic bacteria!''
 &HT;    But it was not to be. Phages proved to be a hit-or-miss affair
as a therapy.
 &HT;    One problem was that there are hundreds of types of phages, and
each type kills only one variety of bacteria. Predator and prey
must be perfectly matched, a daunting process. What's more, there
were early problems with purification. When phages burst out of the
victim's cell, they leave behind debris that can contaminate the
solution. This debris can prove fatal to humans, a problem that the
purification technologies of the early days were unable to solve.
 &HT;    As a result of these difficulties, phages were quickly outpaced
by a rival drug: penicillin.
 &HT;    Although Eli Lilly actually manufactured therapeutic phages for
the U.S. market in the 1930s, after World War II they were largely
consigned to the margins of Western medicine _ even as they took
center stage in DNA research, where their simple molecular
structure made them an ideal tool for peering into the inner
workings of genes.
 &HT;    Sir Francis Crick and Max Delbruck, two architects of DNA
theory, were phage researchers. Phage research helped unlock
molecular biology at the very moment that they disappeared from the
medical scene.
 &HT;    Yet there is a twist to this story. The aristocratic d'Herelle
was a passionate Communist and admirer of the Soviet dictator,
Joseph Stalin.
 &HT;    In 1934 he accepted an invitation from the Soviet government to
join the Institute of Bacteriology in Tbilisi, recently set up by a
young Georgian microbiologist named George Eliava. The Eliava
Institute, as it became known, became the world's leading center of
therapeutic phage research.
 &HT;    One of its first successes was a powerful dysentery phage for
the Red Army during the World War II. Over the ensuing decades, the
institute began supplying precisely targeted phages to hospitals
all over the Soviet bloc. The Eliava Institute became the largest
phage library in the world, with a permanent ``museum'' of more
than 300 phage clones.
 &HT;    ``We've been perfecting bacteriophages as a medicine for over 70
years, just as d'Herelle said we could,'' explains Nina
Chanishvili, a senior researcher at the Eliava Institute today.
``But has anyone been listening?''
 &HT;    In recent years, she says, the institute's phage output has
dwindled alarmingly. Virtually unpaid, its workers now cling to a
fading infrastructure. When high-tech equipment breaks down, they
must work with improvised materials. Also, adds Chanishvili,
``because of the power cuts, we've lost about half of our phage
library.'' (Phage cultures must be refrigerated.)
 &HT;    In the institute's upstairs lab, the equipment is largely
rudimentary. Among the centrifuges, water baths and piles of petri
dishes stand dozens of beer and vodka bottles that the staff use as
containers for their solid agar. To melt the agar, they pop one of
the vodka bottles inside an old Nescafe tin sitting on a hot plate.
 &HT;    ``We like vodka bottles,'' Chanishvili feels obliged to explain,
``because they're so transparent.''
 &HT;    The interns spend most of their time on the tedious chore of
planting phage cultures in the specimens of bacteria, turning each
petri dish into a kind of phage farm.
 &HT;    I watch as one of the women sterilizes the tip of an applicator
in a Bunsen burner, drips a blob of phage solution onto a plate of
E. coli and carefully closes the plastic lid. ``E. coli causes
epidemics worldwide,'' explains the researcher, Marina Tediashvili.
``But these phages find E. coli tasty. They go through it like
Oreos.''
 &HT;    Holding up an E. coli dish that has been incubated for two days,
she points to a smattering of irregular, clear circles carved out
of the agar. They look like the perforations of a shotgun blast.
 &HT;    ``Isn't that beautiful?'' she whispers. A dish of salmonella is
peppered with smaller, more regular bullet holes.
 &HT;    Chanishvili explains that she and her colleagues initially catch
phages in gunky places where the creatures are known to thrive:
sewage water, for example. They are then stored in a liquid broth
kept in a refrigerator at 4 degrees Celsius. Oddly enough, they
don't need to be fed with tasty germs to stay alive.
 &HT;    ``Phages can live for months without food,'' Chanishvili says.
``Without additional germs to feed on, they cannot multiply out of
control.'' If their numbers begin to decrease, however, a few bugs
are thrown to them and they multiply again.
 &HT;    All in all, the Eliava produces about 10 different phage
applications that target about 15 different bacteria genera. A
topical phage application known as a ``PhageBioDerm,'' a kind of
bandage saturated with a cocktail of five to nine different phages,
can treat infected burn wounds. It is the perfect military
Band-Aid. Russian soldiers have used them in Chechnya.
 &HT;    Considering the difficulties involved in doing science in
Georgia, the advancements made by the Eliava are remarkable. Chief
among these has been the creation of an intravenous remedy to the
deadly staph aureus bacteria, a strain that threatens to one day
outpace vancomycin. According to the Eliava, it's been used
successfully on dozens of patients.
 &HT;    In the past few years, the Eliava's skill has attracted the
attention of Western entrepreneurs eager to harness the knowledge
bottled up in Tbilisi's laboratories.
 &HT;    But the Georgian scientists worry about this development as much
as they celebrate it. Who will ultimately benefit from the
commercial exploitation of their work? Will the Americans and
Europeans simply steal their expertise and innovations?
 &HT;    ``The local market has collapsed,'' says Meiparinai with a final
shrug. Indeed, most people in Georgia now are too poor to afford
the medicine. ``But who will patent phages in the West? Who's going
to make the millions?'' Then he corrects himself. ``The billions, I
mean.''
 &HT;    Indeed, the worldwide antibacterials market is estimated to be
worth $25 billion a year.
 &HT;    That evening I meet with Nina's uncle, Teimuraz Chanishvili, who
has helped direct the Eliava Institute for a quarter of a century.
He is at his home on Kazbegi Street, a lampless street of elegant
19th-century Russian houses. A Nabokovian charmer now in his 70s,
he greets me at the top of the stairs in his dressing gown.
 &HT;    ``Come and look at the TV,'' he says excitedly. ``The Americans
have stolen my phage photographs!''
 &HT;    By one of those coincidences that even a journalist couldn't
invent, there indeed is an American TV documentary about phages
being broadcast. Teimuraz's uncopyrighted images of phages float
like extraterrestrial prawns across the screen.
 &HT;    ``I didn't get a cent!'' he cries, shaking his finger at the
screen.
 &HT;    Later, we have a calmer chat over chestnut soda, and he tells me
the sad story of George Eliava. The man who established the
bacteriophage's central place in Soviet medicine was not exactly
rewarded for his efforts. When not doing brilliant science, Eliava
was a handsome playboy who had the misfortune to fall in love with
a woman also admired by Lavrenti Beria, Stalin's secret police
chief. Despite Stalin's high regard for bacteriophages, it was
Eliava's death warrant.
 &HT;    ``Beria had Eliava shot in 1937 on a pretext,'' Teimuraz says
matter-of-factly. ``That's the way it was back then.'' He adds with
a chuckle, ``Thankless work, bacteriophages!''
 &HT;    As if on cue, the lights go out.
 &HT;    But meanwhile, back in the well-lighted laboratories of Europe
and the United States, the prospects for phages are glittering.
 &HT;    At least three U.S. start-up companies are vying to be the first
to push a phage therapy through Food and Drug Administration
approval. There is Harlingten's Phage Therapeutics in Seattle;
Intralytix in Baltimore, a company with numerous Georgian expats on
the payroll; and Exponential Biotherapies on Long Island, a small
biotech company that expects to petition the FDA to begin clinical
trials on a phage drug this spring.
 &HT;    Purification and in-depth animal testing are essential first
steps toward commercializing phages in the painstaking medical
culture of the West. Clinical trials involving human patients are
yet to come.
 &HT;    On this front, the Georgians are way ahead of the Americans.
 &HT;    Indeed, the Soviet bloc's headlong experiment with human
patients may well turn out to be the greatest contribution of the
embattled Tbilisi doctors to the eventual medical use of phages.
 &HT;    Dr. David Shrayer, now a cancer researcher at Brown University,
worked as a medical officer on the construction of the Baikal-Amur
railroad in Siberia in the 1970s, where he says he regularly
administered bacteriophages to Soviet construction workers.
 &HT;    ``Even back then,'' Schrayer says, ``these Siberian workers were
suffering from infections that were resistant to antibiotics. The
phages worked splendidly.
 &HT;    ``But here's the catch. D'Herelle and then the Soviets ruined
the image of phages in the West by testing them on people without
first conducting proper animal tests. Animal tests were expensive;
patients were cheap.
 &HT;    ``That was the tragedy of phages in the East. But it was also
their trump card. We learned that they really work.''

&HT;     HOW TO AVOID INJURIES IN THE WINTER WONDERLAND

<P>
   Scott Gallup still remembers the injury. It was 1967, and he was
skiing with a friend at a small hill in the Berkshire Mountains.
Gear consisted of lace-up boots, wooden skis and cable bindings
that didn't come off.
</P>
<P>
   An expert slope. Nine inches of fresh powder. The fearlessness
that can only come from being 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after he started the run, Gallup lay in the fluffy snow,
his leg in agony. It was his first ski injury _ a leg fracture that
required a cast for two months. But it also was a learning
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been hurt skiing since,'' said Gallup, who remains,
at 40, an avid skier and snowmobiler who knows how to play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain amount of adrenaline makes it exciting,'' he said.
``But you have to temper that with a little bit of caution. You can
get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful white world out there. There's snow on the
slopes, lakes are frozen for ice skating, sledding hills have
plenty of cover, cross-country ski trails are crowded.
</P>
<P>
   But as glorious as the white wonderland can be, it also can be
dangerous. Two recent deaths at Stowe Mountain Resort in Vermont
drove that point home _ 17-year-old Evan Simon of Glastonbury,
Conn., lost control on the black-diamond trail Liftline and ran
into a tree; and Haskel Robern, 68, of Ottawa, died when a
fractured rib suffered during a fall at the resort ruptured his
spleen.
</P>
<P>
   Most winter injuries, whether from snowboarding or ice skating,
tend to be minor, doctors agree. But plenty of other winter sports
carry serious injury risks. Sledding accidents can cause permanent
paralysis. Snowmobile crashes, especially at high speed, can be
deadly. Ice-skating falls, especially for figure skaters, can cause
career-ending injuries. And then, of course, there's the
ever-present risk of frostbite or hypothermia for those who head
into the backcountry to ski, hike or climb ice.
</P>
<P>
   Because winter is best enjoyed on your feet _ not on your back _
here's a sport-by-sport look at how to get the best out of winter
before winter gets the best of you.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   SKIING AND RIDING
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when most people with ski injuries left the
resort in an ambulance. Dr. Jeffrey Lozman, an orthopedic surgeon
at the Albany Medical Center in Albany, N.Y., said the vast
majority of people injured on the slopes are able to walk back to
their skis and ride for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport, by and large, has become safer over the years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for this. Ski bindings have been built to
release from different angles. Shaped skis allow skiers to turn
more easily, requiring less energy. New skiers are now taught not
only how to turn, but how to fall safely. More are wearing helmets.
Some resorts even train workers to, gently, ask unsafe skiers to
slow down, or recommend that perhaps they shouldn't attempt the
icy, mogul-covered double-black-diamond trail as the first run of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, while fractures are down, other injuries are up.
For skiers, the biggest risk is the dreaded anterior cruciate
ligament tear, which claimed 250,000 victims last year. The injury
usually is easy to repair through microsurgery. For snowboarders,
wrist fractures are a common problem, caused by constantly using
hands to land during a fall, Lozman said.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding wrist injuries is simple, he said. Boarders should wear
wrist-guards, which transfer the force of a falling body onto the
much stronger arm bones.
</P>
<P>
   Some ski areas are getting more proactive. Stowe, for instance,
has started to get serious about taking tickets from reckless
skiers and is teaching risk-assessment in its learn-to-ski
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pad the world,'' said Dave Merriam, director of the
ski and snowboard school. ``We help people understand intelligent
risk-taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ski areas also are teaching how to fall safely. Most ligament
tears are caused by either falling or getting up. Skiers shouldn't
attempt to right themselves with their arms, especially while
they're still moving, he said. Instead, they should let their body
come to a stop and not try to break their fall with their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Also, skiers and riders alike should wear helmets and not push
their abilities at the end of the day, when they're tired and most
susceptible to injuries. They should be in shape and make their
bodies flexible through frequent stretching. And finally, all
downhillers should get their equipment checked once or twice a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ski safely,'' Lozman said, ``you'll avoid these
dangers.''

   SLEDDING
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it looks perfectly safe _ you're low to the
ground, it's a small hill, and there's snow everywhere. What could
happen? More than you think.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ambulance is here once or twice a year,'' said Gallup,
superintendent of the popular sledding spot at the New Course at
Albany. Gallup is now quite recovered from the fracture he suffered
as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bump can send you flying through the air,'' he said.
``Depending on how you land, you can hurt yourself. With kids, it's
usually bumps and bruises. Adults, it's usually broken bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sledding injuries can be catastrophic. At the State
University College at Oneonta, N.Y., a few years ago, a girl riding
a tray down a hill broke her neck after being hit from behind. At
The New Course, an adult sledder broke his back in the late 1980s.
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says sledding injuries
occur about 50,000 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Around New York, owners of some popular sledding spots are
banning the sport. Others have put up snow fencing halfway up a
hill to prevent riders from going too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Sledders, Gallup said, should avoid the obvious dangers _
overloading a sled, going down too close to trees, hitting other
sledders, running into the road or off an embankment.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, he said, also should keep in mind the age _ and weight _
of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are quite light,'' he said. ``When they go down a slope,
they don't reach `terminal velocity.' But adults take off on a
tube, they weigh three or four times more, and they take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're also,'' he added, ``not as flexible when they land.''
</P>

<P>
   ICE SKATING
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, 47,784
people were injured ice-skating in 1997. Some of the injuries were
serious. Some ice-hockey players suffered spine injuries during a
particularly exuberant body check. Also, five world-class figure
skaters were seriously injured in the past few months, including
former Olympic contender Paul Bonnebose, who nearly died after his
back buckled while he attempted to lift a partner and he fell and
struck his head.
</P>
<P>
   Not planning to try out for any sports? Skating still is risky,
mostly due to falls onto the hard, slick surface. Experts say it's
important to make sure skates fit properly, including for children
who may require a new size every year.
</P>
<P>
   Ice-hockey players should always wear protective gear, even
during practice. Then there's this old standby: If you're outside,
make sure the ice is thick enough, and stay away from any area with
open water.

</P>
<P>
   THE REST
</P>
<P>
   The most important rule to staying safe in the cold is common
sense.
</P>
<P>
   For snowmobilers, it means not drinking, wearing the right
clothing, avoiding thin ice, not going so fast that you risk
hitting a tree or a friend on another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   For cross-country skiers, it means not tackling a hill you can't
comfortably stay in control on and bringing enough food, water and
clothes to stay properly energized, hydrated and warm. For the
latter, use thick layers, a head covering and windproof,
warm-when-wet materials. If you're going deep into the backcountry,
bring emergency supplies such as a flashlight, and tell people when
you expect to be home.
</P>
<P>
   For ice climbing, it means always wearing a helmet,
understanding the equipment, placing proper protection and being
aware of changing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big winter out there. Play it safe, and you might just
make it to spring.

<P>
   On Tues., Jan. 25, I had to travel from New York to Boston,
braving one of the worst ice storms in history. Since the airports
were closed and trains stood motionless, blocked by newly
accumulated white snow mountains on the rails, I had to make the
trip in a van driven by one of my sons.
</P>
<P>
   Javier is a reliable and expert driver. But the truth is he was
as terrified as I. The trip, which usually takes no more than four
hours, took us eight, most of which we spent driving behind very
slow moving trucks that were distributing tons of salt on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure, though, was well worth our effort because outside
of Vernon, Conn., we found one of those stories that reflect, by
themselves, the fragilities of the American empire.
</P>
<P>
   We had already visited several gas stations in search of hot
coffee but come to accept the fact that in that terrible minus-20
degree climate, we could find only frosty beverages. Over and over
we came upon those vending machines full of iced-cold Coca-Cola,
Sprite, Diet Coke and all the other colorful cans of those bubbly
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   It jogged me into recalling the few facts I knew about that
giant global corporate power: It sells about 85,000 million liters
of beverage per day to the people of 160 countries and earns annual
profits in excess of $500 million. There are Coca-Cola vending
machines in the Saudi Arabian deserts, in the treacherous mountains
of Albania and at the foot of the Great Wall of China.
</P>
<P>
   The company's logo, traced with elegant calligraphy, is today
one of the indisputable symbols of the North American realm. John
Stith Pemberton, the legendary inventor of this soft drink, was a
druggist in Atlanta who also sold iced syrups and cough tonics. In
1886, at age 51, Pemberton created a chemical mix that, he thought,
would really quench the thirst of his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even though only three people in the world are privy to
the exact formula, its two main ingredients are well known: the
extract of the nut of the cola and the tea obtained from the leaves
of the coca.
</P>
<P>
   Hence its name: Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor is rounded off with other vegetable substances, a
little caffeine and sugar. Since the liquid was also medicinal, the
syrup had an infinitesimal amount of cocaine (about one part to 50
million parts). Nevertheless, in 1929 a national debate on
addiction led to the elimination of even the slightest trace of
this substance.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with its thousands of bottlers and concessions around the
world, it is still one of the most prosperous corporations on the
planet. During the past year, however, there were several
disturbing signs.
</P>
<P>
   Sales dropped steeply in Germany and Japan _ two of the five
countries in the world with the highest Coca-Cola consumption _ and
in the recent past they almost collapsed in the shaky economies of
Russia and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas N. Daft, the new president, heard the voices of alarm
among his shareholders and decided to do something radical to stop
the downward slide.
</P>
<P>
   And here we must turn back to Friendly's, where it was about 7
p.m. and we were relaxing, trying to straighten the kinks out of
our muscles. Suddenly, we heard a man sobbing _ the sound of
sadness was as disturbing as anything could be.
</P>
<P>
   The man was about 40 years old, dressed in an elegant gray suit,
necktie and starched shirt. He had a stiff leather briefcase, a
scarf and an overcoat: light clothing for weather such as we were
having that night.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden I recognized the man. He was Aurelio Sanchez
Cos, a Galician Spaniard, the son of a fisherman, who had left his
country in 1975 and traveled to Switzerland. Years back I had
shared a flight with him from Madrid to Buenos Aires. And I clearly
remembered that, on that airplane, he was feeling very proud of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   For he had finished his university studies in marketing and was
working at the Coca-Cola Co.'s Iberian division, where he was
earning $3,000 per month, a huge salary. He had set his life's
goal: to be fluent in English and then try to conquer one of the
golden jobs at the company's headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know something, man?'' he told me at some point in the
conversation. ``I don't have blood in my veins. I have Coca-Cola,
undiluted and without bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   At Friendly's, I waited until the sobs died down a bit and
approached Sanchez Cos, asking, in Spanish, if I could be of any
help.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a few moments to recognize me, but after a short
pause he did.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that he had arrived in Atlanta in 1994 and ever
since then ``everything had been wonderful.'' He had an American
wife and two sons, and a couple of his fishermen uncles lived in
Maine. Sometimes, he admitted, Atlanta seemed a bit soulless and
alien: a place where you lived in a groove, without friends or
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Coca-Cola is there and, well, you know, it has always been
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Jan. 24, Aurelio had been informed that the
company fired him. He was one of 6,000 employees the new CEO
considered redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the courage to tell my wife,'' he said. ``I
packed a few clothes, phoned her and told her my uncle was sick and
wanted to see me in Maine. I then climbed in my Japanese van and
drove through the storm, to nowhere. Do you see how white
everything is outside? That's my life now: a blind desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon in Boston I would see his sorry tale confirmed in the
newspaper. I read that nearly half of the workers at Coke
headquarters in Atlanta were no doubt shedding tears as bitter as
those of Aurelio Sanchez Cos, and that many others were expecting
to receive the same terrible news. What had befallen them was not
poverty, but something worse: a sense of injustice and personal
failure without a chance to recoup.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, during the Nuremberg trials, in Vietnam and
throughout our modern history, that peanut-shaped bottle has been a
symbol of untouchable American happiness. But now, nothing seems
safe.
</P>
<P>
   The American empire seems more prosperous than ever, as
President Bill Clinton told us recently, but here and there you can
see fissures, water and ice needles that fall on the people and
make them cry.

   ATTN SPORTS EDITORS: CoxNet's NASCAR page gears up
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded field of NASCAR pages, one stands out: CoxNet's
Inside NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   CoxNet's NASCAR page draws on material from the Cox papers in
Georgia, Florida, Texas and North Carolina, the heart of NASCAR
country. Michael Carvell, veteran NASCAR reporter for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, will again lead the coverage. He'll attend
every race of the season (and his race-day coverage is a fixture of
the NYT News Service's sports wire).
</P>
<P>
   CoxNet will open the season with a two-page preview on Sunday,
Feb. 20, the day of the Daytona 500. Then for 40 Fridays we'll
bring your readers all the news of the NASCAR season, finishing
with a season wrapup page on Friday, Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Inside NASCAR is a full-page, full-color product, designed
modularly so that a half-page ad or 3-inch strip ad can be dropped
in at the bottom, in place of content. Several papers using the
CoxNet page have tapped new revenue by selling contract ads for the
season around this page.
</P>
<P>
   CoxNet's pages are available for $20 a week _ and the first 10
downloads are free! So if you're new to CoxNet's pages, you'll get
one-fourth of the NASCAR season at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sign up in advance for the whole season, and we'll throw in some
related ad and marketing material for free _ your marketing
department will thank you.
</P>
<P>
   That means the preview pages, the ad and marketing material, and
the 40 weekly pages can be had for a $600 flat fee. (If you're not
satisfied after the 10 initial pages, you can cancel the service at
no charge.)

&HT;     MOURNING A BYGONE ERA

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ultimately, they settled on a bright and airy
place with clean windows instead of the dark, cave-like joint
they'd been headed for.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably better,'' the tall man said as they climbed
onto their barstools. ``You can actually see there's a world
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman in sunglasses agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a healthier way to drink gin,'' she said. ``I
mean, if you're going to drink gin in the middle of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   They had known each other for 25 years _ the woman had met the
tall man the very day she moved to San Francisco _ but generally
they stayed on the periphery of one another's lives. Sometimes
several months went by without their paths crossing.
</P>
<P>
   When they did run into each other _ as they had this day at yet
another funeral _ there was usually an inexplicable (and unspoken)
synchronization of their moods.
</P>
<P>
   Which was why, when the tall man had looked around the
post-funeral reception and said, ``I feel like going someplace and
having a martini,'' the woman in sunglasses decided not to return
to work quite so soon.
</P>
<P>
   They had asked other people to join them, people who had loved
or admired the man they all now mourned and celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't,'' each person said. ``I have to go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if you couldn't get a martini at the reception.
Held in a spectacular penthouse with a 360-degree view of San
Francisco, the post-memorial party wanted for nothing. Not fresh
shrimp and sushi nor two full bars.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman in sunglasses knew why the tall man wanted to go
someplace else to drink gin. This funeral spelled the absolute end
of an era. Attention needed to be paid in an old-style way, a
traditional San Francisco way.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter and columnist for the morning newspaper for more than
50 years, the man who'd died was the last of a breed of local star
journalists. He'd begun to make his name in the post-war years of
American prosperity and hope, and he managed to stay flexible
enough to retain his position as an opinion shaper in the Third
Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues _ the dapper travel writer, the surly
professional Irishman, the pearl-festooned society eye, the
cigar-chomping sports writer, and the sophisticated king of
three-dot itemizing _ all had gone before him. With each death, a
little more of The City That Was went too.
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern transplants (via separate stints in New York City),
the tall man and the woman in sunglasses had fallen in love at
first sight with The City That Was. They'd loved, not just her
incomparable anatomy, but also her human physiology _ her
legitimate characters, her lunatics, her poets and poseurs.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, despite their mind-boggling differences of origin,
profession, religion and politics, had seemed forever united in one
thing: their citizenship. They were San Franciscans and comfortably
proud of it, like people born into an old and already revered
family.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, poor, hustler or burnt-out case, they all considered
themselves part of a community _ San Franciscans first, everything
else second. Native-born or adopted daughters and sons, they
believed to the depths of their souls that they were the chosen
few, the smugly satisfied inhabitants of the greatest city on the
North American continent.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping their martinis, the tall man and the woman in sunglasses
said nothing of The City That Was. Instead, they talked of local
and national politics, of the seemingly roofless economy, the
microchip revolution and the sad but unavoidable decline in
newspaper readership.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the woman noticed a printed sign that was posted
high over the bar. She tapped on the tall man's arm and gestured
toward it: ``Our bar is dedicated to those merry souls of other
days, who again will make drinking a pleasure, who achieve
contentment long before capacity and who _ whatever they may drink
_ prove able to carry it, enjoy it and remain ladies and
gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, after a few minutes had passed, they both
ordered another round.
</P>

MACRO VIRUS POSES A GROWING THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you use Microsoft Word, Excel, or Outlook, then you better
keep on your toes: you are vulnerable to one of the most common
pests on the Internet today.
</P>
<P>
   The pest is something that's called a ``macro virus'' _ a little
program that hides inside a word processor document or spreadsheet
and that can do a world of damage to both beginners and
sophisticated computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, alas, is that it is very convenient to e-mail a
Word file from one person to another: Word makes it easy to send a
complex document complete with fonts, pictures, and even embedded
spreadsheets. Unfortunately, this common practice has also created
an explosion of Word macro viruses that promise to be a growing
threat to our information economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a friend of mine in California dropped me an e-mail
saying that a pop-up window had appeared on his copy of Word 98.
The error was apparently from a macro virus that had infected his
computer. The virus was quite advanced: Besides infecting and
replicating, it also kept a log file of every computer with the
date of each infection and the name of the person who owned the
infected computer. A copy of this log file was automatically sent
to a repository somewhere on the Internet on the first of each
month.
</P>
<P>
   Macro viruses infect a computer in a manner similar to the way a
retrovirus, such as the herpes virus, infects the human body. The
macro virus starts running when your word processor, for instance,
opens an infected file. Once it is running, the virus copies itself
into the word processor, similar to the way that a retrovirus might
insert itself into the DNA of a human cell. Once infected, the
macro virus runs every time you open an existing document with your
word processor or create a new one. When it runs, the virus makes a
copy of itself into the file, infecting the new file.
</P>
<P>
   Macro viruses didn't exist prior to the release of Microsoft 95.
But with Word 95, Microsoft added the ability to store macros in
files along with words.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, one of the telltale signs of having an infected
copy of Word 95 (or Word 6 on the Macintosh) was that the word
processor would only save Word Template files, since this was the
only way that the macro could propagate. Since then, newer releases
of Microsoft Word and Excel have had the ability to store macros in
ordinary document files. Microsoft called this modification an
enhancement, but it significantly compounded the macro virus
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to store macros inside a word processor is a powerful
feature. For example, you can have a macro that computes the terms
of an installment loan, or that automatically asks a few questions
and then draws a graph. Many businesses have created whole
applications that run inside Microsoft Word and Excel. By
themselves macros aren't inherently dangerous. What is inherently
dangerous, however, is the ability of Word and Excel to have macros
that automatically execute when a file is opened.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994 and 1995, many computer security professionals
warned Microsoft that it was making a serious mistake, but the
company decided to ignore those warnings. Legend has it that the
first macro virus, called Concept, was created by a Microsoft
programmer to demonstrate the dangers of the new macro features.
The virus got out: Large parts of Microsoft were infected, and the
company accidentally stamped infected Word files onto CD-ROMs that
were distributed at a developer conference. Unfortunately, the
programmer forgot to include any safety features, such as having
the virus automatically kill itself after a particular date.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial antivirus software protects against many of the most
common macro viruses.
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data, the top-selling antivirus products last
year were:
</P>
<P>
   --Norton Anti Virus, with more than 2 million copies sold.
(average retail price of Norton Anti Virus 2000 is $34.50).
</P>
<P>
   --Network Associate's Virus Scan, with 1.1 million copies sold
($32.97).
</P>
<P>
   --Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus, with 123,000 copies sold ($24.50).
</P>
<P>
   Although antivirus software will fight the most common Word
macro viruses, it's not a panacea. It's simply too easy for a
computer programmer to take an existing Word macro virus, make a
few changes, and create a new virus that won't be detected.
</P>
<P>
   The safest way to avoid being infected by a macro virus is to
disable them. You can do this under Microsoft Word 2000 by changing
your macro security setting. On Word 2000, three settings are
available. The ``low'' setting lets Word run any macro that it
finds. Don't use this setting! Instead, specify ``high'' security,
which disables all macros unless they are signed from a so-called
``trusted source.'' (The program lets you specify which signatures
that it should trust; the rest are automatically ignored.) There is
also a ``medium'' security setting. In this mode, you are warned
each time you open a file if that file contains macros, and you're
given a choice as to whether or not you want the macros enabled or
disabled. I recommend that most people leave their security setting
set to ``high'', since there is no way to tell beforehand if a
macro is going to be safe or not.

BMW X5: THE SUPREME SUV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I crunched it through snow, put it into deliberate spins on
hockey rink-caliber ice, pushed it pedal-to-the-metal from stop to
60 miles per hour, and did rapid, abrupt lane changes at highway
speed.
</P>
<P>
   I was looking for a flaw: a skid that could not be corrected, a
disconcerting lean of auto and driver so common and dangerous on
many SUVs when they do quick maneuvers at high speed, a lack of
power in a vehicle that weighs in at nearly 2 1/2 tons. Forget
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the BMW X5 reigns as the Swiss Army Knife of SUVs: a
high-performance car on the highway, a bull in snow (and, I assume,
mud and sand), and a delicately controlled auto even on the
slickest ice. Pick your blade, carve your task.
</P>
<P>
   Why then did I emerge from my first day of driving a vehicle
that truly impressed me asking the simple question, ``why?'' _ as
in, why would the maker of such fine sedans and sports cars need to
build an SUV (they call it a Sports Activity Vehicle but I'm not
going to quibble over a vowel)?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, in an automobile market where SUV sales are
booming, you need to build one if you want to be a player. To be
sure, BMW hopes to land new buyers for the product line, but as
David J. Buchko, BMW's product information specialist readily
acknowledges, a lot of BMW owners have SUVs as second vehicles in
their household fleets and, until now, none of the latter were
BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freude am Fahren'' is the BMW lingo these days and before you
conjure up images of bearded shrinks and leather couches, know that
the phrase means, ``Joy in Driving.'' And know, too, that many,
many drivers are looking for their joy from the high perch of
luxurious SUVs that perform on the highway, haul people and gear,
and can handle bad roads and bad weather. Buchko says BMW simply
does not want to be left out of a market undergoing ``a very clear
separation'' between old-style, truck-based SUVs and newer, more
luxurious variants. Hey, even Porsche has one in the works.
</P>
<P>
   There's your why.
</P>
<P>
   Here's your how: BMW took unibody construction, coupled it with
a welded-up chassis, and produced a rigid rig that, outfitted with
high-tech suspension, gives a luxury sedan-like ride on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, they gave it the distinctive kidney-grilled BMW nose
and sent the rest of the profile sloping up, back, and away from
there. If I have one complaint with this auto, it is that is just
does not look that distinctive from, say, the Mercedes or Lexus
SUVs. My cleaning lady and the woman who sells me my papers every
morning both asked if it was some kind of new van.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you've got BMW _ think 5 and 7 series quality _ all the
way. Beautifully stitched, firm leather buckets are up front, a
rear bench that folds down 60/40 and seats three comfortably, with
plenty of leg and head room, is in back. A power tilting and
telescoping steering column; heated, leather-wrapped steering
wheel; power controls on dash, console, and steering wheel, and,
for nighttime, that fiery orange glow from the instrumentation that
bathes you in BMW aura appoint the interior.
</P>
<P>
   It's powered by a DOHC 32-valve V8 that pounds out 282
horsepower and a whopping 324 lb.-ft. of torque. The engine emits a
powerful basso rumble and you can't tell me BMW didn't purposely
leave out some insulating qualities just so the driver can feel and
hear that sound.
</P>
<P>
   It propels the car from 0-60 in 7.5 seconds and in the sportier
model lets it run at 143 miles per hour. It got just over 16 miles
per gallon in a week of commuting, testing in ice and snow, and
short trips around town.
</P>
<P>
   The X5 is full-time all-wheel drive with a planetary center
differential that splits the torque about 60-40, front to rear.
This virtually eliminates any hint of torque steer and, coupled
with the near-perfect front-to-rear weight balance, lets you feel
what your wheels are doing in a way not always common to all-wheel
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed Steptronic (manual option) transmission handled
all the torque smoothly. And smooth is a word that applies to much
about this vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The standard suspension is classic BMW engineering (again think
5 and 7 series): up front it features struts, double pivot lower
arms, twin-tube gas shocks, and an anti-roll bar; in the rear, you
get four-link integral suspension with upper later arms,
self-leveling air springs, and twin gas shocks.
</P>
<P>
   ABS with dynamic brake control brings it to straight, sure
stops. And the brake system plays a key role in other
handling/safety features as well. The X5 has All-season Traction
Control, which modulates engine torque and applies individual wheel
brakes to prevent sustained slippage.
</P>
<P>
   The ABS and ATC features unite again in the Dynamic Stability
Control system, which monitors sensors to watch wheel speed, the
turning of the steering wheel, how hard the vehicle is cornering,
yaw, brake pedal pressure, and how hard the X5 is accelerating or
stopping. If it senses the X5 straying from its proper course in a
turn, it uses braking to individual wheels to get it back on
course.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is great, of course, for highways, but a powerful
help as well should you go off-roading with the X5 (somebody will,
right?). For off-roading, it adds Hill Descent Control, which runs
the brakes for you and keeps the X5 creeping down steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features include 2-stage front-impact airbags, head
protection system, and side-impact bags for the front seat. The
latter are an option for the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo space is wide and deep, but not long, though the
two-piece tailgate _ top goes up, bottom goes down _ makes access
very easy.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The split 60/40 rear seat, which can be moved ahead, using
power, on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --It takes a gorilla to remove the sun visor from its clip so
the visor can be moved to the driver's side-window.

AT 70, SKI VISIONARY HELPS SNOWBIRD FLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SNOWBIRD, Utah _ Mineral Basin is the new 500-acre bowl at
Snowbird, and it was about halfway down this sculpted face that
Dick Bass skied into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the 70-year-old Texan has owned
Snowbird, living proof that when the going gets tough, the tough
keep going to bank after bank another until a loan officer sees it
Bass's way. Snowbird is here to stay, God-inspired, and the best
thing this side of Heaven. But on this early morning run, the
mountain not yet open to the public, Bass was in Purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Snow was falling so hard that he couldn't distinguish between
groomed and ungroomed snow. He was wobbling on the edge like
someone crossing ice on stilts. Bombs were going off in the
distance as snow safety experts tried to pry potential avalanches
loose, but Bass appeared oblivious to the thunder. He was just
trying to remain standing. He was up, he was down, he was up again.
No harm done. He was slightly flustered and embarrassed, but onward
he went.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This, in a snapshot, is Richard D. Bass, a gambler, a battler, a
man amid explosions who has taken an occasional hit as owner of one
of the nation's largest ski areas. But when the snow clears, the
guy is always standing.
</P>
<P>
   Bass is, after all, the first man to stand on the highest peak
of all seven continents. This includes Everest, which he intends to
climb again next year _ at the age of 71. Bass has made a career of
playing the odds. If he doesn't like them, he seems to have the
will _ and the mouth _ to change them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't these conditions just terrific!'' he exclaims as he
dusts snow from his derriere and scolds an uncooperative leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, they don't call me Large Mouthed Bass for nothing,''
he adds. A moment later, he points the skis downhill and pushes
into the snowy unknown, bomb bursts crackling all around. ``If I'm
not talking,'' he says to all the snowflakes, ``I'm not selling.''
</P>
<P>
   These are good times for Dick Bass to be selling. The Dallas son
of Texas oil, Bass is celebrating, among other things, this
season's opening of Mineral Basin, almost 1,500 vertical feet of
varied ski terrain serviced by a detachable quad chairlift.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion on eastern flank of ``The Bird'' virtually assures
that someday soon skiiers regularily will be criss-crossing between
Snowbird and neighboring Alta, making Little Cottonwood Canyon one
of the largest avalanche-controlled ski arenas known worldwide for
its light, dry snow.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Bass is happy is that the US Forest Service
recently granted initial concept approval for a $20 million summit
complex, a 3-level, 60,000-square-foot structure incorporating two
restaurants. Some environmentalists are sure to challenge the
project to the end.
</P>
<P>
   In an age in which ski areas have had to merge to stay alive,
Snowbird remains independent _ while it expands. This is
remarkable, according to one competitor who lays credit squarely on
the shoulders of the somewhat diminuative, somewhat hefty frame of
one Richard Bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has to be one of the greats in the ski industry,''
said Nick Badami, chairman of Powdr Corporation, a holding company
for five ski areas, including Park City and Alpine Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anyone else would have given up years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Another admirer is Andy Daly, president of Vail Resorts. ``No
man has climbed higher, challenged bankers longer, or been more
committed to fulfulling his vision,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   So who is Dick Bass?
</P>
<P>
   Ski with him for a half a day, and you might conclude he is
obsessed, passionate, stubborn, deeply religious, poetic, and a
test for wives (he's on his third) and mountain managers (about a
half-dozen in the past decade). He is a visionary and a salesman.
He is an honest, likable man haunted by a need to keep proving
himself. He will bring himself to tears talking about the value of
integrity and the gift of life.
</P>
<P>
   And he is priority-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the recent snowy morning when Bass was battling the
elements and recovering. Hundreds of members of the National Ski
Areas Association were holding a convention at Snowbird, but Bass
was happy singing drinking songs to a reporter while showing off
his mountain. At one point, several skiers stepped off the tramway
at the summit and asked Bass for an easy route down.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, let me show you!'' Bass offered, leading the entourage
like a mother hen. They never knew he owned the place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bass claims to dislike verbal challenges. The record suggests
such challenges have defined him. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   --The smaller of two sons born to a self-made millionaire, Bass
learned early in life to sink or swim _ literally. When he was
about 8, he and friends wagered whether they could not swim
underwater around a submarine cave. Bass got lost in the dark and
came within seconds of drowning. Most boys would have run from the
scene. His father immediately took him back to the water, then
under it, so he would overcome his newly discovered fear.
</P>
<P>
   --``Poetry is for sissies,'' is what young boys from North
Dallas grew up thinking in the 1930s as they entered Walnut Hill
Elementery School. Then they met Miss Coleman. Year after year, she
challenged students to learn verse; to this day, Bass carries
anothologies by Kipling, Service, and Tennyson in his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   --At a 1980 Snowbird dinner, Bass announced he would try some
mountain climbing and asked a young woman on the ski patrol if she
would guide him up Mount McKinley. The late Marty Hoey was also a
McKinley guide. ``Bass, your hot air won't get you up that
mountain,'' she told him. To this day, Bass credits Hoey for the
succession of climbs that got him into the record book as the first
man to climb all seven summits.
</P>
<P>
   After three failed attempts, the deaths of at least two climbing
companions, and a total of nine months on the mountain, Bass
finally made it up Everest in 1985 _ reciting Miss Coleman's poetry
between steps to help get his mind off his misery.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds next year, he will be 11 years older than a
Spaniard who now holds the record as Everest's eldest summiter.
</P>
<P>
   The bid does not thrill Alice Bass, his wife of eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's reasoning?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can achieve whatever we can conceive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we never stop, we can't get stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Recreation is re-creation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The joy is in the journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Alice must wonder if she's married to a cross between
Jesse Jackson and the Energizer Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seeds for entering the ski business were sown while Bass was
at Yale in the late 1940s. He learned to ski on wooden Northlands
with homemade edges at Bromley and Stowe. Later he decided he
wanted to build a ski area, and in 1969 the opportunity to buy into
a large share of Snowbird presented itself. The area existed on
blueprints only. Bass took a week to think it over, touring New
England to consider options but saw only a lot of people skiing in
yellow rain gear. So he returned to Utah and bought into Snowbird.
</P>

   Thirty-one years later, he remains tens of millions in debt,
twice coming within hours of losing the farm (both ranches,
actually) as loans have became due. ``But I'm seeing light at the
end of the tunnel,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bass hopes that Snowbird someday will become a Renaissance
Center to recharge body and mind. He envisions educational
facilities and a performance center, whereas more sanguine
observers see huge debt and a narrow canyon road serving the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has given each of us a niche to fill,'' said Bass. ``Mine
is to create a year-round resort that feeds the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he fails?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'm going down with a hoop and a holler.''

AN ASSAULT ON THE HOME FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With luck, the computer vandals who've been savaging some of
the world's most popular Web sites will soon be wearing the orange
jailhouse jumpsuits they so richly deserve. But what will happen to
their unwitting accomplices?
</P>
<P>
   The assaults that battered Yahoo and eBay and a variety of major
sites were brutally simple. There are programs that fire off
streams of data packets like water from a fire hose. Just a few
such streams would clobber a typical Web site, but the major
outfits like Yahoo have multiple connections to the biggest
Internet backbones. To swamp them with traffic, you need a
multitude of high-speed data streams from a host of computers.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that a disgruntled technician at a large
corporation could pull off such a stunt, using computers scattered
around the company. But many experts fear that the attacking
computers are located in many different organizations, and linked
by one common trait _ lousy Internet security.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the recent attacks, the offensive program
conceals itself. Every packet of data on the Internet comes with an
address that's supposed to tell where it originated. In principle,
the attacking computers should have been quickly identified and
silenced.
</P>
<P>
   But a clever programmer can replace the real packet address with
a fake one, making it just this side of impossible to trace the
source of the data. Thus a disgruntled employee could send a flood
of anonymous nastiness from one his company's servers.
</P>
<P>
   But not if that firm's network manager has the good sense to run
an ``egress filter.'' This is a program that scans the addresses of
outgoing data and compares them to a list of authorized addresses.
If a program tries to ship phony packets, they're denied access to
the Internet, and the network manager gets a warning message that
somebody's gaming the system.
</P>
<P>
   Notice that this is a security program that doesn't just keep
intruders out; it also prevents invaders from using our machines as
a staging point for other network attacks. Even if an intruder
breaks into a system and installs one of these data-flooding
programs, the outgoing packets are intercepted, not dumped
willy-nilly onto the Net.
</P>
<P>
   But Weld Pond, chief scientist at the Cambridge, Mass. computer
security firm (at)Stake Inc., says many major systems on the
Internet aren't set up to prevent their use by computer vandals.
This makes these computers a menace not only to their owners, but
to everybody else on the Internet. ``Just like driving on the
highway with bad brakes and bad exhaust, it impacts all of us,''
Pond says.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the impacts are bad, of course. Liability lawyers will
do fine. Say the FBI catches these vandals and finds that they used
an insecure computer at a big firm with deep pockets. Sounds like a
clear case of corporate negligence; either get ready for a nasty
lawsuit, or make the check out to cash.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing most of us aren't worth the trouble of a
lawsuit, because our home computers may be used in such an Internet
assault; indeed, it may already be happening.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people now have cable modems or DSL Internet
service, which means their computers are on the Internet round the
clock. And that means that any of these computers could be used in
a Yahoo-style attack. A vandal could use the Internet to secretly
install a hostile program on many home computers. Then with a typed
command, he can have these machines bury a major Web site in data
packets.
</P>
<P>
   How easy would it be to invade these home computers? Here's a
hint: Big companies hire experienced network security people to
fend off intruders. But in many homes, the family computer expert
still watches Saturday morning cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   So computer system crackers now hammer away at home machines
with high-speed Web links, hoping to subvert them. John Johnson of
Bell Atlantic, which sells home DSL service, says his firm monitors
data traffic in an effort to spot and block cracker activity, and
has other secret tricks up its sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a race in which we stay a step ahead
of the bad guys,'' says Johnson. But this week, it's the bad guys
who are winning. And some of you are helping them win, by leaving
your Internet computers connected but unprotected. How do you look
in orange?

HARVARD MULLS EASING ETHICS RULES IN MEDICAL RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School, long known for enforcing one of the
strictest conflict-of-interest policies among the nation's top
medical schools, may soon ease up on its conflict-of-interest rules
for researchers, giving them more leeway to profit from their work.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other schools, such as Stanford and Johns Hopkins,
Harvard allows no exceptions to its rules. Harvard researchers, for
example, are prohibited from devoting more than 20 percent of their
time to work outside of Harvard or holding more than $20,000 worth
of a company's stock for which they do research.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a decade without any substantial revisions to its
conflict-of-interest policy, Harvard officials are reviewing a
report by a committee of senior professors that seeks to boost
researchers' economic opportunities while ensuring they adhere to
the medical school's ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``By everyone's measure, we have the most conservative policy
around, and there has been concern among some members of the
faculty that our current policy has been inhibitory to recruiting
and maintaining faculty,'' said Dennis Kasper, executive dean for
academic programs at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal (in reviewing the policy) was to see if we are
extremely out of line with what is going on with our sister
universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School, which like most large institutions
counts its reputation among its greatest assets, is sluggish _ and
wary _ when it comes to change.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that Harvard is taking the long road in
revising its lengthy and legalistic conflict-of-interest policy.
The new guidelines, if they are accepted, won't take effect until
additional committees and administrators vet the professors'
proposal, which could take months, Kasper said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is something administrators say they do not want to let
go for too long. The arcane rules are being dusted off and reviewed
at a time when Internet companies' stock options are converting
many underpaid intellectuals into millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, medical schools throughout the country
confront ongoing ethical dilemmas as government research grants dry
up and professors rely more heavily on corporate money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conundrum now is one of trying to strike a balance between
the obvious benefits to society that come from the increased
infusion of funds from the corporate arena and maintaining the
traditional safeguards that have long protected the public's
interests,'' said Ruth Faden, director of the Bioethics Institute
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials want to make sure there is very little gray
area in their revised policy. Kasper said that any exceptions to
Harvard's new rules will be written into the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Though he would not reveal the details, he said the bedrock of
the proposed revisions ensure researchers do not hold enough stock
to affect a company's profits. Furthermore, he said, researchers
will only be allowed to invest in large companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still struggling with a few questions,'' Kasper said.
``I'm not sure what will come of the proposal. But the impetus is
to make sure our faculty has reasonable opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent ethics conference at Harvard Medical School,
professors from Harvard and MIT debated the merits of loosening
restrictions on researchers versus tightening controls on their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Those favoring further regulation cited the temptation to make
money; those against more rules argued for increasing incentives
and speeding scientists' research to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Ensuring that unscrupulous scientists don't tamper with results
for profit is not the only area of concern, professors said.
Harvard must also guard against becoming something of a research
and development branch of the major pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists spend more of their time doing short-term
``applied science'' for companies, they may get sidetracked from
``basic science,'' the long-term research that may not be
immediately remunerative but could lead to major discoveries,
professors said.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential pitfalls and abuses exist if the rules are
loosened, some said. They include an increasing need for secrecy of
research to protect corporate interests, which runs counter to
universities' tradition of working for the common good; misusing
students by employing them as poorly paid lab assistants instead of
as collaborators; and fueling public suspicion that research
findings are tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harvard's stringent rules disturb some professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line for me is if we make rules, instead of using
our judgment, we risk inhibiting the speed (of new technology) to
market,'' John Parrish, who heads Harvard Medical School's
Dermatology Department, said during the conference last month.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors doing research that involve people, however, should be
required to tell patients exactly what their stake is in the
experiment, Parrish said. He said physicians should say things
like: ``I stand to profit if you use this catheter.''
</P>
<P>
   For nonhuman research, it makes sense to let university
scientists and companies work together with only basic supervision
and minimal regulations, Parrish and other professors said.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is done at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Instead of detailing the ins and outs of researchers'
relationships with companies sponsoring their work, MIT
administrators tell their professors to avoid anything that could
be construed as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't try to plug every hole or try to be the IRS; we set a
general principle and it's: `You know what I meant,' '' said Lita
Nelson, director of the Technology Licensing Office at MIT.
``Conflict-of-interest rules don't prevent crooks from being
crooks. But they help honest people keep straight.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, of course, the spirit of the law is often open to
interpretation, and professors may stray from the public's view of
what is ``appropriate,'' while staying within their university's
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatry professor at Brown University, for example, has
earned more than $500,000 in consulting fees from pharmaceutical
companies whose drugs he touted in articles and lectures, though
Brown officials said he did not violate their policies.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University School of Medicine, officials did not mind
that one of their deans owns 1.4 million shares of a private
Internet company that the school plans to use to offer doctors
on-line versions of its medical courses.
</P>
<P>
   After studying Harvard's conflict-of-interest policy, Dr. Eugene
Braunwald, a Harvard professor who chaired the committee proposing
the revised guidelines, said that any new policy will have to
straddle competing interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answers aren't simple; it's not a case of everything
either is open, or everything is shut,'' Braunwald said. ``This is
something that changes. I imagine it's something we'll have to
change again by January 2005.''

ARCHIVISTS GRAPPLE WITH DIGITAL PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year is 2050. A scholar wants to research the biggest news
story of 2000: how Hillary Clinton, after losing her New York
Senate bid, replaced Regis Philbin as host of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the inevitable Whitewater jokes died down, the move proved
a masterstroke, perfectly positioning her to defeat President
George W. Bush's reelection bid. The biggest applause line in her
stump speech was, ``Say what you will about my ex-husband'' _ the
Clintons divorced in 2001 _ ``but he was a Rhodes scholar. Could
you imagine this guy getting even one question right on the show?''
</P>
<P>
   The story received endless coverage (who can ever forget the New
York Post headline, ``Hillary: Final Answer?''). Surely, the
biggest hurdle facing any scholar would be the need to sort through
so much information.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the biggest problem is one scholars and archivists
already confront. It's not an excess of access but the reverse. For
the wonderful world of digitized information and online everything
has a dark archival underbelly: The more sophisticated information
technology becomes, and the more readily accessible in the present,
the harder it is to preserve and the less accessible it becomes in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never faced the kind of issue we're facing now with this
tremendous explosion of material being kept in electronic format,''
says William Fowler Jr., director of the Massachusetts Historical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at logarithmic growth of the quantity of the
records we have to deal with in electronic form,'' says Ken
Thibodeau, director of the Electronic Records Archives Program at
the National Archives. ``And not only does it get bigger, but it
gets more complex all the time because people are doing things on a
foundation where you have software and hardware obsolescence on a
scale of 18 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the plight of that hypothetical chronicler of the roots
of the Rodham presidency (she reverted to her maiden name after the
divorce).
</P>
<P>
   The researcher would likely begin with ``Millionaire''
videotapes. Presumably, they'd have been digitized by then (that
is, their contents broken down into the binary code that computers
use). And a good thing, too, otherwise they'd almost certainly be
no longer usable. Depending on how carefully it's treated,
videotape can remain watchable for anywhere from five to 30 years.
Even if ``important'' tapes such as, say, Clinton's debut, had been
duplicated, that still presents problems, for with each duplication
tape quality diminishes.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a problem with digitized information, of course. No,
with digital information the researcher would have to deal with
different problems. He or she could download old episodes from the
Web or (more likely) access it on disc, either CD-ROM or DVD. This
would seem an ideal solution: everything nice and clean and easily
retrievable.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, as Scientific American noted in 1995, ``It is only
slightly facetious to say that digital information lasts forever _
or five years, whichever comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a problem with tape, you can splice it. True, you
lose a snippet of information, but everything else remains. With a
digital format, once something within a file or document is
corrupted, the whole thing is gone. But even if the data retain
their integrity, you still have to be able to get to them. This is
not as simple as it sounds. Just because data in a given format can
be accessed now doesn't guarantee they can be accessed in that
format 50 _ or even five _ years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got an 8-inch floppy disc with material on it,''
says Dave MacCarn, chief technologist at WGBH in Boston, ``you'd be
hard-pressed to get that material back. Similar issues have
happened with government agencies, like NASA, which collected
9-track data tapes from the original satellite telemetries in the
'50s. The fact is nobody's kept a record of how you read those
materials. You can get the data off the tape, but nobody ever told
them what form the data were in so they don't know what the bits
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, 8-inch floppy discs and punch cards and UNIVAC tape
drives look ridiculous to us now _ who could ever imagine using
such things? _ but they were once state of the art. Who's to say
that CD-ROMs _ the likeliest means of archiving contemporary press
accounts _ will be used 50 years from now? And even if they are,
they will surely be read on hardware much different from that used
now.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the simple question of durability: 3M Corp.
estimates that with ``moderate'' care a CD-ROM can be expected to
last a hundred years. Not only is this far less than the life
expectancy of acid-free paper _ 300 to 500 years _ it's only an
estimate. The technology simply hasn't been around long enough for
anyone to know for certain.
</P>
<P>
   The history of e-mail illustrates the question of technological
change versus archival permanence. The first message was sent in
1964, either from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cambridge University, or the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now
Carnegie-Mellon University). No one knows which because no one then
knew how to save it _ or even realized it was worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed: Next January, Thibodeau notes, the
National Archives is to receive electronic files containing an
estimated 10 million e-mails from the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management issues with electronic objects are not
radically different from paper objects _ except that they change
very rapidly,'' says Jim Coleman, projects manager with Harvard's
Library Digital Initiative. ``This is very different from paper,
which just sits on the shelf. In the electronic realm, we know that
operating systems change. We know that file formats change. We know
that the way things are delivered changes. There's something
inherently ephemeral about the whole electronic object. It's not
substantiated except insofar as it is rendered on a device.''
</P>
<P>
   For archivists, this means significant expenditures of both time
and money. Howard B. Gotlieb, director of special collections at
Boston University, recalls his surprise at receiving a floppy disc
from the late novelist Richard Condon, all of whose previous
donations had been in manuscript or typescript. Gotlieb could see
the handwriting on the digital wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to purchase equipment we did not have, which is
an added expense for any repository,'' he says. ``We'll have to
make hard copy, paper copy, for everything on a disc.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of changing the medium on which data appear is known
as ``migration.'' Printing out a disc or file is the most
rudimentary example. More often, it takes the form of a
technological upgrade: digitizing videotape say, or putting the
contents of a disc onto a CD-ROM. The process is at once expensive,
time-consuming, and often unsatisfactory, if only because the new
format may not reproduce all the characteristics of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most archivists consider it preferable to ``emulation,''
the other leading response to information-technology obsolescence.
Emulation is, in effect, an act of faith; further down the road,
proponents say, the specifications necessary for accessing data in
a certain format can be emulated in new software, hardware, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, these issues have drawn little interest from the
computer industry. This comes as no surprise. Archivists
concentrate on continuity, emphasize the past, and ignore the
bottom line. High-tech executives work in a business based on
rapid, discontinuous change, oriented toward the future, and
dedicated to profit. For them, creating technological obsolescence
is a sign they're doing their jobs rather than cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two or three years, Thibodeau says, the industry has
begun to show an interest in the archivists' problems, which makes
him feel ``cautious optimism'' for the future. ``We're now finding
vendors coming to us,'' he says. What he finds most encouraging is
that ``the product that's being recommended to us, by and large, is
not technology for archives. It's the technology for e-commerce and
e-government, the next-generation Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   As it's recognized that the information-retrieval needs of
Amazon.com, say, or the Social Security Administration, can
resemble those of large archives, there's an increasing likelihood
the marketplace will address (if not solve) the problems it has
helped create.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, which is what archivists look at,'' says
Margaret L. Hedstrom, an associate professor at the University of
Michigan's School of Information, ``we could anticipate that the
costs will go down: storage is getting cheaper, systems are getting
better faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the sorts of economies of scale that the National
Archives might share with the leading dot.coms don't necessarily
extend to the Massachusetts Historical Society, for example, or any
but the very largest university research libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely that much of what we're producing in electronic
fashion is going to disappear,'' says Fowler, the society's
director. ``That creates a problem for the historian or anyone who
wants to recreate a particular time in history: no documents, no
history. That's a major issue which we're all trying to grapple
with now. We're at the very edge of it. It's unknown territory.''

YOU CAN THAW OUT THOSE FROZEN PIPES WITH HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chances of hell freezing over are much less than those of
your pipes freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Because it can happen with pipes, it will, and several denizens
of New England discovered that last month when the cold finally
came to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Why in the world do water pipes freze? After all, they are in
the house, mostly, and the house is heated, mostly. It doesn't make
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Before we try to make sense of it all, we have to thaw out those
fozen pipes and hope they have not burst. If a pipe freezes along a
straight run, it may not have burst because the water, which
expands as it freezes, expanded along the pipe's length rather than
sideways, right out the pipe. So, when it thaws, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem occurs when the water freezes at a corner or
right-angle joint; when that happens, a burst is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   So, how to thaw a frozen pipe? There are many ways: get heat to
it, if it is accessible. And, when heating a pipe, open the faucet
that it serves, and aim the heat at the frozen spot nearest the
faucet. That way the melted ice will go out the faucet. If you thaw
ice further down the pipe, you could cause a burst by trying to
force the water against the frozen part. Also, enough heat could
create steam that would be a disaster in pipe frozen at each end.
</P>
<P>
   Aim a hair dryer on the suspected area, working it up and down
the pipe ever so slowly. Sometimes you can pour boiling water on a
cloth wrapped around the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement, hang a 100-watt trouble light (a caged bulb at
the end of a cord) on the pipe. Trouble lights have a hook you can
hang right on the pipe, keeping the hot bulb away from flammable
objects. This is a slow process, but if it works, you can leave the
light in place, preventing future freeze-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap a heating pad around the pipe or simply hang it on the
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   If pipes freeze under the vanity, simply open the doors and wait
for the thaw.
</P>
<P>
   What to do with pipes that are inaccessible, in an outside wall,
where they are most likely to freeze? Place one or more floodlights
as close as practicable to the wall where the pipe is. There is
enough heat in those floodlights to go right through the wall. An
electric heater will work, too, placed carefully, not too close to
the wall, where it will not fall. If your electric heater starts to
bubble the paint, you know it is too close.
</P>
<P>
   If the pipe squirts water when it thaws out, turn the water off
and yell for help, from a plumber.
</P>
<P>
   These are the trouble-shooting ways to thaw out a pipe. How
about preventatives; ways to prevent future freeze-ups?
</P>
<P>
   Pipes should not freeze in a basement because it rarely goes
below 40 degrees, even on bitter cold days. That is true, but it
depends on where the pipes are located. Pipes should be located as
far away from the stone or concrete foundation as possible. Stone
and masonry are heat sinks; that is, they absorb the cold and hold
it, affecting pipes near them.
</P>
<P>
   So, if possible, relocate pipes so they are at least one foot
from the foundation. Or course, you can't help it when a pipe goes
up into an outside wall on its way to the first and second floors.
</P>
<P>
   Insulate all pipes, domestic and heating. In most cases, the
standard foam tubes will do, but be sure to cover the full length
of the pipe, and at joints and corners; anywhere you see a pipe,
insulate it.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure all joints are covered. And, tape all seams with duct
tape, both the seams where the tubes meet, and also the full length
of the tube covering the slit.
</P>
<P>
   Insulating pipes will not only help prevent freezing, but with
heating pipes, keep the water warm, not losing heat to the chilly
basement before the water has a chance to enter the radiators,
where it belongs, and where it should be hot.
</P>
<P>
   The insulation will also prevent condensation of moisture in
summer; moisture usually condenses first on chilly pipes.
</P>
<P>
   We have covered all bases except one: where pipes are in the
outside walls.
</P>
<P>
   They freeze because they are in an uninsulated wall, or the
insulation was installed after the house was built, so there might
not be complete coverage.
</P>
<P>
   They freeze because they are on the outside of that wall cavity,
and any insulation in the cavity is behind the pipes, leaving them
unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   The cure is more complicated than others. You have to break into
the wall, but not necessarily take it all down.
</P>
<P>
   Locate the space where the pipes are, and cut an opening at the
top and bottom, so warm, house air can circulate in the cavity,
keeping the pipes a bit warmer.
</P>
<P>
   If that cavity is uninsulated, install insulation, making sure
the insulation is on the outside of the pipes. If the pipes are on
the far side of the cavity, it is going to be difficult to insert
insulation. So, insulate the pipes themselves with standard foam
tubes, then add insulation to the cavity.
</P>
<P>
   All this may not seem important on the 4th of July, but it sure
is important now.

CUSTO BARCELONA MAKES AN IMPRINT WITH THE ART OF THE T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With fashion week in full swing, more than 100
designers from around the world are unveiling their fall
collections. Some, like Donna Karan, have gone all out to create
head-to-toe wardrobes for men and women. Custo Dalmau, on the other
hand, is taking a simpler approach. He's marketing T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on only one thing,'' he says, proudly. ``That's
why we are doing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dalmau, 42, with his brother and business partner David,
39, has created a cult following of his T-shirt brand, Custo
Barcelona. Their colorful, eclectic women's shirts have appeared on
such shows as ``Friends,'' ``Spin City,'' and ``Sex in the City.''
They've been featured in InStyle magazine. And celebrities like
Julia Roberts have been seen in them (the actress wore one in
``Runaway Bride'').
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, this narrowly focused Barcelona-based design house
posted an impressive $45 million in T-shirt sales in 40 countries,
including the United States, Korea, Australia, and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very exciting shirts to wear,'' says Marjorie Muroff
of Newton, who owns 10 of them. ``They're like a Picasso of shirts.
They're works of art that you have to look at. They're beautiful
and each one is so different.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how different are these shirts? Picture an Asian landscape
in which a woman is emerging from Mount Fuji with stylized Japanese
letters running alongside; the back of the T-shirt is embellished
with green sequins. Another shirt depicts a Mexican river scene
with gondoliers guiding fruit-laden boats; the back panel sports a
crocheted Aztec print. A third shows an urban cowgirl striding with
attitude on the streets of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Multiculturalism is the unifying theme. The company also
integrates fabrics, symbols, and characters from various cultures
into the same top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is a reflection of society, and society every day is
much more multicultural,'' says Dalmau. ``No longer is anything in
one color. Everything is mixed. That's why we decided to mix
different materials and different icons and different cultures into
one garment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell the same printed T-shirt to a woman of 15 years and to
a woman of 60 years. . . . I think we've developed a kind of
universal product that fits into (the tastes) of many different
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not every shopper can afford a Custo Barcelona
creation. The shirts (in long-sleeved and short-sleeved variations)
cost about $65 to $75 each. What's more, their snug fit _ designed
to show off curves _ isn't for every figure.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Livingston, 34, of Brookline owns three Custos and wears
them under blazers. ``I did think they were pricey,'' she says,
``But what I like is getting something different. . . . Every time
I wear them, people say, `I love your shirt.' . . . It's worth the
$65.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalmau brothers didn't grow up in the fashion business;
their parents (now retired) owned a construction company. In 1979,
Custo was studying to become an architect at a Barcelona university
while his brother was studying art and history. On the side, the
two operated an unsuccessful company called Davitti for two years,
selling motorcycle accessories such as gloves, scarves, and leather
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Restless, the duo shut down their business, took a two-year
leave from school, and traveled parts of the world by motorcycle.
During a trip through Southern California, the brothers became
fascinated with surfing culture and its popular T-shirts laced with
such icons as waves and boards. ``It was the first time I saw
printed T-shirts for surfing,'' Dalmau recalls. ``Surfing in Spain
is a very small thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, the Dalmaus quit school permanently in 1981 to
introduce the same concept back home in Barcelona. They called
their company Custo Barcelona, since their last venture had been
named after David. ``In the beginning, we weren't attracted to
fashion at all,'' says Custo Dalmau. ``We were attracted to
surfing. . . . Because the (shirts) were important to the surfing
lifestyle, we learned about the technology of printing and
graphics. In Barcelona, there was a big textile industry 20 years
ago, so we were able to (get training).''
</P>
<P>
   Working out of a small office, the brothers combined their
skills (Custo's architectural drawing abilities and David's
understanding of color) to create distinctive surfing T-shirts for
men. They sold these at specialty stores throughout Europe with
moderate success. ``This was a very exotic product in Spain and
Europe,'' Custo Dalmau says. ``It was something very new.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky. From day one, everybody bought our shirts, and
we grew very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Custo Barcelona expanded its line to include a small
collection of women's T-shirts and bathing suits. In 1996, with
sales of just $5 million, the brothers decided to drop their men's
line, focus exclusively on women, and abandon their surfing theme
in favor of something more au courant: multiculturalism. After 15
years, the company also decided it was time to pursue the US
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, fashion in America and many places was (focused
on) the big trend of minimalism,'' Dalmau says. ``Our proposal was
cross-current. Many people didn't understand it. But we understood
that the American people are very open and are always looking for
something new. I think women were a little bit tired of so many
grays and blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalmau devoted 1996 to traveling across the States to pitch his
product. He visited retailers, fashion editors, and Hollywood
stylists, and appeared at trade shows. His efforts paid off. Custo
Barcelona designs are now sold in Saks Fifth Avenue and 300
specialty stores across the United States, including Jasmine and
Sharon Samuels in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are careful about where we sell,'' says Dalmau. ``Our
policy is not to market the product too much.'' Instead, the
company has found word-of-mouth to be a powerful advertising tool.
</P>
<P>
   Like most design houses with a successful concept, Custo
Barcelona is faced with plenty of copycat competition. Knockoffs
can be found these days at almost any mall. ``We have big problems
everywhere, around the world,'' Dalmau concedes. ``We're not very
happy to see that . . . but we are working hard every season to
renew and refresh the concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall collection unveiled here Wednesday may certainly put
Custo Barcelona ahead of the curve. For the first time, the company
is introducing pants and skirts. Multicolored loose-fitting pants
drape low around the hips and are made of such materials as velour
and nylon. Colorful straight skirts feature mix-and-match fabrics,
such as crochet, cut velvet, and synthetic fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The designers also introduced a limited men's T-shirt line
Wednesday, which has only been sold in Europe. Like the women's
line, these shirts depict a wide range of images: one features a
Pegasus on the front and mermaids on the back; another shows a
turbaned man with a llama on the front while the back displays a
thatched hut and a mule.
</P>
<P>
   David Dalmau didn't come to New York because he was busy hosting
a show in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The slender, 5-foot-8 Custo Dalmau, who speaks four languages,
says the collection reflects the brothers' many years of traveling.
``You can see so many different influences in it. . . . We have
factories in Europe, Asia, and South America, so we travel all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get new ideas from the street,'' he adds, ``from sitting in
a park in a chair or by walking through a market in South America.
We don't follow closely the fashion trends. The most important
thing is to have your eyes open all the time.''

BARKTV.COM: WILL THE VIEWERS BITE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   See the dexterous dachshund compete in the canine dance contest.
Watch the display of derring-do in the dog agility demonstration.
Run, Spot, run. Heel, Fido, heel. How about a nice big ``Woof'' for
the audience at home?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to BarkTV.com, where it's all bark, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? The Canary Network? Well, maybe. As silly as it
sounds, BarkTV represents the latest experiment in entertainment
over the Internet. It's one of more than 30 ``channels'' offered by
an Internet operation called Medium4.com, a New York-based company
that targets specialized on-line videos for extremely narrow
audiences. You're into blue uniforms? There's a channel devoted to
world police. Got a Freudian fetish for trains? Tune into
RailwayTV.com. Former CNN war correspondent Peter Arnett conducts
celebrity interviews on ForeignTV.com, while Dr. Ruth talks about
the usual on WorldLifestyle.com.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be clear: Most of this isn't exactly riveting fare, unless
your definition of high drama is watching footage of the Grand
Canyon on WildernessTV.com. But some folks are convinced that this
kind of programming is the wave of the future. Each channel caters
to a tiny slice of the population, such as, say, the group devoted
to old Hercules movies. There might not be enough viewers to
justify BarkTV in any given geographic area, but the global reach
of the Internet makes it possible for this kind of programming,
called narrowcasting, to attract an adequate audience. And the
videos are available on demand, 24-7. No more wrestling with the
recording controls on the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   But dogs jumping through hoops? All the convenience in the world
isn't going to get folks to watch if the programming is, well, for
the dogs. ``We're still in an experimental stage, and not every
channel will be successful,'' says Jonathan Braun, Medium4.com's
CEO. ``It's a big, simple idea, like the cable television model. I
remember when everyone ridiculded Ted Turner and CNN. They said,
`Who needs 24-hour news?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett, for one, remembers those days himself; his action
reporting during the Gulf War helped establish the network's
credibility. He was recruited to conduct interviews for ForeignTV
last year when he left CNN following his role in the network's
botched 1998 ``Tailwind'' report. So far, the war correspondent
known for hanging out hotel windows during bombing campaigns has
conducted soft interviews for ForeignTV. He's chatted with Jordan's
Queen Noor about her late husband, King Hussein, and queried Nobel
laureate and former Costa Rican president Oscar Arias about his
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting all my faith in the Internet now,'' says Arnett,
who claims he doesn't miss action reporting, since he is channeling
his creative energy into a book project, the authorized history of
CNN. He points out that he joined ForeignTV before the company
added all the other channels. ``They didn't have BarkTV when I
started,'' he says, laughing. ``But I'm not barking up the wrong
tree. I'm constantly amused and surprised by what they come up
with.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is cutting deals with television programmers all
over the world to rebroadcast their shows over the Internet; its
current offerings include official state-sanctioned news shows (in
English) from such countries as China, Turkey, and Algeria. Right
now, the programming runs the gamut from polished propaganda to
funky world music videos to amateur home movies.
</P>
<P>
   Braun doesn't claim to be targeting an audience of experts for
any of the channels. ``I don't want the art history professor,'' he
says. ``We're looking for that 15-year-old girl who went to the
museum and discovered the Impressionists and dreams of visiting
Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the world is your living room. And for all the antics of
BarkTV, some of the channels are offering programs that you can't
find anywhere else on any medium. The world music channel, for
instance, features a solid stable of artists, ranging from the
mainstream (Ireland's The Chieftains) to the esoteric (The Three
Mustafas, from the mythical Balkan town of Szegerely).
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Dr. Ruth, who has been assigned to wander
around the world with a Web cam and conduct interviews at her whim.
In one video, she is carried ashore to the island of Papua New
Guinea, where she queries the locals about sexual taboos and
traditions. ``I carry the little camera with me,'' she says. ``I'm
not a mechanical genius but I know how to get people to talk.''
Like Arnett, she swears by the medium, except the good doctor has
one little problem. ``At the age of 71, I am not
computer-literate,'' she confesses. ``Tell one of the companies to
hurry up and get a computer who can understand my accent.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   You know it's a strange day when administrators at august arts
institutions start sounding like public relations officials from
Internet startups. But that's exactly what happened early this week
when the Dallas Symphony Orchestra announced a new Internet
initiative, touting its ``cutting-edge Web site.'' Music director
Andrew Litton offered fighting words to other orchestras: ``Watch
out, or you'll soon be eating our dust in the world's cyber
superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra's new Web site doesn't look all that different
from the sites of other nonprofit arts groups, with one notable
exception. This year, the Dallas symphony will Webcast (audio only)
15 of its concerts live on the Internet, beginning Feb. 13. Other
groups, including the New York Philharmonic and the Handel and
Haydn Society, have experimented with Webcasting in one form or
another, but Dallas is making a bigger commitment to the
technology. It also has an extensive education site to go along
with the first Webcast.
</P>
<P>
   So what are other orchestras doing? The Chicago Symphony
Orchestra is reportedly working on an ambitious initiative that
would establish a sort of orchestral music portal; the New York
Philharmonic has an impressive education site for children. So far,
the Boston Symphony Orchestra's site has been an effective
marketing tool; in fiscal year 1999, the BSO sold more $1 million
worth of tickets on line. The orchestra plans to redesign its site
soon. ``It needs work; the navigation is counterintuitve,'' says
BSO executive director Mark Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   But Volpe doesn't exactly expect to be eating any cyber dust any
time soon. ``Getting there early on the Web does matter, but having
well-known brands helps, too,'' he says. ``If the orchestra in Eli,
Minn. decides to do some fabulous site, it won't matter if the
Bombay or Tokyo haven't heard of it but they have heard of
Minnesota. But they have heard of the BSO.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The aspiring presidents have left New Hampshire and headed south
to warmer climes. But don't worry. They'll be back this way for the
Massachusetts primary next month. If you're still undecided, check
out www.selectsmart.com, a site that matches you up with a
candidate after you answer questions about issues. It also has a
quiz to help you select the right pet for your lifestyle; hmm,
wonder if they've heard about this at BarkTV?

 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The new head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers has a
house on Route 40 in Westford and his wife teaches third grade in
Billerica.
</P>
<P>
   The new head coach of the LA Clippers delivered the Lowell Sun,
grew up worshipping the Celtics, and played four years of college
ball at mighty Fitchburg State.
</P>
<P>
   The new head coach of the Clips won a state high school title at
Notre Dame of Fitchburg, but made a name for himself while coaching
golf and basketball at Salem State for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Jim Todd, the NBA's Massachusetts Everyman, who now shares
office space in the Staples Center with Phil Jackson, the coach of
the other NBA team in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most unlikely of stories. A week ago, Todd was feeling
pretty fortunate just to be an assistant coach in the world's
greatest basketball league. He went out for a jog last Thursday and
when he got back to his rented LA house, his roommate, Chris Ford,
said, ``Elgin's in the living room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elgin'' is Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor, one of the
best players in NBA lore. Baylor dropped by the house to fire Ford
and hire Todd. Full House. Empty House. All in the same day.
</P>
<P>
   It was an awkward moment. If not for Ford, Todd would still be
at Salem State, designing plays to beat Westfield State and
UMass-Dartmouth. Ford is the coach who invited Todd into the world
of the NBA and it was Ford's demise that put Todd on the sideline
against Dallas's Don Nelson last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Todd said, ``I told Chris that I wouldn't take the job if he
didn't want me to take it, but he said, `No, I want to you take it.
This is what the business is about.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Todd took the job and now _ after a lifetime of matching wits
with Charlie Titus, Togo Palazzi, John Fahey, Bob Catalini, and all
the other high school and small college coaching legends of New
England's main streets and backroads _ Todd is going one-on-one
with Jackson, Pat Riley, and Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   It's been an improbable climb. A 6-foot-5-inch forward, Todd
played four years for Ed James before graduating from Billerica
High in 1970. Then it was on to Fitchburg State, where he teamed
with North Middlesex High School shooter Mickey Lorden. Todd lived
off campus with 12 other guys, most of them basketball players.
Todd still remembers the Fitchburg gym:
</P>
<P>
   ``If was like those YMCAs where you have to put your foot on the
wall to inbound the ball. I remember trying to save a ball from
going out of bounds one time. I dove and saved the ball, then the
wall came up and hit me in the face and I got stitches in my
eyebrow. Westfield. Curry. Framingham. That's what those gyms were
like.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he coaches at the Staples Center, where luxury boxes
rent for $300,000. (``I'm on the waiting list,'' joked Todd.)
</P>
<P>
   After coaching and assisting at Notre Dame High, Fitchburg
State, Columbia, Marist, and Manhattan, he settled in Salem, where
he thought he'd work forever until he met Ford at Wayne Embry's
camp in Nashua, N.H. They became friends and when Ford was hired to
coach the Milwaukee Bucks, he brought Todd into the NBA. Last
Thursday, the student replaced the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   His first game was against Nelson and the Mavericks last
Saturday night. As always, Todd wore workout stuff two hours before
the game and spent time on the court instructing players. He saw
Nelson and Bob Lanier sitting on the sideline and went over to say
hello.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson shook hands, then said, ``We're wondering who we're
supposed to be congratulating around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd said, ``That would be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuckling as he recounted the story, Todd said, ``They had no
idea. I guess I haven't made it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clips were 11-34 when Todd was hired. They lost their first
two games (to Dallas and Chicago) under the new regime and were to
play the mighty Trail Blazers in Portland Thursday. Friday its
Vancouver and maybe a chance for a win. Todd wants the Clippers
taking 100 shots a game. He plans to utilize his entire bench with
an up-tempo game.
</P>
<P>
   He made all Celtics fans happy when he rescued Dennis Johnson
from the CBA and made him an assistant coach. The move resurrected
DJ's NBA career and no doubt will fuel rumors that Johnson could be
the Clippers' next head coach if the team fails to respond to Todd.
</P>
<P>
   Nets coach Don Casey, who coached the Clippers and knows
everybody in the businesss, said, ``I wish the kid luck, but that
place is a graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd said, ``We're young and athletic. People ask, `What are you
going to do different?' When you have a chance to run something,
you put your own philosophy on it, your own mark. I coached two
games in December when Chris hurt his back and we won both. We're
trying to build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Clippers owner Donald Sterling will bring him back for
another go next season. Maybe not. Either way, Todd will be back in
Westford after the season, cutting his grass on his John Deere
tractor, hanging out at the Cape with Groton-Dunstable coach
Catalini. But for now, Everyman has made it to the top of the NBA.

EARTH TO LUCAS: A MORE DIVERSE `STAR WARS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to avoid the complaints about racial stereotyping
that greeted ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' last
summer, series creator George Lucas is apparently planning to give
the next film, which is scheduled to be released in 2002, a more
ethnically diverse cast.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like the concept of diversity's
subtler points has quite been grasped up at Skywalker Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   According to the entertainment trade paper Variety, Lucasfilm's
casting director, Robin Gurland, has asked several Hollywood
agencies to look for actors who can fill such new, proposed roles
as a spiritual American Indian and an Asian who might be good at
martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   Beats Jar Jar Binks' Stepin Fetchit act in ``Episode I,'' that's
for sure. But aren't those roles a wee bit familiar from dozens of
revisionist westerns and hundreds of kung fu movies?
</P>
<P>
   If Lucas, who reportedly is still writing the script, really
wants to avoid stereotyping, maybe he should leave his cloistered,
high-tech ranch more often and check out what people are like in
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, George, about bringing Jar Jar back ... &QL;

BMW X5: THE SUPREME SUV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I crunched it through snow, put it into deliberate spins on
hockey rink-caliber ice, pushed it pedal-to-the-metal from stop to
60 miles per hour, and did rapid, abrupt lane changes at highway
speed.
</P>
<P>
   I was looking for a flaw: a skid that could not be corrected, a
disconcerting lean of auto and driver so common and dangerous on
many SUVs when they do quick maneuvers at high speed, a lack of
power in a vehicle that weighs in at nearly 2 1/2 tons. Forget
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the BMW X5 reigns as the Swiss Army Knife of SUVs: a
high-performance car on the highway, a bull in snow (and, I assume,
mud and sand), and a delicately controlled auto even on the
slickest ice. Pick your blade, carve your task.
</P>
<P>
   Why then did I emerge from my first day of driving a vehicle
that truly impressed me asking the simple question, ``why?'' _ as
in, why would the maker of such fine sedans and sports cars need to
build an SUV (they call it a Sports Activity Vehicle but I'm not
going to quibble over a vowel)?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, in an automobile market where SUV sales are
booming, you need to build one if you want to be a player. To be
sure, BMW hopes to land new buyers for the product line, but as
David J. Buchko, BMW's product information specialist readily
acknowledges, a lot of BMW owners have SUVs as second vehicles in
their household fleets and, until now, none of the latter were
BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freude am Fahren'' is the BMW lingo these days and before you
conjure up images of bearded shrinks and leather couches, know that
the phrase means, ``Joy in Driving.'' And know, too, that many,
many drivers are looking for their joy from the high perch of
luxurious SUVs that perform on the highway, haul people and gear,
and can handle bad roads and bad weather. Buchko says BMW simply
does not want to be left out of a market undergoing ``a very clear
separation'' between old-style, truck-based SUVs and newer, more
luxurious variants. Hey, even Porsche has one in the works.
</P>
<P>
   There's your why.
</P>
<P>
   Here's your how: BMW took unibody construction, coupled it with
a welded-up chassis, and produced a rigid rig that, outfitted with
high-tech suspension, gives a luxury sedan-like ride on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, they gave it the distinctive kidney-grilled BMW nose
and sent the rest of the profile sloping up, back, and away from
there. If I have one complaint with this auto, it is that is just
does not look that distinctive from, say, the Mercedes or Lexus
SUVs. My cleaning lady and the woman who sells me my papers every
morning both asked if it was some kind of new van.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you've got BMW _ think 5 and 7 series quality _ all the
way. Beautifully stitched, firm leather buckets are up front, a
rear bench that folds down 60/40 and seats three comfortably, with
plenty of leg and head room, is in back. A power tilting and
telescoping steering column; heated, leather-wrapped steering
wheel; power controls on dash, console, and steering wheel, and,
for nighttime, that fiery orange glow from the instrumentation that
bathes you in BMW aura appoint the interior.
</P>
<P>
   It's powered by a DOHC 32-valve V8 that pounds out 282
horsepower and a whopping 324 lb.-ft. of torque. The engine emits a
powerful basso rumble and you can't tell me BMW didn't purposely
leave out some insulating qualities just so the driver can feel and
hear that sound.
</P>
<P>
   It propels the car from 0-60 in 7.5 seconds and in the sportier
model lets it run at 143 miles per hour. It got just over 16 miles
per gallon in a week of commuting, testing in ice and snow, and
short trips around town.
</P>
<P>
   The X5 is full-time all-wheel drive with a planetary center
differential that splits the torque about 60-40, front to rear.
This virtually eliminates any hint of torque steer and, coupled
with the near-perfect front-to-rear weight balance, lets you feel
what your wheels are doing in a way not always common to all-wheel
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed Steptronic (manual option) transmission handled
all the torque smoothly. And smooth is a word that applies to much
about this vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The standard suspension is classic BMW engineering (again think
5 and 7 series): up front it features struts, double pivot lower
arms, twin-tube gas shocks, and an anti-roll bar; in the rear, you
get four-link integral suspension with upper later arms,
self-leveling air springs, and twin gas shocks.
</P>
<P>
   ABS with dynamic brake control brings it to straight, sure
stops. And the brake system plays a key role in other
handling/safety features as well. The X5 has All-season Traction
Control, which modulates engine torque and applies individual wheel
brakes to prevent sustained slippage.
</P>
<P>
   The ABS and ATC features unite again in the Dynamic Stability
Control system, which monitors sensors to watch wheel speed, the
turning of the steering wheel, how hard the vehicle is cornering,
yaw, brake pedal pressure, and how hard the X5 is accelerating or
stopping. If it senses the X5 straying from its proper course in a
turn, it uses braking to individual wheels to get it back on
course.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is great, of course, for highways, but a powerful
help as well should you go off-roading with the X5 (somebody will,
right?). For off-roading, it adds Hill Descent Control, which runs
the brakes for you and keeps the X5 creeping down steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features include 2-stage front-impact airbags, head
protection system, and side-impact bags for the front seat. The
latter are an option for the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo space is wide and deep, but not long, though the
two-piece tailgate _ top goes up, bottom goes down _ makes access
very easy.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The split 60/40 rear seat, which can be moved ahead, using
power, on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --It takes a gorilla to remove the sun visor from its clip so
the visor can be moved to the driver's side-window.

WINTER IS NO THREAT TO THESE VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There it was, glistening in the Saturday sun: a stretch of ice
about 1,000 feet long and 150 feet wide, rutted in places,
Zamboni-smooth in others, a small hill in the middle, and about 6
inches of crusty snow running along one side. Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Our mission this day in East Taunton was to test drive about 25
cars, SUVs, and trucks and, at the end of the day, name the New
England Motor Press Association's Best Winter Vehicles for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The testing came at an auspicious time for me. Not long after
our first big snowfall a couple of weeks back, I was hit with a
steady stream of mail and e-mail asking a common question: What's a
good car for winter?
</P>
<P>
   It used to be the choices were limited to some kind of truck or
Jeep with four-wheel drive. Used to be. Now, it's a tougher
question because you can get everything from a midget SUV to a van
to high-performance sports cars and sedans that do just fine when
the going gets deep or slick.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't take many of the vehicles I drove out onto nearby Route
44, which was dry and heavy with traffic. I figured I'd put the
cars through their tests right there on the ice and in the snow. I
did a series of tests with each: braking on ice, pushing through
snow, starting from a stop midway up the icy hill, and putting each
vehicle into a deliberate spin that could turn into several spins.
</P>
<P>
   I'll get the braking out of the way in short order: ABS is
amazing. Every ABS-equipped vehicle, rolling down the ice at about
25 miles per hour, came to a straight, controlled stop when I
jammed the brakes and held them. I even (do not try this yourself)
took my hands off the wheel each time I hit the brakes and let the
vehicle go where the brakes would take it _ which was straight
ahead. Hard to pick a favorite when it comes to braking.
</P>
<P>
   But in other tests, certain vehicles were quite impressive. My
favorites (you get the New England Motor Press list at the end of
this column):
</P>
<P>
   BMW X5 _ This is a high-performance highway machine (155 m.p.h.
top end) that is also an SUV. You read that right. It rolled
through the snow as if it weren't there. On the uphill ice test,
its traction-control system was superb and no slippage occurred as
it rolled to an easy start. In the spin-out test, countersteering
and a gentle nudge of the gas pulled it right back onto the
intended line.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo V70 XC station wagon _ This may be the perfect New England
winter car. Snow doesn't bother it. On the hill test, you could
feel power transfer from wheel to wheel almost like it was walking
its way up the hill. Its stability system is so good it was hard to
get it into a full spin and very easy to escape it once induced.
And this is one comfortable, utilitarian automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Saab 9-5 station wagon _ Another fine car, using front-wheel
drive and a ``Winter'' setting that provides power carefully to the
front wheels so they don't slip going up hill. It creeps, in fact.
Good through the snow, a bit easier to put into a spin than the
Volvo, but pulls itself out equally well.
</P>
<P>
   Audi A-8 Quattro _ This is a high-performance sedan. It is also
an all-wheel-drive luxury car whose limits in snow are those
imposed only because it sits low like a sedan should. On ice, it
had to be pushed to spin and pulled itself out of the spin like a
string drawn taught. The icy hill was no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Tundra _ A V8 pickup with an empty bed is not usually the
best of snow machines. It did fine in the snow, though, and even on
the ice, while it was not as sure-footed as some of the others, its
four-wheel-drive system pulled it up the hill with ease. It was a
bit more skittish in the spin test _ it took a couple of
countersteers to get it back in line _ but it's a pickup truck with
no weight in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Land Cruiser _ This one's rugged, heavy, plush _ and very
nimble. It crunched through the snow, crept up the icy hill with
nary a spinning wheel, and though its top-heavy weight let it enter
a spin with not a lot of effort, it was easily corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru Legacy GT Limited _ Maybe the most surprising car of the
day, this is a fine, near-luxurious sedan. All-wheel-drive system
was right there on a par with the Audi, and you could buy two of
these for what the Audi cost and have money left over.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru Outback _ Super car. I remember when Subaru wagons were
cheap tin boxes with idiosyncratic timing belts. No more. The
Outback, all wheels driving, handled the snow effortlessly, crept
up the icy hill with ease, fought right back as I tried to get it
into a spin and, even after I won that battle, was easily put back
on course.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep Wrangler _ Top-heavy, short, stiff yet bouncy, the Jeep did
far better in the tests than I thought it would. It did go into a
spin more easily than the others, but a couple of countersteers and
judicious use of the gas got it straightened out. A bit of slip on
the hill test, but once rolling, it crawled right on up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here's how the wheeled wags and oily wretches of the New
England Motor Press Association voted at day's end:

FOR THE LOVE OF VINTAGE CHOCOLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, a Gallup poll conducted in Britain revealed
that more women would prefer to give up sex than give up chocolate.
So, as Valentine's Day draws nigh, let us keep in mind that love
comes and goes, but chocolate endures. Plus, it's good for you, in
moderation. Chocolate, that is. Love is good for you too, of
course, but chocolate is often easier to come by, and a lot less
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you go in for the vintage stuff. Yes, vintage chocolate,
and varietal chocolate, too. It had to happen. Wine. Coffee. Now
chocolate. Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate, according to the ream of
promotional material sent by the company, is the only cocoa grower
in the United States, and the manufacturer of ``the only
Vintage/Varietal chocolate in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The vintages, the material continues, ``were born as a result of
the union between our unique cocoa genetics and Hawaii's magical
environment. . .which creates specific taste qualities, similar to
fine wines known by their various nomenclatures.''
</P>
<P>
   If this information is anything to go by, chocolate snobbery
appears to share a similar vocabulary with wine and coffee
snobbery: ``. . . smooth unveiling of silky textures and bouquets .
. . the color strong and appealing . . . the aroma familiar yet
slightly mysterious and exotic . . . the initial note aromatic and
stirring . . . the final note langurous, warm, and memorable. . .''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old company is determined to do for chocolate what
Starbucks has done for coffee by opening a chain of retail outlets
to bring ``an entertainent lifestyle element to the merchandising
of the Hawaiian Vintage line of products.''
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate has long been my lifestyle, so I feel qualified to say
that Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate is great stuff. Not that it needs
my endorsement. A New York Times food critic wrote that it's the
best chocolate in the world. Some of the country's best chefs,
among them Tony Ambrose of Ambrosia on Huntington Avenue, are using
it in their kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   So how does it taste? It's impossible to describe, although the
people at Hawaiian Vintage Chocolate make a mighty effort: ``The
essential flavors or notes of the chocolate arouse an impassioned
response. People have compared this natural euphoria to the feeling
one has when first falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Which of course is another indescribable experience, and one
that brings us to the Love Truffle, the company's newest product, a
chocolate fortified with ``natural herbal and neutraceutical''
infusions, substances that are supposed to have aphrodisiacal
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate itself is a reputed aphrodisiac. It contains
substances that act as stimulants and antidepressants. Perhaps more
important, if not as much fun, researchers recently discovered that
chocolate is full of disease-fighting antioxidants.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in aphrodisiacs. I'm not sure I believe in
antioxidants either. But when Hawaiian Vintage Chocolates sent
along some Love Truffles, I ate the whole box, in the spirit of
journalistic inquiry. There are only nine truffles per box, so
that's not as hoggish as it sounds. And I did space them out over
three days because I didn't want to risk being overwhelmed by any
aphrodisiacal effects. I needn't have worried. Honesty compels me
to say that I did not feel even the faintest of chocolate-related
sexual stirrings. But the truffles were superb.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently I missed the point of Love Truffles. Scott Dmitrenko,
the company's public relations person, explained that they are
meant to be shared with your loved one, to get you both in the
mood. Forget it. At $19.95 for nine truffles, he can get his own
box.

Morphine/``The Night'' (DreamWorks)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morphine's moody aesthetic always stood out. Eschewing guitars,
the trio used sliding two-stringed bass, baritone saxophone and
Mark Sandman's sardonic vocals to create an atmospheric, bluesy
noise that gained a sizable audience in Europe and seemed
tailor-made for neo-noir film soundtracks. Morphine was on the
verge of a breakthrough when bassist-singer Sandman suffered a
fatal heart attack onstage last summer while performing in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``The Night,'' Morphine's most accomplished work,
recorded and produced by Sandman with help from such friends as
organist John Medeski of Martin, Medeski &AMP; Wood. The album builds
on the uncompromising minimalism that defined the often
mournful-sounding trio, adding piano, trombone, guitar and even
strings to flesh out such gritty highlights as ``Top Floor, Bottom
Buzzer,'' ``Like a Mirror,'' and the haunting ``Take Me With You.''
Meanwhile, the Eastern-tinged ``Rope on Fire,'' with its earthy,
exotic orchestration, points to destinations the now-defunct
Morphine can never revisit. 3 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Roogalator/``Cincinnati Fatback'' (Proper)
</P>
<P>
   Formed in London during pub-rock's heyday in the mid-'70s, the
genuinely eccentric Roogalator missed the big time when the
quartet's funky, r&AMP;b-tinged sound was decimated by the punk
explosion. The little-known band was led by nerdy-looking
expatriate Danny Adler, born and raised in Cincinnati before
crossing the pond and developing a surprisingly original
instrumental style that made his old Fender Jazzman sound like a
cross between a pedal steel and a foghorn.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that were inventive numbers like Roogalator's
signature tune, ``Cincinnati Fatback'' (six minutes of elegant
Meters-style funk that perfectly mimics a riverboat cruise), ``All
Aboard'' and ``Zero Hero.'' This wonderful import compilation gives
the whole history of this sadly overlooked outfit. Worth looking
into. 3 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ F.S. &QR; 
 &QL; 
McCoy Tyner/``McCoy Tyner With Stanley Clarke and Al Foster''
(Telarc)
</P>
<P>
   Bassist Stanley Clarke rarely plays straight-ahead jazz, so the
treat with this album is to listen to his forceful, funky playing
and see how he prods the 70-year-old Tyner to some of his best
piano work in years.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-song set (which includes two versions of one number, ``I
Want to Tell You 'Bout That,'' with Clarke alternating between
acoustic and electric bass) features six Tyner originals, and the
percussive pianist plays with characteristic ringing power and
inventiveness. Clarke's lively playing and Foster's steady drumming
make this a formidable trio, one that would be a joy to hear
sometime in a club setting. 3 1/2 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
The Handsome Family/``In the Air'' (Carrot Top)
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based husband and wife team of Brett and Rennie
Sparks _ the Handsome Family _ makes sad, creepy old-time country
music that could be a cousin to the Louvin Brothers. There's a
wicked sense of humor at play on such songs as ``Grandmother Waits
for You'' and the title track, while the spare, precise
instrumentation lends a vivid feel to this very grown-up country
disc.
</P>
<P>
   If you like Gillian Welch or Sally Timms, you'll get a kick from
``In the Air.'' 3 1/2 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ F.S. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Hank Williams III/``Risin' Outlaw'' (Curb)
</P>
<P>
   First things first: Indeed, Hank III (nee Shelton) Williams'
voice remarkably recalls his legendary granddad's heartbroke, nasal
yodel, and the true spirit of honky tonk rings more authentically
through this finely crafted solo debut than on just about any of
Daddy Jr.'s recordings.
</P>
<P>
   But lineage notwithstanding, the key achievement here is III's
deft blending of folk/country traditions and a rockin' contempo
Nashville sound, fast acoustic pickin' and demonically demented
pedal steel in furious concert with strong beats and loud guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, however distinctive the grandson's sound may be, the
mournful, haunted wail on his own composition ``On My Own'' can't
help but transport you to the '53 Cadillac's fateful backseat.
Which is a good thing, too. 4 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Strauss &QR; 
 &QL; 
Michael Penn/``MP4: Days Since a Lost Time Accident'' (Epic)
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why Penn and Aimee Mann (most recently
spotlighted on the ``Magnolia'' soundtrack) married. Both share an
affinity for emotion-packed songs about lost souls looking for love
and truth. Penn's latest continues his winning streak as an artist
with another melodic batch of pop that tips a hat to its influences
(the Beatles, Phil Spector) without ever being a slave to them.
</P>
<P>
   Mann and Grant Lee Phillips provide gorgeous background vocals
to the alternately soaring and melancholy songs, while Penn's
clever, cutting lyrics realistically detail the uncertainties of
love and life with a minimalist's eye for detail. 3 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ G.W. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Nicholas Payton/``Nick(at)Night'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   The night, the jazz musician's constant companion, is the stated
theme for trumpeter Payton's latest solo effort, although the
concept is rather loosely used. The album features Payton's working
and recording band of four years _ saxophonist Tim Warfield,
pianist Anthony Wonsey, bassist Reuben Rogers and drummer Adonis
Rose _ and their accumulated telepathy is much in evidence in this
program of mostly original music.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's warm brand of bop has always made for enjoyable
listening, even if his composing skills remain a work in progress.
The album's gem is its one cover, Maurice White's ``Sun Goddess,''
which spotlights Wonsey's effervescent keyboard work. 3 stars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ G.W. &QR; 
 &QL; 
Caravana Cubana/``Late Night Sessions'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   When the Grammy award for traditional Tropical Latin album
(how's (BEGIN ITALICS)that(END ITALICS) for a category?) is
announced later this month, Caravana Cubana will be competing
against two Buena Vista Social Club alums _ singer Ibrahim Ferrer
and guitarist Eliades Ochoa. Caravana Cubana hasn't received the
same publicity, but the music from this all-star assemblage of
Cuban musicians is every bit as enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   The standout group, which includes pianist Chucho Valdes and
bassist Al McKibbon, jams on a lively variety of Afro-Cuban and
Cuban songs, delivering an album that will please anyone who has
relished the recent revival in this venerable genre of music. 3

STILL CSNY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: With CSNY-YOUNG commentary on Neil Young. Fact box below.) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed like ``Deja Vu'' all over again.
</P>
<P>
   After releasing just two studio albums in 26 years, David
Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young _ CSNY, the
acronym goes _ found themselves in the same room, playing tunes and
harmonizing together as if all those years when they had been apart
didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   The current CSNY reunion tour had its roots in that rehearsal
room where Crosby, Stills and Nash were simply singing for
themselves last year after coming to the conclusion they would have
to shell out their own cash to record before a major label would be
interested in marketing something new from the trio.
</P>
<P>
   At some point during those sessions, Young dropped by.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked that we were paying for it ourselves, and he liked
the music coming out of the speakers,'' said Nash, who had quit the
British pop band the Hollies in 1968 to help form CSNY in Los
Angeles. ``At first Neil wanted to play on one of Stephen's songs,
but we just kept going. We realized we had a CSNY record and not
just one where Neil was guesting. So we decided to take it on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking it on the road meant the first concert tour by the
legendary quartet in more than 25 years. The last time CSNY hit the
highway, Richard Nixon was president and the Eagles' ``Best of My
Love'' topped the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Memories go back a long time _ CSNY's second live appearance was
in front of half a million people at the Woodstock festival in
August 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the group has a new album to sell _ the disappointing
``Looking Forward'' (Reprise) _ and the 33-date, three-month tour
(which comes to Staples Center on Saturday) is getting mixed
reviews. Most observers agree that when the band's golden harmonies
click on stage, nothing compares. The problem is, the new material
doesn't come close to winners such as Young's ``Cinnamon Girl'' and
``Southern Man'' or Crosby's ``Guinnevere.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the band members are talking as if there's more
at stake than merely ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an archeological dig,'' Young said. ``We're looking for
ourselves, and we're coming pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take much excavating for the media to come up with a
bit of spice to add to news of the tour after the story broke that
Crosby was the sperm donor for rocker Melissa Etheridge and her
partner Julie Cypher's two young children.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby was the biological father of the couple's 3-year-old
daughter and 1-year-old son, borne by filmmaker Julie Cypher, by
means of artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of razzing and a lot of very, very funny
lines,'' Crosby, 58, has said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehearsals for the tour, dubbed CSNY2000, took place at the
Forum, where the band worked out about 50 numbers so the
three-hour, 30-song program, including electric and acoustic
segments, can vary each night. The backing band includes bassist
Donald ``Duck'' Dunn of Booker T. &AMP; the MG's fame and well-known
session drummer Jim Keltner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been going unbelievably well,'' Nash, 57, said.
``It's thrilling to stand in front of such love. We've always tried
to do the best we could. When we first started, we didn't sit down
and say, `Boy, this is going to last forever!' That first time we
sang together was an amazing feeling. When we heard that vocal
blend, it was surprising how different it sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no particular claim to any series of notes. Anyone can
sing them, but nobody sounds like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those close, high harmonies sold millions of albums and
influenced legions of soft-rock groups throughout the `70s. But the
personalities of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young _ all of whom play
guitar, sing and write their own songs _ were not as mellow as
their tunes. The band split up and re-formed many times through the
years.
</P>
<P>
   There were many false starts at reunions after the final 1974
outing ended at London's Wembley Stadium. Young joined CSN for a
lackluster performance at Live Aid in 1985; Crosby went to prison
after a long series of run-ins with the law due to drug use; and
after recording the 1988 quartet album, ``American Dream,'' Young
refused to tour with his bandmates.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trio's next record, ``CSN,'' failed to make the Top
100, the group maintained a large, loyal following, and concerts
featuring various permutations of the original quartet continued to
draw fans.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four original members, however, flannel-clad
grunge-guitar god Young has enjoyed the most serious rock stardom,
and his solo concerts are multigenerational affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the band members seem clearly delighted to be together on
stage again _ at least this early in the current trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still fun,'' said Nash, who recently broke his legs in a
boating accident in the waters off his Hawaiian home. ``The new
songs are going down as well as the old songs. And that's a
surprise. We're feeling optimistic about the future. Everybody has
really improved as musicians, and we're all actually listening to
each other. We haven't done the same song the same way twice in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash, whose leg casts came off a couple of weeks ago, takes a
dim view of the state of the music industry, where consolidations
and mergers have shrunk the number of major labels to four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the record companies cared about their artists
and cared enough to nurture them through an album and two or three
singles,'' Nash said. ``And if the first single didn't do anything,
they'd plug the hell out of the other ones. Today, it's like
throwing mud at the wall. The labels today are run by accountants.
But the more time people spend on their computers, you won't need
the traditional methods of distribution and media. And that's going
to be a good thing for everybody.'' &QL;

A BETTER HEADACHE REMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Creator must be a trickster. Every time I think I've found
an answer, the Most Mischievous changes the question.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column, I acknowledged that outrage had become such
a dominant player in my life that I wanted to rewrite the script.
Feeling outraged didn't change anything. Not only that, but in my
case it often was a barrier to taking action. The beginning and end
of my outrage was the emotional rush I got from a surge of anger.
What actually gets me involved in making a difference is true
concern.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time I recognized that I always got outraged at
people who were far worse than I could ever be. Extreme violations
of the human spirit made my contribution to the dismal state of the
world look infinitesimal. Getting mad at somebody else let me off
the hook. So I wrote about choosing to focus on one outrage a day,
then turning the remainder of my attention to looking at the part I
play in disrupting the peaceful flow of life in my own family and
community.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I'd gotten wiser. I was not wise enough.
</P>
<P>
   I have an unsigned print I see every time I climb our front
stairs. It's a picture of a figure walking through a series of
doors, and beyond each door is a room with another open door. The
print once folded like an accordion, so that our protagonist could
walk in endless circles, but I like it stretched out in a straight
line. This person is moving ahead, but is never going to arrive
anywhere. The picture celebrates an endless process.
</P>
<P>
   So I reached a conclusion about outrage. Then, while I was
recovering from a back problem, my friend Kathleen dropped John
Sarno's book, ``The Bodymind Prescription,'' into my lap. Dr.
Sarno, whose field is clinical rehabilitation, has a medical theory
that describes how we create pain in our bodies _ from migraines to
backaches to fibromyalgia _ to distract ourselves from powerful
emotions we fear will overwhelm us. Every time anger threatens a
valued relationship, or feelings of grief seem unbearable, or some
current event stirs up memories of childhood abuse, abandonment, or
rejection, our brain rescues us by giving us some ``real'' pain to
worry about.
</P>
<P>
   I was reading a chapter called ``The Psychology of Mindbody
Disorders'' when Sarno mentioned an emotional state that made the
hair stand up on the back of my neck: unconscious rage. His words
suggested to me that perhaps all the outrage I felt about things
happening in the world was a cover for personal rage I was
unwilling to face or to accept. At this stage in my life I hardly
ever get angry. I never cry. After a traumatic upbringing and much
therapy, I've turned myself into someone who can be trusted to be
stable and reasonable. But what if all these roles I've been
playing so competently _ reliable worker, understanding mother,
serene wife _ were related to the increase in the amount of pain my
body was experiencing? What if what I really needed to heal myself
was not to become a better person, but a more conscious one?
</P>
<P>
   I had nothing to lose. My orthopedic surgeon had taken one look
at my MRI and said, ``Well, I'll be seeing you again.'' So in
addition to beginning a regimen of physical therapy, I allowed my
headaches and back pain to be my spiritual guides, to prod me into
asking, ``What am I hiding from myself now? What feelings am I
trying to avoid?'' And I began talking to my brain _ as Sarno
advocates: ``You don't have to distract me with pain. I'm not
afraid to confront these feelings in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   I know this sounds bizarre. It shouldn't work, but it does. I've
been driving somewhere, my head throbbing, and after searching my
memories and coming up empty, an answer pops into my mind. My
feelings got hurt and I smiled and buried them. I was badly
disappointed, shrugged, and felt nothing. My mind has also been
waking me with stress-filled dreams at 2 a.m., my head pounding and
my back aching, and dictated some strange nightmarish scenario,
sending me valuable messages about the nature of my outrage. I have
gotten up to write in a journal, sometimes while crying, then made
a promise to myself to communicate how I feel to the persons
involved _ without blame _ and then gone back to a peaceful night's
sleep. I have made some mistakes that I am seeking to repair, but
for the first time in my life when faced with pain, my first move
has not been to reach for medication. For the first time in my
life, I have resolved a headache without drugs.
</P>
<P>
   I've gone through another door and entered a new room in what
seems to be an endless process.

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neil Young arguably boasts the greatest sustained output of any
rock musician in the past half-century. Yes, Bob Dylan's been
around longer, but his work in the '80s was even more sallow than
Young's was, and Dylan was still grasping until 1997's ``Time Out
of Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, on the other hand, could probably cull three or four
decent albums from the albums released during his lost years of the
'80s _ an average decade's work for the superstar of today _ and he
caught a second wind back in 1989 with ``Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Morrison's likewise a survivor, but he spent the '80s
remaking essentially the same ethereally spiritual album and then
spent the '90s repeating basically a crankier version of his '80s
music. And Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, Lou Reed, Bruce Springsteen,
Richard Thompson and a host of other possible candidates have all
been too erratic, sporadic or beneath the radar of most fans to
qualify for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Even given that lofty declaration, Young's been holding out on
us in a big way, and his occasional forays into the group dynamic _
with David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash, not Crazy Horse
_ only underscore his intermittently lax attitude. As solid as his
work in the '90s was, it was also a decade of unprecedented
wheel-spinning _ he released no fewer than seven CDs of live and/or
reissued material.
</P>
<P>
   Two things make that a shocking waste _ first, he has seven
albums from the '70s and early '80s that have never been released
on CD, five of which are wholly solid, frequently brilliant, if at
times chemically addled efforts.
</P>
<P>
   (Actually, there are others not on CD in America but readily
available as imports. And you can often find the others available
on e-Bay, from entrepreneurs who have simply transferred the albums
from vinyl to compact disc, allowing you to relive the
snap-crackle-pop experience of those old 331/3s. Bidders routinely
pay $50 and more for ``On the Beach'' and ``Hawks and Doves,''
which include additional unreleased material, and $30 or more for
most of the others.)
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Young has, if going by unofficial releases is any
indication, four of five entirely credible CDs of material that he
has recorded over the decades but never released. Much of it is
frequently beautiful acoustic and country-tinged music, since most
of what Young does release is traditional, grungy electric-guitar
rock. He has, for example, an entire album of enjoyably lilting
country songs he has never made available for the public's
consumption _ Young averages a country album roughly once a decade
_ and darn close to an entire album of straightforward blues (at
any rate, it'd be longer than his one official blues release,
``This Note's for You'').
</P>
<P>
   For at least a decade, Young has promised fans a sequel to his
epic mid-'70s compilation, ``Decade,'' a package that has been
rumored to number as many as 10 CDs. In fact, there exists a
bootleg that could be Young's equivalent of ``Tracks,''
Springsteen's generous four-disc collection of his
alternate-universe music, songs that were written on the way to
realizing the classics he did release and intriguingly sparer
alternative versions to songs with which the Boss' fans are
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ranch Archives'' is an assiduously compiled set of originals,
culled from heaven knows how many live shows as well as from some
unreleased but apparently readily available demo recordings. Some
songs are early but radically different versions of Young
standards: ``Evening Coconut'' cribs ``Thrasher's'' melody from
``Rust Never Sleeps.'' ``Road of Plenty'' (also known as ``River of
Pride'') ventures off onto a different tack from the tune from
``Eldorado,'' off ``Freedom.'' ``Pictures in My Mind'' expands on
the gorgeous ``Music Arcade.'' ``Lady Wingshot'' blends melodies
from ``Broken Arrow'' and ``Like a Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Superficially, it's easy to see why some of the material has
never been released. Some of the songs _ ``Time Off for Good
Behavior'' and ``Hitchhiker'' are unapologetically pro-drug. ``I
Wonder Why'' is a nakedly emotional song about his son born with
cerebral palsy (heretofore touched upon only circumspectly on
``Transformer Man,'' from ``Trans''). A lot feature sincerely dark,
emotional, troubled lyrics, but then, so did all of his '70s LP
``Zuma,'' which is readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Others are classics waiting to happen. How songs like ``Distant
Camera,'' ``Grey Riders,'' ``Good to See You,'' ``Ordinary People''
and ``Interstate'' (not on ``Ranch Archives,'' but on other
bootlegs) never made the cut on a Young album is mystifying.
``Ranch Archives''' third disc is practically as good as any
recording Young has released. And many of the folk ballads are
gorgeous tunes of yearning that stand up against the beauty of what
you have heard. And if this is just the stuff that has somehow
snuck out of his vaults, who knows what treasures still remain for
his fans?
</P>
<P>
   So, here it is, Neil, the big plea _ I'm on my knees here:
Enough with the fiddling around with the redundant live albums and
the irrelevant collaborations with your '70s pals. You have
stunning amounts of great music locked up and kept away from your
fans. Share some of this still-vital music with us soon. If only to
keep other poor chumps from paying as much as I have for all of
it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once known for yellow ``Baby on Board'' signs and a history of
ups and downs, Safety 1st Inc. thinks it finally sees a robust
future in potty chairs, vibrating bassinets, and ``alternative
walkers'' that look like ladybugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very good about what we've accomplished in 1999 and
look forward to 2000,'' chairman and chief executive Michael Lerner
told investors who follow the infant-and-toddler products industry
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner may have cause for optimism. According to Wall Street
analysts, several trends may be breaking in favor of Safety 1st,
which recently moved from Boston's Chestnut Hill section to nearby
Canton.
</P>
<P>
   First, the birth rate is up, and a new generation of parents
from two-income households has been eager to indulge its babies.
That's good news for nearly everyone who's competing for a share of
a nearly $5 billion market for so-called juvenile products.
</P>
<P>
   On the retail front, meanwhile, many big players, such as Toys
``R'' Us Inc., its Babies ``R'' Us chain, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
are changing their buying strategy, to the benefit of Safety 1st.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Safety 1st seems to have fixed some problems that
have hurt it in the past. Among other things, it has pruned its
product lines, obtained better financing, and upgraded the computer
system that tracks and manages its supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   It's hoped that such initiatives will smooth out the sometimes
bumpy road that Safety 1st has traveled since 1993, when it first
offered stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The trick now may be to get Wall Street to pay attention again.
Many big investors seemed to give up on Safety 1st after it lost
nearly $45 million in 1996. And they have yet to return.
</P>
<P>
   Safety 1st ``has sort of fallen off the radar screen,'' said
analyst Laura Huskins of Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston. She says
this year's performance may have the potential to turn the company
into a bigger blip on Wall Street's radar.
</P>
<P>
   The Safety 1st name may not be sweet on the street, but, past
problems aside, consumer polls show that Safety 1st is one of the
most respected brand names among parents, Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner would just as soon talk about products as earnings. He
can expound at length on innovations in potties and booster seats.
He can deliver the definitive exegesis on the alternative walker, a
product also known as a stationary activity center.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1984 to sell the ``Baby on Board''
signs, saw a rapid expansion. A decade later, many of the things a
parent might want for a newborn or a toddler could be found in
Safety 1st's inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The company grew beyond little kids, making the kind of safety
products that consumers might buy at a hardware store. Locks,
deadbolts, carbon monoxide detectors _ these hardware items were
among Safety 1st's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew too fast,'' Lerner said. ``In 1996, everything came
together in the wrong way. We had too many products.''
</P>
<P>
   So Safety 1st dropped many items. from its lines. Last In
August, it announced the sale of its hardware business. It now
focuses on categories in which it is either a market leader or the
number two player. In categories that other companies dominate,
such as strollers and car seats, Safety 1st has no presence.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of offering a wide array of items, Safety 1st takes what
Lerner calls a ``good, better, best'' approach to the smaller
number of items it specializes in. For a parent who wants to buy an
alternative walker, Safety 1st offers three choices. There's a
standard version of a walker with a suggested retail price of
$39.99. There's an upgraded version for $49.99, and the deluxe
model for $69.99.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has played neatly into the plans of the giant
retailers Safety 1st counts as its biggest customers, noted
Margaret Whitfield, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us, Wal-Mart, Kmart Corp., and Target Corp. all think
they can gain efficiencies and savings by purchasing from a smaller
number of vendors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, these retailers might have had to deal with three
manufacturers to stock a low-end walker, a midprice version, and a
deluxe model. With Safety 1st, a retailer can turn to one source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal has been to create one-stop relationships with
retailers,'' Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff has been ``more shelf space'' for Safety 1st products
in big retailers' stores, said analyst William A. Block of W.A.B.
Capital in Los Angeles. And more shelf space has meant higher
sales.
</P>
<P>
   According to Safety 1st, 1999 sales were up 29 percent to
Wal-Mart and up 63 percent to Toys ``R'' Us. Such gains helped
Safety 1st outpace an industry that is seeing sales grow at an
annual rate of about 7 percent, according to the Juvenile Products
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Issuing fourth-quarter results earlier this week, Safety 1st
said sales rose 49 percent, to $37.3 million. Before taking a
one-time charge related to the writing off of expenses from a
previous loan agreement, Safety 1st earned $739,000, compared with
a loss of $3.3 million for its fourth quarter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, sales rose 30 percent, to $158 million. Net
income was $4.2 million, versus a loss of $1 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Safety 1st could get a big boost from its retailers, analysts
said. Several of its big customers, most notably Toys ``R'' Us and
Wal-Mart, have big expansion plans for Europe. As these chains open
more stores overseas, Safety 1st products could get wider exposure
and enjoy bigger sales.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of electronic commerce could also open new online
sales channels, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Safety 1st doesn't compete across the board with
anyone. Since its retrenchment, it has offered products in a little
over a dozen core categories. And it competes with different rivals
in different categories.
</P>
<P>
   In baby bouncers, Safety 1st may go up against Fisher-Price, a
unit of Mattel Inc. A big rival in walkers is Graco, a brand owned
by Newell Rubbermaid Inc. And First Years Inc. of Avon, Mass. vies
with Safety 1st in the potty category, Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   If recent sales figures for Safety 1st have been impressive, the
performance of its stock has not. The company's inconsistent track
record over the years has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   A stock whose shares traded at about 25 five years ago now
rarely gets above 8 1/2. Wednesday on Nasdaq, the shares fell 5/16,
to close at 7 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, at long last, Safety 1st may be poised for a big
step forward, analysts say. Added Lerner, ``We think we're very
much undervalued right now.''

NEWEST FORMULA FOR NET RICHES: B2B 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of eToys Inc. and other online retailers may be falling
back to earth, but don't think for a second that the e-commerce
euphoria has ended.
</P>
<P>
   The latest gold rush to be found is in such business-to-business
start-ups as Gofish.com, a Maine e-commerce company that helps to
bring Thai black tiger prawns and other seafood delicacies to
restaurants and grocers.
</P>
<P>
   Although not as sexy as the online consumer market, which
produced household names such as e-retailer Amazon.com and giant
auction site eBay, the less visible business-to-business side is
expected to grow much larger.
</P>
<P>
   By 2004, many firms will be surfing the Internet to buy and sell
everything from fax paper to chemicals. By then, the emerging
business-only industry will have ballooned to $2.7 trillion,
eclipsing online retail sales of $185 billion, according to
Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass. technology research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business-to-consumer side is rah-rah and fun,'' said Neal
Workman, founder and chief executive of Gofish.com. ``The
business-to-business buying is people's livelihood. In our market,
a shipment of shrimp can be a $250,000 invoice. It certainly
doesn't fit into someone's mailbox.''
</P>
<P>
   With visions of huge profits, Wall Street has switched sides,
spurning online retailers and embracing the new
business-to-business darlings. The new e-commerce stocks are
soaring and venture-capital funding is flowing. A rash of initial
public offerings by business-to-business companies in the last year
has many executives and investors smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of FreeMarkets Inc., a Pittsburgh company that operates
an online auction site for chemicals and other industrial products,
shot up after its initial public offering in December. Initially
priced at $48 a share, its stock closed Wednesday at $237, down 10
for the day.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same story for Ariba Inc., a California company that
makes computer software used to process Web orders. Its stock
soared after it went public in June at $23 per share. Wednesday,
its stock closed at $188.75, up 50 cents for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Start-ups eyeing new markets have had few problems attracting
capital. Gofish.com, for instance, has attracted nearly $30 million
in funding from investors, including Bedrock Capital Partners, a
Boston venture capital firm. The closely held Internet company is
trying now to bring in another $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Highland Capital Partners, another Boston venture-capital
firm, more than half of the Internet deals today are in the
business-to-business arena. A year ago, 75 percent of the
investment deals were with Internet consumer companies.
</P>
<P>
   Investors say they prefer business-to-business companies because
the industry's growth potential is much larger than the retail side
of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the costs of acquiring and retaining customers
tends to be lower, said David Duval, managing director of Bedrock
Capital. Companies such as eToys are spending millions of dollars
to woo shoppers who will jump quickly to toysrus.com or kbkids.com
where they might hear of special discounts on Pokemon video games
or Barbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more fickle group,'' Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business firms such as Gofish.com and Chemdex Corp.
also boast that they are solving fundamental problems in their
industries. Seafood buyers for restaurant and grocery chains, for
example, spend hours talking on the phone and dealing with fax
machines to get the freshest fish for the lowest possible prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a buyer with a grocery store can browse through
distributors' offerings at Gofish.com, and let the computer do the
work. In time, seafood costs could go down because buyers, who will
have quick access to more suppliers, should be able to get better
bids, Workman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just getting rid of the faxes and the phones,'' said
Bruce Temkin, a Forrester Research analyst. ``In business to
business, the Internet is actually being used to restructure the
shape of entire supply lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But few industry observers believe the business-to-business hype
will last forever. Right now, companies are scrambling to mark
their territory in cyberspace. And in less than two years, the
shakeout that is emerging among online retailers will include
business-to-business e-commerce firms, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Already, e-commerce companies are consolidating and forging new
alliances, recognizing that only the biggest firms will survive in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Altra Energy Technologies Inc. of Houston, a provider
of electronic trading services to the energy industry, eliminated a
major online rival, Quicktrade.com, by purchasing the company.
</P>
<P>
   Office supplies e-retailer Staples.com, which plans to hold an
initial public offering later this year, invested $7 million last
May in Register Inc., a New York company that has a list of about 1
million businesses with Web sites. Now, Staples.com can target
businesses large and small, selling them paper clips and other
items they need to run their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see now is there is a new frontier,'' Temkin said.
``People are finally recognizing that there's a huge opporunity. I
do think there will be a gold rush, and then there will be more
start-ups than will survive.''

&HT;     NEW MONARCH OF GOLF IS A TIGER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jack Nicklaus never scaled these heights _ not on
his best succession of days, weeks and months. Arnold Palmer never
did. Nobody in more than a half-century has.
</P>
<P>
   The winning streak of Tiger Woods is at six golf tournaments and
counting. And who can possibly resist counting?
</P>
<P>
   The last time anybody won six tournaments in a row, Ben Hogan
was king and Harry Truman was president. Hogan put together a
six-tournament streak in 1948 _ three years after Byron Nelson set
the golfing gold standard.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was the Harlem Globetrotters. The rest of the PGA Tour
was the Washington Generals. Nelson's 11 consecutive victories in
'45 was and is golf's answer to Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting
streak _ unbreakable as the bond between politician and lobbyist.
Nelson's feat turned out to be worth somewhat less than its weight
in gold, but the $30,250 he pocketed in the process allowed him to
buy the Texas ranch that is his home to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you take the money out of the equation, a six-tournament
winning streak in today's PGA is at least the equal of a full
Nelson. Remember, Nelson was dominating a World War II-depleted
field. Nelson took on a Sam Snead here, a Jimmy Demaret there, but
the overall talent pool on tour those days was about as deep as a
conversation between Laurel and Hardy. Woods is head, shoulders and
hip turn above the competition in an age when golfers are almost as
abundant as lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And we still haven't gotten to the most impressive thing about
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive thing is this: Less than 3 1/2 years into
his PGA touring career, Woods has proven himself to be even better
than the hype that preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had $60 million worth of endorsements in pocket before he
took his first professional swing. Given all the Sultan of Swoosh
buildup, there was only one way for Woods to avoid being golf's
answer to ``Waterworld,'' the Hindenberg and the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Win.
</P>
<P>
   Win often.
</P>
<P>
   Win big.
</P>
<P>
   Win dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Win coming from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Win majors.
</P>
<P>
   Win staying ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Win. Win. Win. Against all comers.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Woods already has won 17 PGA events. The only active
players on tour with more career victories _ Ben Crenshaw (19) and
Greg Norman (18) _ are in their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   What we're seeing is Rembrandt painting a portrait or a
landscape. What we're seeing is Edmund Hillary scaling Mount
Everest. What we're seeing is Neil Armstrong making one giant leap
for mankind. What we're seeing is Elvis on stage, swiveling his
hips and thrusting the pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably going to be bigger than Elvis when he gets into
his 40s,'' said fellow touring pro Ernie Els, a two-time U.S. Open
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take the liberty of assuming that Woods won't get so big,
he takes to squeezing himself into gaudy jumpsuits. Let's even go
so far as to assume that Woods will not die ingloriously on a
toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem comparing him with Michael Jordan,'' former
Masters champion Fred Couples said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jordan, Woods has an unquenchable thirst for the
competition. Like Jordan, Woods has an affinity for saving some of
his best shots for the most dramatic moments. Like Jordan, Woods is
driven enough to keep finding new ways to improve his game. Like
Jordan, Woods uses the aging process to gain wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Woods used to bomb away with drivers and long irons.
The new-and-ever-improving Woods sacrifices distance _ not much,
but some _ for accuracy. The rest truly is history.
</P>
<P>
   The streak began in August at the NEC Invitational. Woods held
off Phil Mickelson by one shot. Since then, Woods has won in all
shapes and sizes. Woods outdueled Els twice _ once in a playoff at
the Mercedes Championship. Woods beat Miguel Angel Jimenez in a
playoff at the American Express. Woods won going away at the Tour
Championship. He entered Monday's final round at Pebble Beach
trailing by five shots.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Woods walked to the No. 12 tee, the deficit was
seven shots. Then he stuck a 5-iron to 8 feet and made the putt. On
No. 15, his pitch from 97 yards took flight like a guided missile.
</P>
<P>
   An eagle had landed. His approach from 115 yards on the next
hole was even more pure, skittering just past the cup for a tap-in
birdie. Another birdie on the final hole put the final touch on a
64. He played the last four holes at 4-under to finish two shots
ahead of Vijay Singh and rookie Matt Gogel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed, to be quite honest,'' Gogel said. ``But I will
not ever be amazed anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   From the mouth of a PGA Tour babe ...
</P>
<P>
   When a 21-year-old prodigy won the Masters by 12 shots in '97,
the first words I wrote were, ``Let the search begin for the manger
where Tiger Woods was born.'' It was supposed to be
tongue-in-cheek, but it's hard to be sure about anything involving
Woods anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Don't listen to any nonsense about this not being a real streak
because it carries over from one year to the next. Truth be told,
that makes what Woods is doing even more impressive. Players
occasionally have hot streaks that last a month, even two. Woods
was winning in August. He's still winning in February.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a mere hot streak. That's the work of a player who is
so talented, so driven, so focused that he truly can win every
tournament he enters.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus never scaled these heights, nor Arnold Palmer, nor
anybody else in the past 50 years. Tiger Woods stands alone,
looking for even more worlds to conquer. He hasn't even turned 25,
and he's already better than the hype.

PRETEENS AND THE PARTY SCENE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By BARBARA F. MELTZ 
c.2000 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Armed with the conviction that it's important for preteens to
maintain close friendships with children of both sexes, a mother
who prefers to remain nameless gave permission for her 12-year-old
son to invite three girls and two boys to a sleepover.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she chaperoned all night long (``I have a baby who
was in the habit of being up every 90 minutes, so I was awake
anyway,'' she says), she's not sure she would allow it again. ``Not
that anything bad happened,'' she says. ``They giggled and talked.
That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was also talk at school and this mother learned a hard
truth. ``Talk starts reputations, even at this young age,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Coed sleepovers are not the norm, indeed not even a trend among
preteens. Professionals and researchers say they hope they never
will be. But overnights such as this one are cropping up and, like
other boy-girl social events, they highlight just how
developmentally contradictory children this age are and how
confusing parenting them can be.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, like this mother, we want to believe boys and
girls can be just friends. On the other hand, like Shulamit Kahn, a
mother whose daughter can't attend coed sleepovers, we have a
nagging sense there's more to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when they are just standing in my kitchen, I can
feel an underlying sexual tension,'' says Kahn. ``The way the girls
hang out when there are boys is very different from the way they
hang out when there are only girls around.''
</P>
<P>
   There's truth in both mothers' positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 12-year-old can tell you, `We're just friends,' and mean it
with all her heart at that moment,'' says Margaret Sagarese, a
researcher of preteens and coauthor of ``Parenting 911: How to
Safeguard and Rescue Your 10- to 15-Year-Old'' (Broadway Books).
</P>
<P>
   But the preteen is also impulsive and more susceptible to peer
pressure than at any other time in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a child will do in a group is totally different and out
of character from what that child will do alone,'' says Sagarese.
``It can really take parents by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The years from 10 to 15 are transitional in two important ways:
Not only are children shifting from relying on adult authority to
trusting their own judgment, but they also are moving from concrete
to abstract thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``As concrete thinkers, they're a lot like 4-year-olds: They
need to touch, feel, and experience something for it to be real to
them,'' says educator Robert Spear, executive director of the New
England League of Middle Schools.
</P>
<P>
   That means they are rooted in the here and now. ``They don't
focus on consequences because they can't,'' says Spear. Think of a
sixth-grader with a long-term homework assignment: ``Unless he's
experienced the consequences of leaving it to the last minute, no
matter how much you try to guide him, he's not going to say, `I
have to work a little each night.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating this stage even more is that sexual curiosity can
kick in before the move from concrete to abstract thinking is
complete. So, as with the homework assignment, a child can't
project to consequences. When you tell her, ``Sleeping in the same
room with boys, even boys who are just your friends, might make
someone think about kissing, and might make two friends actually
kiss, which might make other kids who didn't want to feel
uncomfortable,'' your 13-year-old is almost programmed to respond:
``That won't happen to me,'' ``Not my friends!'' or ``I could
control myself.''
</P>
<P>
   What plays out, of course, can be very different.
</P>
<P>
   At a party where everyone else wants to play Truth or Dare (tell
the truth to an embarrassing question or kiss someone); Lemon
(follow directions from separate pieces of paper that tell you
whether to kiss, lick, or touch a boy/girl's specific body part);
or Wild Kiss (a boy and girl on either side of a circle wrestle
each other to deliver/avoid receiving/giving a kiss), good
intentions get forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength and value of peers are so powerful that the
thought is more likely to be `Oh, I could do that' rather than the
more abstract `Maybe this isn't a good idea,' '' says Spear.
</P>
<P>
   Sagarese says peer influence is so potent that even if a child
feels uncomfortable, she may go along with it because it's more
uncomfortable to say no. ``When they are 10 to 15, nearly all kids
become followers,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason rumors can be so destructive and rampant at
this age. ``All it takes is for one child to say something _ `You
slept at her house and nothing happened? What's wrong with you?' _
and it brings on uncontrollable peer pressure,'' Sagarese says. Not
just pressure for other kids to join in, but also for the child who
did nothing to say she did something. A variation on this theme is
no doubt what occurred after the sleepover &UR;  &LR; we mentioned at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   Such unpredictable results of peer pressure are why sexuality
educator Debra Haffner advises saying no to any coed preteen social
activity that is not well chaperoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough just to be home,'' she says. ``Kids need to
know there's a parent paying attention.'' She says something as
simple as going in and out of the room to bring food and refresh
glasses cuts down on daring behavior and makes children feel safe.
Haffner is executive director of the Sex Information and Education
Council of the United States and author of ``From Diapers to
Dating: A Parent's Guide to Raising Sexually Healthy Children''
(Newmarket Press).
</P>
<P>
   You also need ground rules, says health and sexuality counselor
Ellen Rosenberg. For instance, a start and finish time; no alcohol
or drugs; respect for the household and its contents. While she
doesn't recommend dictating what can and can't occur during a
party, she wouldn't hesitate to send a child home or end the party
if something inappropriate (alcohol, drugs) caught her eye.
Rosenberg is the author of ``Get a Clue! A Parents' Guide to
Understanding and Communicating With Your Preteen'' (Owl Books).
</P>
<P>
   Don't humiliate your child, however. ``Call him out of the room,
tell him the problem, and give him the chance to correct things
with his friends,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Should this party ever be a coed sleepover? The answer is no,
but with two exceptions:
</P>
<P>
   --Friends from overnight camp who come to visit.
</P>
<P>
   --Friends who have known one another since childhood and whose
parents are also friends of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these situations, the friend is a guest of the family. That
gives you input and control. It makes a big difference,'' says
psychologist and human-sexuality researcher Sol Gordon, professor
emeritus at Syracuse University and coauthor of ``Raising a Child
Responsibly in a Sexually Permissive World,'' second edition (Adams
Media).
</P>
<P>
   Gordon would never allow girls and boys to sleep in the same
room. Spear says the only way he would even allow a slumber party
is if boys and girls were in separate rooms and ``I slept in the
hall between them.'' He isn't being facetious.
</P>
<P>
   Coed sleeping in the same room, even with very good friends,
sends a mixed message, says Haffner. ``The good part is, `I trust
you.' The negative message is, `I think you are old enough to
handle whatever comes along.' '' Since neither we nor the preteens
know when sexual curiosity will come along and they lack the
emotional maturity to handle it if it does, why provide the
opportunity? she asks.
</P>
<P>
   The mother who allowed the coed slumber party reasoned it was
safe because the kids had been best friends since before
kindergarten. Sagarese says that can backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely because they know each other so well, and because
they're lying in a sleeping bag in their PJs on the floor in the
dark, there's a degree of intimacy that allows them to say
something like, `I've always wondered what a penis looks like,' or,
`I wonder what it feels like to kiss,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   What may start out as the preschool equivalent of playing doctor
could turn into something with far more serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PARTY POLITICS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whenever your child is invited to a social event at someone's
house, whether's it's a party or a sleepover, call the parents:
Will they be home? What ground rules do they have? What's their
chaperoning policy? Parents who tell you ``We don't mind that
they're here; they're in the basement and we can't even hear them''
are either overconfident or naive. Offering to bring something is a
diplomatic way of offering to help.
</P>
<P>
   Coed overnights are increasingly popular for schools and other
groups. Ask about sleeping arrangements (separate rooms, not
everyone in sleeping bags on the auditorium floor) and chaperones.
(The best arrangement: An adult sleeps in each room with adult
monitors in the halls between the rooms).
</P>
<P>
   Before you agree to host a party, negotiate ground rules with
your child, including no inappropriate sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   It's unrealistic to expect there won't be kissing games (the
more popular the children, the more likely there will be). What you
want to avoid is pairing up. As you move through a party, count
heads. If a couple has disappeared, talk to your child: ``We agreed
no inappropriate sexual activity. Either you tell those kids to
come out of the closet or I do.''
</P>

KIMBERLY WILLIAMS VISITS `THE 10TH KINGDOM' 
</HEADLINE>

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Kimberly
Williams in a scene from ``The 10th Kingdom.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Kimberly Williams always adored ``The Wizard of Oz.''
 &HT;    ``I remember staying up late to watch it,'' Williams says
excitedly. ``Every year, I'd wait for it to come on. I wanted to be
Dorothy.''
 &HT;    Now the actress is getting her shot at the next best thing.
Chiefly known as the wide-eyed bride in the ``Father of the Bride''
movies and as the star of the acclaimed television drama
``Relativity,'' Williams heads the cast of ``The 10th Kingdom,'' a
wildly ambitious, 10-hour fantasy miniseries that NBC will debut on
Feb. 27, with subsequent segments airing Feb. 28 and March 1, 5 and
6.
 &HT;    Williams plays a young woman named Virginia who, along with her
father, Tony (John Larroquette), is whisked from modern-day New
York City _ a.k.a. the 10th Kingdom _ into the fairy-tale realm of
the other Nine Kingdoms.
 &HT;    Seeking a way home, Virginia and Tony meet up with strange and
wondrous figures, including Snow White (Camryn Manheim), the evil
Queen (Dianne Wiest) and her Huntsman (Rutger Hauer), the Troll
King (Ed O'Neill) and Wolf (Scott Cohen), a half-man/half-wolf who
falls for Virginia.
 &HT;    ``I fell in love with the script as soon as I read it,''
Williams says by telephone from London, where she's starring in a
West End production of David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow.'' ``I felt
passionate enough about `The 10th Kingdom' to put everything else
on hold and come over to England to do it for seven months.
 &HT;    ``It was such an escape for me, such a fantasyland and an
adventure,'' she adds. ``Virginia goes to amazing places, and I
knew that in order to film amazing places we actually had to go to
a few amazing places. And we did _ we filmed at some of the most
beautiful locations in Europe.''
 &HT;    Williams and company shot outdoor sequences throughout England,
Germany, Austria and France. The unit, under the direction of
Herbert Wise and David Carson of ``Star Trek: Generations'' fame,
also spent months making magic on sound stages at London's
venerable Pinewood Studios.
 &HT;    ``It felt, every day, like we were shooting a fantasy,''
Williams says. ``I had to deal with a lot of special effects. My
wig, which is a 50-foot wig, was a special effect. We were often
talking to animals and creatures that didn't really talk back to
us. We were in front of blue screens a lot, having to imagine
something was there that really wasn't there.
 &HT;    ``But that was all part of the fantasy of it,'' she concludes.
``When you read a fairy tale, it's in your head. As an actor,
creating them and imagining much of it was really like reading the
`Grimms' Fairy Tales.'''
 &HT;    Williams promises that ``The 10th Kingdom'' will follow in the
Grimm tradition of conjuring up darkness and danger as much as it
does escapades and whimsy.
 &HT;    ```The 10th Kingdom' appeals on different levels,'' the actress
says. ``It's entertaining and a light story on the one hand, but on
the other hand it's got a deeper meaning sometimes, and there are
scares.
 &HT;    ``To me, it's an epic adventure of great, exciting proportions
and, at the same time, there are several human elements to it,''
Williams says. ``There's a very deep mother-daughter bond that
develops later on, and throughout there's a father-daughter
relationship and the love story between Virginia and Wolf.
 &HT;    ``Those are very basic human relationships,'' she says.
``Virginia is right in the middle of all of them, and I did some of
the most emotional scenes I've ever had to do in my life.''
 &HT;    Yes, that's right, there are emotional scenes in a fantasy
miniseries.
 &HT;    ``There were a lot of opportunities to really explore the
character,'' Williams insists. ``We had 10 hours to do it, and you
don't have that in a film. That was a real joy.
 &HT;    ``There was so much for me to do in this,'' she says. ``There
was humor, a lot of dark stuff and a lot of action, which I'd never
done before. I really learned a lot. I was working every day, and
every day was different _ every day I felt like I was working on a
different film.''
 &HT;    And every day Williams felt a bit like a certain girl from
Kansas.
 &HT;    ``Virginia wants to get home,'' Williams says. ``She has to
battle evil. She's wearing blue.
 &HT;    ``I felt very much like Dorothy.''

`TARZAN' OFFERS ANIMATION WITH AN EDGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Rob Lowman's weekly video column reviews ``Tarzan'' and ``The
Thomas Crown Affair'') 
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been remiss in recent weeks in mentioning two DVD releases
that shouldn't be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan,'' which came out last summer, proves once again why
Disney is the king of animation despite numerous and expensive
attempts to dethrone the studio in recent years (think Fox's
``Anastasia'' or DreamWorks' ``Prince of Egypt'').
</P>
<P>
   Besides being, as you would expect, as family-friendly as ever,
``Tarzan'' is gorgeous, kinetic eye candy. Over the last 10 years
or so, the Disney studio has consistently produced entertaining and
enjoyable animated films while continuing to push the technological
envelope (from ``Beauty and the Beast'' to ``Toy Story'' to ``A
Bug's Life''), and ``Tarzan'' is no exception. Using
background-enhancing technology that Disney artists call ``deep
canvas,'' the film has a painterly, detailed quality, with less of
the hard edges and a richer, three-dimensional feel than you ever
see in most animation.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere does this depth come through better than in the look of
the African forest, which instead of being just scenic background
takes on a life of its own as much as any of the characters. The
scenes in which Tarzan (voiced by Tony Goldwyn) swings on vines (or
surfs on branches) through the jungle are exhilarating. When the
apeman helps Jane (Minnie Driver) escape from a pack of wild
monkeys, the chase through the treetops has the feel of an
amusement park ride.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Tarzan'' succeeds because it is more than a mere
technological triumph; it's a romantic adventure with an emotional
edge that manages to (perhaps because of its animation) bring the
hero of this fantastical tale from Edgar Rice Burroughs to life
better than the nearly 50 previous filmed versions.
</P>
<P>
   Give credit to directors Kevin Lima and Chris Buck, writers Tab
Murphy, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White, and the Disney artists in
taking the familiar Tarzan story and, ironically, making it less
cartoonish and more human _ even if Tarzan is raised by a band of
apes. But his gorilla family _ as with any clan _ has its own
problems, and it is in this that ``Tarzan's'' message of belonging,
family, loyalty and love begins.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best films of last year, ``Tarzan'' is entertaining
and fun for kids. Phil Collins' score and songs are a perfect
complement to the joy onscreen. But no adult should be embarrassed
to rent or buy this film. Disney has created a classic for the
ages.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as it sounds like boosterism (no, I'm not on
Disney's payroll; they make plenty of turkeys outside of
animation), the seven- minute preview on the ``Tarzan'' DVD of
their next big animation feature, ``Dinosaur'' (due out May 19) is
simply breathtaking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Director John McTiernan's remake of the Steve McQueen-Faye
Dunaway romantic thriller ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' with Pierce
Brosnan and Rene Russo is perfect entertainment for those of us
tired of seeing teens in angst, in heat, in whatever. This
delicious cat-and-mouse game has exotic settings, glamorous clothes
and fabulous sex (well at least it looks fabulous), and reminds
aging boomers that maybe youth is wasted on the young (or at least
too many movie and TV plots).
</P>
<P>
   While ``Crown'' may not be a classic, it sparkles as pure
entertainment. And fun films that don't cater to the under-25 crowd
are hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ______
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' is $34.99 for the DVD and $24.99 for VHS. The DVD
includes Collins' ``Strangers Like Me'' music video, plus
``Trashin' the Camp,'' a behind-the-scenes studio session with
Collins and 'N Sync, a peek at Disney's upcoming ``Dinosaur,'' and
the ``Tarzan'' Interactive Trivia Game &AMP; and Interactive
Read-Along. ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' from MGM is priced for
rental or sale on VHS ($106.99). The DVD ($24.90) includes
commentary by McTiernan. &QL;

GROUT WON'T STAY PUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My bathroom has a new ceramic tile floor. Now, after only two
months, grout is pulling away from the fiberglass tub. What can I
use that will not do that?
</P>
<P>
   KATHY BOYD, Georgetown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The grout shrank, and/or the fiberglass moved enough to cause
the gap. Or, the grout was inadequately compacted when it was
installed. You could try regrouting, after chipping out the old
grout completely, and putting in new, fully and compactly. Or use
thin-set mortar, which is more likely to stay in place.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, dig out the old grout and insert a bead of
caulking, which will expand and contract with movement, and keep
the gap filled and watertight.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You wrote recently about a homemade concoction for getting
rid of hair, grease, and other gunk from a sink and shower drain. I
have forgotten what it is. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   DONALD PIERCE, Kingston, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. And I presume from your question that the drains are
not clogged, but perhaps slow and smelly. Use straight household
bleach; pour it down the drain and leave it in the trap for an hour
or so; also, use a big bottle brush to physically remove the gross
part; push the brush down as far as it will go, and pull up
carefully to avoid spattering. This brush will grab a lot of that
gunk. You can maintain the drain nicely by adding a cup of bleach
once a week or once a month. And if it is a bathroom sink, be sure
to clean out the overflow drain with a coat hanger wire; these
sometimes get clogged and smell bad. Wear skin and eye protection
when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   If a drain is clogged, open it with a mechanical snake, or use
an enzyme-type drain cleaner such as Drano.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a grungy linoleum in my newly purchased old house,
with cracks where the plywood underlayment joints are. What can I
do to improve it? Can I put real tiles over the old linoleum, or
rip up the old linoleum and put down tiles, or what?
</P>
<P>
   ALLISON, Lost in Cyberspace
</P>
<P>
   A. The handyman dutifully answered your e-mail question, but it
got hurled back into his face. So, a warning to e-mailers: don't.
It is unreliable, in my opinion, and I prefer good old snail mail.
It may be slow (thus the snide title), but it is totally,
completely reliable. I've never lost a letter that has a stamp on
it.
</P>
<P>
   You can do several things about your floor:
</P>
<P>
   1. If the old linoleum is in good shape (not torn or curled or
anything like that), you can sand and wash it, then apply the
peel-and-stick vinyl tiles. I suggest sanding; since it is real
linoleum (as opposed to sheet vinyl), it does not contain asbestos.
If you have any qualms about asbestos or the material containing
it, then do not sand. Fill the plywood joints with a floor-leveling
compound so the new floor surface will not crack again.
</P>
<P>
   2. Take up the old linoleum and lay new sheet vinyl or vinyl
tiles on the plywood, after filling the joints.
</P>
<P>
   3. Take up the old linoleum and lay ceramic tile on the plywood,
using a thin-set mortar.
</P>
<P>
   4. Have a professional tile setter put ceramic tiles over the
old linoleum. This is expensive; a tile setter puts down steel
mesh, then a layer of mortar, lets that set, and then puts the
tiles down with thin-set mortar. It is expensive but permanent, so
if you do that, make sure you can live with the color for years and
years and years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My evergreen bushes are great foundation plants, and help
prevent water from going down the foundation and into the cellar.
But they are terribly overgrown, so much so that I cannot prune
them. I was thinking of cutting them to the ground and planting new
bushes between the stumps of the old. Would that work?
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA ROGALSKI, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think that would work because it would be extremely
difficult to dig through the old roots in order to plant new
bushes, and all those roots will interfere with the new bushes.
Instead, consider this: Dig out every other plant, roots and all,
and plant new bushes in their place. You may not have to do any
more than that if the old bushes fill in where the others were
removed. If not, then in a year or so dig out the rest and plant
new bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Or, dig them all out and start all over.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, consider using dwarf varieties. Dwarf yews, and
especially dwarf Colorado blue spruce are two that occur to me as
useful. Dwarf varieties will take up nearly as much water as the
old plants did, helping to keep water away from your foundation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I took up the linoleum in my attic floor. It took a lot of
work, and left a black mastic on the floor that is still sticky.
How can I remove it?
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY COSTELLO, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. One thing about that black mastic: On rare occasions, it
contains asbestos. If the mastic stays sticky, and you keep it wet,
this asbestos is safe. If in doubt, take a sample of the mastic to
an asbestos abatement company to determine if it contains absestos.
If it does, you can have the mastic removed professionally. If not,
remove it by soaking with paint thinner, which should dissolve it
enough so it can be soaked up with cloths. Dispose of those cloths
carefully; they can cause spontaneous combustion.
</P>
<P>
   Or, instead of using cloths, scrape with a wide, stiff putty
knife.

CONTAGIOUS HMO MYTHS A PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We don't pretend to have any magic answers to the problems of
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care or the ills that plague the American
medical system.
</P>
<P>
   But we've been struck during the debate over the HMO's fate by
all of the myths, misinformation, and questionable assumptions that
have been tossed around. Dubious statements get made and repeated,
and after a while they take on the aura of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the misinformation is spread by those who think they are
giving out straight dope. Some is being pushed by those who are
interested in advancing a particular political point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the result is worrisome. Garbage in will lead to
garbage out. Any solution to the problems of the HMOs and hospitals
will have to be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   The list of myths is a long one, but at least five strike us as
particularly important:
</P>
<P>
   --Myth No. 1: The HMOs got into trouble because, to gain market
share, they deliberately set prices too low.
</P>
<P>
   We can just imagine the discussions that were going on inside
HMOs two years ago: ``Hey guys. I have a great idea. Let's slash
the premiums way below costs, get much bigger, and lose a ton of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs did set their premiums too low. That is obvious now. It
was not so obvious at the front end. The HMOs, as well as others in
the health care world, were blindsided by their experience in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons no one can fully explain, medical costs rose very
slowly between 1994 and 1997. The HMOs looked at those numbers and
assumed that the future would look like the recent past. Big
mistake. When costs began to escalate, the HMOs were caught off
guard and were slow to react. In Harvard Pilgrim's case, the
problem was exacerbated by bad computer systems. You can't react to
losses if you don't know you are losing money.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs may have been dumb. They were not, however, engaged in
a conspiracy to destroy the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   --Myth No. 2: The hospitals are hurting solely because HMOs are
not paying them enough.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs probably aren't paying the hospitals enough. But if
that is true, they have plenty of company. The government, through
the Medicare and Medicaid programs, has also been stingy when it
comes to reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act. The measure
was designed to slow the growth in Medicare spending. It did that
and then some. According to the Congressional Budget Office,
Medicare spending rose 1.5 percent in 1998 but actually declined by
1 percent in 1999. Hospitals, which rely on Medicare for 35 percent
to 40 percent of their revenue, have been screaming about the
impact of the cuts for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the government program for the poor, has not been much
more generous. In Massachusetts, Medicaid pays 70 percent of the
bill for nursing home residents. Medicaid payments to the nursing
homes have been rising at about 2 percent to 3 percent a year. The
homes, some of which are operating under bankruptcy protection, say
they can't afford to hire adequate staff.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think that single-payer government health systems are
the answer to our medical problems, take note:
</P>
<P>
   Medicare and Medicaid are both single payers. If their
experience proves anything, it is that you can underfund health
care just as easily through the public sector as you can through
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   --Myth No. 3: Better regulation would have prevented Harvard
Pilgrim's failure.
</P>
<P>
   This one qualifies as a partial truth. The HMO's failure has
pointed up the need for better regulation: more timely reporting
rules, minimum capital requirements, maybe even a bailout fund.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to remember, however, that the banking industry
has all those protections in place, yet wasn't able to stop the
widespread failure of banks in Texas and New England in the late
1980s and early 1990s. Financial disasters tend to be like
earthquakes: There are some early rumblings of trouble, but not
much warning before all hell breaks loose.
</P>
<P>
   --Myth No. 4: Selling Harvard Pilgrim to a for-profit HMO would
be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Says who? For-profit HMOs are insurance companies. They don't
deliver health care. If a for-profit bought Harvard Pilgrim, it
would have to come in and establish relationships with the same
doctors and hospitals Harvard Pilgrim works with today. A newcomer
that adopted a slash-and-burn policy toward providers would have a
tough time gaining a foothold. It would also have a tough time
hanging on to customers, who could vote with their feet and join
other HMOs. Would you stay with an HMO whose slogan was ``Crummy
care at a slightly lower price?''
</P>
<P>
   --Myth No. 5: We can't afford to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to much of the discussion, you get the impression we
live in a Third World country that can't possibily afford to spend
another dime on medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as President Clinton said recently, ``The State of the
Union has never been better.'' Household incomes are climbing,
corporate earnings are up, and both the state and federal
governments are sitting on large surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   What is to prevent us _ as employers, employees, and taxpayers _
from digging deeper into our pockets and spending more for medical
care? Just as there is no free lunch, there are no free heart
transplants. If we want quality health care, we are going to have
to pay for it.

THE STREAK STRIKES FROM FAIRWAY TO RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ As he hit soft wedges at the driving range, Ed Fiori
may as well have been a solar system away from the madness that was
going on a short walk away. The golf world in which he resides is
nowhere near Tiger Woods's, though there was a weekend not long ago
when these golfers locked clubs.
</P>
<P>
   They call him ``The Grip'' for the way he holds his golf club,
his right hand twisted in such a manner that his palm points
skyward. It is unlike anything you will ever see on the PGA Tour,
so it should come as no surprise that Fiori also holds to a piece
of golf trivia that none of his colleagues can lay claim: he
outplayed Woods head-to-head in a final round.
</P>
<P>
   Fiori's career dates back to 1978, but a 47th birthday awaits
and he's taking aim at the Senior Tour. ``That's why I'm out here.
You still have to work, still have to keep going,'' said Fiori, who
had visions a couple of years ago of giving up the golf grind and
becoming a charter boat captain.
</P>
<P>
   Then something funny happened: he won a tournament and earned
another two-year exemption. It is a victory long forgotten, only
resurrected in the hoopla involving Woods's streak of six straight
PGA Tour wins.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)There he is on the range, the man who stared down
Woods.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I stared him down,'' said Fiori, a short, husky
man with a gentle smile. But Woods has led after 54 holes 12 times
in his brief career, and only lost once, Fiori was told. He smiled
again. ``He won't lose many more, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quad City Classic is a low-profile PGA Tour stop, but in
1996, three weeks in Woods's pro career, it drew national
attention. When the 20-year-old Woods assumed a one-shot lead
entering the final round, the golf world braced for the coronation.
Fiori made sure they would wait a bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was long. Longer than anyone I had ever seen,'' said Fiori,
who closed with a 68 to win that event.
</P>
<P>
   But the Woods who faded to fifth with a 72 is nothing like the
Woods who is making a mockery out of today's PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has matured. Absolutely. He is managing his golf game much
better,'' said Fiori, part of the field at this week's Buick
Invitational. ``I'm surprised he has won six straight, but God
bless him. It's great for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Six straight. Fiori absored that thought and shook his head. He
has needed 561 PGA Tour events to earn $2,247,886 in his 22-year
career. Woods made three times that amount with just 21 tournaments
in 1999. ``Amazing. Simply amazing,'' said Fiori, lofting another
easy wedge toward a practice pin 100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than 100 members of the media had crowded into
the Torrey Pines clubhouse to meet with Woods. A pro-am round that
had started at 6:42 a.m. with nine TV crews greeting Woods on the
first tee had ended with a ho-hum eagle (driver, mid-iron, 20-foot
putt) on the 498-yard 18th hole and now The Story was facing the
obligatory questions.
</P>
<P>
   He only thinks about the streak, said Woods, ``when you guys
bring it up.'' No, he said, it is not a priority for him, not when
compared to the number he most craves. ``The greatest record of all
is 18 professional majors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the streak, Woods was again asked. Can he match _ or surpass
_ Byron Nelson's mark of 11 straight? He shrugged, then relented,
as if he knew the question would come again and again until he gave
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can do it. If I play well, keep hitting the ball
well, keep making the putts, and, more importantly, have luck on my
side there is a chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The press conference went on with the leading man, but a search
of Torrey Pines _ a 36-hole municipal facility _ produced no
shortage of supporting actors in this drama.
</P>
<P>
   Fiori, for instance, who was still hitting balls, trying to keep
tuned up a career that awaits a rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon was a few spots from Fiori, trying to explain the
phenomenon. No doubt, he said, after he and his colleagues play the
first round the move to check out leaderboard will be swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know where Tiger is,'' said Faxon. ``It's
impressive stuff because he's taking down all challengers, whether
it's Ernie Els or Matt Gogel.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bryon Bell attracted attention. Back in junior high he
played golf with Woods and they've been friends ever since. Last
year, when Woods was in the midst of a breakup with caddie Mike
``Fluff'' Cowan, he called on Bell at this tournament. They teamed
for a trademark Woods charge _ coming from nine shots after 36
holes _ and ``he has a right to defend the championship, too,''
said Woods. So Bell will replace regular caddie Steve Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this one week, then it's back to work,'' said Bell, an
engineer on vacation from Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   He is never amazed by his friend, just at the attention it has
generated. But he isn't feeling an ounce of pressure, because, ``I
play such a small role out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's Tiger's Show _ as if there was ever any
doubt.

SKATERS CAN ONLY WATCH WHILE THEY RECOVER

   CLEVELAND _ They were wearing street clothes, killing time
backstage before the opening ceremonies at the US figure skating
championships inside Gund Arena. ``I feel that I should be getting
my skates on,'' Laura Handy was saying. Not this year, though. And
next year...who can say?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Binnebose, her pairs partner, still gets dizzy and loses
his balance on the ice. The left side of his face is still
paralyzed. His speech is slurred. ``But I've been doing very
well,'' Binnebose said. ``I haven't even been out of the hospital
as long as I was in.''
</P>
<P>
   After Binnebose crashed to the ice doing a practice lift and
fractured his skull last September, his family and friends feared
he would die in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His injury was so grave that doctors put Binnebose into a
drug-induced coma for 11 days. He lost nearly 50 pounds from a
180-lb. frame and developed life-threatening infections. ``If I
didn't have the weight to lose and my athletic resources to draw
upon, I probably would have died,'' said the 22-year-old Binnebose.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the 2002 Olympics were irrelevant. Making the world
team again this year was impossible. Even getting back to Nationals
was a pipe dream. For now, it is a victory for Binnebose to do a
simple spin without having the rink turn upside down on him. Lifts,
throws, jumps are out of the question. ``My neurologist says it's
too early,'' said Binnebose. ``I'm still feeling some concussionary
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   So he goes for physical therapy three days a week. Twice a week,
he has speech therapy. And twice a week, he lifts weights. ``Doing
dumbbell bench presses with 50 lbs. is an ego-buster,'' Binnebose
conceded. ``But it's a question of baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 19-year-old Handy, whom Binnebose shielded with his body
to cushion her tumble, it's a waiting game. His fate has become
hers. ``It's been difficult, because I really want to compete,''
she said. ``But I think we'll be back. I don't think it's a big
year to miss. It's not an Olympic year.''
</P>
<P>
   For the pairs, it's been a wipeout year. Danielle and Steve
Hartsell, the defending champions, went down for the season when
she fractured a kneecap in practice. So the event figures to be a
walkover for Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, last year's runnersup,
and an easy spot on the world team for Tiffany and Johnnie
Stiegler, who just missed last year. And for Tiffany Scott of
Hanson, Mass. and Philip Dulebohn, it could be a place on the
awards podium after two years of dues-paying.
</P>
<P>
   While their should-have-been rivals were lacing up Binnebose and
Handy walked out in blazer and gown to be recognized during the
ceremonies. ``I've never seen them before,'' said Binnebose. Then
they went up to watch with everybody else. ``I'm sure when the
final group goes on, it'll be difficult,'' mused Binnebose. ``I
think I'll have to be heavily medicated if I can't come back to
skating.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defending champions Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev
easily won Wednesday's original dance to remain ahead of newcomers
Jamie Silverstein and Justin Pekarek, last year's junior victors,
going into the free dance. ``I had a blast,'' said the 16-year-old
Silverstein, who'll make the world team with the 18-year-old
Pekarek if they hold their position. ``Everyone's taller here.''
</P>
<P>
   Climbing into third was the husband-and-wife team of Beata
Handra and Charles Sinek of Lexington, Mass., who had to sit out
the international season after because of botched eligibility
paperwork by the US association. ``It put us at a disadvantage,''
said the 31-year-old Sinek. ``So we have no benefit of the doubt
here. We'll be given no gifts. We have to earn it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Inside the Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop, the e-commerce
revolution seems improbable, like a setting ripped from a Robert
Louis Stevenson novel on the store's dusty shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Vincent McCaffrey would have it no other way. Hence, the
resident cat, Blue, who sleeps in the front window, the classical
music, and the hand-scrawled sign that says ``Please Touch The
Books.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the charming store encloses a hidden world, one where
touching the books is impossible, where silence reigns, and where
Blue is nothing more than a flickering image. It's called
AvenueVictorHugoBooks.com, and last year, it generated 6 percent of
McCaffrey's sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to survive, it's very simple: We have to have the
Web,'' said McCaffrey, peering down nearly empty aisles on a recent
afternoon. ``I've got 150,000 books here, and I might offend the
typical Bostonian by saying this, but there aren't enough people
here who read. That's just how the world is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Battered by chain stores and the on-line giant Amazon.com, one
out of every three of New England's independent booksellers has
created sophisticated yet quirky Web sites in the past two years in
an effort to lure patrons and keep their doors open.
</P>
<P>
   To their happy surprise, the reluctant on-line entrepreneurs are
finding cyberspace fertile beyond their wildest hopes, as readers
in Australia and Japan purchase what locals ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Many owners now admit that the Internet may mean the salvation,
and not the destruction, of their brick-and-mortar book nooks after
all.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, these famously disorganized
capitalists are finding out how tough it is to balance the digital
and the down-to-earth. Successful Internet ventures have begun to
distract owners from the business of selling books to walk-in
customers, eroding the character and charm that made independents
unique, many proprietors fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my bookstore to be the Wal-Mart of the Web,''
said Frank Kramer, owner of the esteemed Harvard Book Store in
Cambridge. ``We want the Web to drive people to our store, that's
the goal. The fact is, we have tremendous potential on the Internet
and could increase our sales tremendously, but we enjoy physical
retailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gloss, owner of the historic Brattle Book Shop, in downtown
Boston, takes great pains to ensure that walk-in customers get
treated as well as his on-line patrons, whose mounting orders take
more and more time to process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any books we put on the Web site we make sure to make
available in the store first,'' Gloss said. ``We don't want our
in-store customers to feel like they're left out.''
</P>
<P>
   What many proprietors are finding out is that loyal customers
were waiting for their chance to enjoy the convenience of on-line
shopping without having to buy books from the massive corporate Web
sellers like Barnes &AMP; Noble's on-line store bn.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shop on line because it's convenient, because I have to,''
said Frances Burke, a professor emeritus at Suffolk University, as
she bought a book at Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop. ``But whenever I
get the chance, I come to the bookstore. I need to touch and smell
the books.''
</P>
<P>
   As a cradle of the high-tech economy, the Boston area was
perhaps destined for the vanguard of on-line book selling.
Wordsworth.com, created in 1993, was the world's second on-line
bookstore, followed closely by Harvard.com, BrooklineBooksmith.com,
and a few others.
</P>
<P>
   But the movement was slow to take off, as shopkeepers either
could not afford to create a Web site or saw the creation of one as
a violation of their store's identity. In January 1996, only 10
shops in the region had Web sites, and two years later, 10 more had
joined them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, nearly 150 of the region's 470 independent
booksellers, many teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, have Web
sites, according to the New England Booksellers Association (NEBA).
That compares with 65 of the 325 stores in the Northern California
Independent Booksellers Association, the nation's other storied
association of bookstore proprietors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a six-fold increase in the past two years,'' said
Wayne ``Rusty'' Drugan, the NEBA's executive director. ``It's a
groundswell.''
</P>
<P>
   For some shops, the high-tech effort consists of little more
than a few pretty photographs, directions to the store, a telephone
number, and some staff recommendations of good reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to have a crew of 20 people working constantly to get
all my books on the Web site,'' said Gloss, whose site holds just a
smattering of his collection.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the resources to offer millions of titles like
Amazon.com, some owners have instead focused on recreating the
intangible qualities of their shops on-line. McCaffrey has a page
devoted to Blue, for instance. Gloss offers photos of handsome,
leatherbound tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual bookstores, they admit, are pathetic by comparison
with the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   On ``the computer screen, there's no texture, no depth,'' Kramer
said. ``I don't care how many graphics you have, it doesn't compare
to the table, the shelves, the overstock area, the books at the
front counter. That has a dimension computer screens cannot
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   To make up for the physical shortcomings of the Internet, many
storeowners have invested in Web sites that offer depth of stock,
on-line ordering, and other conveniences. Most now offer search
engines that allow surfers to comb entire store inventories, or
even to tap into databases of every book in print. In effect, many
tiny shops on the corner now have the capability of offerring the
same number of books as the massive retail chains like Barnes &AMP;
Noble, Borders, or Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsworth's general manager, Sanj Kharbanda, said his store's
Web site now holds about 1.2 million titles, enough variety to
bring in about 125 on-line sales a day. That converts to roughly 9
percent of total sales on a given day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, the minimum expectation is that we would
have a Web site, and being a bookstore, a search function has
become a necessary convenience,'' Kharbanda said.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Boston Book Company, which occupies a
less-than-glamorous second-floor stie in the city's Jamaica Plain
neighborhood, Internet sales now account for half the shop's sales,
co-owner Helen Kelly said. The reason, she said, is the plentiful
title list on the store's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Even the slickest home pages, however, seem hopelessly grounded
in the physical world, no matter how virtual the shopping
experience. Few independent booksellers take the time to create
customer profiles, or track shoppers' habits, and even fewer have
employees dedicated solely to working with on-line customers. As
Richard Howorth, president of the American Booksellers Association
and owner of a small bookstore in Mississippi, said, ``I have no
idea how many hits I get.''
</P>
<P>
   Such apparent disdain for mimicking the widely imitated
strategies of Amazon.com is apparent in other ways. Anirvan
Chatterjee, founder of Bookfinder.com, where on-line book buyers
browse inventories of thousands of independent bookshops around the
world, said on-line book indexes like his have helped independents
offer books that appear nowhere on their shelves.
</P>
<P>
   With such resources available to booksellers who go on-line,
there's plenty of financial sense in shuttering storefronts and
doing business solely in cyberspace, Chatterjee said.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, most have kept a foot in the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of sellers are finding that their on-line presence
subsidizes their storefront; that just warms my heart,'' Chatterjee
said. ``Book-selling is a great, historic tradition. Amazon.com is
not going to come along and change all that.''

Times critic Stephen Holden lauds it as perhaps ``the most
important American work of popular culture in the last 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And what sports fan hasn't seen ESPN anchor Dan Patrick praising
former quarterback John Elway in ads for Coors beer?
</P>
<P>
   It may be the media's fastest-growing ethical dilemma, the
phenomenon of the journalist doubling as a pitchman, using his or
her name to endorse a commercial product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a serious problem,'' says Dave Boeyink, an
associate journalism professor at the University of Indiana.
``We're in a profession where the line between news and
commercialism is important to draw. And that's getting thinner and
thinner.''
</P>
<P>
   In this era of media mergers and cross-pollination, it's no
surprise that the line between news and commercialism blurs,
providing new opportunities for full-time journalists who are
part-time radio talk hosts, ``Sopranos'' fans, and personalities
who straddle the journalism/celebrity line to become commercial
endorsers, sometimes for pay, sometimes gratis.
</P>
<P>
   Media ethicists agree with Boeyink that mixing news and commerce
by using a journalist's professional reputation to sell other
products to the public is a bad idea. And a number of news
organizations cite similar policies or guidelines. But in practice,
many cases fall between the cracks or land somewhere in a vast
expanse of gray area. As is typical of many thorny ethical issues,
media outlets can embrace higher standards while tolerating the
loopholes that allow them to be circumvented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not one of the big issues when were revamping the
(Society of Professional Journalists') code of ethics in 1995,''
says The Denver Post's Fred Brown, who serves as the society's
ethics chairman. ``But it certainly is proliferating.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the issue has been smoldering on the back burner for
some time. More than a decade ago, newswoman Linda Ellerbee created
a controversy when she shilled for Maxwell House coffee. In Boston,
a 1998 decision by WBZ-TV (Channel 4) and WCVB-TV (Channel 5) to
allow staffers to appear in a Jordan's Furniture video exhibit
designed to raise money for charity made headlines. Last year,
Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly's decision to do a beer ad
with a supermodel forced him to defend his ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest flap occurred a few years ago when venerable network
newsman David Brinkley became a pitchman for food-processing giant
Archer Daniels Midland. The fact that Brinkley had already retired
didn't dissuade his critics, including ``60 Minutes's'' Andy Rooney
who said Brinkley's move ``leaves the rest of us open to the
suspicion that we might be bought too.''
</P>
<P>
   That suspicion hasn't always functioned as a deterrent for
journalists caught up in the multimedia career path. Talk radio
hosts, for example, are often expected to read advertisements as
part of their duties. Aside from Fee's teeth brightening
testimonial, she and fellow Herald columnist Laura Raposa have also
read an ad for a jeweler. Fee also says their contract stipulates
that they do commercial spots if the station desires.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Herald columnist and WRKO-AM host Howie Carr has read
his share of on-air spots. Channel 4 sportscaster Bob Lobel, who
had done a testimonial spot for vision-correcting surgery, is
currently heard on a radio ad for fitness equipment that was
actually taped several years ago during his old WBZ radio show. (In
the early 1990s, this reporter, while working at The Boston Phoenix
and as a talk radio host, also read a number of commercials on the
radio.)
</P>
<P>
   Some journalist/talk hosts decline to do ads. ``I've been a
reporter for 20 years and reporters just don't do this,'' says
Herald columnist and WTKK host Margery Eagan, who won't read spots.
Globe staffer Doreen Iudica Vigue, who is leaving her weekend WRKO
show later this month, says she read one ad on the air before
deciding it was improper. ``I didn't want there to be any kind of
appearance of conflict of interest,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sopranos'' promotional spot, aired on HBO, featured
Holden, New York Post columnist Jack Newfield, and ABC
correspondent John Miller, each singing the show's praises. And
such luminaries as Florence Henderson, who co-hosts the NBC News
morning show ``Later Today,'' and ``CBS Sunday Morning'' host
Charles Osgood are allowed to do commercials thanks to agreements
they have with their network bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Citing concerns about the perception of conflict of interest,
New York Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen says Holden's ``Sopranos''
endorsement is ``not in accordance'' with the paper's policy ``and
he now knows it.'' According to the Globe's managing editor for
administration, Louisa Williams, ``we have a general understanding
that people who work here will not use their names, and by
extension, the Globe's name, to sell anything. I'm sorry to hear
that Doreen read the ad, but I'm glad that she had second thoughts
and realized it was improper.''
</P>
<P>
   Herald editor Andrew Costello says his paper does not prohibit
staffers from doing ads, saying ``it's a fairly widespread practice
in the radio industry and if we're allowing our people to work in
that industry, I'm not so sure we want to get into regulation.''
Carr feels ``a little queasy'' about his on-air ads, but says
``it's such an integral part'' of the radio business. And Fee would
draw the line at an ad that ``crossed into an area that was
something we covered all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, these decisions hinge on judgments about what constitutes
a conflict of interest. Lobel, who rejects a number of endorsement
opportunities, says, ``I never put the station in harm's way.'' And
Channel 4 news director Peter Brown concurs, saying his ad for
fitness equipment is OK because it is ``not for something he'll
ever report on.''
</P>
<P>
   Newfield sees no problem with the ``Sopranos'' spot because
``I'm not a TV writer. I'm a cityside politics muckraking
columnist.'' And ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy says, ``I don't know
that we'd call (Miller's appearance) an endorsement . . . John, as
a mob expert, has been asked . . . to make a judgment about how
realistic the portrayals of mobsters are in the Sopranos . . . We
sort of judge these things case by case.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Dan Patrick, and other ESPN personalities who have also done
commercials, ESPN senior vice president John Walsh says: ```The
policy is to avoid potential conflicts of interest within the
sports industry . . . We continually think about it and we
continually evaluate it.'' And Costello suggests he may reevaluate
the Herald's position, saying, ``the advertising thing is a new
issue and maybe we have to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter
Institute for Media Studies, says journalists ought to learn to
just say no. Ads are intended to ``capitalize on celebrity and
crediblity,'' he says. And ``frankly, I don't think news
organizations and journalists should allow that to happen.''

<P>
   MILFORD, Mass. _ On one hand, there is Erik Sullivan, third
grader: Sony Playstation aficionado, Rob Zombie music fan, and
``Goosebumps'' buff who earns Pokemon money by doing odd jobs in
his parents' Mexican restaurant here.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, there is Erik Per Sullivan, boy actor: the
youngest of four TV brothers in the new hit sitcom ``Malcolm in the
Middle,'' the sickly orphan in the current film ``The Cider House
Rules,'' and the performer-by-accident who's just been offered a
starring role in a soon-to-be-shot horror film titled ``Wendigo.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine, the star of ``The Cider House Rules,'' has called
Erik a ``treasure.'' Given a choice, Erik himself _ whose screen
name reveals his Swedish half _ would prefer to discuss, say, the
pleasures of playing Twisted Metal 4 over those of working with the
estimable Caine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really cool,'' he chirps about the video game one recent
morning. ``You're like a monster truck or that sort of thing, and
you pick up weapons and try to blow up other cars, and the main guy
is Sweet Tooth, who's like an ice cream truck with these pink spots
all over him, and on the top of the ice cream truck there's a big
white clown head that's on fire, and the name of the driver is
Needles, but that's not important, and . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Caine?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   That his 8-year-old head has apparently not been turned because
he has played opposite an Oscar winner and now appears on national
television on Sunday nights (8:30 p.m. on Fox _ WFXT-TV, Channel
25, locally) is likely due to Ann and Fred Sullivan's stated belief
that their son's life should be as unaffected as possible. For now,
anyway. ``We want to keep things normal for as long as we can,''
says Fred Sullivan, who works six days a week at the Alamo, the
eatery just off Interstate 495 that he and his wife opened early
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Erik, who usually converses in Swedish with his mother, is a
third-grader at the Milford Catholic Elementary School, where, his
teacher, Laura Micelotta, says, he's an A student. The family lives
modestly, renting half of a two-family home here and putting Erik's
earnings into a fund for his college education.
</P>
<P>
   But his parents know that their diminutive only child, who now
has both an agent and a manager, no longer leads the life of an
average 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, while filming the first 12 episodes of ``Malcolm in
the Middle'' in Los Angeles, he had an on-set tutor who faxed his
schoolwork to Micelotta. He will have a similar arrangement if he
signs to star in ``Wendigo,'' shooting of which is scheduled to
start next week in upstate New York. He has made four trips to Los
Angeles, two in one recent week, since initial filming of
``Malcolm'' ended. The show, a frenetic and edgy family sitcom in
which Erik plays a mousy kid named Dewey, is such a success that
Fox will begin shooting 16 more episodes next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young actors are in private schools or have home
schooling,'' Fred Sullivan concedes. ``And maybe there will be a
point where Erik has to do that. But for now, we want him to be
with his buddies as much as possible.'' If Erik signs to do
``Wendigo,'' however, he will segue into more episodes of
``Malcolm'' without a break.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot-tall 50-pounder, who says that one of his greatest
pleasures is playing with a gaggle of cousins, clearly wants to
maintain the buddy system. ``I just want to be a normal kid like
all my friends,'' he says. ``I like acting. I might want to be an
actor for a long time. But I still want to be able to see my
friends and that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's not easy. ``Derek and Kevin, they act like I'm a
normal kid,'' Erik says, referring to his two closest local
friends. ``But other people, sometimes they don't act like I'm a
normal kid. Like I can't have a peaceful lunch on Wednesdays,
because that's when all the classes get together to eat at my
school. The fifth and sixth graders are always asking me questions
and stuff. And I just want to be a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to Erik himself, it sometimes seems like the boy who dreams
seriously about making a movie with Jim Carrey isn't the same one
who says he's looking forward to learning advanced multiplication
in school. ``It does actually feel sometimes like I'm more than one
person,'' he says. ``When I watched `The Cider House Rules,'
(Fuzzy) looked so unlike me, because he was like all sick. And in
`Malcolm in the Middle,' (Dewey)'s supposed to be like 6 years old,
and I'm 8 1/2! And we have totally different personalities, Dewey
and I. Dewey is kind of mischievous. I'm not usually that way. And
he's into like Superman stuff, and I'm into music and
Playstation.''
</P>
<P>
   That Erik Per Sullivan exists on screen at all is the result of
chance as much as talent. He has had no acting lessons, unless you
count seven or so hours spent in a class for kids aspiring to act
in commercials. That came after a role as an extra in
``Armageddon,'' the 1998 action movie starring Bruce Willis. And
that came after Fred Sullivan, upon hearing a radio disc jockey
announce an open casting call for extras for the film while the
family was living in Dallas, suggested that his wife take Erik for
a tryout ``for something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Erik liked movies, especially ones that starred Carrey, but he
hadn't thought of them as something to appear in as well as watch.
``When I was little, I wanted to be a spy or a monster truck
driver,'' he explains. ``Later, I just thought movies would be like
a good hobby or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the family traveled to Ann Jakobsson Sullivan's
native Sweden. If plans to open a restaurant there had
materialized, Erik's nonspeaking part in ``Armageddon'' would
likely have been remembered as merely a family footnote. After the
Swedish restaurant didn't happen, the Sullivans stopped to visit
relatives in the Boston area _ Fred Sullivan is originally from
Scituate _ on their way back to Texas. They learned about a casting
call in Northampton for ``The Cider House Rules,'' an adaptation of
John Irving's World War II-era novel that focuses on an orphanage
in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of nervous that I wouldn't get a part 'cause of the
thousands of people who were waiting in a long, long line,'' Erik
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He got the part. He plays Fuzzy Stone, age 6, an orphan with
underdeveloped lungs who lives in a humidified tent. Irving, who
wrote the screenplay for ``The Cider House Rules'' as well as the
novel, declared in a memoir: ``In every scene he was in, Erik was
more Fuzzy than Fuzzy. . . . He was a gift to the film.'' What Erik
remembers most about making the movie, which was filmed in Western
Massachusetts, is regularly conversing in Swedish with director
Lasse Hallstrom. ``Nobody else could understand us!'' he says
gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   If Erik hasn't had any formal acting lessons, he thinks he's
nevertheless reaped the benefits of something just as good: martial
arts. Although his acting has put his tae kwon do on hold, he's a
first-degree black belt with a shelf of trophies in his bedroom.
``I went to karate for about four years, and I learned a lot about
focus and listening very good,'' he points out. ``Karate is good
for teaching you to do what you're supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What Erik will do with the rest of life is as uncertain as it is
for any 8-year-old. ``If he receives a score of 100, he wants to
know how he can get 105,'' says his teacher, Micelotta. ``He puts
lot of pressure on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's less concerned about the road ahead. ``I mean, who
knows what kinds of jobs there could be in store for me?'' he asks.
``Salesman? Flight manager? Pilot? I doubt I'd want to be one of
those, but who knows what could happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Erik Sullivan yawns. ``Sorry,'' he apologizes, smiling. ``I was
up at 6:38 this morning playing Playstation.''

divorce from his wife of 18 years, the Friends of Newt GIngrich PAC

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Friday's performance of ``The Liar'' by the Antaeus Company
in North Hollywood, Calif., had all the makings of a classic
preview night from hell.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of actors were still learning their lines, a piece of
the set refused to stay put, and the leading role changed hands at
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, was this production of Juan Ruiz de Alarcon's
17th-century comedy _ apparently the first fully staged adaptation
ever seen in the United States _ such an exhilarating and promising
experience?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies partly in the sheer pleasure of seeing Antaeus,
an ambitious, demonstrably talented classical theater company, take
up residence in a North Hollywood warehouse, which it plans to
convert into its permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a pilot program of the Mark Taper Forum, Antaeus has
grown slowly and steadily, producing a handful of well-regarded
shows such as its production of Chekhov's ``The Wood Demon'' while
also taking part in numerous workshops and play readings.
</P>
<P>
   Now the actor-driven troupe turns its considerable skills to a
neglected near-masterpiece written by a semi-obscure Mexican-born
playwright who cast his cool, humorous eye on the foibles of Madrid
high society in Spain's golden age.
</P>
<P>
   Smartly and accessibly translated into rhyming verse by Antaeus
co-founder Dakin Matthews from Alarcon's original Spanish text ``La
verdad sospechosa'' (``The Truth Can't Be Trusted''), the play is a
classically plotted three-act comedy centering on a handsome,
charming young man, Don Garcia, who simply can't tell the truth _
not to his flustered father, Don Beltran (Marcelo Tubert), nor his
wily servant Tristan (Matthews), nor to Jacinta (Nike Doukas), the
beautiful young lady he adores, and certainly not to her jealous
suitor, Don Juan de Sosa (a splendid Richard Miro), who always
enters the stage to a fiery burst of flamenco guitar to match his
smoldering machismo.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that Don Garcia is a rogue, certainly not as
played by J.D. Cullum, the googly-eyed actor who brought his
ingenuous, disarming brand of good humor and expressive physical
shtick to last summer's Getty Center production of Frank Dwyer's
``The Affliction of Glory: A Comedy About Tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted in Astro-turf colored knickers, Cullum's Don Garcia
isn't a Moliere-style cynic, but an exuberant aristocrat carried
away by artistic flights of fancy that lead him to recount
Rabelaisian banquets and swashbuckling exploits that occur only in
his mind. Filling the role on short notice, Cullum occasionally
lost his grip on Alarcon's colloquial poetry, but never on his own
facile charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few verbal missteps here and there, which surely
will disappear as the run continues, the Antaeus ensemble gave
evidence of its own classical polish, impressively orchestrated by
director Anne McNaughton. Doukas, an accomplished performer with
South Coast Repertory and the Old Globe (as well as Cullum's
beautiful co-star in ``Affliction'') demonstrated her sure touch
with cerebral comedy, as did Julia Fletcher in the role of the
chaste Lucretia, Don Garcia's other (inadvertent) love interest.
Matthews is just about perfect as the perceptive manservant
Tristan, and Dean Cameron's set design of arrases framing a
curtained entrance/exit is simple and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Here's wishing good fortune to a company that's likely to be a
sparkling new addition to Valley theater _ and that's no lie.

JEFFERSON AND HEMINGS: THE SLAVE WHO LOVED ME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until SUNDAY, Feb. 13; tonight is SUNDAY in this
review of ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal,'' ``Homicide: The
Movie,'' and ``It's Black Entertainment; all times PST, please
check times in your area. Fact box below). 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are so many compellingly conflicted emotions and roiling
issues pulsing through the CBS miniseries ``Sally Hemings: An
American Scandal'' that to ultimately couch it as a sweeping love
story seems something of a cop-out. But that's network TV for you.
This is ``Roots'' reimagined as ``The Thorn Birds,'' but darned if
they don't let some intelligence seep through occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Even the opening lines sound like a romance novel, not a
highlight of Black History Month. ``I was born to slavery but
destined to scandal,'' Sally Hemings (Carmen Ejogo) tells us in a
voice-over while she plays innocently on a swing; already, you're
searching for the remote. But the film finds its footing as it
conjoins Hemings and Thomas Jefferson (Sam Neill) smoothly and
credibly (in an artful conceit, mirrors play a key role in their
introductions and subsequent meetings).
</P>
<P>
   Hemings and Jefferson became close while he was America's
ambassador in France and he tutored her; even though she could have
remained in France a free woman, she returned home with him,
carrying his child. The film gives her an added incentive to return
to America _ the French Revolution is tearing up the countryside
around them; in fact, were it not for a well-read and fortuitously
located peasant rioter who knew the ambassador's essays on freedom,
``Hemings'' suggests, there may have never been a President
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Monticello Association, official protectors of
the Jefferson legacy, rejected the notion that Jefferson and
Hemings had children together, despite the claims of Hemings'
ancestors and the historical record suggesting that many plantation
owners helped themselves to their slaves. The interesting question
is, from what did they think they were defending Jefferson? The
charge that he slept with and perhaps loved a black woman, or that
he used his power to dominate someone in a subordinate position? It
all became a moot point in 1998, when tests suggested that Hemings'
and Jefferson's ancestors shared the same DNA.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, our lovers have, shall we say, many issues to
work out. Him: A highly respected statesman who risks derision and
national censure by loving a woman barely considered a second-class
citizen, tormented by the fact that his infant nation is years from
accepting the truths in its own Declaration of Independence. Still,
he perpetuates his own dilemma by owning scores of slaves himself
and treating his own children by her as servants. Her: A young
woman, given privileges unheard of among those in her class and
spurning her race by declaring love for a man who enslaves them,
who could change everything for her and her people but doesn't. And
we think Clinton's relationships were hopelessly dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Tina Andrews frequently addresses these nettlesome
issues in a series of impassioned scenes between the lovers. ``You
cannot come to my bed, then go to your white Congress and do
nothing about this plague on my people,'' Sally boldly scolds
Jefferson at one point. Trouble is, yes he can. ``You don't hate
me, you love me,'' he replies after one roundelay, and that settles
it, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   But it couldn't have, really. Andrews knows this is where the
heart of her drama lies, but can't quite resolve their impasses
philosophically, just lushly and carnally. Instead, she sets up
external villains _ Jefferson's prudish daughter Martha (Mare
Winningham), a ludicrously foppish journalist who hounds Jefferson
about his mistress _ and rushes through Jefferson's presidency so
that the country's reaction goes relatively unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   Director Charles Haid opts to divert our attention away from
these prickly problems by staging a lot of ornate party sequences
with large groups of extras gaily milling about that give this a
sense of spectacle without contributing to the real drama at hand.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this probably would've been better had it been shaved
down an hour or so. The stately pace serves the edict that
miniseries have a certain amount of bombast, but not the subject
matter itself, and after hour three, which addresses the crux of
their paradox with the most immediacy, the final hour (warning:
distracting elderly-folks makeup) just sort of peters out.
</P>
<P>
   Ejogo makes for a wonderfully empathetic romantic heroine,
delicate yet headstrong; when Jefferson tells her early on, ``My
instincts tell me you have a good mind,'' they've barely met, but
the flash in her eyes and her presence ensure that it's more than
just a come-on line. There's a little too much effort to make Ejogo
glamorous _ it's a little strange halfway through when her grown
children look as old as she does.
</P>
<P>
   Neill, who can be a kind of jittery, caffeinated actor, relaxes
here; he's always good at making the best of a bad scene or line of
dialogue, and that serves him well a few times here. On the whole,
``Sally Hemings'' does what's required in terms of formulaic
television, but had it aspired for a little more, it could've been
a true TV event. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``HOMICIDE: THE MOVIE''
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide: the Movie'' opens with Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto),
running for mayor of Baltimore on a legalize-drugs platform _
Baltimore may be the only city where that strategy would actually
make a candidate the front-runner. When he's gunned down at a
campaign appearance, there's the requisite montage in which cast
members of the acclaimed TV series learn of the news and, no matter
what they were doing, turn up in the squad room, ready for action.
Bringing everyone back tends to be an unwieldy piece of overkill,
because there's simply not enough time for everyone to contribute
meaningfully.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, the film focuses on former partners Pembleton (Andre
Braugher, an Emmy winner for this role) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor,
nicely underplaying opposite Braugher's commanding bravado), who
investigate in an unofficial fashion. Except for a shocker halfway
through, it is their scenes that carry the most resonance.
</P>
<P>
   There's a little too much strolling down memory lane _
characters too often say, ``Wasn't that when ...'' which is
invariably followed by quick flashbacks to episodes from the show.
And the jittery editing style has become a little affected at this
point _ you know it's gone too far when one character even dreams
in that manner. The movie also seems to have a problem knowing when
to wrap things up _ there seems to be no fewer than four endings.
Still, it's largely arresting. (Before the film, Court TV will
present the series' final two episodes at 6 p.m.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``IT'S BLACK ENTERTAINMENT''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Black Entertainment'' offers a sterling if incomplete
compilation of rare and famous footage of African-American
entertainers doing what they do best. Divided into seven segments
ranging from dance (highlighted by an amazing sequence by the
Nicholas brothers, Fayard and Harold, from the film ``Stormy
Weather'') to hip-hop, it's a scattershot journey that leaves the
viewer ready to see more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment'' ranges from the sublime _ Billie Holiday
(whose name is misspelled just as someone laments her struggle for
respect), Josephine Baker, Lena Horne, Louis Armstrong and Nat King
Cole _ to the curious (a one-legged tapper named ``Crip'' Heard).
From the ebullience of the performances, one would never guess at
the racism that the early, ground-breaking entertainers endured
when not on stage, but on-camera interviewees provide perspective
(though they ladle the superlatives on a bit too thickly).
</P>
<P>
   The focus on film seems a tad arbitrary, since many of the clips
are from rare short films featuring performers who otherwise
weren't movie stars. It also makes for some glaring omissions, such
as John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and a host of
contemporary jazz musicians, not to mention Whatever Prince Calls
Himself Today (who, in fact, did several films). But what is

   PAIK-VIDEOART (New York) _ No one has taken the measure of that
awesome monster television with more audacious ingenuity than Nam
June Paik, the Korean-born electronics wizard who started his
career in Germany as a renegade musician. With boundless energy and
manic obsession, he has made television his own subversive
creature, pushing it beyond the banalities of network and cable
into the realm of art and critique. Now, at 68, has Paik peaked?
Not a bit of it, as proved by ``The Worlds of Nam June Paik,'' his
first American retrospective since 1982, at the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum. By Grace Glueck.

   GREENBRIER (White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.) _ ``So do I need to
curtsy when I go in?'' Gabriela wanted to know. Gabriela, my
daughter, is a month shy of 10 and has been to places like
Versailles and Blois. So her awed reaction surprised me. I had just
shown her the brochures for the Greenbrier, the grand old
6,500-acre resort 2,000 feet up in the mountains of West Virginia.
Instead of a quiet weekend at home, Gabriela wanted nothing less
than Disney World; I wanted a spa. So we came up with a Disney
World of sorts: a step back in time known as the Greenbrier. By
Elaine Sciolino.

WINTER IS NO THREAT TO THESE VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There it was, glistening in the Saturday sun: a stretch of ice
about 1,000 feet long and 150 feet wide, rutted in places,
Zamboni-smooth in others, a small hill in the middle, and about 6
inches of crusty snow running along one side. Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Our mission this day in East Taunton was to test drive about 25
cars, SUVs, and trucks and, at the end of the day, name the New
England Motor Press Association's Best Winter Vehicles for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The testing came at an auspicious time for me. Not long after
our first big snowfall a couple of weeks back, I was hit with a
steady stream of mail and e-mail asking a common question: What's a
good car for winter?
</P>
<P>
   It used to be the choices were limited to some kind of truck or
Jeep with four-wheel drive. Used to be. Now, it's a tougher
question because you can get everything from a midget SUV to a van
to high-performance sports cars and sedans that do just fine when
the going gets deep or slick.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't take many of the vehicles I drove out onto nearby Route
44, which was dry and heavy with traffic. I figured I'd put the
cars through their tests right there on the ice and in the snow. I
did a series of tests with each: braking on ice, pushing through
snow, starting from a stop midway up the icy hill, and putting each
vehicle into a deliberate spin that could turn into several spins.
</P>
<P>
   I'll get the braking out of the way in short order: ABS is
amazing. Every ABS-equipped vehicle, rolling down the ice at about
25 miles per hour, came to a straight, controlled stop when I
jammed the brakes and held them. I even (do not try this yourself)
took my hands off the wheel each time I hit the brakes and let the
vehicle go where the brakes would take it _ which was straight
ahead. Hard to pick a favorite when it comes to braking.
</P>
<P>
   But in other tests, certain vehicles were quite impressive. My
favorites (you get the New England Motor Press list at the end of
this column):
</P>
<P>
   BMW X5 _ This is a high-performance highway machine (155 m.p.h.
top end) that is also an SUV. You read that right. It rolled
through the snow as if it weren't there. On the uphill ice test,
its traction-control system was superb and no slippage occurred as
it rolled to an easy start. In the spin-out test, countersteering
and a gentle nudge of the gas pulled it right back onto the
intended line.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo V70 XC station wagon _ This may be the perfect New England
winter car. Snow doesn't bother it. On the hill test, you could
feel power transfer from wheel to wheel almost like it was walking
its way up the hill. Its stability system is so good it was hard to
get it into a full spin and very easy to escape it once induced.
And this is one comfortable, utilitarian automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Saab 9-5 station wagon _ Another fine car, using front-wheel
drive and a ``Winter'' setting that provides power carefully to the
front wheels so they don't slip going up hill. It creeps, in fact.
Good through the snow, a bit easier to put into a spin than the
Volvo, but pulls itself out equally well.
</P>
<P>
   Audi A-8 Quattro _ This is a high-performance sedan. It is also
an all-wheel-drive luxury car whose limits in snow are those
imposed only because it sits low like a sedan should. On ice, it
had to be pushed to spin and pulled itself out of the spin like a
string drawn taught. The icy hill was no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Tundra _ A V8 pickup with an empty bed is not usually the
best of snow machines. It did fine in the snow, though, and even on
the ice, while it was not as sure-footed as some of the others, its
four-wheel-drive system pulled it up the hill with ease. It was a
bit more skittish in the spin test _ it took a couple of
countersteers to get it back in line _ but it's a pickup truck with
no weight in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Land Cruiser _ This one's rugged, heavy, plush _ and very
nimble. It crunched through the snow, crept up the icy hill with
nary a spinning wheel, and though its top-heavy weight let it enter
a spin with not a lot of effort, it was easily corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru Legacy GT Limited _ Maybe the most surprising car of the
day, this is a fine, near-luxurious sedan. All-wheel-drive system
was right there on a par with the Audi, and you could buy two of
these for what the Audi cost and have money left over.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru Outback _ Super car. I remember when Subaru wagons were
cheap tin boxes with idiosyncratic timing belts. No more. The
Outback, all wheels driving, handled the snow effortlessly, crept
up the icy hill with ease, fought right back as I tried to get it
into a spin and, even after I won that battle, was easily put back
on course.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep Wrangler _ Top-heavy, short, stiff yet bouncy, the Jeep did
far better in the tests than I thought it would. It did go into a
spin more easily than the others, but a couple of countersteers and
judicious use of the gas got it straightened out. A bit of slip on
the hill test, but once rolling, it crawled right on up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here's how the wheeled wags and oily wretches of the New
England Motor Press Association voted at day's end:
</P>
<P>
   --Official Winter Vehicle of New England: BMW X5
</P>

DICAPRIO PLAYS A WHINY ROTTER IN `THE BEACH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All those teenage fans who have been breathlessly waiting for
Leonardo DiCaprio's follow-up to ``Titanic'' are likely to be
disappointed by ``The Beach.'' The Hollywood golden boy plays a
liar, a coward and a weakling, who, when the chips are down, is
also a big crybaby.
</P>
<P>
   Others might find the movie a bit more interesting. It doesn't
really come off, but it's an admirably ambitious, and mostly very
engaging, coming-of-age adventure that apes the spirit of Joseph
Conrad (and Hollywood's most famous Conrad adaptation, ``Apocalypse
Now'').
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio plays Richard, a young American backpacker alone in
wicked Bangkok who is given a map by an older and seemingly crazed
expat (Robert Carlyle) that supposedly will lead him to a secret
island off the southern coast of Thailand containing ``a perfect
beach'' _ a veritable paradise on earth.
</P>
<P>
   In the company of a French couple (Virginie Ledoyen and
Guillaume Canet), Richard impulsively follows the map to a tiny
island just north of Ko Samui, where he finds a commune of young
exiles who have founded a ``beach resort for people who don't like
beach resorts'' _ and jealously guard the secret of the place.
</P>
<P>
   The trio are accepted by the tribe of pleasure-seekers, and, for
a while, live out their wildest fantasy of paradise. But,
gradually, a combination of sexual jealousy, paranoia, neighboring
drug farmers and the harsh reality of life rears its head, and the
hero finds himself descending into a heart of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a novel by Alex Garland by the ``Trainspotting''
team (director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew Macdonald, writer John
Hodge), the film treats us to a gallery of gorgeous Thai scenery
and half-naked young bodies, several scenes of nailbiting tension,
and two of Boyle's trademark comic-fantasy sequences.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the film, its pseudo-Conradian edge, and its running
homage to ``Apocalypse Now'' _ including an actual scene from that
film, the famous whirling ceiling fan opening, and non-stop,
hard-boiled voice-over narration (everything but the Doors on the
soundtrack) _ is fun.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his character engenders little sympathy or movie
star sparkle, DiCaprio also gives a strong and relatively
unmannered character performance that holds the movie together.
He's simply one of the very best young actors of his generation,
and he's not afraid to take chances and break the ``rules'' of
movie stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, however, the various themes the film explores _ the
impossibility of ``escape'' anywhere on the planet, the frustrated
thirst for high adventure in a generation that lives largely in
cyberspace _ never comes together with any emotional satisfaction
or even much sense, and it all falls apart badly in the final act.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, one senses a war going on between the needs of
artistic-minded filmmakers with a grim vision and the demands of a
big-budget star vehicle. By the time the film works to its clumsy
``author's message'' and non sequitur happy ending, the Hollywood
sensibility seems to have triumphed, and the movie rings terribly
false.
</P>
<P>

`HOLY SMOKE' PRESENTS WOMAN'S VIEW OF SEXUAL POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a rule, whether you love or hate Jane Campion's idiosyncratic
films (``The Piano,'' ``The Portrait of a Lady''), depends upon
gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke'' will certainly fuel that divisive argument
because it's deliciously designed to have its share of ardent
admirers and just as ardent critics.
</P>
<P>
   But oddly, the film, written by the New Zealand director and her
sister, writer and director Anna Campion (``Loaded''), transcends
gender lines despite its subject matter. It's a funny, insightful
film that has feminist undertones without overwhelming its story
and characters.
</P>
<P>
   It's kin to the anarchic Lina Wertmuller film, ``Swept Away,''
and, obliquely, to Ken Russell's ``Castaway,'' in that two people
are thrust together in an exotic place that is both paradise and
hell. But it avoids any stridency and an underlying, alienating
core of class-loathing and disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke'' could only have been written by a woman. It's
told distinctly from a woman's view _ in this case a young woman
possessed of great beauty _ and how she is perceived in a world
that can't see past her looks despite her insistance upon forging
out into it to discover her place.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth (a terrific Kate Winslet) goes searching for spiritual
enlightenment to the slums of Delhi, India, far from her staid and
conservative Australian home. She joins an ashram presided over by
a charismatic guru and finds contentment in her calling until her
mother and quintessentially odd ``Australian'' family embark upon
their own ``we know better'' quest to bring the ``golden girl''
home.
</P>
<P>
   The family hires a spiritual expert _ ``exiter'' P.J. Waters
(Harvey Keitel) _ to pull her back from perceived oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   What begins with typical Campion oddity _ and of all Campion's
films, ``Holy Smoke'' most reminds us of her 1989 breakthrough
movie, ``Sweetie'' _ turns into a compelling roundelay and war
between the pair as they are sequestered in an outback ``halfway
house'' hut in the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, a slick, creased and pressed American cowboy, quotes The
Upanishads and Socrates and Ruth taunts him for not having the
heart to have original thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses her as a baby _ albeit a very sensual one _ and
ignores her well-thought out counter attacks, staying cool in his
``I know better'' pose. ``I get strength from my choice,'' she
tells him, and he retorts, ``That's what we're here to discern _
whether it was your freedom of choice.'' Yet Ruth slowly whittles
away at his veneer and in front of our eyes, the power shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke'' is a visually ravishing, eerily isolating,
sometimes wild in its views of sexual politics and plays with our
notions of obsession and adulation. More, it's a sociological
expedition into culture _ eastern and western _ power, age and the
objectification of beauty, especially feminine beauty.
</P>
<P>
   It's a twistedly funny film as well. It revels in the absurdity
of sex and chafes against easy confinement in pat and presumed
roles.
</P>
<P>
   After its power struggles and after violence that occurs because
compromise seems impossible and submission is the only out, Campion
allows both Ruth and P.J. their dignity. She strikes a perfect
chord that allows both to redefine their lives and achieve a sort
of enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Smoke. Directed by Jane Campion. Written by Jane and Anna
Campion. Cast: Kate Winslet, Harvey Keitel. Miramax Films. 115
minutes. Rated R for nudity, language, sexual content.

`TIGGER' IS A TREAT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1925, a writer named A.A. Milne watched his young son,
Christopher Robin, invent a child's enchanted world consisting of
his collection of stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by his wife, Daphne, Milne wrote the first Winnie the
Pooh story, based upon the boy's imaginative interactions with the
toys, and published it in the London Evening News on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five years later, the adventures of Winnie the Pooh and
his friends, set in the Hundred Acre Wood, are still favorites
among children everywhere. And this new Disney animated feature
makes it's pretty easy to see why.
</P>
<P>
   Though Tigger is the star of this first full-length feature
animated film (the Pooh gang has starred previously in three
featurettes, the last made 17 years ago), Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet,
Kanga and Roo support him ably.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Tigger is aching to venture deep into the forest to
find his family tree. He's lonely ``being an only'' and can't find
anyone to bounce with. Despite his friend's efforts to cheer him,
he glumly insists there must be more Tiggers out there just waiting
to be united together. The yearning leads the friends on an
adventure that will prove to Tigger that family can consist of more
than blood ties and, indeed, sometimes very best friends who have
stripes of a different color will do the job perfectly well, if not
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' is a delightful mix of songs, composed by
Richard and Robert Sherman, and of scenery that carefully
replicates the books' original line drawings by E.H. Shepard.
Director Jun Falkenstein and Art Director Toby Bluth insist they
were careful to retain the integrity of the published volumes
rather than try to modernize or alter such a successful formula.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with John Hurt's whimsical narration and the voice
talent of Jim Cummings, who supplies the vocal personality for both
Tigger and Winnie the Pooh, the gentle message of ``The Tigger
Movie'' makes it a positive film for kids and adults. Like last
year's overlooked-but-wonderful ``The Iron Giant,'' it is both
sophisticated and elemental enough for all ages to grasp the moral
and message and, if a preview screening packed with kids of all
ages as well as grownups is an indication, dampen a few eyes as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigger Movie. Directed and written by Jun Falkenstein. With
the voices of John Hurt, Jim Cummings, Tom Attenborough. Walt
Disney Pictures. 76 minutes. Rated G.

`BIG TEASE' IS MODERATELY AMUSING, BUT MOSTLY FORGETTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I admit I was one of those reviewers who found Scottish
actor-turned-director Kevin Allen's 1997 black comedy, ``Twin
Town,'' cruel and unusually repellent punishment.
</P>
<P>
   So it's with some relief that I can report his second effort,
``The Big Tease,'' is, if not a great movie, at least gentler in
spirit and void of its predecessor's painful and mean-spirited
heartlessness at the expense of its characters (and animals).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Tease'' is an innocuous, hit-and-miss affair that,
despite a predictable ```Rocky' in curlers'' story line, remains
modestly amusing. It stars Craig Ferguson, who is featured on
television's ``The Drew Carey Show,'' as hairdresser Crawford
Mackenzie, Glasgow's premiere coiffure artist.
</P>
<P>
   When Crawford receives a letter from the prestigious World
Freestyle Hairdressing Championship in Los Angeles, he mistakenly
believes he's been asked to participate, not just attend. Armed
with a documentary film crew and his shampoo, he flies off to the
City of Angels where, he believes, he will make his mark on the
blow-dried beautiful people and find glory for Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's rejected because he doesn't have the proper
credentials and, in his pursuit of recognition, makes an enemy or
two along the way. Certainly everything under the sun happens to
the poor innocent but, being the movies, he will conquer adversity
and find a bevy of friends to help him.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford meets everyone from super agent Candy Harper (Frances
Fisher), who he advises on her hair care products, a wacky limo
driver and screenwriter (Donal Logue), to a dastardly malevolent
competitor, last-year's champion stylist Stig Ludwiggssen (David
Rasche).
</P>
<P>
   While Ferguson is certainly likable and amiable, and the film
has its charms, it is also sloppily made and so whimsical that it
lives up to Ferguson's comments, in the press notes, that ``the
idea came to him over lunch.'' ``The Big Tease'' is as memorable as
a fast food meal, fading from memory as rapidly as the vapors from
a can of hair spray dissipate in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Tease. Directed by Kevin Allen. Written by Sacha
Gervasi, Craig Ferguson. Cast: Craig Ferguson, Frances Fisher, Mary
McCormack, Davis Rasche. Warner Bros. 86 minutes. Rated R for
language.

`SNOW DAY' MELTS INTO DUMB KIDDIE FLICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea behind the Nickelodeon-produced kid's movie, ``Snow
Day,'' is the varying impact (joy for most kids, misery for most
parents) of a ``snow day'' _ a day in which school has been
officially canceled because of a heavy snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   It's an original and rather clever premise, but first-time
director Chris Koch doesn't do anything with it. It's one more
innocuous but thoroughly routine baby-sitter that panders to its
audience with a string of bad-taste gags.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Syracuse, N.Y., during one 24-hour period, the script
follows four separate plot-lines and four members of one family:
</P>
<P>
   First off is Natalie (Zena Gray), a precocious pre-teen who
lives in her own fantasy world, and is quickly involved in a
surreal campaign to prolong the snow day by preventing the snowplow
man from clearing the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Natalie's older brother Hal (Mark Webber), who has
the impossible dream of winning the heart of a shallow high school
princess who has just broken up with her thick-headed, vindictive
jock boy-friend.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the kids' workaholic mother (Jean Smart) whose
forced isolation on the snow day causes her to lose her company's
market share of the Asian cola market but allows her to spend some
quality time with her troubled third child.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there's Dad (Chevy Chase), a long-suffering,
under-appreciated TV weatherman who first predicted the snowstorm
but lost the credit to his slick, no-nothing competitor on the
other, higher-rated channel.
</P>
<P>
   The film zips between these four story lines, alternately
straining to be funny, tender, anarchistic and gross _ and
counter-pointing every gesture to a (mostly inappropriate)
wall-to-wall pop score.
</P>
<P>
   The top-billed name of Chevy Chase connotes a certain kind of
comedy, and this film doesn't deliver it _ or even try. So it's
deceptive, and Chase's fans are likely to be appalled by the kiddy
movie in store for them.
</P>
<P>
   Chase himself looks long-in-the-tooth and _ unless it's my
imagination _ carries in his manner an air of sadness, defeat and
even bitterness. Like he'd rather be anywhere else but this dumb
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Snow Day. Directed by Chris Koch. Written by Will McRobb and
Chris Viscardi. Cast: Chevy Chase, Jean Smart, Zena Gray, Mark
Webber. Nickelodeon/Paramount. 95 minutes. Rated PG for brief mild
peril and language.

`HISTORICAL FICTION' OF JEFFERSON AFFAIR SERVES NEITHER PURPOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea of ``historical fiction'' is inherently oxymoronic, but
it is irresistible to the creative community nonetheless. Until
technology allows us to record for posterity every utterance, every
thought, every gesture, it will remain so. Writers and filmmakers
will constantly wonder what really happened and what might have
been, and they will fill in history's blank spots with their own
suppositions, interpretations and agendas.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS film ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal'' provides
plenty of rich filling over a soapy two-night run commencing Sunday
and resuming Wednesday. Hemings is the light-skinned African
American slave whose long-alleged intimacy with Thomas Jefferson
has been borne out by modern DNA testing. Jefferson evidently
fathered seven children by Hemings, five of whom are known to have
survived to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what kind of relationship Jefferson had with Hemings is
impossible to know. Was it a brutal master/slave thing? A tender
widower/mistress affair? Writer and co-executive producer Tina
Andrews leans toward the latter, etching Hemings delicately,
Jefferson paradoxically.
</P>
<P>
   As entertainment, though, ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal''
is enormously frustrating. Just as Jefferson privately lacked the
courage of his public convictions, the film ultimately lacks the
cohesion that would make it a ringing statement of artistic
attitude. In trying to cover more than 30 years in the lives of
Jefferson and Hemings, who was 16 when she had her first child with
Jefferson and 49 when Jefferson died, director Charles Haid
achieves breadth at the expense of depth. The film's obvious rally
cry _ that we are all from the same family of man _ is diluted for
want of better storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the luxury of two nights, many TV films, especially
those of the ``epic miniseries'' variety, are shortchanged by the
time limits and artificial pacing required by commercial networks.
``Sally Hemings'' was originally conceived as a one-night film,
which is just 88 minutes minus commercials. Even at twice the
length, it is tightly crammed with a string of historic vignettes _
some real, many imagined _ that hit the target the way a quiverful
of arrows might if they were all shot at the same time from the
same bow.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't completely diminish an impressive performance by
British actress Carmen Ejogo, who invests Sally Hemings with the
sort of intelligence and charm American TV audiences expect in
their protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   But it does weaken Sam Neill's Jefferson, who exhibits none of
the genius of the man, existing instead in a state of quiet
confusion that persists no matter if he's dancing with Sally at
Versailles, walking the grounds of Monticello or celebrating the
Louisiana Purchase at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The ``scandal'' of the title refers to newspaper reports of the
Jefferson/Hemings relationship that circulated during Jefferson's
first term as president. Though stung by the accusation that he was
morally bankrupt, Jefferson never answered it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps appropriately, ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal''
never answers the question of whether historical fiction is an
important cultural contribution or a petty indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hemings: An American Scandal. Four-hour miniseries about
the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and one of his slaves.
Starring Sam Neill and Carmen Ejogo. Sunday and Wednesday On CBS.
Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

&HT;     FEDS ARMED WITH ARSENAL OF LAWS TO GO AFTER COMPUTER HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT BEER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Investigators hoping to nab whoever is
responsible for the digital vandalization of some of the Internet's
most notable sites will be armed with an arsenal of laws.
</P>
<P>
   This week Yahoo, Amazon.com, CNN.com, ETrade and a host of other
Web sites were flooded with millions of simultaneous requests for
information, causing the Internet sites to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers in the past have been prosecuted for breaking into
computer networks and stealing data. But in these recent attacks,
data were not stolen. Instead, networks were clogged and users were
prevented from accessing Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco lawyer Jennifer Granick, who defends people
accused of computer crimes, said these attacks were different from
the usual computer break-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are saying, so far, that no one is accessing
their data,'' she said. ``The hackers are simply clogging their
service.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Granick and other computer crime lawyers, the
federal government, including the FBI, will be pursuing the hackers
under the National Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a wide-ranging set
of laws that seeks to protect the Internet and the computers that
run it from intrusions and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the hackers would be in violation of a federal
statue that makes it a crime for anyone who ``knowingly causes the
transmission of a program, information, code or command, and as a
result of such conduct, intentionally causes damage without
authorization, to a protected computer.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if the alleged hackers are found to be launching
attacks from within California, they could be prosecuted under a
provision of the state's Crimes against Property laws.
Specifically, section 502, which prohibits ``Unauthorized access to
computers, computer systems and computer data.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal law, a hacker who interrupts service on an
Internet site could be sentenced to five years in prison. If it is
a second conviction or a conviction for another section of federal
computer crime laws, a hacker would face 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers can also be responsible for damages, such as loss of
business, incurred by bringing down a commercial Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet, by its very nature as a worldwide network, is an
interstate crime,'' Granick said. ``That brings the FBI into the
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the investigation, law enforcement sources said, will be
conducted at the Computer Crime Squad, which has offices in San
Francisco and San Jose. The group is supervised by the National
Infrastructure Protection Center. It includes specially trained FBI
agents, local law enforcement officers and consultants from private
software companies.

WHY ASHLEY JUDD IS THE HOTTEST WOMAN ON THE PLANET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She drinks bourbon. Fine bourbon. Perhaps she has imbibed Jim
Beam, but it's not what she prefers, not a drink that ``speaks to
her.'' She favors whiskey from Blanton's, a single-barrel
distillery from her home state of Kentucky. Blanton's produces a
fine, well-rounded distilled mash. Just listen to this description
of the bourbon aged in Barrel No. 444, Rick No. 9 from the book
``Kindred Spirits'':
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a good fruit presence on the tongue that's
multilayered and graceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the symmetry, the parallel between what Ashley
``drinks'' and what Ashley ``is'': multilayered and graceful. (She
may also have a ``burnished gold, medium-amber hue,'' but I don't
want to stretch the association too far.) Still, she is many things
a drink is not, no matter how bold and sultry a spirit it claims to
be: She is whip smart, a talented actress, a master of the slit
dress and quite possibly the hottest woman in the known universe.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, then, that her new movie, ``Eye of the Beholder,'' is
getting such bad reviews (ours is particulary unkind; no stars ...
``meee-yow''), because Ashley deserves better. Too bad that her
last movie, the silly and predictable ``Double Jeopardy,'' was a
surprise hit, because Ashley deserves smarter. Any woman who reads
the dictionary and favors the word ``debacle'' because it's not
``so fantastically challenging a word but it is wonderful in the
mouth'' is applying her Phi Beta Kappa education in the right ways.
</P>
<P>
   I acknowledge that my (and, if the Internet is to be believed,
many others') fascination with all things Ashley is not based
solely on her mind or her sophisticated choice of adult beverages.
She is, in the words of today's youth, a looker; a bird, if you're
British. Just ask the professionals: a photo editor at Playboy was
recently asked whom he would photograph if he had his choice of
anyone in the world, and his answer was the youngest Judd.
</P>
<P>
   But of course. What better challenge than to capture her unkempt
beauty and what Terry Jones, in the ``Monty Python and the Holy
Grail,'' called, ``that certain, special, something.'' For it is in
the best glamour shots of Ashley where one can bear witness to more
than her callipygian physique: Her impish toughness is also on
display, seen clearly in her wicked grin. Case in point: When a
waiter informed her that Miramax bigwig Harvey Weinstein was
offering to buy dinner for her and a reporter for GQ (he had
stopped by the table to say hi) she simply smiled and said, ``Tell
him I'd rather have a more favorable back-end deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley, of course, would be properly disgusted by this fawning.
She doesn't want some man who's captivated by movie-star Ashley or
cover-girl Ashley. Her boyfriend, Scottish race-car driver Dario
Franchitti, had not, as of October, ever seen her in a movie. ``And
I never want him to,'' she said at the time. ``Ever.'' (She's so
... ``together.'' Don't you think?)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, she wants a man who simply loves her for what she is
_ a simple country girl, born into a fame-drenched family (Naomi
and Wynonna, the Judds) who stars in movies and plays, speaks
French, loves college basketball, hates underwear and can use the
word ``perspicacity'' in a sentence. And I do admire her for all
those things. Unfortunately, though, we weren't meant to be. I've
seen too many of her movies, read too many worshipful profiles of
her in big-time magazines. All we can share is fine bourbon. I'm
sure she's heartbroken.

FRENZY OF FEAR: BOOKS OFFER HELP TO THOSE WORRIED ABOUT TAX-LAW
CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may just be the middle of February, but tax season is upon
us.
</P>
<P>
   And we hope you have some extra time.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IRS, if you had itemized deductions and
investment income, it took more than 22 hours to do last year's tax
return _ three hours longer than the year before. The Tax
Foundation estimates that Americans spend about 5.4 billion hours
filling out their returns each year.
</P>
<P>
   And 1999 was the 33rd time in the past 36 years in which changes
were made to the tax law, although tax guru Jeff Schnepper concedes
that the recent changes are small in comparison with those of the
year before. Last April, the IRS commissioner noted that 9,500
changes had been made in the code in the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Add all those changes to the original document, and the tax code
stands at a depressing 1.5 million words.
</P>
<P>
   But before you start screaming or consider locking yourself in a
closet until after April 15, remember that there are books to help.
</P>
<P>
   The king of the tax guides is the top seller, ``The Ernst &AMP;
Young Tax Guide 2000'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 718 pages, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons this guide sells more than the others.
After 12 years of publishing this as Ernst &AMP; Young and the five
previous years of publishing it as Arthur Young &AMP; Co., this group
has it down in terms of presentation, organization and clear,
concise writing.
</P>
<P>
   And it's priced the same as most of the other guides.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young is the only major accounting firm to produce a tax
guide of this magnitude available to the public, and this guide is
the only one that includes the IRS tax guide, Publication 17, and
more official tax forms than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Other guides offered include ``J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax
2000'' (IDG Book Worldwide, 814 pages, $15.95) and ``H&AMP;R Block 2000
Income Tax Guide'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 574 pages, $15).
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R notes that it is the world's largest tax preparer, while the
J.K. Lasser Institute has written a tax guide for more than 60
years. Lasser's publisher also produces the best-selling ``... For
Dummies'' series known for boiling complex subjects down to
manageable and even entertaining reading.
</P>
<P>
   Both books are full of helpful information, and you really can't
go wrong with either. But both are lacking in the presentation that
makes the Ernst &AMP; Young guide so accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Lasser offers a chapter by Arthur Andersen on tax planning, but
it's unfortunate that it doesn't apply some of the graphic boost
that its publisher uses in the ``Dummies'' series, which
interestingly produces its own tax guide.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not interested in wading through tax guides, there are
a host of other books to help you find those hidden deductions or
forgotten credits. Among them are two that deal specifically with
not paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One is the best-selling ``How to Pay Zero Taxes'' (McGraw-Hill,
652 pages, $14.95) by attorney, accountant and personal finance
columnist Jeff Schnepper.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 17th edition, this book focuses on the ``cracks'' in
the IRS code established by Congress as economic and social
incentives. In other words, instead of paying taxes, if you have
expenditures in specific areas, you can deduct your way out of
being taxed at all.
</P>
<P>
   Schnepper really knows the tax code and studies it fervently
every year as the code is tweaked or rewritten. He provides 138
deductions to watch for, describing each in detail, often with
anecdotes or examples of how the law effects an individual. Many
are ones you know, although I was surprised to read about the
cattle-breeding deduction. Many of Schnepper's ideas take more
sophisticated financial power than most of us have time or ability
to endure.
</P>
<P>
   Another book more for the common taxpayer is called ``The
Complete Idiot's Guide to Tax Deductions'' (Alpha Books, 364 pages,
$16.95).
</P>
<P>
   Although an obvious knock-off of the ``Dummies'' series, this
book, also part of a series, offers a refreshing look at the dull
presentations of most guides. Snappy graphics, witty cartoons and
refreshing language make the whole idea of reading about taxes more
appealing. A ]decoder-ring graphic helps readers learn the
difference between their AGI and their FICA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Idiot's Guide'' author Lisa Collins is a practicing CPA with
20 years experience and covers a lot of helpful ground in this book
that's loaded with graphics.

`THE BEACH': DICAPRIO SWIMS WITH THE PLANKTON IN PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Beach'' is an attempt by all the major talents involved to
try something new. For the first 10 minutes, the movie slices
forward like the prelims of the latest adrenaline splurge at the
Extreme Games.
</P>
<P>
   It reaches an early peak when Robert Carlyle _ the
flesh-and-blood yang to the yin flash of the director, Danny Boyle
_ pops up as Daffy, a buzz-cut head offering words of wisdom to
Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio). Playing to the back row, Carlyle is so
potent a presence that he's one of the few actors for whom Dolby
Digital is wholly unnecessary. Daffy tells Richard about an island
paradise not found on any conventional map. And Richard, a young
American vacationing in Thailand and looking for something off the
beaten path, follows Daffy's map in search of promise.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle is as skilled as any filmmaker at polished sleight-of-hand
camera business, in lieu of narrative resonance. DiCaprio wants to
stand his image on its head and give the members of his young fan
club something to think about as they slip on their retainers and
doze off, with visions of Leo dancing in their heads. The picture
opens with stark black-and-white that blinks into color before you
know it: a metaphor for the awakening that Richard will undergo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like every tourist, you want it all ... to be safe, just like
America,'' a Thai street salesman sneers at Richard as he drifts
from one noisy, overcrowded bazaar to another. Seconds later,
Richard is forcing down several jiggers of snake blood to prove
he's down for new experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Richard lures his next-door neighbors from his hostel (Virginie
Ledoyen and Guilluame Canet) into joining him on the trip to the
Shangri-La that Daffy told him about. After a boys' book of
adventure journey, they find themselves in the hidden land. (That
is, after they slip past acres of apparently wild marijuana that is
actually fiercely guarded by drug runners.) There, Richard is
knee-deep in pleasure seekers who have established a commune in
this hidden land _ more sun, willowy babes and lean fellas with
six-pack abs than you'll find in a summer resort layout in the
fashion magazine Spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``Shallow Grave,'' a gleeful and malicious piece of genre
legerdemain, was an appropriate first feature from ``The Beach''
production team: Boyle, the writer John Hodge and the producer
Andrew MacDonald. They're best served when riffing on genres,
dispensing a superficial gleam that's cool to the touch. Their
crowning, and crowing, work, a glib adaptation of Irvine Welsh's
facile scab ``Trainspotting,'' contradicted the heroin-pallor of
the source material; it burned with a red-eyed eight-ball rush.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of perhaps John Woo, no director is better at
exploiting interiors than Boyle. In ``Shallow Grave,'' the
apartment that was the center of most of the action was as much a
character as any actor in the film. And if mottled walls could
talk, they would chatter like ``Trainspotting.'' His camera
slithered through every nook and cranny to find just the right
peculiar point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The camera work in ``The Beach'' is just as industrious. (Oddly
enough, the wide open spaces and big, blue skies confound him a bit
here and also in ``A Life Less Ordinary.'') Boyle and his squad are
also gifted at shifts in tone, slipping from cheeky to dread in the
same shot, like a gentle freshet with a pearly froth that pours
into an ominous waterfall. The camera sidles up to a monkey sitting
in a tree, then closes in on the tether on its neck _ it's a
watch-primate in service of the weed guards, and what was innocent
is transformed into danger.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle and his collaborators are superb at creating surface
tension, and Alex Garland's novel is all surfaces, one fever dream
mostly about Vietnam bleeding into the next. The book is a fervid
stoner's reverie about introducing an outside element into a
thriving organism, and how that element becomes an infection that
leads to the deterioration of a healthy organism _ the absurdity of
good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie is simply a Colors by Benetton take on ``Lord of
the Flies,'' with the imperious paradise ruler (Tilda Swinton, whom
the movie could use a lot more of) holding court as the Promised
Land crashes around her. And Richard finds himself living the
aphorism that has ruined the life of so many film protagonists:
paradise breeds callousness, a marginal rethinking of beware the
things you want, for you shall have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beach'' is not a terrible movie, just an insubstantial
one. All of DiCaprio's charisma and the director's savvy are used
to divert us from the fact that there's not much going on. The
picture is a cocoon around DiCaprio. Nothing makes that more
evident than the bumping underscore, a great soundtrack, which is
the kind of music that you would hear played at Moomba or Balthazar
or someplace else in Manhattan where DiCaprio would be sequestered
from harm behind a velvet rope. He shows some talent: when he tries
to seduce Ledoyen with rambling collegiate pomposity, it is clear
he's willing to undermine his idol status and lampoon cockiness.
(He has a lanky, likable intensity _ earnestness with a sense of
humor.)
</P>
<P>
   As undifferentiated as DiCaprio is, almost everyone else in the
movie is more indistinct _ with the exception of Carlyle with his
``World Is Not Enough'' haircut, Swinton and the vibrant young
actor Paterson Joseph (as Keaty, a British Empire sports junkie),
who establishes an immediate connection with the audience. ``The
Beach'' is underwritten, so much so that it is mostly texture, like
a scene that parodies love-on-the-beach sequences and then goes
them one better: DiCaprio and Ledoyen kiss underwater, aglow from
the iridescent plankton that surround them. The visual scheme,
abetted by the cinematographer, Darius Khondji, is the most
distinguished member of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   The unstated theme _ well, maybe it's not so unstated, after all
_ of Boyle and Hodges' protagonists is that they're looking for
something new, until they come to realize what they left behind
isn't so soul-deadening after all. Along those lines, ``The
Beach,'' as the old joke goes, is priceless. It isn't worth
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The Beach'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes exhibitions of the leisure
lifestyle: drugs, adult language, nudity and sex.

`SNOW DAY': DEEP SLUSH, FOLLOWED BY SCATTERED SNICKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' should be taken for what it is: a scheme _ likely
to be successful for a week or so _ to separate a few million
10-year-olds from their allowances. You expect a movie like this to
be pretty stupid. Why else would you pay good money to watch Chevy
Chase don a Hawaiian-print shirt, a snowman costume and something
that looks like a fur-trimmed Persian rug?
</P>
<P>
   But the problem with ``Snow Day'' is that it's not stupid
enough. It lacks the over-the-top vulgarity and the anarchic
silliness vital to any halfway decent feature film starring a
former ``Saturday Night Live'' cast member, even one from way back
in the olden days. Chase, who, as usual, portrays a distracted,
genial paterfamilias (in this case a Syracuse weatherman named Tom
Brandston), plays every scene as if in a desperate hurry to be
someplace else. Jean Smart, as his ambitious wife, does a
reasonably good job of acting in what looks to be the complete
absence of guidance from the script or the director.
</P>
<P>
   A number of potentially funny plots thread their way through the
film, which seeks to capture the liminal freedom _ the sense that
``anything can happen'' _ that accompanies a school-canceling
blizzard. One involves Chase's attempt to defend the dignity of the
meteorological profession against his slick, vacuous rival, Chad
Symmonz (John Schneider, whom the parents of the target audience _
the innocent-bystanders _ may recognize from ``The Dukes of
Hazzard''). There is also an uptight, snowphobic principal (Damian
Young) and a malevolent snowplow operator (Chris Elliott) with very
poor dental hygiene, against whom the schoolchildren of Syracuse
must struggle to win themselves a second day off. And there is a
brief, mystifying appearance by Iggy Pop, the glowering godfather
of punk, as an ice-rink operator who plays only the soporific
crooning of Al Martino on his P.A. system.
</P>
<P>
   The dumb jokes and broad gags, which are the real point of a
movie like this, fall flat. Even the periodic attempts to tap into
an inexhaustible source of puerile humor, flatulence, seem
desperate. And the climactic confrontation between the snowplow
driver and a vengeful mob of schoolchildren is less funny than
cruel: the guy is only trying to do his job.
</P>
<P>
   At least he's trying. The screenwriters, Will McRobb and Chris
Viscardi, and the director, Chris Koch, lacking any ideas of their
own, have wrapped a homage to the later National Lampoon vacation
movies around a pallid tribute to the John Hughes films of the
1980s. Here, Tom's oldest son, Hal (Mark Webber), pursues the most
popular girl in school (Emmanuelle Chriqui), incurring the wrath of
her jock boyfriend (David Paetkau) and wounding the feelings of
Hal's pal Lane (Schuyler Fisk) who secretly adores him. This story,
which occupies far too much of the movie, is an uninteresting as
its outcome is unsurprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' fails both as arrested-development farce and as
teen-age romantic comedy. Wheeler and Fisk are bright, appealing
young actors, and they do what they can with the anodyne banalities
of the script. But their performances _ along with an eager,
energetic turn by Zena Grey as Hal's younger sister, Natalie _ are
the only signs of intelligence in a movie so witless that it can't
even manage to be stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Snow Day'' is rated PG (parental guidance suggested).
It includes some chaste kissing and the wanton destruction, by
snowplow, of a Plymouth Reliant.

`THE ICE RINK': LIGHTS, CAMERA, ZAMBONI 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ankles buckling, arms flailing, faces frozen in concentrated
terror as they wobble perilously onto the slippery floor, the many
characters who are novice skaters in Jean-Philippe Toussaint's
comedy ``The Ice Rink'' have all they can do to remain upright.
</P>
<P>
   This giddy comic conceit, one of the cleverest since the
invention of the banana peel, has enough continuing clout to keep
Toussaint's small, deft comedy on its feet even though it is
repeated again and again. There is a sadistic pleasure to be
gleaned from the spectacle of adult professionals trying to
maintain their dignity while clumsily slipping and sliding. Put the
bossiest CEO on ice skates, and he can turn into an instant
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``The Ice Rink,'' like Truffaut's ``Day For Night,'' is
a movie about the making of a movie, the mishaps afflicting the
film crew serving an imperious director and an unscrupulous
producer determined to complete their film in time for inclusion in
the Venice Film Festival become a delicious spoof of moviemaking
and its pretensions. The work in progress, dumbly titled
``Dolores,'' is a tacky little hockey romance whose story its
director (played by Tom Novembre) insists is a metaphor for modern
European history.
</P>
<P>
   Although amusing, ``The Ice Rink'' lacks the grand sweep and
humanity of Truffaut's masterpiece. The movie, which opens a
one-week engagement Friday at Anthology Film Archives in New York
City, is a loosely connected series of jokes and sight gags about
the making of a film whose plot is too nebulous to describe.
</P>
<P>
   The endless retakes of a single scene in which an actor,
awkwardly lowered from an elaborate contraption onto the ice so
that his head hits the surface at the very moment he catches a
first sideways glimpse of his true love, slyly equates filmmaking
obsessiveness with ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the roster of egotists who slip, slide or glide (if they
can skate) through the movie is its director, who remains suavely
in control as one accident after another curtails his mobility
until he ends up in a wheelchair. He is more than matched in
self-regard by his beautiful, ruthless female star (Dolores
Chaplin, the granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin), who, within moments
of arriving on the set, has sparked a sexual competition by putting
the moves on both the director and her rugged American co-star
(Bruce Campbell), with whom she tumbles into a flaming backstage
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Also shoving their egos into the mix are the deceitful producer
(Marie-France Pisier), who lies to the film festival's selection
committee about the project's readiness (some of the final editing
is done aboard a helicopter bound for Rome to meet the deadline);
and the ice rink's vain, preening director (Jean-Pierre Cassel), a
former skating champion who wastes everyone's time by telling
anecdotes and showing film clips of his glory days. Funniest of all
is the female actress' stand-in (Gilbert Melki), a stout, hirsute
stunt man ludicrously outfitted in a red dress that matches the
star's.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, there's also a Lithuanian hockey team, which doesn't
speak French. For its scenes on the ice, the director instructs it
to play without a puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ice Rink'' builds to a nifty final swirl as the
filmmakers, in their mad rush to meet the deadline, interrupt the
filming of a grade-C sword-and-toga epic at the Italian studio
Cinecitta when their helicopter touches down on the set. At the
same moment, the gravely ill film festival chief arrives by
ambulance for his private screening.
</P>
<P>
   If its pieces don't completely fit, ``The Ice Rink'' has
sophisticated comic performances by a cast who know their
characters well enough to make us like them in spite of their
self-absorption. While portraying moviemaking as one of the
silliest activities on earth, ``The Ice Rink'' also makes us want
to be there in the heart of all that foolishness, quaking in our
skates.
</P>
<P>
   This film is not rated.

 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MISSED THIS 
 
 REVIEW  of ``GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING'' 
 By Tracy Chevalier (Dutton, $21.95) 
 
 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The girl looks back over her shoulder with wide eyes and parted
lips, as if someone has come up from behind and taken her by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Her earring, a giant pearl, catches the light, and a blue turban
hides the unruly hair that she never lets anyone see. Her pose
seems natural, but we know she was coaxed into it by the artist who
painted her _ he even instructed her to lick her lips and not to
close them. As she gazes back at him, we also know her secret: She
loves the man, but she can never speak of it to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   She is 17. Her name is Griet, and she is a maid in the house of
Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, who is known today as the ``master
of light'' but who in 1665 was merely a respected artist struggling
to support a wife and six children (11, by the time he died a
decade later) in 17th century Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer and his family are real, but Griet is the invention of
Tracy Chevalier in her novel, ``Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' which
was inspired by Vermeer's painting of the same name. Griet is only
16 when she is sent to work in Vermeer's house, a move made
necessary after her father, a Delft tilemaker, is blinded in a kiln
explosion and unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy time for Griet, who has never been away from
her parents. She is Protestant and the Vermeers are Catholic, and
their home is full of religious paintings (Vermeer is a collector
as well as an artist) that are foreign and frightening to her. Her
days are long and hard, and she must fend for herself in the
constant power struggle that simmers among the women of the house:
Vermeer's suspicious and mercurial wife, Catharina; his
mother-in-law, the sly and powerful Maria Thins; Maria's personal
maid, Tanneke; and Cornelia, Vermeer's malicious 7-year-old
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Griet holds her own well enough. She has an instinct for
flattery that disarms Tanneke at first, and she manages to
establish a minor alliance with Maria Thins. But her biggest weapon
is the master himself. From the moment he meets her, Vermeer
recognizes Griet's eye for color and detail. It is not long before
he secretly enlists her as his assistant, teaching her how to mix
paints and plan what will appear on a canvas. And Griet begins to
see him not just as employer but as an artist, and then as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Griet narrates her story with a certain plodding charm, the
voice of a working-class girl who knows her place in life but
cannot resist the allure of what is beyond her. She is
hard-working, cautious, uncomplaining and clever, a Jane Eyre in
the land of canals.
</P>
<P>
   That her story moves so quickly (I read it in two days) is a
reflection of how shallow it actually is _ we never really have a
sense of why any of the characters are the way they are. But that
is not a drawback. Griet does not have time to analyze the people
whose lives touch hers. She must support herself, contribute to her
parents' well-being and navigate the dicey emotional tides in the
house of Johannes Vermeer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she does not settle happily into her master's arms
like Jane Eyre, but perhaps does something better: She makes a life
for herself and sees it for what it is, growing into a pragmatic
woman who tells her story exactly as it should be told.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer left only 35 paintings behind at the end of his life.
Several _ including ``Young Woman With a Water Pitcher'' and
``Woman With a Pearl Necklace'' _ make appearances in Chevalier's
book, as if she cannot resist making up stories to explain these
dazzling and enigmatic works of art. Any one of them would have
made a good premise for a novel, but Chevalier has chosen well. We
don't know who really posed for ``Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' but
her Griet is a character worthy of the honor. &QL;

   &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED IT &QL; 
 &QL; 
eere are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``MY GENERATION'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Michael Gross (Cliff Street, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gross looks at the cultural impact of the baby-boom generation
(his rather liberal standards include anyone born from the day the
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 to the day John F. Kennedy was
assassinated in 1963) by focusing on 19 ``quintessential boomers,''
including Donald Trump, Marianne Williamson, political cartoonist
Doug Marlette, software superstar Steve Capps, porn star Nina
Hartley, New York criminal court judge Leslie Crocker Snyder and
public-relations executive Cynthia Bowman (she once lived with Paul
Kantner of the Jefferson Airplane and was Grace Slick's maid of
honor when she married her lighting director). The story of this
generation and how it evolved, Gross writes, ``is best told not
through the lives of average members but through those who achieved
or failed or both, extravagantly.'' His book is sometimes
scattered, but thought-provoking, and haunted by the belief of
fellow boomer Maureen Dowd that ``we are going to die without
experiencing the nobility that illuminated the lives of our parents
and grandparents.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``GREENE ON CAPRI'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Shirley Hazzard (FSG, $22) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to be young and well-off and living in Italy, where you
could sit in a piazza and read books or work crossword puzzles
until your friend Graham Greene showed up to share a bottle of wine
and some scintillating conversation. This slight memoir begins in
the 1960s and is set in a succession of villas and cafes on Capri,
where Hazzard and her husband, biographer Francis Steegmuller, got
to know Greene very well. She addresses Greene's religion, his
fiction, his culinary habits, his friends and acquaintances, his
appreciation of women, his feelings about America and his own
country, his alleged anti-Semitism. All of it carries an air of
otherworldliness brought on by the underlying suggestion of leisure
and privilege (there are some references to ``completing
manuscripts,'' but mostly these people just seem to eat and talk).
Most of all, the conversations were literary. After Greene's death
in 1991 and Steegmuller's in 1994, the woman who had been Greene's
companion wrote to Hazzard that ``maybe now they have found each
other, and go on discoursing on Flaubert.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BECOMING AMERICAN'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Meri Nana-ama Danquah (Hyperion,
 &UR; $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Lilianet Brintrup came to the United States from Chile as a
graduate student in 1981, she was humbled by the cold. Winter had
set in, hard and implacable, but the chill was also in the faces of
the people around her. They did not smile. ``I supposed that they
were in a hurry,'' she writes. ``I didn't see any sign of welcome,
not even one small flag waving in the wind as a sign of welcome for
foreign people. This lack of courtesy in a country of immigrants .
. . really surprised me.'' This wonderful collection of essays by
first-generation immigrant women will help you see this country in
a different light, as an adventure and a place of great opportunity
but also as a source of confusion and a sense of displacement. Some
of these women now think of the United States as home, as when
Gabrielle Donnelly, formerly a London journalist, writes with
delightful assurance of her American husband, her American city _
Los Angeles _ and her increasingly American sensibilities. Others
never will. Among the contributors are women from Haiti, India,
Korea, Russia, Ireland, Japan, China and Egypt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LETTERS FROM THE EDITOR'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Thomas Kunkel (Modern Library, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Orson: I was astonished at your column in yesterday's
`Post,' in which you say `The New Yorker' sneers at you. You were
brimful of prunes when you wrote that.'' We don't know about you,
but we are brimful of prunes over the fact that ``New Yorker''
Editor Harold Ross never wrote to  &UR; us, &UR; when he managed to send such
droll missives to everyone else in the world. Included are notes to
the above-mentioned Orson Welles, Katharine and E.B. White, Ring
Lardner, Groucho Marx, F. Scott Fitzgerald, H.L. Mencken, Ernest
Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, James Thurber, Lillian Hellman, Joseph
Mitchell. In short, some of the most luminous people of the day
heard from Ross, and they were lucky for it. He was witty, he was
affectionate, he was irascible _ he once wrote to E.B. White to
denounce the use of the term ``toilet paper'' in his magazine,
which, he said, ``would ruin my meal if I read it while eating. It
might easily cause vomiting.'' Ross is great company _ if you don't
have a letter of your own, this book is the next best thing.  &QL;

`THE TIGGER MOVIE': YOU'RE ONLY HAPPY WITH YOUR OWN KIND? OH,
POOH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1966 Walt Disney produced a short animated film, a featurette
in company parlance, called ``Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree,''
adapted from A.A. Milne's beloved children's book. Three more
installments followed, and in 1977 Disney released ``The Many
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,'' which may be among the most
frequently watched videos in a great many American households. I
know it is in mine.
</P>
<P>
   In its zeal to capitalize on the enormous popularity of Pooh,
Piglet, Eeyore and the rest, Disney has since knocked out, in
addition to several million plush toys, plastic figurines and (I'm
not kidding) Hanukkah menorahs, a number of straight-to-video
features starring the denizens of the Hundred Acre Wood.
</P>
<P>
   These tend to depart radically from both the spirit and the
letter of Milne's books, and they range in quality from unbearable
to adequate. The animation is, by Disney standards, crude and
unimaginative, the songs banal and the stories maudlin and chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie,'' the first Pooh adventure to be released
theatrically in 17 years, falls on the high end of the scale. It is
an adequate piece of children's entertainment, though it seems
better suited for home viewing _ while parents can cook dinner,
read the paper or balance the checkbook _ than for the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the animation is competent. And in two musical
sequences _ one involving sleepy dancing bees, the other a
phantasmagoria of history's greatest tiggers _ it is downright
inspired. The characters wriggle charmingly, and the scenery
beautifully replicates watercolor illustrations in children's
books.
</P>
<P>
   Milne's books, while they don't serve as source material, are
cannily evoked by John Hurt's very English narration. And from time
to time, Tigger and friends caper across handsomely typeset pages,
reminding us we are in storybook land.
</P>
<P>
   If only the story were better. Milne was working in the great
tradition of English nonsense, and his characters are studies in
post-Edwardian eccentricity. But in the imagination of Jun
Falkenstein, who wrote and directed ``The Tigger Movie,'' each one
is reduced to a single trait: Rabbit is a compulsive scold, Owl is
a windbag, Piglet is a worrywart, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Pooh himself seems unusually vague and depressed, perhaps
because Tigger has sucked up all the film's comic and dramatic
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   But it is, after all, Tigger's movie. You may recall (and if you
don't, Roo will helpfully remind you) that to Tigger, the most
wonderful thing about tiggers was that he was the only one. Now,
for reasons that will be hard to explain to young viewers (in part
because they don't make much sense), he is desperate to find others
of his kind.
</P>
<P>
   So he scours the Hundred Acre Wood looking for his lost family,
like an adoptee in a made-for-television movie in quest of birth
parents. But any child will tell you that stuffed animals don't
have birth parents, and to raise the issue of Tigger's parentage is
to invite all sorts of other questions. What happened to Roo's
father? Why is Rabbit a bachelor? Where are Pooh's pants?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``The Tigger Movie'' is meant to be just innocent fun
(bouncy, trouncy, flouncy fun, to be exact). But it isn't _ it's
transparently cynical, and not as much fun as it should be. The
songs, by the redoubtable team of Robert and Richard Sherman, seem
to have been written over lunch at the Disney cafeteria. Not one is
memorable, musically or lyrically, which may well be a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The plot collapses into teariness and hugs, which some grown-ups
in the entertainment industry persist in believing children can't
get enough of. It's certainly true that children can't get enough
of Pooh and his friends, and many would be content to watch them in
anything from a public service announcement to an animated remake
of ``Last Year at Marienbad.''
</P>
<P>
   But surely these icons of childhood whimsy can find a better
vehicle for their talents than ``The Tigger Movie.'' Don't they
have agents?

`SEX: THE ANNABEL CHONG STORY': CHAMP (BRIEFLY) OF THE SEXUAL
OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at the end of review) 
(af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing is clear about the star of the documentary ``Sex: The
Annabel Chong Story.'' She craves attention.
</P>
<P>
   As an undergraduate in fine arts at the University of Southern
California, she decided to seek a career in pornographic films.
Having achieved stardom in movies like ``I Can't Believe I Did the
Whole Team'' and ``Depraved Fantasies 3,'' she was 22 years old in
1995 when she decided to seek a more advanced measure of fame. She
had sex with 251 men in 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although her record was rapidly eclipsed, she appeared on Jerry
Springer's show, among others. She appeared before the Cambridge
Union Debating Society. She had a press agent. She had a fan club.
And she lent herself to Gough Lewis' superficial documentary about
her.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' ``Sex: The Annabel Chong Story,'' shown last year at the
Sundance Film Festival, dutifully and sometimes graphically records
her exploits and seeks commentary from its subject, her friends,
classmates, teachers, lover, employers and relatives in her native
Singapore, where she began life as Grace Quek, an only child of
middle-class parents. But no dispassionate expert analysis of
Annabel Chong-Grace Quek is sought or offered.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeting references to drug use are left unexplored, as is her
decision to leave the pornography industry, to which she later
returned. Nor is the impact of a gang rape that occurred after she
picked up a stranger one night on the London Underground fully
illuminated.
</P>
<P>
   And when Quek speaks about herself, she is sometimes like a
defiant little girl seeking to shock with frank talk, sometimes an
overwrought punk as she puffs on a cigarette, sometimes a lost
soul, sometimes a would-be artist creating life as a work of
outrage, feminism and politics, or openly self-destructive as she
cuts her arm repeatedly with a knife. ``You've just got to feel
something,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As for having sex with 251 men in 10 hours, she argues that it
is no different from having sex with one man for 10 hours. ``I just
wanted to explore my own sexuality,'' she says on an English
television show. Her response to the possibility of contracting
AIDS: ``I believe that sex is good enough to die for.''
</P>
<P>
   About her career in pornography, she says she liked sex before,
so why not do it for money. ``Sounds cool to me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of the film's unexplored contradictions, it seems
that her actions cannot be explained by a yearning for money.
According to the film, she never collected the $10,000 that was to
be her fee for her sexual marathon.
</P>
<P>
   And in one scene that is as bleakly funny as it is instructive
and dismaying, she bargains with a filmmaker by proclaiming herself
a great star, demands to be paid more than her female co-star and
then rapidly reduces her price. And her messy little apartment
gives no indication that her career has bought her psychological or
environmental comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Singapore, her mother, a piano teacher, is
supposedly unaware of Quek's career in films, but toward the end of
``The Annabel Chong Story,'' when it becomes clear that her mother
knows all, Quek tearfully promises to regain her dignity for her.
``My mom deserves a monument,'' she says. ``I won't let them
down,'' she says of her parents. ``I'm going to make them proud of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the film notes, Grace Quek graduated in 1998. She remains in
pornography films.
</P>
<P>
   As documentaries go, ``Sex: The Annabel Chong Story'' sheds heat
but insufficient light.

 &HT;    CHECHEN REFUGEES STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 13,
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)

<P>
   NESTEROVSKOE, Russia _ At first glance, scenery along the
well-paved country road running across the Russian republic of
Ingushetia resembles rural America. Frosty fields hoed for spring
planting surround fenced-off, prosperous-looking homes and barns.
</P>
<P>
   But the similarity ends at the driveways, where instead of mail
boxes or house numbers stand hand-painted signs with the words
``Refugees Live Here.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 people, or a third of Chechnya's
population, have fled fighting between the Russian army and rebels.
They've moved to neighboring Ingushetia, nearly doubling this
republic's population.
</P>
<P>
   Official camps set up along the border of Chechnya and
Ingushetia are large enough to house only about 10 percent of the
refugee population. The remaining 90 percent of displaced families
have had to make ends meet largely on their own, shacking up in
crowded homes of Ingush neighbors, abandoned pig sties, barns or
even abandoned railway cars.
</P>
<P>
   International aid officials say privately that forcing them to
live like this is part of a Russian government strategy aimed at
making conditions so bad that Chechens will return to their homes.
That, in turn, will bolster the Kremlin's propaganda campaign that
has been proclaiming the war is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   The administrator of the largest refugee camp in Ingushetia,
called Sputnik, would not comment directly on this alleged Russian
ploy. However, he did confirm last week that new refugees are not
being allowed to enter camps or register to receive food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon Albayev, a 54-year-old father of six and a refugee from
the Chechen capital of Grozny, feels this squeeze acutely.
</P>
<P>
   Albayev evacuated his family from Grozny before shelling started
in December, remembering the hellish days of the first war there in
1994 when Russians bombed the city non-stop. For the last three
months he, his wife and six grown children have been living in a
one-room barn without running water or heat located off the main
road from the airport to the Ingush capital of Nazran.
</P>
<P>
   The Albayevs are among the luckier ones. They succeeded in
taking a car full of their personal goods with them so that now,
after a long day of hunting firewood and clean drinking water, the
family can sit on familiar pillows and drink from favorite cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose your home, the smallest item becomes precious,''
said the gray-haired man. ``Still, even with these comforts, the
evenings are long.''
</P>
<P>
   Food is a major problem. Aid is distributed primarily by two
organizations: the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations and
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). The groups
say they provide at least one meal a day to all inhabitants of the
official refugee camps, but distribution to areas where other
refugees live is spotty.
</P>
<P>
   Albayev says that when he takes his family's ration card to the
camps, he is turned away. ``They only have enough for those that
live there,'' he said. ``I have to go home empty-handed to my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road in the Ingush town of Nestarovskoe, lining up for
food is a twice-a-month event for Sapirat Durzhundalova (CQ), who
fled her home one night in September with her five children when
Russian soldiers started shelling their village. In Nestarovskoe,
she found a room for herself and her children _ but at a cost. Her
monthly rent is the equivalent of $20, or roughly equal to what had
been her entire earnings each month.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the door to her home away from home reveals that it is
crammed with other refugees, including several tight-lipped, stoic
Chechen mothers and fathers and their bright-eyed but ragged kids.
Together, they occupy space meant for just one family. They freely
share whatever goods and items they have between them, giving the
bulk of their food to the children.
</P>
<P>
   According to UNHCR, about 50 percent of the refugees are
children. Since October, more than 2,000 babies have been born
among the refugee population. Although schools have been started in
the official camps, the kids living in other areas have no access
to lessons or books.
</P>
<P>
   Durzhundalova, a steely-eyed woman who looks older than her age
of 43, says that better medical care is at the top of her wish
list. A shortage of decent winter clothes has kept her children
sniffling and feverish for the last two months, she says. Even
worse, though, are the nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   ``My five-year-old can't watch cartoons. The loud noises remind
him of bombs and he starts to cry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Every refugee community is awash in stories of atrocities
committed by Russian soldiers against Chechen civilians who
remained in their homes. Durzhundalova says her cold, muddy
existence is miserable, yet safe.
</P>
<P>
   When she runs out of rent money, she fears she won't have a
choice about whether to stay in Ingushetia or return to the rubble
of her Chechen village.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I return to a razed home, where all my supplies and
animals will have been eaten? What would I feed my family?'' she
asked. ``Do I trust guarantees (by the Russian military) that I'll
be safe? Hardly. They don't fool anybody when they claim the war is
over.''

`EVERYTHING YOU KNOW': CURMUDGEON'S REBIRTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Willy Muller, the middle-aged narrator of Zoe Heller's sparkling
first novel, is anything but a mensch: he's done jail time for
killing his wife, he's had almost nothing to do with his two
daughters in a decade, he cheats on his girlfriend with women he
barely knows, and he's in the midst of turning his tacky life story
into an even tackier movie. When he tries to make a list of
``Things To Be Grateful For'' the best he can come up with is:
``Women still want to have sex with me,'' ``I have quite a lot of
hair left,'' and ``I am still not smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Everything You Know,'' Heller _ a British-born journalist
who has written for Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and The Sunday
Times of London _ has managed to turn this unsavory curmudgeon into
the unlikely hero of a tale of rebirth and redemption. In doing so,
she has written a novel that's as affecting as it is amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Using her quick journalistic eye, Heller effortlessly conjures
up the disparate worlds Willy has traversed in his peripatetic
career _ bohemian London in the '70s and hedonistic Hollywood in
the '90s _ while introducing us to a Waugh-like cast of misfits,
hustlers and losers, all delineated with Swiftean malice and glee.
</P>
<P>
   There's Willy's mistress, Penny, a makeup artist who sticks to
him ``like a limpet to a rock'' despite his many infidelities and
petulant fits. There's his agent, Art, who gets him ghostwriting
jobs, arguing that ``as the infamous protagonist of an English
manslaughter trial,'' he is a perfect ``amanuensis to the stars.''
And there's Hans, the director planning to bring Willy's memoir to
the screen, a would-be auteur who compliments Willy on having a
life story with ``a fabulous arc.'' Of Willy's character, he writes
in a set of notes to the movie: ``We should get a strong sense that
yesterday he was `king of the hill' and now he is an
`untouchable.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Willy feels little but contempt for his Hollywood colleagues,
he feels little but guilt and resentment when it comes to his
family back home in England. His sister-in-law Margaret, a
well-born woman who likes to play the role of ``the snide country
mouse,'' is convinced that Willy murdered her sister Oona (even
though he was acquitted in an appeal). Willy's older daughter,
Sophie, is a nymphomaniac who lives with her addict boyfriend in a
grungy council flat near Holborn and speaks to Willy only when she
needs money. And his younger daughter, Sadie, leads a lonely
existence in a London squat, sleeping with a married man who treats
her with cavalier disregard.
</P>
<P>
   When Sadie learns she is pregnant, she decides to have the child
on her own. Little Pearl _ whose name summons up memories of Hester
Prynne's child in ``The Scarlet Letter'' _ will end up living with
her great-aunt Margaret in the north of England, after Sadie kills
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Willy initially deals with his daughter's suicide with the same
sort of sardonic detachment he's brought to all the other tragedies
in his life. ``It Could Have Been Worse,'' he thinks; instead of
swallowing a bunch of mashed up pills, washed down with Bailey's
Irish Cream, she could have been ``a jumper'' or ``hanged herself
from a light fixture after listening to Satanic messages in pop
songs played backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months after her death, however, Sadie's diaries, dating
from the time she was 9 years old, turn up in Willy's mailbox, and
after a mild heart attack he finds himself avidly reading his late
daughter's words. Their effect on him is insidious. As he reads
about her troubled childhood, he begins to re-evaluate his own life
and his myriad failures: chief among them, his failed, acrimonious
marriage and his failed relationships with Sophie and Sadie.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the days when they were still a family, Willy
thinks, he secretly resented his daughters. ``Well, not them so
much, but their attitude _ their idiotic happiness about things _
the way they saw their life as this orderly business of school days
and holidays, presents and punishments. They had such cheery
confidence in life. I suppose what I'm saying is that I resented
their innocence. They  &UR; were &LR;  innocent _ even Sophie. They hadn't
been beaten down; they weren't scared yet. It bugged me.''
</P>
<P>
   By cutting back and forth between Willy's recollections and
Sadie's journal entries, Heller deftly shows the downward spiral of
these two dovetailing lives: the daughter spinning into suicidal
depression; the father spinning into self-loathing and regret. In
doing so, she also lays out the jigsaw puzzle pieces of their
lives: the events that led to Oona's death and Willy's
incarceration in prison, and the events that led to Willy's
departure from England and his break with his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about Willy's story is that Heller not only
manages to make this selfish, piggy man understandable _ and by the
end of the book, sympathetic _ but that she has also succeeded in
creating a narrative that seamlessly blends the sarcastic and the
sincere, the comic and the tragic. Her journalistic eye for the
telling detail, her pitch-perfect ear for the lunacies of
contemporary speech, her knack for capturing the subtext of hope
and memory and regret that informs so many familial exchanges _ all
combine to make a stylish and spirited debut.

&HT;     POLLSTER SAYS BUSH SHOULD PICK MCCAIN AS RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., cannot be ``denied'' the
Republican nomination for vice president if he loses his
hard-charging challenge to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, an
influential pollster said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a prominent Republican public opinion specialist,
said the Republican ticket must include McCain, the most daunting
challenger to a Republican frontrunner since former California Gov.
Ronald Reagan nearly wrested the GOP nomination from President
Gerald Ford in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz, who isn't working for any presidential candidate this
year, helped Texas billionaire Ross Perot garner 19 percent of the
vote as an independent in the 1992 presidential election. He also
helped then-Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., craft the 1994 campaign
manifesto known as ``Contract with America'' that enabled the GOP
to win control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said he expects Bush to prevail in the contest for the
Republican nomination, despite McCain's surge in the wake of his
victory in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's sizeable campaign bank account will enable the two-term
governor to bombard upcoming primary states with campaign
advertising, Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   The front-loaded schedule of primaries also handicaps McCain's
insurgency, Luntz said. It will take weeks to parlay popular
support into the state-by-state political organizations needed to
match entrenched political operations that Bush has piggy backed
onto the campaign organizations of the 27 governors, 37 senators
and 175 House members who have endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   But Luntz said that most delegates to the GOP nominating
convention in Philadelphia in late July will already have been
chosen by the end of March. Some of the upcoming contests are
winner-take-all, as well, meaning that even a close second place
finish by McCain would yield few delegates, Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has ``all the ingredients'' for an upset, Luntz said,
``but it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Likening McCain's populist appeal to Perot's appeal in 1992,
said that McCain ought to be chosen as the vice presidential
nominee because he draws votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how John McCain can be denied the vice
presidential nomination when he will have done so well in the
primaries (and) when he will have demonstrated the ability to win
voters who otherwise do not vote Republican,'' Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's hand may be strengthened as well by support from the
Christian Right, now that magazine publisher Steve Forbes and
former Reagan administration official Gary Bauer have withdrawn
from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said what will rescue Bush even more, however is his
abandonment of the arms-length campaign style that contributed to a
disastrous defeat in the New Hampshire presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart guy and he's got smart people around him,'' Luntz
said. ``I can't imagine that somebody is not going to get into Gov.
Bush's face and say, `George, wake the hell up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who comes across to voters as ``handcuffed by his
handlers,'' has got to ``get out and let people touch him, and
punch him and kick him _ and he's got to punch and kick back,''
Luntz said. ``He's got to let people feel that they can
breakthrough that invisible wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush began adopting a more open campaign style in South Carolina
on Wednesday by staging a town meeting-style question-and-answer
session with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said that McCain's proven appeal to independent-minded
voters in New Hampshire and his strength among independent voters
in pre-election polls in South Carolina and Michigan require that
he be selected by Bush as the GOP vice presidential nominee, if
Bush prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how John McCain can be denied the vice
presidential nomination when he will have done so well in the
primaries and when he will have demonstrated the ability to win
voters who otherwise would not vote Republican,'' Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said that McCain's appeal to independent voters is
stealing strength from former Sen. Bill Bradley's challenge to Vice
President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Latest surveys show McCain leading Bush in South Carolina, 44
percent to 40 percent after trailing the front runner by 20
percentage points before victory in the New Hampshire primary.
McCain's margin over Bush is due in part to his 2 to 1 margin of
support from independents, who favor his candidacy 57 percent to 27
percent, according to a CNN/Time survey completed on Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters can cast ballots in the Republican primaries
in both South Carolina and Michigan, as they did in New Hampshire.
Exit polls in 1992 found that 24 percent of South Carolina's voters
were independents, as were 30 percent of Michigan's voters.

<P>
   Dear Leo,
</P>
<P>
   OK, after sitting slack-jawed through your new two-hour-plus
``Lord of the Flies''-meets-''Apocalypse Now'' travelogue called
``The Beach,'' I feel compelled to share a few thoughts about your
questionable taste in selecting a suitable follow-up to the most
successful movie of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Now don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those crazed fans who
only wants to remember your frozen face sinking beneath the icy
Atlantic at the end of ``Titanic.'' I certainly understand the need
for an actor to play against type and try something new to avoid
getting pigeonholed.
</P>
<P>
   And hey, it worked for Brad Pitt, right? Even Rose, um, I mean
Kate Winslet, has done some pretty cool indie stuff since surviving
the sinking. But Leo, what on earth were you thinking with this
``Beach'' thing?
</P>
<P>
   I can respect your decision not to do ``American Psycho.'' It
was a crummy book anyway, and the vault from romantic leading man
to sadistic lady-killer (literally) may have been too big a leap
for your hardcore fans to make. Besides, Christian Bale would have
been really ticked at you if you stole that part out from under
him.
</P>
<P>
   I know you've done some gutsy, challenging roles in the past _
your Oscar-nominated turn as the mentally impaired brother in
``What's Eating Gilbert Grape,'' the drug addict in ``The
Basketball Diaries'' and that gay poet's lover in ``Total Eclipse''
_ but this thing is just ``weird,'' man.
</P>
<P>
   I, along with a lot of your doe-eyed admirers who still remember
you from ``Growing Pains,'' was with you for a while _ struttin'
around shirtless, showing off your newly buff bod in a gorgeous
island paradise. But by the time you started Brando-ing out after
spending too much time alone in the bush, your craze became
infectious. Staring at some of those tedious, overlong closeups of
your sweaty face, I actually started thinking that ``The Man in the
Iron Mask'' was pretty good ... till I came to my senses, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   So if you don't mind a little unsolicited advice, here are a few
tips to consider when pickin' your next part:
</P>
<P>
   The Force isn't with you, babe. There's an ugly rumor floatin'
around that you're in line to play the older Luke in the next
``Star Wars'' flick. Trust me, Leo, drop the light saber and walk
away. The fans and critics will be all over you like a Wookie on a
waffle.
</P>
<P>
   Remember who made you King of the World. You don't have to be a
slave to the whims of all the little ladies in braces who run your
homemade fan club Web sites, but show 'em some occasional skin and
throw a little romance their way to keep 'em coming to the local
megaplex. It's the least you could do for the folks who paid for
your house.
</P>
<P>
   Find a pet director. Tim Burton transformed Johnny Depp from a
``21 Jump Street'' heartthrob into one of the most versatile
performers of our generation. And the gals are still wild about
him. Martin Scorcese is great, and your next picture with him,
``The Gangs of New York,'' could be Oscar bait. But let's face it,
Leo, you're no De Niro. Capisce?
</P>
<P>
   Seek out a mentor. You don't have to be the star of every film.
There's something to be said for learning from a master (Tom Cruise
with Paul Newman in ``The Color of Money'' and Dustin Hoffman in
``Rainman'' or Brad Pitt with Morgan Freeman in ``Seven''). Find a
venerable old Hollywood type and use your box-office pull to help
earn him some much-needed attention along with an Oscar nod.
There's nothing wrong with good karma.
</P>
<P>
   Hope these help. You know I criticize because I love. But
remember, as long you never play a supervillain in one of the
``Batman'' flicks, you'll always be King of the World in my book.
Yours truly, Todd Camp

 &HT;    DEMOCRATIC GROUP URGES END TO RACIAL PROFILING
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The use by police of racial characteristics to
identify and investigate crime suspects should be eliminated, a
moderate Democratic research institute said in a report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial profiling is escalating tensions between police and
minority communities,'' said Will Marshall, president of the
Progressive Policy Institute. He said the strategies in the new
report ``will help create safer communities and more effective law
enforcement policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Eliminating Racial Profiling: A Third Way
Approach,'' suggests that police departments use new technologies
to improve the collection, processing and dissemination of
information to officers so they can make decisions based on facts
instead of race.
</P>
<P>
   Authored by three prominent law enforcement officials, the
report also encourages police departments to recognize that crime
is concentrated in certain geographic areas and focus on the
relatively small number of people responsible for the majority of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the report calls for police departments to improve
their training and improve their hiring standards.
</P>
<P>
   Officers who engage in racial profiling are not necessarily
racist, said co-author Robert Wasserman, a senior international law
enforcement advisor for the State Department. He said the officers
make decisions based on biases, and police chiefs defend racial
profiling as an effective way to target their limited resources on
likely lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   Minority officers are also guilty of racial profiling, Wasserman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is an initial step toward a more effective
criminal justice system,'' said John D. Cohen, the report's
co-author and a former Los Angeles police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project aims are identifying and promoting the next
generation of community-based crime-fighting strategies for
preventing crime and improving public safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is available on the Internet at
http://www.dlcppi.org/texts/social/profiling.htm.

SOME PLACES WHERE YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING ON SPRING BREAK)
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Accompanied by SPRING BREAK-LIST) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not that you can't learn something at the beach. Nor do you
want your child's spring break to turn into one giant field trip.
</P>
<P>
   But with spring break season fast approaching, it's good to look
for a happy medium. Luckily, Texas is full of family-friendly
destinations, places where it's possible to both have a good time
and, just maybe, learn something new.
</P>
<P>
   Here, our suggestions for seven educational spring break trips.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all: no homework.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. VICTORIA: Archaeological adventure
</P>
<P>
   Fort St. Louis, established in 1685 by the French explorer La
Salle and abandoned three years later, was the first European
settlement in Texas. But its exact location remained a mystery
until 1997, when scientists concluded that cannons found near
Victoria were from the fort.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists continue to excavate the site, but it is not open
to the public. However, until October, visitors can get a look at
artifacts in a real working archaeology lab, opened earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the project consists of an open lab, where scientists
will clean, sort and catalog artifacts discovered on the dig; the
workers will answer questions and interact with visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The other half is actual artifacts, including the eight cannons
found at the fort and items the French would have used in trade
with Indians, such as rings, glass beads, cannon balls, musket
shots, and ropes. There's also a computer with video clips so
visitors can watch archaeologists in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: Victoria has several chain motels, such as a
Hampton Inn and a La Quinta Inn; get information from the Victoria
Convention and Visitor's Bureau, (361) 572-0063. For a more
intimate atmosphere, there's the Friendly Oaks Bed &AMP; Breakfast
(361) 575-0000, a restored older home where a gourmet breakfast is
included; four rooms range from $55 to $85 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Information: The Fort St. Louis Project Public Archaeology
Laboratory, 113 W. Santa Rosa, (361) 570-1356.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. AUSTIN: African-American history
</P>
<P>
   The small size of Austin's African-American community belies its
traditional strength and influence. And a look at its historical
sites is particularly fitting this spring, as the Lyndon Baines
Johnson Library and Museum will unveil an exhibit Feb. 19
showcasing a wealth of African-American artists, both new and
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our New Day Begun'' will feature the work of Gordon Parks and
Jacob Lawrence along with that of 35 other artists, including a
good number from Texas. The library is at 2313 Red River; (512)
916-5137.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites to seek out include the George Washington Carver
Branch Library and Museum (1165 Angelina St.; (512) 472-4809). This
one-room frame building housed Austin's first public library; the
museum now pays tribute to the scientist and leader and hosts
African-American themed programs and exhibits. And there's the
campus of Huston-Tillotson College (900 Chicon St.; (512)
505-3000), which began in 1881 as the first institute of higher
education for blacks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Even traditional tourist stops can be seen through new eyes. For
instance, Treaty Oak is famous as a historical site where treaties
were signed and peace arranged, and, more recently, for its
near-death after being deliberately poisoned. But in the
African-American community, it's also recognized as the spot where
civic leader the Rev. Jacob Fontaine organized several churches.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: Parents will like the historic Driskill Hotel
downtown, (512) 474-5911 (doubles from $185), but kids will get a
bigger kick out of the Austin Motel, (512) 441-1157, (doubles from
$49), a restored '50s-style mom-and-pop motel with a cool outdoor
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat: Hoover's (2002 Manor Road; (512) 479-5006) is
well-known for its traditional home cooking. Across the street is
Calabash, (2015 Manor Road; (512) 478-4857) a brightly colored spot
with Caribbean dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Get more ideas from the Texas Historical Commission
publication, African Americans in Texas: Historical &AMP; Cultural
Legacies. For general Austin information, try the Austin Convention
and Visitors Bureau, (800) 926-ACVB or
www.austin360.com/partners/acvb
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. CAPROCK CANYONS: Nature _ and buffalo
</P>
<P>
   Palo Duro Canyon may be bigger and better known, but this
Panhandle-area state park has something Palo Duro doesn't: buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Bison Herd was established here two years ago to
preserve and protect one of the last wild herds of North America's
largest land mammals. The herd contains more than 20 pure bison;
visitors can observe them, but be forewarned, they're not tame.
Look carefully and you might also spy African aoudad sheep,
pronghorn antelope, and even golden eagles.
</P>
<P>
   The 14,000-acre park also boasts more than 90 miles of mixed-use
trails and a 100-acre lake for fishing and boating. The visitors'
center offers an interpretive area and an archaeological site
featuring American Indian artifacts and signs of more than 250
million years' worth of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: Just over 10 miles from the canyon, The Hotel
Turkey, (806) 423-1151, is a refurbished 70-year-old building
listed in the National Register of Historic Places; rooms with
original furnishings are $69 per night, breakfast included.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat: At Turkey's The Peanut Patch, (806) 423-1051,
gourmet four-course dinners are served up by a Swiss-born chef;
reservations are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Caprock Canyons State Park, (806) 455-1492.

   4. ATHENS: Something fishy
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are alligators in Texas. Also bigmouth bass that grow
up to 20 pounds in size, and dozens of other kinds of fish. And at
the Texas Freshwater Fisheries center in Athens, the 300,000
gallons of exhibits display these and nearly every major species of
freshwater fish found in Texas, all in their natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Tours of the giant aquariums begin above the water surface, but
you end up 10 feet underwater, eye-to-eye with some of the largest
freshwater fish in the state. You can also watch handlers feeding
alligators in their natural marshy environment and see divers
hand-feeding fish, including a 42-pound blue catfish. Kids can even
borrow rods and reels to try their hand at catching rainbow trout
or channel catfish. Also on the grounds are a working hatchery you
can tour, plus the Texas Fishing Hall of Fame and Museum. The
complex is closed on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: Athens has six motels and three bed-and-breakfast
inns; for information, call the chamber of commerce, (903)
675-5181.
</P>
<P>
   Information: The Texas Freshwater Fisheries center, (903)

</P>
<P>
   5. Gulf Coast: Follow the birdy
</P>
<P>
   Texas is home to more species of birds _ 613, to be exact _ than
any other one state, so it's an ideal spot to begin an avocation of
bird-watching. To help out both novices and experts, the Texas
Parks and Wildlife department has developed the 1,000-plus mile
Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail, which snakes along the entire
Texas coast from the Sabine River to the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The program, the first of its kind in the nation, was completed
late last year. The trail took five years to put together and links
300 birding sites, marked with distinguishable brown signs and
detailed in special birding trail maps. Some areas are adding
observation decks, information kiosks or boardwalks, the better to
spot such species as tanagers, buntings, orioles, warblers,
hummingbirds and such Texas-specific birds as the green jay, ringed
kingfisher, and great kiskadee.
</P>
<P>
   Too big to be covered in one fell swoop, the trail is divided
into three sections covering the upper, middle and lower coast,
from the Sabine River near the Texas/Louisiana state line to the
Rio Grande valley. The first two maps are already available, and
the lower-coast map is scheduled to be available next month. Trail
maps also include information about birds likely to be found at
each site, the best season to visit, and food and lodging available
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Information: For a copy of the birding trail maps, contact Texas
Parks and Wildlife, (800) 792-1112; www.tpwd.state.tx.us

</P>
<P>
   6. Central Texas: Frontier history
</P>
<P>
   The first of a number of regional historical tourism programs
planned by the Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Forts Trail
illuminates the history of Texas' 44 military posts by pointing the
way to eight frontier forts in west central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The fort trail covers a group of forts that were set up in the
1800s to protect and colonize the western fringe of the United
States, adding suggestions about other small towns and attractions
to visit. Since it would be tough to cover the entire trail during
one trip, consider these highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Isolated Fort McKavett, near Menard, has 16 restored buildings;
its visitor center contains a model of the fort as it appeared in

   7. South Texas: Border Stories
</P>
<P>
   The second of the historical commission's regional programs is
Los Caminos del Rio, which covers the 200-mile corridor from Laredo
to Brownsville, providing opportunities on both sides of the border
to learn about wildlife, Spanish colonial life, military history,
and the birth of Texas ranching.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested stops along the tour include:
</P>
<P>
   San Ygnacio, an old ranching outpost that is home to a historic
district including the Jesus Trevino Fort, occupied from 1830 to
1871.
</P>
<P>
   Los Ebanos/Ciudad Diaz Ordaz International Ferry, the last
hand-pulled ferry on the U.S.-Mexican border, dating to the days
before bridge construction was common.
</P>
<P>
   Sabal Palm Grove, a preserved section of the native palm
woodland that once lined the banks of the lower Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Palmito Ranch, where the last battle of the Civil War was fought
_ 30 days after Lee's surrender at Appomattox.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: Laredo, Edinburg/McAllen or Brownsville all make
logical bases for this tour.

`MAD MAX': A PUNK WESTERN SERIES SET IN THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A new breed, ferocious and wild,'' Tina Turner snarled about
the characters populating George Miller's ``Mad Max'' series.
Miller's directorial debut, ``Mad Max,'' has so much comic-book
volatility that it triumphed over the wretched dubbing it received
when it was released in the United States in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max'' sounded as if it had been revoiced by airline pilots.
(Their soothing, untroubled enunciation almost functions in the
same way the ridiculous English dubbing did for Woody Allen's
``What's Up, Tiger Lily?'') The movie was dubbed because it was
felt that the cast's Australian accents would scare off
exploitation house audiences.
</P>
<P>
   (This may not have been a bad instinct in those days before the
snack spread vegemite, the band Men at Work and Nicole Kidman.) The
roughness of the Aussie speech and the distinction of the actors'
voices obviously add another layer of vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson had so much presence that even when soaked in the
mellifluous anonymity of the voice-over, he roots the picture in an
emotional reality as Max Rockatowsky, the highway cop of the
low-budget dystopian future. Max's world is destroyed when his wife
and child are murdered by a vengeance-minded gang.
</P>
<P>
   Max's early ease and his eventual suffering become the heart of
the picture. ( Gibson's shy reserve _ he's a little embarrassed _
provides a rare opportunity to watch a star on his shaky first
voyage.)
</P>
<P>
   Miller's infatuation with Joseph Campbell _ there's much talk
about a need for heroes in ``Mad Max'' _ unfortunately came into
full flower during the sequels ``The Road Warrior'' and ``Mad Max:
Beyond Thunderdome.'' ( Gibson rarely smiled when he strapped on
his leather future cop/bondage gear for Miller.)
</P>
<P>
   It's true that ``Max,'' which opens Friday at the Film Forum in
Manhattan in the original Australian version, is a punk western.
Miller's reflexes for kinetic filmmaking never fail him. They
propel the picture through the scenes of domestic ecstasy between
Max and his wife and the insistent mush of the strings.
</P>
<P>
   Though the punkish attitudes and look seem quaint now, they gave
``Max'' a sense of menace. Probably a whole generation has grown up
without seeing ``Max'' projected on a wide screen, and the movie
might feel a little subdued because it lacks a wall-to-wall
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   But it lets the exhilarating rowdiness and visual intensity of a
master moviemaker do its work, with Miller creating by his wits and
rubbing sticks together to create a riveting classic. &QL;

MOVIES, MONKS AND MORE: `THE CUP' RUNNETH OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Orgyen Tobgyal
and Godu Lama in scenes from ``The Cup.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There are independent films and there are independent films ...
and then there's ``The Cup.''
 &HT;    Every so often a new, unheralded movie comes along that is
charming, disarming and offbeat enough to constitute that cinematic
miracle, something we haven't seen before.
 &HT;    ``The Cup'' is like that. The first film ever produced in the
tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, it first drew attention at last
May's Cannes Film Festival. In January it won raves at the Sundance
Film Festival, and it will open around the country in March.
 &HT;    Its story line is not one that would have major-studio moguls
rushing to invest, and it doesn't have a single recognizable name
on screen or behind the camera. But this one is worth seeing for
many reasons.
 &HT;    For one thing, there's the story: A bunch of young Tibetan
monks, living in exile in a Bhutanese monastery, get caught up in
World Cup soccer fever. They go to extraordinary lengths to rent a
huge satellite dish _ no easy task in preindustrial Bhutan _ and
transport it by tractor to their monastery to watch the 1998 Cup
final between France and Brazil.
 &HT;    They're rooting for France, incidentally, because France is one
of the few nations to speak out strongly against China's occupation
of Tibet. And no, you don't need to be a fan of soccer _ or
football, as we Brits call it _ to appreciate ``The Cup.''
 &HT;    Shot in the Chokling Monastery, a Tibetan-refugee settlement
nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, the film centers on a
13-year-old monk (Jamyang Lodro), a fanatical soccer fan who
organizes the monks' campaign to watch the Cup final. Lodro's
father, also a monk, is Orgyen Tobgyal, who plays the monastery's
tough but fair-minded disciplinarian.
 &HT;    You can be sure this film's producers didn't have to dicker with
agents over salaries, luxurious trailers or above-the-title credits
_ the rest of the cast are all local monks without a scintilla of
acting experience.
 &HT;    The man behind this remarkable film is Khyentse Norbu, a Tibetan
lama. The other day the 37-year-old Norbu, shaved-headed and
wearing the traditional colorful garb of a Buddhist monk, sat down
with me at a Los Angeles hotel to talk about his film and the
virtual miracle of its getting made.
 &HT;    Initially, Norbu says, he figured he could make the movie for
$10,000.
 &HT;    ``It was unrealistic,'' he admits. ``The nearest camera was
thousands of miles away.''
 &HT;    Eventually he met the British producer Jeremy Isaacs, who
convinced a New York backer to bankroll the film to the tune of
$600,000 _ still bargain-basement cheap in this era of ballooning
Hollywood budgets.
 &HT;    He was able to save money by casting the monks as themselves and
housing the entire crew in the monastery throughout the shoot.
 &HT;    ``Everything was there,'' he says. ``Basically, all we had to do
was to roll out of bed and shoot the film.''
 &HT;    The monks had to get up at 4 o'clock every morning to complete
their religious duties before filming began, and as novice actors
struggled to learn their lines. Nevertheless, the director says, no
scene took more than three takes _ a tribute, no doubt, to the
monks' powers of concentration.
 &HT;    Norbu insists that his movie is based on a true story.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' he says, ``I had to omit some of the true events,
because when you tell too much truth people don't believe it.''
 &HT;    Yes, he says, there really are monks who are soccer fanatics. In
fact, there are lots of them.
 &HT;    ``Growing up in a monastery, I've noticed that monks everywhere
are obsessed with football,'' he says. ``I guess there's something
similar between religion and a football match.
 &HT;    ``But the film is about the change of a society, about what
really goes on in a monastery,'' he adds. ``It's an insider's look
at the touchstones of Tibetan culture and society.
 &HT;    ``Many people have this strange idea that in a monastery
everything is rigid, everything is sort of sterilized,'' Norbu
says. ``Maybe monks are like God, they don't eat and they don't
s--t. That's not true. They are human _ they eat and drink and
watch football. This is another human realm, and they have their
own life.
 &HT;    ``But now they are being challenged by technology, the media and
television _ knowing they have to live with it, they are trying to
learn how to cope with it.''
 &HT;    Even by the standards of first-time filmmakers, Norbu has an
unusual background. As ``the third reincarnation of the Khyentse
lineage,'' he lived until the age of 12 at a monastery in Sikkim,
and later studied Buddhist philosophy in Bhutan and India. He
speaks English well, and has traveled to North America and other
parts of the world to teach and lecture on Buddhism.
 &HT;    His interest in movies was whetted by a stint as technical
adviser and unofficial apprentice to director Bernardo Bertolucci
during the making of ``Little Buddha'' (l993), a Buddhist-themed
film.
 &HT;    ``And then I loved to watch a lot of films,'' he says. ``I think
it's better to understand the power of this influence than to be
its victim.''
 &HT;    ``The Cup'' has lots of low-key humor, as the monastery's abbot
struggles to understand his monks' passion for a sporting event in
which 22 men from two countries utterly unlike Tibet run themselves
ragged for a cup which no one can find a use for.
 &HT;    ``This is two civilized nations fighting over a leather ball,''
the astonished abbot says to his right-hand man. ``Is there any
sex?''
 &HT;    Fine Line Features, which is distributing the movie in North
America, was faced with a tough challenge: How do you market a
foreign-language movie about a bunch of Buddhist monks who are
soccer nuts to a country in which Buddhists are a tiny minority and
soccer is, at best, the No. 5 spectator sport?
 &HT;    In an inspiration, Fine Line had representatives at the
U.S.-Iran soccer match held in January at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena, Calif., handing pamphlets about the film to the 58,000
spectators. It worked _ the independent film to end all independent
films actually began to generate some buzz.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, back in Bhutan, Norbu is viewed with more than a
little skepticism by his fellow monks. In fact, he's proud of it.
 &HT;    ``I was the black sheep even before I made this film,'' he says,
``and I've been known for being a little bit wild when I was young
_ not so much a rebel, but a practical joker.''
 &HT;    That side came to the surface last month, when he and a fellow
high-ranking lama strolled down the Champs d'Elysee in Paris. His
colleague was in traditional monastic garb ... but Norbu wore high
heels and a miniskirt, along with a red wig, lipstick and lots of
makeup.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to experience how men look at women,'' Norbu says.
``But my colleague told me that more people were looking at him
than at me.''
 &HT;    Hmmm ... might be his next movie.

 &HT;    Tracking Tiger's assault on Nelson's record
 &HT;    By Alan Tays
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every week, every day, the question is becoming a little less
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can Tiger do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson's mark of 11 consecutive wins in 1945 is one of the
most enduring records in sports. Like Joe DiMaggio's 56-game
hitting streak or Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game, it was
considered unbreakable. The closest anyone had gotten was barely
more than halfway, when Ben Hogan won six in a row in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes Tiger Woods, who has made a career _ two
careers, actually: one as an amateur, another as a pro _ out of
doing things nobody thought could be done. He has reeled in Hogan.
Only Nelson sits in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   So now the question begins to be asked: ``Can Tiger catch
Nelson?'' It's mostly whispers so far, for these are not words
ready to be spoken aloud. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus doesn't have an answer. The question is the verbal
equivalent of a sucker pin, and Nicklaus doesn't shoot at sucker
pins. ``I don't know'' whether Woods can catch Nelson, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has surprised me and a lot of people by winning two or
three more tournaments than anybody thought he could win.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Golden Bear doesn't have an answer, how about a dog?
Trick-shot artist Dennis Walters, who entertains at Woods' clinics,
has incorporated a Tiger-and-Byron routine into the act he performs
with his dog, Benji Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many tournaments did Byron Nelson win in a row in 1945?''
Walters asked Benji on Tuesday during a clinic at the Senior Tour
event in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf,'' Benji
responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more does Tiger Woods need to catch him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf.''
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, Benji can't comment on Tiger's chances,
although that doesn't stop people from asking. ``The other day
somebody asked him what's the capital of Rhode Island,'' Walters
said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dougherty played the PGA Tour from 1975-97. During that time,
he saw two players win three times in a row: Hubert Green in 1976
and Gary Player in 1978. ``I thought those three wins by those two
individuals, it just set them apart,'' Dougherty said on the other
end of the practice range in Naples. ``To do it six times . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Can he break Nelson's record? ``I doubt it would happen,''
Dougherty said, ``but I wouldn't want to be the one to say he's not
going to do it. Let's just say if he does it, it's not going to
surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't surprise Nelson, either. ``I'm pulling for him,''
Nelson told The Boston Globe on Monday after watching the TV
broadcast of Woods coming from seven strokes down with seven holes
to play to win at Pebble Beach. ``I'm proud of him, and when he
breaks it, whether he wins 12 or 15 or whatever, I'll congratulate
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said luck will have to be with him. ``You are going to
have to play good for not only a long period of time, but you have
to get lucky,'' he told reporters Wednesday at Torrey Pines Golf
Club in La Jolla, Calif., where he'll tee off in the Buick
Invitational this morning. ``You have to get some good breaks right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Woods said if rookie Matt Gogel had shot par on
the back nine Monday at Pebble Beach, the streak would have been
over. But Gogel collapsed with a 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a chance'' to catch Nelson, Woods said. ``But the
chances are very small. Very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods claims the only time he thinks about his streak is when
reporters ask about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out there trying to win a tournament, that's all,'' he
said. ``And what I did last week doesn't really matter this week.''
</P>
<P>
   That was true for Nelson in 1945, too, although that's about the
only similarity between Nelson's experience and Woods'. Nelson was
33, nine years older than Woods is now. The country was at war,
which meant shortages of golf pros (in the service) and golf balls
(rubber rationing). Woods makes more than $10 million annually from
endorsements; when Nelson was asked if Wheaties could put his
picture on their boxes, he cut the deal himself for $200 and six
cases of cereal. To get away from fans and reporters, Nelson often
chose not to play practice rounds. ``That sounds foolish,'' he
wrote in his autobiography, How I Played the Game, ``but many times
I played my best golf when I hadn't even seen the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson began his streak in the 10th tournament of 1945, the
Miami International Four-Ball at Miami Springs Golf Club. He was
paired with his friend McSpaden (Mc-SPAY-den). The two had played
many exhibitions together during the war, for they were both 4-F,
Nelson because his blood didn't clot well, McSpaden because of
severe hay fever.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson already had won three tournaments that year, continuing
the fine play he had demonstrated in 1944, when he won eight
tournaments and had a stroke average of 69.67. He also had begun
keeping a record of his rounds in 1944, charting which clubs he
used, how he played and what mistakes he made. His analysis was
that poor chipping and too many careless shots had hurt him in '44,
and he was determined to improve in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   He set specific goals for himself going into '45, among them
setting records for low scoring average and low tournament score
and leading the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Money was important to Nelson. His main goal was to earn enough
to buy a ranch so he would have a business to fall back on.
Nelson's wife, Louise, was skeptical of the idea, because Byron
didn't know anything about ranching. She agreed to the plan on the
condition that they not borrow any money. So he had to earn the
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and McSpaden won four better-ball matches, including a
second-round victory over Hogan and Ed Dudley, to win at Miami
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the war, the U.S. and British Opens and the Masters
were not played in 1945, and the tour had a two-month layoff after
the Atlanta tournament. When play resumed, Nelson won by 10 shots
in Montreal. The next week, the streak almost ended at six.
McSpaden took a one-shot lead into the final round of the
Philadelphia Inquirer Invitational, and closed with a 66. Nelson,
however, birdied the last five holes to shoot 63 and edge McSpaden.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Chicago Victory Open for consecutive win No.
8, Nelson came to the PGA Championship in Dayton, Ohio. As a former
champion he was not required to qualify, but he did anyway, because
he wanted the cash prize that was given to the qualifying medalist
(he tied with Johnny Revolta). In the first round he beat Gene
Sarazen, and later he said he had heard that Sarazen wanted to play
him in the first round because he wanted to either lose right away
or have a chance to win the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After beating former New York Yankee Sam Byrd in the PGA final,
Nelson next won the All-American Open at Tam O'Shanter in Chicago.
The Tam O'Shanter tournaments, run by promoter George S. May,
always had the year's biggest purses. In addition to winning
$13,600 in war bonds, Nelson also took $100 from May. After Nelson
shot 34 on the front nine in the first round, May offered him
100-to-1 odds that he couldn't shoot another 34 or better on the
back. Nelson bet only $1, but he eagled the 10th, made a
hole-in-one on the 11th and went on to shoot 32. ``We used to call
the tournaments the Byron Nelson Benefits,'' said May's daughter,
Dottie May Campbell of Tequesta. ``Because he would show up and
he'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   The streak was stopped two tournaments later in Memphis, where
Fred Haas Jr. became the first amateur to beat a field of pros
since 1936. Another amateur, Bob Cochran of St. Louis, led Nelson
by nine shots after two rounds. Haas came on with a 64 in the third
round and pulled away for a five-shot victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government asked some of the better amateurs to
participate (in tournaments during the war years),'' said Cochran,
now 87 and a seasonal resident of Quail Ridge in Boynton Beach.
Cochran, whose grandson, Bobby, plays the PGA Tour and finished 13
shots behind Woods at Pebble Beach, was paired with Nelson and
McSpaden in the third round, and remembers a newspaper headline
quoting Nelson as saying he didn't think he could win.
</P>
<P>
   Before the next tournament, Nelson and McSpaden played an
unofficial four-ball match against Hass and fellow amateur Billy
Gilbert in Jackson, Tenn. ``And they beat the hell out of us,''
recalled Gilbert, who now lives in Jupiter. ``He was a little hot
after losing in Memphis.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the depletion of the tour during the war
years, but by 1945 many of the stars were back. Snead played in 26
events, Hogan in 18. Regardless of the competition, though,
Nelson's accomplishments stand on their own merits. Forget wins and
streaks. His stroke average was 68.33, which would be a record
except that official statistics were not kept during the war.
(Woods set the record with 68.43 last year.) He averaged an amazing
67.68 in final rounds.
</P>
<P>
   So we're back where we started. Can Tiger do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can win six, you can certainly win seven,'' said Senior
Tour pro Dave Stockton. No. 7 might even come easier than No. 6
did. Woods won a World Junior title at Torrey Pines when he was 15
and is the defending champion in the Buick Invitational. When he
won last year, he shot a third-round 62, which was his best round
as a pro. He later bettered that mark to 61 in _ do you believe in
omens? _ the Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great story,'' Stockton said. ``In your wildest dreams,
you never think anybody's ever going to get near 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to have them looking in their rear-view mirrors, I
know that.''

&HT;     COMPUTER HACKERS ARE `GRAFFITI VANDALS' OF CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT BEER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Berkeley astronomer who cracked a Cold
War-era computer hacking ring said that those responsible for
attacks on the World Wide Web are showing their ``technological
ignorance'' by crippling Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, German teen-agers using computers and the Internet
broke into computers at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. The
intrusion was discovered by astronomy professor Cliff Stoll while
he was investigating a 75-cent shortfall in a program that kept
track of thousands of dollars of the lab's budget.
</P>
<P>
   That discrepancy led Stoll on a yearlong hunt into a Soviet
hacker ring fueled by cocaine and reporting to the KGB. Stoll's
book on the saga, ``The Cuckoo's Egg,'' was a bestseller that gave
the outside world a first look at the murky world of computer
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll was somewhat bemused by this week's attacks on some
leading Internet sites, and also a bit angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are not that well vested in society,''
Stoll said of whoever is responsible for the assaults. ``They're
trying to contemptuously show their technological arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   This week Yahoo, Amazon.com, CNN.com, ETrade and a host of other
Web sites were flooded with millions of simultaneous requests for
information, causing the Internet sites to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll said the attacks remind him of vandals who spray-paint
graffiti on buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bid for attention,'' he said, ``to show their friends
and the world what they can do.``
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably thinking: 'Won't we impress everybody?'''
Stoll said. ``The answer is no. The Internet has had plenty of
vandals in the past, and will have plenty of vandals in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But the attacks are confusing to Kevin Poulsen, who was once a
fugitive for hacking into phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to analyze them because it's really unprecedented,''
he said. ``This is very sophisticated stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 Poulsen gained notoriety when his house was raided by
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which was looking for
evidence that he had illegally invaded computers running ARPANET,
the precursor of the modern Internet. Poulsen, then 17 years old,
was not charged with a crime at that time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Poulsen became the first hacker to be indicted under
U.S. espionage laws after the Justice Department charged him with
stealing classified information while working as a defense
contractor. He was cleared of the charges, but did spend five years
in prison for hacking into the phone system to rig radio station
contests while a fugitive from the espionage charges. He was
released from prison in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to Poulsen, who now works at the SecurityFocus.com, a
Washington, D.C.-based computer security industry reference site,
hackers usually brand their work with public digital scrawls on
target Web sites or by bragging about their exploits in Internet
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetrators of this week's attacks have so far been silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when someone cracks a Web site, they'll put up
something like 'I'm the best. The rest are losers,''' Poulsen said.
``It's usually about outsmarting the adults. That's because,
invariably, it's teen-age boys doing this.''

 &HT;    MEXICANS JACK UP EFFORTS TO STOP THEIR COUNTRY'S AGE-OLD HABIT
OF VOTE BUYING
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 13 
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Anonymous callers hissed threats and three letters
contained ugly warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That commission won't last long, and you won't either,''
Mexican congresswoman Elodia Gutierrez says one note warned her in
late December.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez is the president of a new Mexican special
congressional commission with a very sensitive mission.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans go to the polls on July 2 to elect their next president
and Congress in what could be the most competitive election ever in
this country. Over the course of the campaign season now underway,
Gutierrez's watchdog commission will attempt to prevent the misuse
of federal funds and poverty programs to pressure voters or buy
their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Obvious-to-subtle intimidation and vote buying using food
subsidies, educational scholarships and other government assistance
as bait remains one of the main obstacles to truly fair elections
as Mexico becomes more democratic, according to election watchdog
groups here.
</P>
<P>
   The party that is accused most of using this age-old practice _
aimed mostly at the poor _ is Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, which has controlled Mexico's presidency and most
other political offices here for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, pork barrel politics is not unique to Mexico. But
Mexico, with its legions of poor and its long history of one-party
domination, is in a different league from other countries, said
Daniel Lund, director of MUND (CQ) Opinion Services in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 70 percent of Mexicans are poor and are in need of
assistance or touched by assistance,'' Lund said. And the PRI _
dominating every level of government from municipalities up to the
presidency _ has held most of the purse strings of government for
more than seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys Lund conducted in the state of Mexico last year found
that nearly one-third of voters in the governor's election in July
received financial ``incentives'' around election time. They
included scholarships, food and agricultural subsidies, building
materials and temporary public works jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a feel for the timing of these economic incentives,''
Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who received the assistance _ sometimes under conditions
of coercion _ represented more than 50 percent of the vote for the
PRI's candidate for governor, Lund added.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's candidate won with only 41 percent of the vote, so
those who received subsidies contributed a critical bloc of votes
to the party, Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez, a member of the rival National Action Party, or PAN,
said that five previous congressional commissions that monitored
other state elections also gathered complaints of coercion by state
bureaucrats loyal to the PRI. Those commissions investigated
complaints in Tabasco, Coahuila, Nayarit, Guerrero and Veracruz.
</P>
<P>
   PRI members of Congress tried to block the formation of those
smaller temporary commissions as well as the one that monitors this
year's presidential race. But because opposition parties have
outnumbered the PRI since 1997 in the Lower House _ the Chamber of
Deputies _ the PRI lost.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Oseguera, a PRI deputy who will serve on the commission,
said he believes it is nothing more than a ``propaganda tool'' for
the opposition, which is eager to trumpet any complaint, solid or
dubious, against the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make their constituents think the PRI doesn't
want oversight of public funds,'' Oseguera said. He claimed, too,
that the commission is redundant because Congress has an office of
fiscal responsibility that monitors federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' Oseguera said, ``we are going to fulfill our duty
and work with the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   He challenged the commission to also make sure that the other
political parties, which now control 10 of Mexico's 31 state
governorships, don't try to use their power to buy votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez, who has been very vocal in her criticism of the PRI,
said she doesn't know who tried to intimidate her after the vote
last December to establish the commission. The harassment stopped
only after she went public about it in the Mexican press in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the eye of the hurricane,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that when the commission was investigating
complaints in Tabasco about vote buying in 1997, she and other
chamber deputies had to flee hotels by fire escapes and back doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people outside threatening us and insulting us,''
she said. ``They were people from the PRI rank and file who said we
wanted to take away the food that Gov. Roberto Madrazo gave them.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, expects
to be in a tight race up to July and has made fighting corruption,
including the misuse of public funds, a centerpiece of his
campaign. He has challenged his own party to clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's demonstrate, with actions, that in the new PRI that we
are constructing there is no room for the corrupt,'' Labastida said
in a January speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said the watchdog commission gives Labastida and the
PRI a chance to prove they mean what they say.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is setting up offices in every state in Mexico to
receive complaints about coercion. It will present those it
believes have merit to the full Congress and to appropriate legal
authorities for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Meyer, a well-known political analyst here, said
Mexico's opposition-dominated Congress is still inexperienced and
may have trouble ``following the money'' spread around the country
in federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But he called the commission ``indispensable'' for a country
moving out of a one-party system.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big bases of support for the PRI now is the poor.
And one can also say that the poor are the product of the PRI,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The poor exchange votes for food, Meyer said, because ``in the
brutal world they live in, it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the programs the commission will watch with special
vigilance, Gutierrez said, are those offering cash and seed
subsidies to poor farmers and a federal poverty program for the
poorest of the poor called Progresa.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which was launched in 1997 by President Ernesto
Zedillo, gives about 2.6 million families _ 14 million individuals
_ cash subsidies and medical care if they keep their children in
school instead of forcing them to drop out to work.
</P>
<P>
   Destitute families that often earn less than the $3 minimum
daily wage in Mexico's countryside receive about $10 a month for
food.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said complaints cropped up in Guerrero about federal
workers pressuring families to vote for the PRI if they wanted to
stay in Progresa.
</P>
<P>
   In Coahuila last year, Gutierrez said, complaints about coercion
using temporary public works jobs and other incentives led to the
resignation of a federal director of social programs in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Civic Alliance, an independent elections watchdog group here,
also said it interviewed people in the state of Mexico who claimed
they had been warned to vote PRI if they wanted to continue to
receive educational subsidies for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Coercion around election time ``is something rooted in the
history and culture of our country,'' said Silvia Alonso, executive
secretary of Civic Alliance, which will assist Gutierrez's
commission.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico's provinces, where people are less educated, federal
workers and PRI officials are often very blunt about the link
between voting and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they'll say, 'You'll get part of your scholarship or
credit now and the other half after the election,' `` Alonso said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission and Civic Alliance are conducting an educational
campaign to remind people that their votes are secret and that
federal programs are not gifts from political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of poor people still don't know the difference
between the government and the PRI,'' Alonso said. ``If the
government does something for you, it's the PRI doing it.''

   AFGHAN-HIJACK (Stansted, England) _ The four-day hijacking of an
Afghan airliner at Stansted airport ended peacefully Thursday
morning, with no weapons fired and no injuries to the 150 or so
people aboard the plane. But no sooner had the British government
solved that crisis than it found itself embroiled in another: how
to cope with the rush of hijackers and hostages from the plane who
now say they want to stay in Britain. Twenty-one people have been
arrested in connection with the hijacking, the government said. And
at least 60 passengers, along with 14 dependents, are seeking
political asylum in Britain, apparently in an effort to flee the
repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-SUHARTO (Jakarta) _ In what appeared to be a serious
new effort to prosecute Indonesia's former president, Suharto, the
government named him for the first time on Thursday as a suspect in
a widening corruption investigation and summoned him for
questioning on Monday. Suharto's lawyers immediately responded that
he was too sick to attend. The former president is 78 and was
hospitalized twice last year after a stroke. By Seth Mydans.

   KOSOVO-TROOPS (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ British peacekeeping
troops in Kosovo took over guard duties from some of their French
colleagues Thursday on a bridge in an ethnically divided town that
has become a focus of violence between the Serbian and ethnic
Albanian communities. The change follows reports accusing French
soldiers in the town, Mitrovica, of abandoning U.N. police during a
recent riot. (Summary from wires) By Carlotta Gall.

   ISRAEL-LEBANON (Jerusalem) _ A flare-up of fighting in Lebanon
appeared to subside Thursday as people in northern Israel emerged
from bomb shelters and the United States set a meeting on Friday of

Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas, or the Party of
God, declared victory in the latest round of violence, an
indication that it was coming to an end. By Joel Greenberg.

   MCCAIN _ The two-man race for the GOP presidential nomination

with cameras in tow. The trooper is now worried that he may lose

   GINGRICH _ Newt Gingrich was a fund-raising powerhouse the first
half of 1999, pulling in more than a $1 million from people all
over the country for his political action committee. That was
before he left his wife. Since July, when Gingrich filed for
divorce from his wife of 18 years, the Friends of Newt GIngrich PAC
has brought in a quarter as much, about $288,000. Gingrich's folks
say they have purposely slowed their fund-raising as they looked to
close down the FONG PAC. Last month, Gingrich started a new kind of
fund-raising machine, one from which he won't be required to file
disclosures and donate money to candidates. (Stanford, Atlanta

Baltomore Ravens in the city jail where he eats bologna sandwiches
and refuses to talk to police. Police are not talking either as
hundreds of rumors swirl concerning the events that prompted the
deaths of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar. We take the reader on a
timeline of sorts from the moment Baker and Lollar arrived at
Cobalt with friends and relatives from Akron, to the moment their

that turned deadly. (Longa-Abramson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

</P>
<P>
   A note passed between young students at prayer reads ``Brazil
vs. Argentina'' and on the walls is scribbled ``Long Live
Paraguay!'' At World Cup time, soccer fever even seeps into a
Buddhist monastery. In countries engaging one another on the soccer
field, children sneak out of their houses at night for all kinds of
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At the monastery, Orgyen (Jamyang Lodro), an undersize
14-year-old with a wonderfully gravelly voice about to change,
leads two pals on a breakout to a local bistro with a television
set.
</P>
<P>
   France is playing Italy. Orgyen keeps leaping up, blocking the
view of other fans. It must be a rarity to see three Buddhist
monks-in-training get thrown out of an establishment for rowdy
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At the monastery, which has been transplanted from Tibet to
India, the elderly Abbot (Lama Chonjor) doesn't know what the World
Cup is, but he and his gentle aide, Geko (Orgyen Tobgyal, an
eminent Tibetan theologian) realize that there will be no sticking
to lessons until the matches are over. ``Don't worry, there's no
sex,'' Geko tells the Abbot.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing an easing of restrictions, young Orgyen has a
proposition: allow the monks and students to rent their own set for
the cup finals. It takes a while for permission to arrive, but
arrive it does. Money is raised to pay the Indian electronics
dealer, who suddenly raises the fee, necessitating further hurried
fund-raising by the indefatigable Orgyen.
</P>
<P>
   A large dish antenna is hauled to the roof and pointed in the
desired direction. The game commences and the electricity goes out.
In a sports bar that might start a riot, but here the gathering
finds other things to talk about until power is restored.
Afterward, Orgyen still owes money. ``You're so bad at business,
you'll make a good monk,'' Geko tells him. &QL;

explanation would be required even without the language problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-11 They can handle the film, provided they have the
patience. Orgyen makes a most appealing hero, as it were. &QL;

experience; most wouldn't be caught dead. &QL;

<P>
   Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette, David Arquette, Parker
Posey, Scott Foley &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Wes Craven &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 116 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Craven's killer with the concave cheeks is back for a third tear
through a crowd of terrorized young things ripe to be done away
with. In ``Scream,'' the 1996 original, some viewers didn't know
quite what to make of a wildly entertaining time with
knife-wielding maniacs. By now, though, it's clear that all is
meant in fun, or as fun as its gets in a slasher movie.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, where were we? After a blood bath at Windsor College in
``Scream 2'' (1997), Sidney Prescott ( Campbell) has retreated to
the woods, where she broods and wrestles with a disturbingly vivid
sense of deja vu. Down in Hollywood, on the set of ``Stab 3,'' a
movie being made about the ``Scream'' killings, two bodies have
turned up. ``Ten more murders and we have a calendar,'' says a
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the masked one is back, impossibly quick and cunning as he
executes swift coups de grace. ``Stab 3'' personnel in his path are
immediate goners, but his ultimate target is Sidney, whom he is
having trouble locating.
</P>
<P>
   Not at all shy about her own whereabouts, Gale Weathers (
Arquette), the driven television newswoman of the first ``Scream''
films, crashes the set of ``Stab 3.'' There she reconnoiters with
Dewey ( Arquette), the nice, pedestrian policeman and lukewarm love
interest of the earlier movies, who is now an adviser for ``Stab
3.''
</P>
<P>
   Things take a while to register with Dewey, but he battles
gamely with the slasher. So does Sidney, who comes out of seclusion
to deal retaliatory blows with authority. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Stabbings and slashings are shown with only a modicum
of restraint. &QL;
</P>

   AGES 14-17 Speaking for all the infiltrators (those under 17 who
will get in without an accompanying adult), they've probably seen
worse, not that this is any recommendation. But then, most parents
are well aware of ``Scream'' movies. &QL;

<P>
   There are a lot of private lives in the San Fernando Valley, and
Anderson, director of ``Boogie Nights,'' gets into at least half of
them in a mosaic of a film that takes three hours to put the pieces
together, and then none too neatly.
</P>
<P>
   Start with old Earl Partridge ( Robards), a television mogul who
lies dying of cancer and lamenting past indiscretions that prompted
him to desert his 14-year-old son at a time of crisis. Feeling no
small amount of guilt herself, Earl's young wife ( Moore) wails her
regrets about the many times she cheated on him and quaffs a good
portion of her husband's painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the valley a morose former child television quiz
show star ( Macy) watches a young genius named Stanley (Jeremy
Blackman) whip all comers on the current show ``What Do Kids
Know?'' Behind the scenes, the host, Jimmy Gator ( Hall) is as
doomed by cancer as Earl Partridge and just as guilty about his
extramarital dalliances and mistreatment of his daughter, Claudia (
Walters).
</P>
<P>
   And in auditoriums full of men feeling sorry for themselves, a
strutting macho cult figure, Frank T.J. Mackey ( Cruise), preaches
that ``it's not what you deserve, it's what you take.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson keeps these and other characters in motion. Suddenly
they all start singing the same song and later, as if in a biblical
epic, it starts raining frogs. Everybody is alarmed except Stanley.
``It's something that happens,'' he says. &QL;

&HT;     REFORM IS A LEGACY OF POLITICAL MAVERICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Feb. 13)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the presidential contenders squabble over who
most deserves the label of reformer, we should recall the profound
impact that political mavericks have had on America in little more
than a century.
</P>
<P>
   The look backward has become timely in view of George W. Bush's
decision, following his defeat by John McCain in the New Hampshire
primary, to burnish his ``Mr. Compassionate Conservative'' image
with a ``Mr. Reformer'' persona.
</P>
<P>
   If a single moment could be cited as the beginning of modern
reform efforts, it probably would be a blistering-hot July
afternoon in Chicago in 1896. It was then that the 36-year-old
William Jennings Bryan strode to the stage of the Democratic
National Convention and mesmerized an entire generation of
progressives with the most memorable speech ever delivered at a
national political convention.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates cheered, cried, applauded, stamped their feet and
seemed to be filled with hope and optimism. Some saw the young man
standing before them as a Christ-like figure who had come to save
them from the tyrants of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, attractive and eloquent, young Bryan had a mission to add
to the Democratic platform a plank demanding the free coinage of
silver. It was a populist proposal that was supported in the South
and the states west of the Mississippi but bitterly opposed by
so-called ``sound money'' states in the East.
</P>
<P>
   As delegates marveled at his oratorical skills, Bryan excoriated
proponents of the gold standard and then spoke the words that
students of history know well:
</P>
<P>
   ``Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the
world, supported by the commercial interests, the laboring
interests and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their demand
for a gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down
upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns; you shall not crucify
mankind upon a cross of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention-goers went wild and on the fifth ballot nominated
the former Nebraska congressman for president. He had other issues,
including opposition to the protective tariff and support of a
federal income tax, but he was identified throughout the nation for
his stand in favor of silver.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan conducted the most strenuous presidential campaign the
nation had ever seen. Traveling 18,000 miles in three months, he
addressed an estimated 5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But he was defeated by Republican William McKinley and a huge
campaign war chest that the Bryan forces could not possibly match.
</P>
<P>
   The silver issue no longer has any meaning to Americans. Bryan
is only vaguely remembered. He ran unsuccessfully for president
again in 1900 and 1908, served as Woodrow Wilson's secretary of
state from 1913 to 1915 and ended his career pathetically at the
1925 Scopes ``monkey trial'' in Dayton, Tenn., where he opposed the
teaching of evolution in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   His monetary stand in 1996 was so revolutionary that the
retiring Democratic president, Grover Cleveland, refused to support
him.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, however, Cleveland Mayor Tom Johnson explained the
meaning of the campaign. It was, he said, ``the first great protest
of the American people against monopoly _ the first great struggle
of the masses in our country against the privileged classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform and rebellion have been an inbred part of the American
spirit since the Revolutionary War began in 1775 and the
Declaration of Independence was drafted in 1776.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan and that other dynamic insurgent of the early 20th
century, Theodore Roosevelt, were forebears of all the reformers
who were to follow them. John McCain, George W. Bush, Al Gore and
Bill Bradley now claim the label, although none is a reformer in
the tradition of Bryan and Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   But Roosevelt, the trust-buster, conservationist and Panama
Canal builder who ascended to the presidency on the death of
McKinley in 1901, is a special favorite of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after watching McCain win the New Hampshire primary and
soar in the public opinion polls as a reformer, pointed to his
record as Texas governor last week and asserted, ``I'm a reformer _
with results.'' McCain retorted: ``If he's a reformer, this is
hisfirst day on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley continues to describe the Democratic Party as the
``party of reform.'' But his primary reform at the moment appears
to be an attack on Gore's character.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore's proposals are not seen as revolutionary
reforms because they are largely rehashes of policies that Bill
Clinton failed to get enacted.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier decades of the 20th century, several great reformers
operating on Capitol Hill _ among them Wisconsin's Robert
``Fighting Bob'' LaFollette, Nebraska's George Norris, California's
Hiram Johnson and Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey _ achieved memorable
results.
</P>
<P>
   After Theodore Roosevelt left the presidency in 1909, many of
our most lasting reforms emanated from Woodrow Wilson's ``New
Freedom,'' Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``New Deal'' and Lyndon
Johnson's ``Great Society.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell L. Willkie, the colorful Republican presidential nominee
in 1940, sought to move the GOP out of the myopic confines of
isolationism, but it took a World War II military hero, Gen. Dwight
D. Eisenhower, to achieve that reform as president in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   It usually shocks the ruling barons of the two political parties
when an insurgent musters enough public support to seek and achieve
dramatic changes in the way we live. Yet Social Security, Medicare,
the income tax, food and drug laws, the GI Bill of Rights, creation
of the Federal Reserve, protection of our natural resources,
collective bargaining for labor and laws ending racial segregation
and discrimination are among the many profound changes achieved by
reformers in the past century.

   AFGHAN-HIJACK (Stansted, England) _ The four-day hijacking of an
Afghan airliner at Stansted airport ended peacefully Thursday
morning, with no weapons fired and no injuries to the 150 or so
people aboard the plane. But no sooner had the British government
solved that crisis than it found itself embroiled in another: how
to cope with the rush of hijackers and hostages from the plane who
now say they want to stay in Britain. Twenty-one people have been
arrested in connection with the hijacking, the government said. And
at least 60 passengers, along with 14 dependents, are seeking
political asylum in Britain, apparently in an effort to flee the
repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan. By Sarah Lyall.

<P>
   Most design movements reflect the political regimes that spawn
them, whether Ming or Louis XIV. Just as Louis Seize furniture was
designed to reflect royal glory, Empire furniture was part of
Napoleon's brilliant propaganda machine. But Britain's Arts and
Crafts Movement grew out of the politics of protest. It began in
the mid-1800s as a reaction to the human cost of rapid
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
   This is the complicated subject of ``Leading `The Simple Life':
The Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain, 1880-1910,'' an exhibition
at the Wolfsonian-Florida International University Museum in Miami
Beach, Fla., which is on view through August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founders criticized the Industrial Revolution for
exploiting workers, blighting the countryside and filling store
shelves with poorly made goods,'' explained the curator of the
show, Wendy Kaplan. ``They felt such evils could be overcome by a
return to the `simple life,' a utopian vision of a rural
environment where the craftsperson could control the creative
process from design through execution.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the movement, reacting to what Kaplan called
``the cacaphony of the many Victorian styles prevailing at the
time,'' set clear goals: a revival of hand craftsmanship, more
satisfying working conditions, the elevation of decorative arts to
the status of fine arts and the promotion of simple, uncluttered
interiors through design unity.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a revolution but a reformers' campaign. ``The Arts
and Crafts Movement is proposing an alternative rather than an
oppositional culture,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may see some parallels with the ideas of Martha
Stewart, who constantly uses the phrase ``it's a good thing.''
Kaplan defines this approach as moral aesthetics. ``There is a
virtue to living with handmade things,'' she said, explaining the
movement's point of view. ``It makes you a better person and your
environment better.''
</P>
<P>
   This viewpoint, she added, had its roots in the ideas and social
ideals promoted by the 19th-century English architect A.W.N. Pugin,
the art critic John Ruskin and the designer and reformer William
Morris. ``They were convinced the decorative arts were no less
important than the fine arts of painting, sculpture and
architecture,'' she said. ``They attributed both moral and
aesthetic value to work done by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The 85 objects in the Wolfsonian show range from rustic
furniture to complicated pottery. It includes Morris' colorful
floral designs for wallpapers, textiles and books; an Iznik-style,
ceramic Pugin garden seat made by Minton &AMP; Co. at the Staffordshire
Potteries in England; a simple walnut coin cabinet designed by
Ernest W. Gimson; and an inglenook, a chimney corner, from an 1897
house on the Isle of Man.
</P>
<P>
   The fireplace and built-in inglenook are among the earliest
surviving examples of the interior designs of M.H. Baillie Scott, a
leading British architect of the day who subscribed to the ideal of
Gesamtkunstwerk, or total design unity. Architects then, like many
today, wanted to design not only the house but also the
landscaping, furniture, lighting fixtures and rugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, the fireplace, faced in colorful William de Morgan
glazed ceramic art tiles, and the wood inglenook are original. The
wallpaper is a reproduction of the original block print; the
original stenciled frieze, with gliding birds and wind-blown trees,
has been copied by hand. The upholstery fabric is similar to the
original Morris Co. pattern. The Wolfsonian reinstalled the
elaborately carved fireplace surround, with capitals covered in
plant motifs.
</P>
<P>
   ``By investing everyday objects with the highest design
principles, Baillie Scott also strove to integrate art and life,''
Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gimson's coin cabinet is an archetypal Arts and Crafts object.
``Arts and Crafts adherents believed in the supremacy of individual
expression, which could best be realized through the domestic
vernacular _ a national style based on adherence to the local
traditions, climate and geography of the native land,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the idealistic designer, Gimson abandoned London to set up
a workshop in the Cotswolds. He did not make the cabinet (that was
done by the craftsman Harry Davoll), but he designed it _ using
walnut, a local wood _ in a style that showcased time-honored
cabinetmaking techniques. The cabinet is a plain rectangular box
that sits on four tall legs. The only ornamentation is the
geometric arrangement of its walnut panels on its front and the
exposed construction of dovetails and joints. ``The focus was on
form and structure,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, vernacular style enters the design. The stretcher
securing the legs is clearly inspired in its shape by an
old-fashioned hay rake, the model then used for clearing fields in
Gloucestershire.
</P>
<P>
   The Arts and Crafts Movement also celebrated the handwork of
more ``primitive'' cultures, like that of the Celts. One of the
most arresting textiles in the show is a pelican hearth rug, which
was sold at Liberty of London. It was designed by Mary Seton Watts,
the wife of G.F. Watts, a Victorian painter. She was asked to
design rugs for the 500 female weavers at the Alexander Morton
carpet company in Donegal, Ireland, in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Watts wrote to the weavers to explain her design. She put a
pelican in each corner because it was a bird that drew ``blood from
her own breast to feed her young . . . . a sign of the love which
will give its own heart's blood to help those who suffer or are in
need.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kaplan explained, ``Watts' letter is a testament to the
combination of romanticism, reverence for beauty and the earnest if
somewhat patronizing desire to improve the lot of others that
characterized the Arts and Crafts Movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement in Britain may not have a style that is easy to
characterize, but it did have enormous influence. Josef Hoffmann
went to England in 1902 to see the work for himself before
co-founding the Wiener Werkstatte in Vienna, Austria, the next
year. Dutch, German and Hungarian designers were also influenced by
the idea of organic unity and the concept of the total work of art
in an interior.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the movement ran out of steam by World War I. Its
proponents ``were never able to resolve the basic conflict between
the goal of democratic art and one that upheld the highest
standards of craftsmanship,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   But its impact continues. ``It transformed not only how objects
looked but also how people looked at objects,'' she said. ``It
changed peoples' attitudes toward design and the home and compelled
them to think about the relationship of art to everyday life.''

 &HT;    This ocean setting is less kind to Leonardo DiCaprio, adrift in
a jaded tale of paradise lost
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sun-loving dudes of ``The Beach'' think that life should be
just that: a day on the beach. Even better, days and days on the
beach, with nothing to do but spear fish for dinner, work that tan
and smoke lots of weed. Unfortunately, Leonardo DiCaprio's new
movie, the first he's made since cavorting aboard the
moviegoer-loving ``Titanic,'' is as empty-headed as its main
characters.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio, who has a film opening in metro Atlanta on the same
weekend as his former shipmate Kate Winslet, plays a restless young
man named Richard. His character is so vaguely defined that it's
surprising he even has a name instead of a label: Icon of Gen-X
Ennui. Richard likes to travel; that's all we know about him. Oh,
and he's feeling disenfranchised, detached, unconnected to the
world. Even when he stumbles onto the bloody corpse of an
acquaintance, he can't feel anything. ``I was waiting for it to hit
me, but it just didn't happen,'' he says in voice-over.
</P>
<P>
   On the lookout for the next wild adventure, Richard lucks out in
Bangkok. Thailand. A wreck of a guy, aptly named Daffy (manic
Robert Carlyle), tells him about a hidden, forbidden island, a
perfect beach, a true paradise. Better yet, he gives him a map.
</P>
<P>
   Richard shares the secret with a couple of other attractive,
aimless people like himself, French couple Francoise (Virginie
Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet). Like him, they apparently
have no ties to a job, family or any kind of annoying
responsibility. So they say, Bien sur, let's go.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the beach is the best part of the story. Once there,
the movie turns into a tepid mixture of ``Lost Horizon,'' ``Lord of
the Flies'' and even ``Peter Pan.'' That's because the island
harbors a secret commune of lost boys and girls, rat-race dropouts
like Richard and his pals. They're led by the steely founder, Sal
(Tilda Swinton, bringing an elegant hint of danger to the movie).
The rest of these characters are pretty interchangeable. The
trailers for the flick don't show any of them, probably because the
filmmakers don't want to bore you prematurely with their blond,
blank company.
</P>
<P>
   In short, things are great on the island, then they go bad.
Mainly it's Richard's fault. Over and over, he does the wrong
thing. We're supposed to empathize. Sent into the woods on a
lookout mission, he has a mental meltdown and briefly becomes a
tropical Travis Bickle. The character's imagination is so
undernourished that, at the worst of his wacko phase, he imagines
himself as the action hero of a video game.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shallow Grave'' and ``Trainspotting,'' director Danny
Boyle, producer Andrew Macdonald and screenwriter John Hodge
explored the cynical self-absorption of characters in their early
20s. They need a new subject. Boyle directs with his usual flair,
but the story fails him. The movie relies so much on DiCaprio's
voice-overs that it starts to suffer from the same detachment
plaguing its central character: It gets told to us, instead of
letting us discover it as we go.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's meant to be a satire, this tale of privileged young
people who find paradise, then screw it up. But it's hard to get
attached to characters who care about only one thing: their next
moment of pleasure. It's like being asked to root for the
two-dimensional figures in a mural. Cinematographer Darius Khondji
(``Stealing Beauty,'' ``Seven'') makes the most of the exotic
locations. But all the beauty in the world can't camouflage the
movie's gorgeous emptiness.

<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big. The sheer size of the latest Imax
offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience. Otherwise,
this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest state is
just one of those languid Discovery Channel-style nature flicks.
The film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about
Alaskan life. (Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz and Antonia
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar grows up with this
humane celebration of nurturing women. ``All About My Mother'' is a
virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage
classic ``All About Eve.'' It's a movie that can wink at its own
campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the gut. Dark and
tender, the movie beautifully balances humor and heartache. In
Spanish with subtitles. (SM)1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Movie'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   featuring Mark Borchardt.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Smith's documentary is alternately hilarious and
horrifying as it chronicles Mark Borchardt's attempts to make his
autobiographical magnum opus, ``Northwestern.'' The 30-ish
Borchardt _ a high-school drop-out with three kids who still lives
with his mother _ is a not-so-young, incredibly selfish film geek.
``American Movie'' is funny, scary and as compulsively watchable as
a train wreck. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' R (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson
</P>
<P>
   and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   A finely made adaptation of Frank McCourt's popular memoir of
growing up in poverty and death in Ireland that's almost too
stately for its own good. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their
favorite parts re-created onscreen. Others, who don't have the
memory of McCourt's lyrical prose whispering in their heads, might
wonder what the fuss is all about. (SM) 2 hours, 26 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we didn't need another version, but this one is handsome
and engaging. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish,
songless costume drama that holds its own against the beloved 1956
musical ``The King and I.'' A mix of old-fashioned moviemaking
doused with contemporary political correctness. (SM)2 hours, 20
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. Al Pacino plays the coach
of the fictional Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team
co-owner Cameron Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and
emerges as the best actor in the large cast. (Bob Longino)2 hours,
50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beach'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Leonardo DiCaprio,
</P>
<P>
   Virginie Ledoyen and Tilda Swinton.
</P>
<P>
   A secondhand plot. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a restless young man
who travels with other aimless, privileged young people to a hidden
paradise _ then screws it up. It's hard to get attached to
characters who care about only one thing: their next moment of
pleasure. The cinematography makes the most of exotic locations.
But all the beauty in the world can't camouflage the film's
gorgeous emptiness. (SM)1 hour, 59 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' PG (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams,
</P>
<P>
   Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays the android Andrews, a metallic butler who
slowly develops human traits (creativity, curiosity and a hint of
emotion). But the people around him age, wither, die. Overlong,
``Man'' moves swiftly for its first 90 minutes, but it slows down
to become a disappointingly conventional love story that isn't
really persuasive. The movie has a heart, but a flagging pulse.
(SM)2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (sexuality, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving has adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr.
Larch (Michael Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal
abortions in his remote Maine orphanage. In the second,
less-engaging half, Larch's protege, parentless Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), runs off with a World War II pilot and his girlfriend to
learn about the world. Excellent performances by Caine and by
Delroy Lindo as an apple picker. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
Considering the difficulty of conveying religious faith in film,
he's surprisingly successful in depicting both kinds of passion.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM)1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Eye of the Beholder'' R (language, sex, nudity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ewan McGregor
</P>
<P>
   and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What begins
as a hypnotic riff on the old surveillance classic, ``The
Conversation,'' ultimately veers off into nowhere. Too bad because
the picture is as stylishly acted as it is directed. An isolated
British surveillance agent (Ewan McGregor) becomes more involved
than he intends in the case of a diplomat's son and a mysterious
femme fatale (Ashley Judd). (ERG)1 hour, 50 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated. Music from Beethoven
</P>
<P>
   and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, shop the mall, then go rent the
original. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity and content relating
</P>
<P>
   to drugs, sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Two fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna
Kaysen's memoir about the two years she spent in the '60s at a
mental hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent
of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' As Susanna, Winona Ryder
steadies the movie and gives it its emotional center, but Angelina
Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath. (ERG)2
hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing, beautifully
acted and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison
novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest
prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Michael Clarke Duncan, has
mystical powers of healing. ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of package
Oscar voters love. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Grizzly Falls'' PG (wilderness adventure
</P>
<P>
   violence and some mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bryan Brown,
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Clark, Tom Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Old Harry (Richard Harris) scares his grandkids with a campfire
tale of a hungry bear, then tells them a remarkable adventure he
had at their age and that's the start of ``Grizzly Falls.'' It's a
tale about a boy, a bear, and the bond between parent and child _
even if not of the same species. ``Grizzly Falls'' becomes a
message on the value of family bonds that comes through without a
sentimental overstatement. (SM) 1 hour, 34 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun Shy'' R (profanity, violence and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock and Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   Stressed-out undercover drug cop Liam Neeson matches ulcers with
stressed-out junior Mafioso Oliver Platt in a deeply funky New York
comedy about murder, stomach disorders and male anxiety. It's
scattershot, but it scores a few surprising satirical bull's-eyes.
Love interest Sandra Bullock's screen time is unwisely minimized by
producer Sandra Bullock. (Bob Campbell, Newhouse News Service) 1
hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke'' R (sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Winslet
</P>
<P>
   and Harvey Keitel.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Campion's movie is about how we blow smoke at each other
emotionally, spiritually and sexually. An Australian girl (Kate
Winslet) who's joined a cult in India is lured home by her family,
who hire a professional deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel). As the two
face off, the question becomes who will deprogram who. It's a
brutally primal battle of the sexes that makes Sam Shepard look
tame. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington delvers his best performance in years as
pugilist Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender
wrongly imprisoned for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though
ably directed, the film contains some fabrications _ and invents
one key character, a Javert-like detective _ to tell this otherwise
compelling true story. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't She Great'' R (language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane
</P>
<P>
   and Stockard Channing.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't great. Or even good. Bette Midler plays ``Valley of the
Dolls'' author Jacqueline Susann, but the movie is neither
biography nor burlesque. It can't decide if its main character is
great, or a gargoyle. (SM)1 hour, 35 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families, love and
forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with small
miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
``Magnolia'' is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of movie you
live through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. Among
the stellar acting talents: Tom Cruise, Jason Robards Jr. and
Julianne Moore. (SM) 2 hours, 59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti.
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying look at the mind of comic genius Andy Kaufman, capped
by Jim Carrey's spectacular performance. Carrey's impersonation of
the late, prankish Kaufman, a performer as interested in making
people squirm as making them laugh, is often so pitch-perfect, it's
more like channeling than acting. The movie's title comes from an
R.E.M. song about the comic, and the Athens band wrote the movie's
score. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Julie'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Saffron Burrows
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Mullan.
</P>
<P>
   August Strindberg's late-19th-century play was once considered
so controversial that it was banned in his native Sweden. Today,
his study of class warfare spiced with sexual politics seems boring
and misogynistic. Miss Julie (Saffron Burrows) initiates a doomed
flirtation with her father's footman, Jean (Peter Mullan). Mullan
plays an arrogant and manipulative Jean, and Saffron is a neurotic
and conflicted Julie. (ERG) 1 hour, 43 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube
</P>
<P>
   and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yacking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone'' R (violence, sexuality, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas,
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson and Lolita Davidovich.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining take on boxing. Antonio Banderas' Cesar, a
Madrid-born boxer, now lives in Los Angeles and has become best
pals with Woody Harrelson's Vince, a Texas-born fighter. The first
half of the film is a road movie, with Grace (Lolita Davidovich),
Vince's former girlfriend and Cesar's current lady, driving them to
Las Vegas; it soon becomes a love story. (From Los Angeles Times.)
At metro theaters. 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream any more, but it's a decent wrapup of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween getup. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Simpatico'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Bridges, Nick Nolte,
</P>
<P>
   Albert Finney and Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the world of horse-racing, this movie reminds you that
you can have the best bloodlines imaginable and sometimes the nag
still won't run. A blue-ribbon cast is wasted on a tale of old pals
with a shared shady past that still haunts them 20 years later.
Jeff Bridges is a wealthy Kentucky breeder; Sharon Stone his
doped-up, depressed wife; Nick Nolte a crumpled alcoholic
blackmailing Bridges. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women nor children.
(SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' PG (mild peril and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A lame kids movie about Syracuse schoolkids trying to extend one
out-of-school snow day into two. Chevy Chase plays a TV weatherman
suffering all kinds of humiliation and Chris Elliott appears as the
ominous Snow Plow Man with bad teeth. (Robert Denerstein, Denver
Rocky Mountain News) 1 hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his John Deere riding mower more than 300
miles to reconcile with his brother (Harry Dean Stanton). It's a
sublime celebration of America at its most beautiful: kind,
welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG)1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis, Jonathan Lipnicki
</P>
<P>
   and the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945 children's book, Stuart
is a 3-inch-tall computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox.
He brushes his teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such
convincing visuals you'll swear he's the next best critter since
``Babe.'' But his movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into
run-of-the-mill slapstick. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence, profanity, brief
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate
Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty
thriller. Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to
Italy to bring back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his
lifestyle and committing murder. Fans of the earlier, superior
adaptation ``Purple Noon'' will likely find this lovely-to-look-at,
but psychologically flawed, version disappointing. (SM) 2 hours, 18
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG)1 hour, 16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Topsy-Turvy'' R (for a scene of risque nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Broadbent
</P>
<P>
   and Allan Corduner.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas
to enjoy ``Topsy-Turvy.'' But a love of the theater can help you
appreciate Mike Leigh's meticulously detailed valentine to
performers of the 19th century. The ensemble is superb, but it's
Jim Broadbent who turns in a monumental performance as the pompous
William Gilbert. (SM)2 hours, 39 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of Tom Hanks,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) At metro theaters. 1 hour,
25 minutes. A

 &HT;    CONGRESS ATTACKS THE INTERNET COOKIE MONSTER
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internet privacy is rapidly emerging as a major
issue in Congress, with legislators on both sides of the aisle
calling for laws that would let online consumers block the unwanted
spread of personal information through cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tidal wave of public concern,'' Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., said Thursday. ``As more people are becoming
aware that some of their most intimate personal and family
information is vulnerable, they are expressing their outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   As Torricelli put an Internet privacy bill into the
congressional hopper, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., mustered a
bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus of both senators and
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Torricelli, at least a half-dozen lawmakers plan
legislation this year that would require online sites to better
inform consumers about their information practices. Some of the
bills provide for penalties and enforcement if the Web sites drop
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, announced the separate formation of a Senate Democratic
Privacy Task Force. It will be led by Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the
Senate Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of privacy touches virtually every American, often
in extremely personal ways,'' Daschle said. ``Whether it is bank
records or medical files or Internet activities, Americans have a
right to expect that personal matters will be kept private.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show that assaults on privacy, enabled by
sophisticated Internet technologies, rank as a top concern among
Americans. Many are alarmed by increasingly widespread access to
individual financial data, health records, employment and
purchasing records.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has yet to enact a comprehensive law that governs the
gathering of online information. So far, it has dealt with privacy
protection issues on a piecemeal basis, passing such laws as the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Driver's Privacy
Protection Act, and, most recently, the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's approach would require prior approval by Internet
users before any personal information could be disclosed to others.
This so-called ``opt-in'' standard would compel Web operators to
tell consumers that their data would remain private unless they
specifically authorize its disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. and Conrad Burns. R-Mont., have
co-sponsored a bill that allows the collection of data, but gives
consumers the rights to stop the collection and to access any data
that has been gathered. Their proposed legislation, as well as a
measure advanced by Leahy, take what's known as an ``opt-out''
approach.
</P>
<P>
   In favoring the Torricelli approach, Marc Rotenberg, executive
director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a consumer
advocacy group, said: ``Too many Web sites set the privacy switch
to 'off' and leave it to the Internet user to find the switch and
set it to 'on.' It is time to change the default to privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Clinton White House and the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) have favored a self-regulatory approach that
encourages industry codes and voluntary compliance. But there are
signs, as the fall elections approach, that the administration is
gearing up to directly respond to mounting public concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has found that while 85 percent of Web sites gather
personal information in one form or another, only 14 percent offer
users notice of intended use and only 2 percent explicitly state
their privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the FTC concluded a privacy workshop with promises
from the 10 leading ad service companies to come up with voluntary
guidelines. But the companies have yet to put anything forward.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the proposed bills would curb the current practices of
DoubleClick Inc., the leading advertising firm on the Web.
DoubleClick's computers post banner ads on about 1,500 Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Such messages can be directly targeted at specific customers
with the use of computer text files known as cookies. They permit
DoubleClick and other online ad firms to track what people are
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, cookies allow a Web site to store user information
for possible future retrieval on the computer hard drives of users
who visit the site. In a similar fashion, Internet service
providers can track and store a record of a user's online activity.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting databases _ an estimated 100 million profiles have
been gathered to date _ reveal how users surf the Internet, what
goods and services they buy and where they spend their time.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, DoubleClick reversed its prior policy of providing
solely anonymous data to marketers. It now combines cookie profiles
with data from direct mailers that further help determine the
actual identity of the surfers.
</P>
<P>
   In November, DoubleClick paid $1.7 billion for Abacus Direct
Corp., a data warehousing company that records consumers' catalog
purchases, including name and address data. That allows the company
to know not only where users go online and what they do there but
also who they are, where they live, and their phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Online marketers say the data-gathering is merely a way of
fine-tuning marketing for the convenience of consumers as well as
marketers. But with millions of cybercitizens up in arms, Capitol
Hill is listening as never before to the growing chorus of
complaints.

 &HT;    `Tigger' should tickle tykes' fancy
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because my designated consultants, Malory (age 3 1/2) and
Charlie (2 1/2), had to back out, I decided to rely on Stevie _ he
happened to be sitting in front of me at the Saturday morning
screening _ for some expert commentary concerning ``The Tigger
Movie.'' Before the lights went down, he grilled his expert (i.e.,
his mother) on whether she thought Rabbit would be in it. She did.
</P>
<P>
   Being a mother, she was right. In fact, the whole gang _ Pooh,
Piglet, Kanga, Baby Roo, Owl, Eeyore, even Christopher Robin _ is
back in this charming animated feature, in which the irrepressible,
ever-bouncing Tigger searches for his family. He learns, as you may
have guessed, that families come in all shapes and sizes. And they
don't necessarily have to come from the same family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, ``The Tigger Movie'' comes from a totally different
branch of the Disney animated family. Unlike its more celebrated
and ambitious cousins _ ``The Lion King,'' say, or ``Tarzan'' _
``Tigger'' is clearly aimed at little ones with limited attention
spans. The Barney babies, you could call them. The songs, by
Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman (``Mary Poppins''), are
sprightly, the dialogue is kid-level funny and the animation often
has the manic energy of ``Alice in Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the action is laid on a bit thick. I don't think A.A.
Milne ever envisioned an avalanche in his Hundred Acre Wood. But,
given the adrenalin-hungry synapses of the post-``Star Wars''
generation, that's probably not such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   The voice talent is generally excellent. Special credit,
however, must go to John Hurt as the narrator, who somehow manages
to sound like a combination of Sterling Holloway (the original
Pooh) and Sebastian Cabot (the original narrator). All in all, this
is a movie that knows its intended audience and takes care of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
Directed by Jun Falkenstein. Rated G. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: As Tigger himself would say, it's tiggerific.

 &HT;    Modern Iran: Islamic outside, Western inside
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 13.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New Hampshire earlier this month, Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
race for the Republican presidential nomination blew a tire, while
Vice President Al Gore managed to get a slender leg up for the
Democratic nomination. Whoever might succeed President Clinton,
there are no clear signs as yet that his stature will one day
require a monument.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, God himself is up for re-election, and even he is no
shoo-in.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Iranians vote in parliamentary elections that could
produce a setback for the ``government of God'' that was swept into
office in 1979. In the same year, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was
banished from the country and sent on an ``open-ended vacation.''
Ayatollah Khomeini, exiled by the shah in 1964, returned in triumph
and Iranians voted overwhelmingly to create an Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
   The heat and fervor of the revolution have cooled, the
population has almost doubled in 20 years and God's ministers have
shown no great gift for managing an economy or much else. A younger
generation, meanwhile, has grown up, and it is impatient.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Last Great Revolution: Turmoil and Transformation in
Iran,'' Robin Wright _ who has visited Iran more than any other
American since the fall of the shah _ compares the events of
1978-79 with the French and Bolshevik revolutions, each a pivotal
turn in the making of the modern world. It is a large claim to
make, and not one that Wright, a journalist whose work has appeared
in the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and The New Yorker,
quite substantiates. If anything, she undermines it by her vivid
portrayal of a proud and talented people who would like to give God
a rest and enjoy the freedoms _ political, artistic, sexual _ of
the modern world. You wish she had contented herself with
reportage. She is a perceptive observer of individual lives and,
especially, the relations between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   This, in fact, is the book's virtue _ its portrayal of people
who can be Islamic on the outside and Western on the inside. Wright
attends movies and basketball games, listens to people in the
security of their homes and sees how different the private person
is when the cloak of secrecy is removed. She is a better observer
than she is an analyst, but insists on telling a larger story than
has to be told.
</P>
<P>
   Simplifying revolution
</P>
<P>
   ``All the current signs,'' she writes, ``indicate that the
Islamic Republic is not likely to survive in its current form. The
turbaned class may manage to hang on to power, although over time
they almost certainly will be weakened and probably increasingly
will have to work alongside those in hats _ and maybe someday even
ties. Iran's theocrats, however, could also eventually go the way
of France's Jacobins and the Soviet Bolsheviks, fading into history
because of their own unacceptable political dogmatism, internal
squabbling or economic failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to put too fine a point on it, but the anatomy of a
revolution (to borrow the title of Crane Brinton's classic book) is
rather more complex than that, and so, too, are the forces that
shape what comes after. Set that quibble aside, though, and
consider instead two assertions on which Wright's argument stands
or falls. One is that ``the singular political theme of the Modern
Era ... has been empowerment, or the spread of political, economic
and social rights to the Earth's farthest corners.'' To the
contrary, the primary impetus for change in the modern world has
not been constitutional government and democratic freedoms but
nationalism. Even Soviet Russia, bloodily created in the name of
classless equality, quickly learned that national interest
superseded ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for reform
</P>
<P>
   The second assertion is more serious. ``In ways never
anticipated,'' Wright tells us, ``Iran's upheaval did succeed in
creating a climate for revolutions within the revolution _ in
women's rights, the arts and social customs, among the young and,
most important, within Islam itself. Through these other movements,
Iranians took bigger steps in defining a modern Islamic democracy
than any other Muslim country.''
</P>
<P>
   The landslide election of Mohammed Khatami as president two
years ago was, of course, just that _ a demand for reform and
liberalization. But the pressures that brought about his election
have only increased. Trying to placate the mullahs who hold real
power and the students and others restive for change, Khatami has
been more a conserver of the revolution than a champion of reform.
Newspapers that supported him have been closed by the clerics, with
no protest from the president. Dissenters have been executed, and
Khatami has been silent.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's sympathy for Khatami and the balancing act he must play
is amply evident. But there are Iranians you hear little from in
this frequently fascinating travelogue, and they are the people who
think Khatami has no intention of bringing about real reform. For
them, he is only a less menacing man of God. And for them, at
least, the Islamic revolution cannot be the last.

 &HT;    More than a wisp of sexual tension in `Holy Smoke'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of ``Holy Smoke'' is about how humans blow smoke at each
other _ sexually, spiritually, emotionally; through relationships,
through religion, through family.
</P>
<P>
   But at its white-hot core, Jane Campion's film _ her riskiest
since ``Sweetie'' _ is a disturbingly primal battle of the sexes,
so savage, surprising and, at times, searingly funny that it makes
Sam Shepard's forays into similar territory look positively
sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Barron (Kate Winslet) is an outgoing, free-spirited
Australian girl who goes to India with a buddy. The friend comes
back by herself and, in a traumatized whisper, tells Ruth's family
that their daughter has joined a cult. ``We wanted to visit a live
guru,'' she explains regretfully. ``You know, for a laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Barrons, this is no laughing matter. Mom (Julie Hamilton)
takes off for India and lures Ruth home with a lie about her
father's health. The next step is to hire P.J. Waters (Harvey
Keitel), an expensive American ``exit counselor'' who has
successfully ``exited'' 189 people from cults. He takes Ruth to an
isolated outback cabin where, he claims, he will break down her
defenses in three days. But Ruth proves a complex case and, before
long, we're not sure who's going to deprogram whom.
</P>
<P>
   That P.J. has an Achilles' heel in his crotch area is made
immediately clear when Ruth's randy sister-in-law gives him oral
sex his first night on the job. That Ruth will act on this weakness
is made clear when she realizes that her other strategies _ reason,
faith, cleverness, acting out, stubbornness, whatever _ won't work.
Sexuality, Campion tells us, is still the ultimate female trump
card.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker is both scrupulously fair and scrupulously brutal
in her depiction of Ruth and P.J. He's like a diminutive Johnny
Cash: a strutting bantam cock in a black shirt, cowboy boots and
too-tight jeans that emphasize his middle-aged paunch. She is less
physically ridiculous _ Winslet is actually fetching in her sari _
but her proclamations about Baba and the world in general come off
as naive at best, hippie-imbecilic at worst.
</P>
<P>
   The Barron family seems to have dropped in from another movie
altogether. They're tacky middle-class caricatures and more than a
tad eccentric (a live sheep serves as a dip table). The dichotomy
in tone is initially jarring, an overdone weakness in an otherwise
relentless film. But Campion saw that leaving us locked up with
Ruth and P.J. for the entire movie would be too much. The nutty
Barrons may not be the right relief, but at least they offer relief
of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   As for the two stars, this is among the best work either has
ever done. P.J.'s transformation is as spooky as it is clownish.
``I was young once and handsome,'' he insists. ``You would've been
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't born! '' she shoots back.
</P>
<P>
   Winslet's performance is equally daring in its raw, naked power
_ both emotionally and physically. With a survivor's cunning, she
bluntly confronts her captor, asking casually, ``Do you like my
personality or my breasts best?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke'' is a demanding and often perverse picture. But
its sense of itself is exhilarating. In a very odd way, it could be
seen as a ``Taming of the Shrew'' for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Winslet. Rated R for strong sexuality and
profanity. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Plenty of fire _ and fireworks _ in this ``Smoke.''

 &HT;    `Beauty' of Oscar contest shaping up
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 13.
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year was easy. This year, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1998 Oscar nominees were announced, you could be
pretty certain of at least three of the five best-picture picks:
``Saving Private Ryan,'' the forceful Steven Spielberg war epic;
``Shakespeare in Love,'' a swoonfest both sexy and smart; and
``Life Is Beautiful,'' the little Italian flick that conquered the
world with its audacious blend of slapstick and Holocaust horror.
</P>
<P>
   This year won't be so easy to predict because of a wealth of
terrific movies vying for attention. When the 1999 nominees are
announced Tuesday morning, there's really only one title you can
really bet will be on the list.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``American Beauty,'' a movie whose buzz has risen, fallen
and risen again since it appeared in theaters in September,
plastered with great reviews. Yeah, the critics loved it. But so
did mainstream audiences (a rare match).
</P>
<P>
   The academy likes to give out Oscars to movies the public likes
(witness ``Forrest Gump,'' ``Dances With Wolves,'' ``Titanic,''
``Braveheart''). But ``Beauty'' is more than entertainment: Its
script, by Marietta native Alan Ball, balances so many moods, it
keeps you perpetually off-balance and entranced. One moment it's
satirizing suburbia, stale middle-age marriages and the miseries of
adolescent life. The next, it lets you witness the unexpected, holy
grace in (of all things) a plastic bag dancing in a gust of winter
wind. Operating on multiple levels (just like its title),
``American Beauty'' fuses art and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   While crowning star Kevin Spacey as one of our great screen
actors, the film introduced two new talents: first-time scripter
Ball, and director Sam Mendes, making his debut transition from
theater to film.
</P>
<P>
   Since DreamWorks Pictures lost its big chance at the Oscar crown
last year, when ``Private Ryan'' lost to ``Shakespeare,'' the
studio will probably put every resource it has into lobbying
academy voters to name ``American Beauty'' best picture. It already
stands as the front-runner, without the need of behind-the-scenes
politicking. (If you don't know why, you'll have even a better
chance to see ``American Beauty'' when DreamWorks re-releases it
Friday on 750 screens nationwide.)
</P>
<P>
   So what will the other four best picture nominees be?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can bet the list won't include ``Topsy-Turvy,''
director Mike Leigh's meticulous look at the theatrical
collaboration of Gilbert and Sullivan. Sure, it won best picture
and best director from the National Society of Film Critics and the
New York Film Critics Circle. But it's not the kind of movie Oscar
likes.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the not-a-chance category: ``Man on the Moon,'' once a
rumored front-runner that wound up doing no business. Then there's
``Magnolia,'' an ambitious, abrasive ensemble film that audiences
either love or loathe.
</P>
<P>
   Other would-be contenders that probably didn't gain enough
momentum to attract Oscar: ``The Cider House Rules'' (too
political, with its pro-choice message), ``Snow Falling on Cedars''
(too cold), ``Angela's Ashes'' (too wet).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is a likely nominee because it's a serious,
somber movie about contemporary issues (big tobacco). ``The Green
Mile'' may make the grade because it's the solid, square kind of
Hollywood film that manufactures schmaltzy uplift and strong box
office grosses. Plus Tom Hanks stars. And Oscar and Tom enjoyed one
of the greatest love affairs of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two slots are a harder call. ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley'' could slip in. It panders to the academy's love of period
dramas, offering great costumes and Italian vistas. On the
downside, it's the tale of a murderous sociopath driven by
homoerotic longings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair,'' another period piece, could also fit
the bill. But two dark-horse movies could fill the remaining slots
instead: M. Night Shyamalan's ``The Sixth Sense,'' the surprise hit
of 1999, and ``Being John Malkovich,'' the art-house must-see
movie. They both have a secret weapon: nominations from the
Directors Guild of America, a group whose selections usually
reflect the academy's choice. (In contrast, ``Ripley's'' Anthony
Minghella and ``Affair's'' Neil Jordan weren't tapped by the
guild.)
</P>
<P>
   There's even a long-shot chance for Spanish filmmaker Pedro
Almodovar's ``All About My Mother'' to make it into the top
category. But foreign films rarely make best picture. Since ``Life
Is Beautiful'' did just last year, ``Mother'' will probably be the
front-runner in the foreign film category.
</P>
<P>
   So what about actors? You can bet on nominations for Denzel
Washington (``The Hurricane''), Russell Crowe (``The Insider'') and
Spacey. Annette Bening (``American Beauty''), Hilary Swank (``Boys
Don't Cry'') and Janet McTeer (``Tumbleweeds'') also look like
locks.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves us to ponder the fate of Julianne Moore. Not only
was she the busiest actress of 1999 (five films), she was one of
the best and most diverse. She may turn up in double categories:
best actress for her emotionally torn lover in ``The End of the
Affair'' and supporting actress for her drug-addled trophy wife in
``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she might cancel herself out entirely, if
academy members also vote for her work in the other three movies,
``An Ideal Husband,'' ``Cookie's Fortune'' and ``A Map of the
World.''
</P>
<P>
   A list of nominees without Moore on it would be the real proof
of what a crap shoot the Oscars can be.

 &HT;    `Glory's Shadow' casts a harsh light on Shannon Faulkner's
nemesis
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 13.
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shannon Faulkner, confident that she'd be the first woman to
wear the Citadel ring, stormed the South Carolina military college
in 1995. Within days, though, she'd retreated in the smothering
humidity of a Charleston summer.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a fleeting victory for the college's males-only
corps of cadets.
</P>
<P>
   The Citadel had spent a century and a half girding for the
female assault, Catherine S. Manegold argues in her book ``In
Glory's Shadow: Shannon Faulkner, The Citadel and a Changing
America.'' But that thesis is too sweeping, crumbling under too
heavy a reliance on the past.
</P>
<P>
   Portrayed as an assembly of vindictive cadets and
backward-looking administrators and alumni, The Citadel went from
preventing slave revolts in antebellum Charleston to resisting
integration in the 1960s. Once black cadets enrolled and gained
rank over whites, the next enemy was women, who complained about
being barred from the corps even though The Citadel received tax
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, along came Faulkner, ``the first in a new line,'' and
she tapped into a rage over The Citadel's lost causes. The school
was determined not to lose this battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``An odd truth lay hidden deep within their rage,'' writes
Manegold, a New York Times reporter who covered Faulkner's
successful court battle to end The Citadel's ban on female cadets.
``Their passion and their persistence grew not from what they
wanted to preserve but from what they knew they had already lost.
They had lost their righteous sense of place and the guarantee that
it was theirs alone, and not for sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though an elegant point worth debating, preferably over mint
juleps under a magnolia tree, Manegold's account trivializes
Faulkner's failure to achieve what her highly skilled lawyers had
won for her in federal court. Admitted to The Citadel after a 2
1/2-year legal battle, the 19-year-old from Powdersville, S.C.,
faltered during the first hours of Hell Week and quit four days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Manegold seems determined to excuse Faulkner's unreadiness for
The Citadel's strenuous freshman year. Rather, she holds steady to
her glowing assessment of Faulkner as ``an unsentimental rebel ...
a modern teenager who did not believe in rote obedience yet chose
to pit herself against an institution that taught it as a
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Manegold traces The Citadel's regimen of physical and emotional
abuse to the school's reopening after the Civil War. ``Behind their
own closed gates the game of slave and master thrived,'' she writes
in describing a tradition of hazing that peaked in brutality during
the Vietnam War, when freshmen ``were sometimes herded in
stairwells like squealing, frightened pigs. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Some were beaten. Some were ridiculed,'' she writes. ``Some
were taunted the whole year. In the end, they all broke,''
surviving to heap vengeance upon the next year's crop of freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Manegold's dark portrayal of barracks life has brought out
defenders of The Citadel, which reversed its all-male policy in
1996 after the U.S. Supreme Court declared a similar one at
Virginia Military Institute to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Charleston Post and Courier recently published a letter from
John Grinalds, president of The Citadel, who said that the addition
of 63 women to the 1,650-member corps has strengthened the college,
after ``our shaky beginnings with coeducation ... which we will
apparently be forced to remember every time an enterprising writer
sees a good story in our angst.''
</P>
<P>
   Even sharper criticism came from novelist Pat Conroy, a 1967
Citadel graduate. In a letter to Manegold's editor, Conroy wrote,
``Here is what I think is the great flaw in Ms. Manegold's new
book, and it is a serious one: In her loathing of The Citadel
culture she cannot bring herself to admit that anything good or
worthwhile or exemplary can spring out of such an offensive and
male-dominated crucible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A feminist cannot understand or fathom or translate The
Citadel,'' wrote Conroy, who supported Faulkner and paid for her
college education after The Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   Manegold does seem to relish casting The Citadel as boorishly
out of touch. It's hard to blame her, since Citadel cadets and
administrators provided so many opportunities. Terry Leedom, in
charge of the school's public relations in 1995, described one
reporter as ``a real oinker from Washington, the ugliest reporter I
ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strange encounter late one night after Faulkner had quit,
Manegold described a cadet who had taped the words ``Bye Shannon''
on his car. He circled the campus, again and again, as though he
were patrolling a war zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all over now,'' he said. ``You can clear the area. It's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   For Faulkner, the ordeal is past but not over. A public school
teacher in South Carolina, she is both praised and vilified as the
first to pry open The Citadel's gates, leaving it to others to
enter.

 &HT;    Pop go the tops: All-american classics
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 13.

   It's T-time.
</P>
<P>
   No, not on the golf course, but in the fashion world. For warm
weather wear, T-shirts will become the newest tops to crop up on
the backs of fashionables. But these aren't your classic white T's.
They are printed, painted, colored and dyed in every hue
imaginable. In addition to all-cotton, fitted T's come in silk,
nylon and rayon, often blended with Lycra to give them stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing in general is more decorated for warm weather days
ahead. So are T-shirts, ranging from Vivienne Tam's screen-printed
``Asian faces'' to Sweet Pea's tie-dyed shirts in vivid tones. For
those who like their T-shirts in solid colors, go for Laundry's
simple rhinestone-trimmed styles. Shirts include long-sleeved,
three-quarter or short-sleeved styles, with a variety of necklines
_ round, square or V.
</P>
<P>
   ``A T-shirt is one of the least expensive items you can buy to
perk up your wardrobe,'' says David Wolfe, a New York trend
tracker. ``Prints are where the action is right now. Some women
think a print dress is too much to wear, but a printed T-shirt is
not quite as scary to invest in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, T-shirts have been embellished with political
slogans, company logos, jokes and brand names. This time around,
wild prints grab the spotlight _ some dusted off from earlier
decades. Designers' inspirations for the latest patterns include
flowers, '60s tie-dyed effects, graphic geometrics and Pucci
prints. The latter designs _ made popular by the Italian designer
Emilio Pucci in the '60s _ boast psychedelic motifs in brilliant
colors, usually on a white background.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a T-shirt is effortless. For daytime, the shirts look
great paired with denim, in classic blues or citrus brights, says
Carmen Aseron, Nordstrom's East Coast fashion co-ordinator. She
also suggests wearing them with A-line skirts or cuffed Capri pants
and flat sandals. When the weather turns a bit warmer, white makes
a good foil for colorful T-shirts. At night, wear them with
darker-colored denims that have a bit of sheen to them or silk
Shantung trousers and strappy sandals.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts _ so called because of their shape _ were once the sole
domain of men, usually worn under another shirt or jacket. The U.S.
Navy was the first to adapt a short sleeve, white cotton crewneck
as part of the their standard issue uniform in 1913. By the start
of World War II, the rest of the service followed suit. In the late
'40s and early '50s, the T-shirt came out of hiding and worn by
such acting icons as Marlon Brando and James Dean. Women started
wearing T-shirts, for casual wear, in the late '50s and '60s. But
it took magazine editorJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, in the early
'70s, to popularize them on the streets of New York for the working
woman. And it took actress Jacqueline Bisset wearing a wet T-shirt
in ``The Deep'' to make everone realize what a sexy top it could
be. Today, the T is a favored top not only because it's affordable,
but because it's so comfortable and easy to wear _ precisely why
this top was created.

   WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. _ ``So do I need to curtsy when I
go in?'' Gabriela wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela, my daughter, is a month shy of 10 and has been to
places like Versailles and Blois. So her awed reaction surprised
me. I had just shown her the brochures for the Greenbrier, the
grand old 6,500-acre resort with the world-class golf courses 2,000
feet up in the mountains of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   One color photo showed a tuxedo-clad waiter serving two women in
black evening dresses and two men in dark suits and ties dining in
a high-ceilinged, mirrored room under a five-tier crystal-and-gold
chandelier. The main dining room is so formal that it has a dress
code for dinner: suits and ties or black tie for men, dresses or
evening suits for women. Gabriela figured she'd fit in fine with
her new black velvet dress with the leopard print bolero jacket
bought for $9.95 from the sale rack at Limited Too.
</P>
<P>
   I am in the final stretch of writing a book, the stretch where
day after day you work 18 hours to make deadlines that defy logic
in the computer age. My husband was heading to California for a bar
mitzvah of the son of one of his childhood friends and taking along
our elder daughter, Alessandra. How delightful it would be to spend
a quiet weekend at home together, I told Gabriela. How dreadful,
she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela was determined to top her sister. She wanted nothing
less than Disney World; I wanted a spa. So we came up with a Disney
World of sorts: a step back in time known as the Greenbrier.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Greenbrier is a magical kingdom for mothers and
daughters, particularly if they're prepared to drop a lot of money.
The resort boasts 637 guest rooms, including 46 suites and 71 guest
and estate houses, 10 lobbies and 30 meeting rooms. The 1,600
employees serve a maximum of 1,200 guests. There are three 18-hole
golf courses, a golf academy, 20 indoor and outdoor tennis courts,
indoor and outdoor swimming, croquet, mountain biking, trap and
skeet shooting, whitewater rafting, horseback riding, carriage
rides, fishing in a trout-stocked creek, wild game hunts, ice
skating, exercise rooms, personal training, a medical diagnostic
clinic and a 25,000-square-foot spa.
</P>
<P>
   There is simply too much to do in one weekend, even in winter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, the plantation owners of the South _ men
sporting top hats and walking sticks, women in sweeping skirts and
parasols _ gathered on the Greenbrier's lush, manicured lawns to
sip a Champagne-watermelon juice cocktail. President John Tyler
spent his honeymoon here in 1844. (So did Joseph and Rose Kennedy
and Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher.) The spa's famous heated
sulfur water, from natural springs smelling like rotten eggs,
gained an international reputation for curing rheumatism and
arthritis. ``A European cure without going to Europe,'' one of its
early 20th-century brochures boasted.
</P>
<P>
   During the Civil War, both the Union and the Confederacy
alternately occupied the Greenbrier. During World War II, the State
Department housed several hundred German and Japanese diplomats
here for several months until they could return home. The hotel was
also used as a hospital for 20,000 wounded American soldiers. An
ultra-secret bomb shelter to house all of Congress in the event of
an enemy attack on Washington was built in a separate wing in the
1950s. More than two dozen presidents have visited the resort.
</P>
<P>
   By car, the Greenbrier is four and a half hours from Washington,
eight and a half hours from New York. Since our time was short,
Gabriela and I flew in on a 19-seat US Airways Express propeller
plane. We were the only passengers on board the one-hour flight
that Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela was entranced by the decor. We live in a house that has
white walls, hardwood floors, Middle Eastern carpets and art bought
mostly at flea markets around the world. There are no draperies, no
floral print upholstery, no boiserie. The decor at the Greenbrier,
by contrast, is Martha Stewart on an acid trip. The resort is
particularly proud of its decorating style, originated in the late
1940s by Dorothy Draper, the New York interior designer who used
bold colors (mixing pinks and greens with red was her favorite) and
made flower-patterned chintzes an American design statement.
</P>
<P>
   Our room was a vast expanse, with so much space between the
king-size bed and the television set that we could scarcely see the
screen. Like the rest of the hotel, nothing in the room seemed to
match. The striped pink-and-pale-green-flowered wallpaper did not
match the kelly green carpet or the red comforter with the forest
green trim or the pink-and-white checked upholstered armchairs or
the cranberry-and-white print tablecloth and dust ruffle. It wasn't
supposed to, we were told. This was all part of the Draper plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela was fascinated by the wallpapered walk-in closet, the
cupboard that pulled down to reveal two ironing boards _ a large
one for shirts and a small one for shirt sleeves _ and the
well-stocked mini-bar, which she photographed from several angles.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenbrier has remained faithful to Draper's fastidious
attention to detail. The fluffy bathrobes in our walk-in closet and
the towels in our bathroom were monogrammed with elaborate Gs. The
end sheet of the toilet paper roll in our bathroom did not hang; it
was folded into a V and secured with a gold sticker engraved with
the same G. The G was stamped into the sand in the urns used to
snuff out cigarettes at the entrances to elevators and restaurants.
Pots of perfectly trimmed fresh flowers graced every public room.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenbrier may not be for everybody. For urban Northerners
like us, it was a dramatic leap backward. During our three-day
visit, neither Gabriela nor I saw one nonwhite face among the
guests. ``The History of the Greenbrier,'' a 222-page hard-cover
book, includes only a few nonwhite faces, including a member of a
United States pro golf team, Japanese diplomats interned during
World War II and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Colin L. Powell. But where else can you find a mosaic-tiled pool?
OK, so it's not Piazza Armerina, the 1,800-year-old Sicilian villa
where the pool's colored mosaics depict frolicking women in bathing
suits. But the Greenbrier pool is big _ Olympic-size _ and lined
with tall white columns, with hundreds of yards of fabric draped
from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenbrier also believes in service, real service, the kind
in which the staff really seems to care that you're perpetually
comfortable, fed and entertained. On the weekend of our visit,
there were only about 400 guests, including a veterinary
convention, which meant we got appointments whenever we wanted and
instant pampering.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the dead of winter, the Greenbrier isn't cheap. But the
beauty of traveling here as a single parent is that the child stays
free. It cost $220 a night for the two of us, including breakfast
and dinner. (That doesn't include taxes or an automatic service
charge.) The price also includes free access to the game room, the
swimming pools and an outdoor ice rink, afternoon tea and a movie
every evening. And Gabriela got to choose her meals from the adult
menu. A couple would pay almost twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other activities come with price tags: bowling ($8, including
shoe rental), horseback riding ($42 an hour), indoor tennis ($37 an
hour for singles), a 30-minute carriage or sleigh ride ($26), a
falcon and hawk demonstration at the Falconry Academy ($65 for
adults and $40 for children). The shops sell gift items geared to
indulgent grandparents. Gabriela spotted a small metal horse as a
gift for her baby sitter. The only problem was that it cost $495.
Porcelain-shard boxes that can be found in Beijing's overpriced
state-run stores for less than $2 started at $15. We didn't do much
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   But we did do a lot of eating. We arrived and headed straight to
lunch in Draper's Cafe. Gabriela was wide-eyed. ``It's just like
the ice cream parlor in `Annie,''' she said of the pink-and-white
striped entrance and the wicker chairs with cushions covered in
plasticized cabbage-rose chintz. It was an odd menu, a combination
of regional American and ethnic. (The soup and sandwich of the day
on Friday was New England clam chowder and lox, lettuce and tomato
on a bagel.)
</P>
<P>
   Nothing on either the children's or the adults' menu appealed to
Gabriela, and she wondered out loud if scrambled eggs and bacon
were an option. When the waiter smiled and said sweetly, ``No
problem, Gabriela,'' she gave the cafe five stars.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfasts were perfection. The miniature muffins were homemade;
the juice was fresh-squeezed; the mixed berries were fresh, sweet
and piled high in big bowls. This is farm country, and the eggs
tasted like eggs, the bacon like bacon. Second helpings were
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Dinners were almost as good, and we ate our way through
multicourse meals of respectable American-Continental cuisine, to
the music of a violinist and a pianist who welcomed our requests.
Gabriela goes to a progressive school in Washington with no dress
code, so she embraced the Greenbrier's formality and even learned
how to use which utensil when. Much to her chagrin, a woman was
admitted to the dining room wearing what looked like a coral sweat
suit.
</P>
<P>
   During our stay, I made two appointments for myself: one at the
spa, the other at the beauty salon. At the spa I opted for the $93
``Greenbrier.''
</P>
<P>
   For 15 minutes I was soaked in a deep, bubbly hot bath of sulfur
water and salt. A steam bath or sauna followed, then a ``Swiss
shower'' of water from 16 shower heads and something called a
``Scotch spray,'' when the spa therapist turned a high-pressure
hose on me. The finale is a 15-minute Swedish massage, not nearly
enough to iron out all the kinks, she informed me. It was in the
spa that I noticed the pink rhododendron, West Virginia's state
flower, on the tiled walls. Of course! Romance and rhododendrons
had been Draper's motto. (Throughout the weekend Gabriela and I
found rhododendrons in all sorts of places: on the menus, on the
china, on the napkins, on the minibar price list.)
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela, meanwhile, spent an hour bowling in the Greenbrier's
eight-lane bowling alley with the other children registered in the
``Brier Patch'' program. For $40, a child can spend the day. A team
of baby sitters feed and entertain the children, in winter with
bowling, swimming, ice skating and arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Gabriela reminded me that this was our weekend
together. So when I went for a facial ($130) at the beauty salon
the next day, I took her along.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, I signed off on a mini-manicure for her (I've had
only one manicure in my life) and a trimming of her bangs. (How
much could a bangs-trim cost?) When I saw her again, her hands had
been paraffined, her nails multicolored and topped with sparkles.
Her bangs were indeed shorter, and her hair was swept up in a
French braid. The tab: $80.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way during our weekend, we also watched a PG-13 movie,
``The Bachelor,'' in real leather seats in the Greenbrier's movie
theater, which is larger than many commercial ones. (The nearby
powder room displayed dozens of black-and-white glamour portraits
of movie stars from the 1940s and '50s, from Clark Gable to Jane
Russell, the latter in a bubble bath.) We took tennis lessons
together from a good-natured and very patient high school chemistry
teacher named Bill, who doubles as the tennis pro. We sipped tea
and ate tiny napoleons at the 4:15 afternoon tea in the main lobby
with a live violin and piano concert. We walked to the outdoor
Springhouse, where we held our noses as we sampled the sulfur water
in plastic cups with the signature rhododendron on them.
</P>
<P>
   But Gabriela discovered pool at the Greenbrier, and what she
really wanted to do was to spend as much time as she could at one
of the two pool tables in the dimly lighted game room.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't played pool since I was about 13, and the
deep-green-and-black plaid wall-to-wall carpeting and reproduction
fowl prints at the Greenbrier bore little resemblance to the
neighborhood pool hall at the foot of Porter Avenue on the west
side of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of the trip was our tour of the Cold War-era bomb
shelter, built 720 feet into a hillside below a wing of the hotel
during the Eisenhower administration; the president frequently
visited the resort. Code-named Project Greek Island, the shelter
was kept secret _ and active _ until The Washington Post revealed
its existence in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb shelter is closed for renovation now; we were able to
finagle a private tour. There are 12-foot-wide, 25-ton
concrete-and-steel ``blast doors'' to shield inhabitants from a
nuclear explosion as close as 25 miles away; a decontamination
room; chambers for the House and the Senate; a kitchen and a
cafeteria; a power plant; a medical unit (complete with an
operating room and 12-bed hospital); a communications room; and
dormitories for the lawmakers. (All this was very exclusive: the
families would not have been allowed in, although they might have
booked space in the resort proper.)
</P>
<P>
   To help fill up the resort during the slow winter months, the
Greenbrier wants to convert part of the bomb shelter into a casino
with mostly card games, we were told. The museum, it seems, is
simply not enough of a moneymaker. The fusty old image would be
shed. Eisenhower would be replaced by Kennedy. Cold war seriousness
would be out, Rat Pack glamour in.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the West Virginia state Legislature passed a bill
allowing the county commission to put the casino question to a
referendum by the people of Greenbrier County. But the county is a
conservative place, and the project faces stiff opposition. Even
many on the resort staff, some of them third- and even
fourth-generation Greenbrier employees, have expressed concern to
management that a casino could bring in hard-drinking riff-raff.
Still, management has a golden argument: this is an economically
depressed area whose main source of income is the Greenbrier.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela decided she liked the bomb shelter just the way it was.
In fact, there was nothing about the Greenbrier she would change.
On Sunday, after the East Coast was hit with more than a foot of
snow, Gabriela and I opted out of flying and took a six-hour train
ride home on Amtrak's Chicago-Washington line instead. We asked
Draper's Cafe to pack box lunches.
</P>
<P>
   As we chugged along the back yard of rural Allegheny Mountain
country, eating BLTs and sipping chocolate milk, I realized just
how well the weekend had gone when Gabriela asked, ``Mom, does it
cost a lot to have a wedding there?''
</P>
<P>
   The Greenbrier is at 300 West Main St., White Sulphur Springs,
W.Va. The largest nearby town is Lewisburg, about 10 miles away. In
the late fall and winter, daily room rates are $196 to $222, based
on double occupancy and including breakfast and dinner; children
under 18 stay free in the same room. From April through October,
daily rates range from $266 to $328. Holiday packages are
available. Information: (800) 624-6070.

 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Audibility, at least, is not a problem in the
Roundabout Theater Co.'s production of ``Arms and the Man.'' The
actors' voices, though congested with mossy English accents, boom,
shriek and bellow even in calmer moments, giving the Gramercy
Theater a decibel level to match that of Irving Plaza, the nearby
rock arena. Somewhere along the way, it seems, a decision was made
to take the words ``screamingly funny'' to heart.
</P>
<P>
   The overall impression to emerge from this high-strung revival,
which opened Thursday night under Roger Rees' direction, is that
George Bernard Shaw must have written his satire of martial glory
and romantic heroes entirely in capital letters. Rees, a first-rate
British actor who has been directing more and more with varied
results, here sustains an air of artificial urgency that emphasizes
the play's farcical aspects without being very funny.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is nothing shabby-looking about this latest take on
Shaw's early comedy (the first of his self-described ``plays
pleasant''), what most frequently comes to mind are amateur
productions of Gilbert and Sullivan. There's that same heightened
eagerness among the game actors, in their fairy-tale ethnic
costumes by Kate Voyce, to be comic in the British way, don't
y'know.
</P>
<P>
   What with the standard Viennese waltzes and marches providing
mood music between acts, it is too easy to remember that this story
of war as a matchmaker in 19th-century Bulgaria was stolen as the
basis for Oscar Straus' operetta ``The Chocolate Soldier.'' Shaw
was incensed by that appropriation, just as he was angered, after
the play opened in 1894, by the comparisons made between his vein
of satire and that of W.S. Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my honor it was a serious play,'' Shaw later said, ``a play
to cry over, if you could only have helped laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Arms'' has endured as a favorite of theater
repertories, it is a trifle by later Shavian standards, and much of
its mechanics of plot feel borrowed from the stilted bourgeois
plays that Shaw, then a novice in the dramatist's trade, was
reacting against. (William Butler Yeats, in typical visionary
style, said that ``Arms'' inspired in him ``a nightmare that I was
haunted by a sewing machine.'')
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is more to ``Arms'' than boulevard comedy in
Ruritanian clothing; there is even more to it than its debunking of
military glamour, a stance that rattled its first audiences. Its
greatest interest lies in its suggestion that none of its main
characters are immune to romantic illusion. That includes the
pragmatic Swiss mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian lady's
bedchamber in the play's first scene to violate not her honor but
her ideals.
</P>
<P>
   The romantic pentagon at the work's center has bristling
intimations of that fabled phenomenon, Shavian paradox. Within the
broadly drawn outlines of the comic types of ``Arms,'' there are
subversive, self-contradictory elements. Yes, ``Arms'' has a
classic comic momentum it is easy to coast on. But at this point
why should a major New York theater troupe bother with it without
looking beneath the surface?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Rees tends merely to coast, albeit in a boisterous way.
You can occasionally glimpse deeper intentions. Neil Patel's sets,
for example, are seen against a backdrop of a period map of the
Balkans, which inevitably (and perhaps unwisely) brings to mind
contemporary strife in the region. There are a couple of smart and
provocative bits of stage business, winking tableaux out of Regency
romances, in the first act.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly this is Shaw played for yucks, drawing easy laughs from
its characters' affectations and from wince-making references to
its Bulgarians' lack of sophistication, including limited bathing
habits. With one qualified exception, no one in the ensemble
successfully slips out of the contours of a cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of ``Arms'' is a contrast between two soldiers: the
swaggering Sergius Saranoff (Paul Michael Valley), a major in the
Bulgarian Army, and the pragmatic Captain Bluntschli (Henry
Czerny), a Swiss mercenary fighting for the Serbs. The play's
heroine, the rich and spoiled Raina Petkoff (Katie Finneran), is
engaged to Saranoff but finds herself strangely drawn to the
truth-telling Bluntschli, who is more likely to carry chocolate
creams than ammunition into battle.
</P>
<P>
   Sergius has always been the plum part, a fatuous Byronic poser
nettled by suspicions that he is indeed only that. (It was a role
that Kevin Kline was born to play, and did, in a 1985 Circle in the
Square production.) Valley brings out only the ridiculous in his
character, with ungainly, heel-clicking bows and, for moments of
lust, pelvic gyrations. Tom Bloom and Sandra Shipley, as Raina's
rich and unworldly parents, operate at the same level, pitching
their respective performances as an ursine growl and a police
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Potts, as the wily servant Nicola, is most notable for
his hard-earned Cockney accent, while Robin Weigert, an actress of
fascinating emotional transparency, is unfortunately miscast as the
impudent maid, Louka. Czerny has the virtue of relative calm,
though his being the only performer to use a non-British accent
suggests a political allegory that is surely unintentional.

<P>
   Finneran, while one of the prime offenders in the shrieking
department, is also the only cast member to demonstrate a natural
comic instinct, and the evening's best moments revolve around her.
One comes early, when Raina lies in bed staring at a photograph of
Sergius and clearly wishing herself more thrilled by the sight than
she is.
</P>
<P>
   In another, during an argument with her mother about Sergius,
Raina blurts, ``I always feel a longing to do or say something
dreadful to him.'' It's an incidental line when you read the play,
but there's something thrilling in Finneran's delivery of it, the
sense of a character surprising herself with something she has
never given words to before.
</P>
<P>
   Such surprises are what make ``Arms'' more than a confectionary
farce. Without them, the play is as disappointing as an empty
chocolate box.

   MOUSE ON MARS: ``Niun Niggung'' (Thrill Jockey). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ghosts of dance music waft through the instrumentals on ``Niun
Niggung,'' the fourth album by the German duo Mouse on Mars. As
synthesizers tick and whir, nibble and chirp, horn-section
arrangements hint at ska in one tune, cha-cha in another; strings
and a chunky beat briefly hark back to early disco.
</P>
<P>
   But with hardly any bass tones, the music doesn't set out to
move bodies around the dance floor; it's made to tickle the brain,
wandering from elegiac contemplation to wordless giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Mouse on Mars is part of a minimovement rediscovering the
synthesizer-happy German rock of the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the performers are not machine purists. ``Niun Niggung''
places instruments and wisps of pensive melody amid the whirring,
staticky gadgets, warming the music without trading away its
quizzical detachment.

   A Symbiotic Relationship
</P>
<P>
   When a museum organizes an exhibition of a major family
collection, it is generally hoping that someday it will be given at
least some of the art in that collection.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are a way of buttering up potential donors or just
smart business, collectors' exhibitions are regularly organized by
institutions like the National Gallery of Art in Washington. A year
ago the museum showed a group of American Impressionist and Realist
paintings and drawings owned by Margaret and Raymond Horowitz of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the gallery will present more than 70 works of
20th-century American art from the collection of Barney A. and Pam
Ebsworth of St. Louis. Ebsworth, who is retired as the chairman of
the travel company Intrav, has been a major collector of American
art for 30 years, buying at auction and through dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Ebsworth has also been a member of the museum's Trustees'
Council and co-chairman of its Collectors Committee since 1996. In
1997 he gave the museum a painting by Pat Steir, and since then has
donated several other works, including Georgia O'Keeffe's seminal
1930 painting ``Black White and Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the Ebsworths have been generous, and we hope they
will continue to be,'' said Earl A. Powell III, director of the
museum. ``There are many things in this collection that are highly
desirable to any museum. We have watched in admiration as this
collection has grown.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will trace the history of American modernism from
the 1913 Armory Show in New York, at which the public in this
country had its first glimpse of the European avant-garde, until
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Included are paintings, drawings and sculptures by artists like
O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove and John Marin, who all believed that modern
art meant abstraction. There are also paintings by major figures
like Edward Hopper, whose realist depictions of American life
became his signature, and works by Abstract Expressionists like
Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, along with ones by Pop
artists like Wayne Thiebaud and Andy Warhol.
</P>
<P>
   The show, in the museum's East Building, runs from March 5 to
June 12. It will travel to the Seattle Art Museum from Aug. 10 to
Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   A Pedigreed Pad
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sotheby's did it 11 years ago. Now Christie's is
acting as if it's a revolutionary idea to sell the 1950 town house
at 242 E. 52nd St., which Philip Johnson designed as a guest house
for Blanchette Rockefeller. The town house would be included in an
auction of 20th-century decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Anthony d'Offay, the London dealer, bought the house for
$3.5 million at Sotheby's. Now d'Offay is putting the house up for
sale through Christie's. It is expected to bring about $4 million
and will be one of the star lots in a sale called ``Masterworks:
1900-2000,'' to be held at the company's Rockefeller Center
headquarters on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the perfect thing, to sell a Philip Johnson
house alongside the most respected names in the applied arts,''
said Lars Rachen, head of Christie's department of 20th-century
arts in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The auction chronicles the history of decorative arts, ranging
from works made in the early years of the century by the Scottish
architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the architect
Mies van der Rohe to more recent designs by the Italian designer
Ettore Sottsass and the California architect Frank O. Gehry.
</P>
<P>
   Using the house as a marketing tool is not a new idea, either.
Sotheby's did it, and now Christie's plans to open the house for
viewing. From May 16 to June 3, the house will be the showcase for
highlights from the sale. Christie's is also producing an elaborate
catalog, which Rachen said he hoped would be seen as a ``reference
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller owned the house for eight years and gave it to the
Museum of Modern Art in 1958. The museum used it as a guest house
until 1964, when it was sold to Robert and Mary Gay Leonhardt of
New York for $100,000. In the 1970s, after Leonhardt's death,
Johnson rented the house from Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Designed a year after the architect's famous glass house in New
Canaan, Conn., the town house has a large living room with a glass
wall facing a reflecting pool and a bedroom in a separate wing
reachable from across the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate market is so strong we expect there will be a
lot of interest in the house,'' Rachen said. For two weeks it will
be open for viewing by appointment only.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Museum Windfall
</P>
<P>
   Besides a stash of recent acquisitions, the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles has also received the largest cash
gift in its 20-year history. Dallas Price, a contemporary-art
collector who has been a trustee since 1993, is giving the museum
$10 million, to be paid in installments of $1 million a year. The
money will support the museum's operating budget and endowment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas Price had planned to give us a major bequest, but then
she decided she didn't want to wait but rather give us a donation
while she is still very active,'' said Jeremy Strick, the museum's
director. ``Unrestricted gifts like this are a rare thing for any
institution, but it's what a museum needs most.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Director Departs
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years, Alan Fern is retiring as director of the
National Portrait Gallery in Washington. Fern, who turns 70 this
year, stressed that his resignation had nothing to do with the
dispute over the allocation of space between the Portrait Gallery
and the National Museum of American Art.
</P>
<P>
   The museums, part of the Smithsonian Institution, share the Old
Patent Office Building on F Street, which closed last month for
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   In December, I. Michael Heyman, who was retiring as the
secretary of the Smithsonian, decided to award most of the space to
the National Museum of American Art, the larger of the
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year, $60 million renovation will reduce the Portrait
Gallery's space from half of three floors to a portion of the first
floor and a corner room on the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about the space fight,'' Fern said. ``The time
seemed right to leave. I thought it was important that when the
museum reopens in 2003 or 2004, it should be in the hands of a new
director.'' &QL;

`H. ART CHAOS': TURN (BIFF!)   AND SPIN   (SHAZAM!)  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Japan)   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Something compelling, to say the least, emerges from
H. Art Chaos, the all-female dance troupe from Japan that landed
with such Wonder Woman impact on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater
here.
</P>
<P>
   This is tough dancing, shazam style. The dynamics in a piece
called ``Secret Club . . . Floating Angels 2000'' are all thrust
and plunge, full of speed and whiplash turns.
</P>
<P>
   As tables spin and lampshades swing, a lanky heroine with a
blond shag haircut and her tormentors go at each other with
kamikaze fervor. Yet the entire piece, choreographed by Sakiko
Oshima and led by the spectacular Naoko Shirakawa, has the
ritualized order of a tea ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   To wonder how the same culture could once produce kamikaze
pilots and flower arrangements is to delve into the kind of protest
that ``Secret Club'' embodies on an oblique but multilayered level.
The references are fleeting but not subliminal: prostitutes, hands
tied behind their backs, are recalled in images of bondage, women
in red dresses are objects of desire, and dancers attached to wires
march in militaristic drills to orders barked in German and then
collapse like broken marionettes.
</P>
<P>
   Although its self-sufficient tribe is exclusive of men, ``Secret
Club'' cannot be reduced to a feminist piece. The overall
sensibility is postindustrial, springing out of the Japan of
high-speed trains but also acutely attuned to Western art currents.
</P>
<P>
   Like the American painter Robert Longo, whose trademark figures
had heads about to be blown off, Oshima focuses on heads thrown
back or dropped from symbolically broken necks. In a provocative
passage, Shirakawa and four other women duck or arch back as a
crystal ball on a wire swings out regularly toward their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Art can be unpleasant, but H. Art Chaos is a suitable name for a
modern-dance company founded in 1989 that has something to explore.
In this instance, a violent dream is, in effect, a quest narrative
in which the heroine's angst takes the form of trials leading
toward some form of self-realization.
</P>
<P>
   Too much should not be made of the cat faces on the chairs that
are the main props. As fertility symbols in ancient Egypt, cats
have feminine associations, and when the piece ends with the
heroine kissing her cat chair as she spins in the air with it above
billowing waves of silver fabric, ``Secret Club'' finally says
something about human solitude.
</P>
<P>
   The interest of the piece is in its choreography, which uses a
limited set of movements but with power and abrupt dynamics.
Shirakawa and Oshima, who founded the company, were ballet-trained,
and their dancers can jete and spring into barrel turns with the
best of them.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a quibble, it is the narcissistic display in some of
Shirakawa's solos, especially the last topless one. A high leg
extension says nothing in itself; more spellbinding is her
loose-hipped fluency and the collage of torso rotating and arm
flailing that runs through the entire ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Motifs recur. Shirakawa does a back flip and hooks her knees on
a partner's shoulder. Others follow suit. When the dancers fly out,
wires attached to waists, the effect here is also unexpected. These
are not light aerial creatures but weighted figures, unable to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   As two possible dreamers, Motoko Hirayama and Kumiko Kikuchi,
open the piece dressed in futuristic leather tunics. The score by
Toshiyuki Ochiai and Yasuhiro Kasamatsu moves progressively from
its ambling introduction to chant, clangor, voices and a dominant
jagged violin. The heroine enters to the violin, a seeker whose
image is multiplied by various mirrors behind her.
</P>
<P>
   She is confounded by Hirayama's seductive leg-crossing solo. But
like a violent dream, the action shifts from scene to scene. The
music and dancing are turbulent in the ensemble sections: women
thrust fists under the crotches of other women, and in an intense
dramatic cafe scene to a tango beat, women in black pants suits
push the heroine around. Understandably, she acquires a cosmic
headache and holds her temples.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which should return, included Yasuko Katsukura,
Natsuko Kinoshita, Noriko Seki, Yui Kawaguchi, Mayumi Ikeda, Naomi
Maruyama and Akiko Hontoku.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nothing became the sorry presidential campaign of
Steve Forbes so much as his leaving it.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire magazine publisher was long on cents and short
on sense. Facing the reality of a dismal 2 percent support in the
national polls and successive primary defeats, giving up in a
timely fashion stands out as the most rational act of his entire
useless campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could figure out why he was running in the first place,
beyond the fact that his private fortune made it possible for him
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes had to learn the hard way that while money can be helpful
in politics, it isn't everything.
</P>
<P>
   Although he tried to buy his way into the White House without
bothering to hold any prior elective office, voters informed him
that they prefer candidates with strong personalities tested and
seasoned by broad political experience.
</P>
<P>
   So now he's gone, his expensive ego trip finished. By some
calculations, he had spent $550 per vote _ not a good return on his
investment.
</P>
<P>
   He will sink back into the woodwork of the publishing empire he
inherited from his father without leaving a political trace.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes tried to exit with dignity, claiming that the more than
$60 million of his own money he spent on two futile presidential
runs really hadn't been wasted because his message had changed the
political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tough case to make. It's hard to see that he made any
lasting impact or had any message anyone will remember.
</P>
<P>
   He pounded away at two main themes, opposition to the graduated
income tax and to abortion in all circumstances. His flat-tax
concept would have mostly helped rich folks like himself. It was
dismissed by economists as financially reckless and had little
appeal to ordinary voters. His rigid anti-abortion stand was shared
by the other Republican contenders except Sen. John McCain, who
would allow the procedure to save the life of the mother or in
cases of rape and incest.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is not the first unfortunate fellow to confuse the fact
that he has money with the question of whether he has the personal
qualities of leadership that voters seek in potential presidents.
Texas GOP Sen. Phil Gramm, for instance, flaunted his huge
financial war chest in 1996, spent $25 million, came in fifth in
the Iowa primary _ and withdrew two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was running a classic conservative campaign on classic
conservative issues in a year when voters are looking for
something, and someone, fresh. Memories of Ronald Reagan's glory
days are receding into history, and so are his ideas. The
Republican Party seems ready to be retooled into a more modern
image.
</P>
<P>
   Even Texas Gov. George W. Bush, pushed hard now by McCain, is
trying to lose the establishment label that he used to be so proud
of in order to appear more exciting. Suddenly, he is identifying
himself with the word ``reform.''
</P>
<P>
   With Forbes, there was also a personality-deficit problem. He
had all the cuddly charm of a pet rock. He was so serious-minded he
put people to sleep. Some men are born to run companies, some to
run countries. He clearly belonged in the former category.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes did not endorse either Bush or McCain, but it doesn't
matter. His support was so thin that even if all three Forbes fans
rushed in a bloc to one alternative or the other, nobody would
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Had Forbes stayed in, he would have been throwing good money
after bad. The GOP presidential fight is now a one-on-one tug of
war between Bush and McCain. A candidate with 2 percent support in
the national polls is not going to influence that.
</P>
<P>
   What should happen next is that Alan Keyes should bow out too.
He has nothing fresh to say either, and his poll numbers are as
embarrassing as those of Forbes. This is a lost cause. Keyes is so
radical on the abortion issue that his endorsement of either of his
rivals _ unlikely in any case _ would harm more than help. But if
he got out of the way, it would clear the air and eliminate the
last minor distraction.

   Sizing Up, 400 DVDs
</P>
<P>
   Take it from a veteran laser disc man, DVD is better. ``The
picture quality on the best-looking DVDs is absolutely
incredible,'' writes Doug Pratt in ``Doug Pratt's DVD Video
Guide,'' to be published March 1 by Harbor Electronic Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Widely known among finicky laser collectors, Pratt recently
added the DVD to the title of his DVD-Laser Disc Newsletter. Pushed
aside by the compact digital disc, the flow of new lasers is down
to a trickle. ``If any are released past this year, I'd be very
surprised,'' Pratt said this week.
</P>
<P>
   His new book reviews 2,400 DVDs down to the most minute detail.
More generally, his overview of the disc is if not a total rave,
then a qualified one. On the best sound-equipment laser disc audio
still has what Pratt calls ``a fuller sound.'' Otherwise the day
belongs to DVD. ``The picture outdistances laser disc easily,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His book does note some variation in quality. If the movie
company hasn't made a top-grade transfer from film or if the film
material is damaged or too old, a film can look poor on DVD. But
with the new disc fast becoming a mass medium on the strength of
its superior picture, the studios are working hard on their discs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more uniform quality on major new releases than I ever
saw on laser disc,'' Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   Studios are also digging to add extra features. At the top of
the book's list of the 10 best discs is ``Armistead Maupin's `More
Tales From the City,''' a two-disc set from DVD International.
``That's because of the effort that went into the supplementary
materials,'' Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   Cut scenes are popular with average viewers. Film-length
commentaries by directors, actors and others are gaining
acceptance, but these sometimes can be overdone. The greater the
popularity of discs, the more filmmakers want to talk about their
work, which can lead to several commentaries on a disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a drag for a critic because if there are three commentary
tracks, you have to listen to all of them,'' Pratt said. ``But the
consumers are responding or the companies wouldn't be doing them.''
</P>
<P>
   He rates the DVD title supply as good, with some caveats. Since
the format was introduced in 1997, some big films, notably from
Disney, have been withheld from DVD until it became apparent that
the format would catch hold.
</P>
<P>
   Now Disney has committed some of its biggest titles to the disc.
Still among the missing, however, are the ``Star Wars'' films from
Fox, four juggernaut titles that would propel the DVD explosion
even further.
</P>
<P>
   George Lucas, the ``Star Wars'' creator, is said to be waiting
to put out high-end editions of the films. ``The usual formula is
to put out the generic versions first, then double-dip with a
collector's version later,'' Pratt said. ``That way you don't
frustrate people who want it now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to his book, only two things appeared to
really bother him. ``We hate the cases DVDs come in because they
take up more than 15 times the space a DVD itself takes up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the ``menu,'' the index of features that guides
viewers. Some menus, Pratt wrote, ``are bizarrely obscure, where
you practically have to guess what to press and hope you choose
correctly.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Muse
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly booted off the studio lot, the screenwriter Steven
Phillips (Albert Brooks) finds himself with no livelihood and an
expensive wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell), and photogenic Hollywood
abode to maintain. Short on ideas and convinced that his best years
are behind him, Phillips is advised to get help from Sarah (Sharon
Stone), who is billed as a muse of the original ancient Greek
variety.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sarah comes up with a workable project, she is
expensive and seems more interested in teaching Laura the right way
to shop. Stirring his own ingredients, Janet Maslin wrote in The
New York Times, Brooks concocts a ``mordantly hilarious cri de
coeur about contemporary life.'' &QL;

   The Story of Us
</P>
<P>
   In a middle-aged marriage running on empty, a suburban dad named
Ben (Bruce Willis) and his beleaguered spouse, Katie (Michelle
Pfeiffer), keep up appearances for the children's sake. That can
mean screaming at each other until their necks turn red, but it
also leads to longing reminiscence about the days when they
actually could abide each other.
</P>
<P>
   While Rob Reiner's film means to depict the workaday realities,
its elbow-in-the-ribs humor doesn't work, nor does ``trumpeting its
insights at high volume, relying on heavy shtick and turning its
characters into clowns'' (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

they are visiting Hawaii on their high school graduation trip.
Actually, the girls are headed for Bangkok, where things turn nasty
when they are gulled by a charming Australian (Daniel LaPaine) and
arrested at the airport with six kilos of heroin planted on them.
</P>
<P>
   Thrown in prison, Alice really has a chance to show how clever
she is. With a pungent sense of cultural dislocation and Danes
riding a strong emotional current, Jonathan Kaplan's film is ``good
enough that you wish it were better'' (Maslin). &QL;

   For this film's purposes, God is the name of a blustery

agent (Omar Epps) charged with infiltrating God's operation. Not
the most original situation perhaps, but within the framework there
are some interesting subtleties, provided in the main by Ellery
Ryan's cinematography. And ``to its credit, the film treats its
characters seriously and doesn't resort to the obvious very often''
(Maslin). &QL;

But a stolen sheep yields worthless mutton, the local priest thinks
his offer to clean drains is a contribution to the church and a job
as a bouncer at a disco lasts one night.

   `Hairspray'? No Teasing?
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Depending on your taste for oddballs, drag queens and
camp, camp, camp, it may be a dream come true or a ring of theater
hell. Either way, it's coming: ``Hairspray,'' the Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word this week from the producer Margo Lion, who has
assembled a quirky array of talent to transform John Waters' cult
film into a song-and-dance extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, ``Hairspray'' (1988) is the story of Tracy,
a pretty but obese dance addict, who dreams of making the big time
via ``The Corny Collins Show,'' a teen-age dance show on Baltimore
television in 1962. Always a lover of the bizarre, Waters packed
his movie with a collection of strange characters, including a
deranged psychologist, played by Waters himself, and Tracy's
diet-pill-chugging mother, played by the drag queen Divine.
</P>
<P>
   For the stage version Lion has tapped Marc Shaiman, a film
composer who wrote the very funny music for ``South Park: Bigger,
Longer and Uncut,'' with Trey Parker. The eclectic creative team
also includes Rob Marshall, whose work on ``Cabaret'' earned him
two Tony nominations. Marshall is to direct and choreograph, with
Waters as consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The first reading of the script is tentatively scheduled for
April at the New York Theater Workshop, and Lion said she hoped to
open ``Hairspray'' in spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Lion, like Waters a Baltimore native, said she didn't see her
city quite as he did but felt a deep connection nonetheless.
``Without giving up my age, I remember this moment in Baltimore,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hairspray'' isn't the only movie getting a stage treatment. On
Wednesday, Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, said
his organization, in partnership with SFX Entertainment, was
completing plans for a musical based on ``An American in Paris,''
the 1951 film with a Gershwin score.
</P>
<P>
   Less is known about this project, targeted for a fall 2001
opening, but contracts were being drawn up this week for one big
name: the playwright Wendy Wasserstein, who is to write the book.
</P>
<P>
   The use of films as source material is sure to cause hand
wringing for some musical-theater purists, as well as those already
decrying the lack of new American plays on Broadway. But for
Waters, the thought of his work on Broadway is a just a tickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought it?'' he said. ``John Waters spreads to
Broadway. Only in America do these things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Complex Arrangements
</P>
<P>
   The artistic director of the Actors Studio, Estelle Parsons, has
opted out of the cast of ``The Moment When,'' a new play by James
Lapine, giving fuel to rumors that the studio's planned production
of ``Oedipus'' is moving ahead. Informal rehearsals of the classic,
with Al Pacino, have been going on for several months. Parsons,
however, was cautious about its prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 52 years we've been developing things here, and one always
hopes that these things go on and have a natural evolution,'' she
said, adding that ``Oedipus'' would have three performances, Feb.
23 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Newman has taken over Parsons' role in ``The Moment
When,'' which is to open on March 12 at Playwrights Horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Running Success
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may want to stop reading. But for anyone with a ounce of
romance, listen for a moment to the story of Barnard and Helen.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1945, and in a rehearsal hall in the theater district the
eyes of two young actors met. He asked for a pencil. She provided
one. And then he asked for a date, and she said yes.
</P>
<P>
   They ate dinner and walked along the East River until dawn, and
then she lent him subway fare. (He had spent all his cash on that
dinner.)
</P>
<P>
   They've been in love ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way those two actors, Barnard Hughes and Helen
Stenborg, have worked together in theaters from Santa Barbara,
Calif., to Highland, Ill. (Oh yes, and got married and had two
children.)
</P>
<P>
   But the couple had never acted together in New York until
December, when they opened in ``Waiting in the Wings,'' Noel
Coward's 1965 comedy at the Walter Kerr Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked if we wanted to share a dressing room,'' Stenborg
said, ``and we both screamed, `No!'''
</P>
<P>
   Both have had fine careers. Hughes won a Tony Award in 1978 for
``Da''; Stenborg won high praise just last year in ``Wit.'' But
considering that their 50th anniversary is in April, their romantic
persistence may be more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Any Valentine secrets to divulge? ``Have a sense of humor, be
thoughtful and have a rip-roaring fight once in a while,'' Stenborg
said.
</P>
<P>
   A mischievous Hughes said: ``Yes, a sense of humor. I've needed
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stenborg shot back, ``My heart bleeds for you,'' with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   300 and Counting
</P>
<P>
   Quick: What's the longest-running off-Broadway play to open this
season? A hint: You may not have heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``The Countess,'' by Gregory Murphy, which began
off-off-Broadway last March before jumping to a run at the Samuel
Beckett in June, just after the official beginning of the 1999-2000
season. The play, about the 19th-century affair between Effie
Ruskin, wife of the critic John Ruskin, and Everett Mallais, one of
Ruskin's proteges, has received good reviews from most of the
city's newspapers but little other press. Still, with good word of
mouth, it had its 300th performance on Wednesday.

 &HT;    IMMIGRANTS JAILED ON SECRET EVIDENCE, FBI TELLS CONGRESS
 &HT;    540&AMP;add.
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has used secret evidence
against at least 12 immigrants, including five who are being held
without knowledge of their crimes, an FBI official told Congress on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to use classified information in this manner is
vitally important to the protection of our national security,''
Larry Parkinson, general counsel for the FBI, told the House
Judiciary subcommittee on immigrations and claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department often does not inform immigrants of the
charges filed against them or the sources of the charges in order
to protect national security and the methods of investigations,
Parkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Use of classified information is rare, but it has been used
about 30 times in 300,000 immigration cases in the last two years,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases the FBI, or another law enforcement agency,
shares the information with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. It is then subject to review by senior Justice Department
officials to evaluate whether it should be classified. If the
information is considered classified, the INS then presents it to
an immigration judge to determine the importance of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., brandishing a bound volume of the
U.S. Constitution, testified that the use of secret evidence was
unconstitutional. Campbell read aloud the Fifth Amendment, which
states that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or
property without due process of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says no person, not no citizen,'' Campbell said. ``The
fight against terrorism need not involve compromise of our most
cherished constitutional rights.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., joined Campbell in
urging the panel to consider a bill that would repeal the use of
secret evidence as grounds for removal from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It would prohibit the government from using classified evidence
against illegal immigrants trying to avoid deportation and prohibit
the government from using secret evidence to deny immigration
benefits, including asylum, permanent residence and United States
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies have used secret evidence to detain
immigrants for more than a dozen years, but in 1996 the law was
expanded to give the INS the right to arrest, detain and deport
non-citizens on the basis of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the past eight years, three federal judges have ruled that
the use of secret evidence violates the right to due process.
</P>
<P>
   Hany Kiareldeen, a Palestinian immigrant living in New Jersey
who was once considered a serious threat to national security by
the INS, sat in the audience observing the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen was detained by the INS for 19 months before a New
Jersey federal court ordered his release last October. He was not
told why he was held, or given any information on who had accused
him.
</P>
<P>
   Later he was given an unclassified summary of the secret
evidence accusing him of associating with the terrorist
conspirators who bombed the World Trade Center in 1993. The
accusations were brought by his ex-wife during a custody battle
over their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not very optimistic that this (repeal) law will pass,''
Kiareldeen said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Nahla Al-Arian, a Palestinian living in Tampa, Fla., testified
on behalf of her brother, Dr. Mazen Al-Najjar, an immigrant who has
been detained for nearly three years on the basis of secret
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was impossible for my brother to defend himself,'' Al-Arian
said. ``He was denied the right to face his accusers, to
cross-examine them, and to present evidence on his behalf that
would establish his innocence. It was like fighting ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Najjar, entered the United States on a student visa in 1981.
He now shares a detention cell in Tampa with 16 inmates. As a
Palestinian refugee, he has no citizenship or residency in any
country and has no passport.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Arian said the government has permanently ruined her
brother's reputation by detaining him. Egypt, the United Arab
Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan are all unwilling to take her
brother because of his detention, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can expect this to happen in a totalitarian regime, but not
here, not in America, the land of the free and home of the brave,''
Al-Arian said.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson said the Justice Department is reviewing all pending
cases involving the use of classified information to ensure that it
is being used properly. It also is working on guidelines and
regulations to improve the classified evidence process.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference following the subcommittee hearing,
Campbell said he was considering offering a narrower bill that
would allow the INS to detain an immigrant for only 30 days on the
basis of secret evidence. He added that the bill might also be
attached to an appropriations bill and could come to the House
floor this summer.

INDONESIA NAMES EX-LEADER SUHARTO AS CORRUPTION SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In what appeared to be a serious new effort
to prosecute Indonesia's former president, Suharto, the government
named him Thursday as a suspect in a widening corruption
investigation and summoned him for questioning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's lawyers immediately responded that he was too sick to
attend. The former president is 78 and was hospitalized twice last
year following a stroke. ``He is physically and mentally unfit to
appear for the questioning,'' said one of the lawyers, Juan Felix
Tampubolon.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a less deferential tone than past investigators, who
dropped a probe of Suharto, a spokesman for the attorney general's
office said illness was no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suharto is now named as a suspect and we hope he'll turn up
for questioning,'' the spokesman, Suhandoyo, told reporters. ``We
have also looked at the state of Suharto's health, and it seems to
be improving.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed move to bring Suharto to account appeared to be part
of a broad policy by the new government of President Abdurrahman
Wahid to address past abuses and begin building a new society based
on civilian government and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, who was forced to resign in May 1998, is
widely believed to have illegally amassed billions of dollars for
himself, his children and his associates. He has denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite demands by the public for an accounting, investigations
under B.J. Habibie, Suharto's friend and immediate successor,
seemed half-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto was treated with elaborate deference when he was called
to give evidence at the attorney general's office in late 1998. His
questioners were former members of his own administration.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Habibie was voted out of office last October, those
investigators announced they had not found enough evidence to bring
charges and closed the case. That highly unpopular move was one of
the last straws in Habibie's failed bid for election.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, Wahid's attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, reopened
the case, which involved allegations of the misuse of millions of
dollars in seven charitable organizations controlled by Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate any monkey business any more,'' Marzuki
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Softening the harshness of the idea of putting a former
president on trial, Wahid later said that if Suharto were
convicted, he would be pardoned if he apologized and returned any
stolen funds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Thursday that they now also wanted to question
Suharto about a failed national car project, in which he bent
investment rules to favor one of his sons, and about lucrative
monopolies in cloves and fruits that were run by his children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, was acquitted last
year, during Habibie's administration, of corruption charges
involving a land deal. But he and other family members and friends
remain under investigation for other deals.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation and trial of Suharto was one of the loudest
demands made by students and other demonstrators who helped end his
corrupt 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   While overturning much of Suharto's legacy with a range of
political reforms, Habibie appeared committed to protecting the
personal welfare of his longtime mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's administration is advancing on virtually every front to
overhaul the government and to clear the ledger of past abuses that
range from corruption to military killings.
</P>
<P>
   The president is now engaged in a high-stakes standoff with
Indonesia's most prominent general, Wiranto, who has refused
Wahid's demand to resign as coordinating minister for security
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The demand followed an accusation by a government commission
that the general was guilty of human rights abuses in the violence
that followed a vote for independence last August in the territory
of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   That commission is conducting just one of several investigations
into abuses by the military during the years it acted as Suharto's
enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that Wahid is making a public example of
Wiranto because he symbolizes the old order. Like Habibie, he is a
protege of Suharto, having been appointed defense minister after
serving for years as his personal adjutant.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning Suharto resigned, Wiranto made a public pledge to
protect his interests.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid contrasts with Suharto in almost every way: he is voluble
where Suharto was enigmatic, informal (and often barefoot) where
Suharto was solemn, he welcomes public discussion and dispute, and
he is committed to democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto gave only three news conferences in 32 years. Wahid
seems to have something to say every day, if not every hour.
</P>
<P>
   Now he almost seems to be taunting Wiranto with new statements
at every stop on a 16-day foreign tour, which will end Sunday. The
general says he is waiting for the president's return to plead his
case.
</P>
<P>
   While Wiranto smiles gamely in Jakarta and says little, the
president alternates between expressions of personal regard for the
general and repeated, humiliating demands for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version came Thursday in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is for him to resign, and we can pay our
respects to him in a capacity we will decide later,'' the president
said. ``He will not be in the cabinet but I still have great
respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   There could have been a veiled threat when he added: ``It is in
the interest of General Wiranto himself because if he refuses to
step down voluntarily, then the country will lose the opportunity
to have investors, to have an economic comeback. It will not be
good for his career later.''

paychecks.

   ASBESTOS-BAN (Undated) _ Almost everyone believes that the
mining, production, sale and use of asbestos in America has been
banned. Almost everyone is wrong. Despite bans in 12 other
countries, it's legal to mine, import and sell asbestos in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   By Andrew Schneider. (Story will move in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   ASBESTOS-BAN-CANADA (Undated) _ Like the deadly, but nearly

the government, has fought to expand its market globally, attacking
bans elsewhere.

   FILM-BEACH (Undate) _ All those teenage fans who have been
breathlessly waiting for Leonardo DiCaprio's follow-up to
``Titanic'' are likely to be disappointed by ``The Beach.'' He
plays a liar, a coward and a weakling, who, when the chips are
down, is also a big crybaby. Others might find the movie a bit more
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SMOKE (Undated) _ As a rule, whether you love or hate Jane
Campion's idiosyncratic films depends upon gender. ``Holy Smoke''
will certainly fuel that divisive argument because it's deliciously
designed to have its share of ardent admirers and just as ardent
critics. But oddly, the film transcends gender lines despite its
subject matter. It's a funny, insightful film that has feminist
undertones without overwhelming its story and characters.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-TIGGER (Undated) _ ``The Tigger Movie'' is a delightful mix
of songs and scenery. Combined with John Hurt's whimsical narration
and the voice talent of Jim Cummings, who supplies the vocal
personality for both Tigger and Winnie the Pooh, the gentle message
of ``The Tigger Movie'' makes it a positive film for kids and
adults.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-MIRACLE (Undated) _ Films about men (and women) of the
cloth struggling with the earthly desires that chafe against their
clerical vows are pretty standard cinema stuff. Yet there's
something compelling about Agnieszka Holland's ``The Third
Miracle,'' featuring Ed Harris and Anne Heche.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-TEASE (Undated) _ ``The Big Tease'' is an innocuous,
hit-and-miss affair that, despite a predictable ```Rocky' in
curlers'' story line, remains modestly amusing. It stars Craig
Ferguson, who is featured on television's ``The Drew Carey Show,''
as hairdresser Crawford Mackenzie, Glasgow's premiere coiffure
artist.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SNOW (Undated) _ The top-billed name of Chevy Chase in
``Snow Day'' connotes a certain kind of comedy, and this film
doesn't deliver it _ or even try. Chase's fans are likely to be
appalled by the kiddy movie in store for them. Chase carries in his
manner an air of sadness, defeat and even bitterness. Like he'd
rather be anywhere else but this dumb movie.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   TV-HEMINGS (Undated) _ The CBS film ``Sally Hemings: An American

run commencing Sunday and resuming Wednesday. But as both history
and entertainment, it's not much.

 &HT;    Political ticker: Pushing and shoving over push-polling
 &HT;    EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After hearing Thursday from a mother who said a telephone
pollster upset her 14-year-old son, John McCain again accused
George W. Bush of using phony polling calls to mislead voters. Bush
denied his campaign was making such ``push poll'' calls and
criticized McCain's fund-raising. Responding to the allegation that
a caller working for his campaign portrayed McCain as a liar, Bush
said he would fire anyone who did so. Campaign spokesman Ari
Fleischer released a script for what he said was the only call the
Bush campaign was making. It criticizes McCain for ``negative
campaign tactics'' but does not refer to his honesty, and asks only
one question: Will you support Bush in the GOP presidential
primary?
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN WORTH EVERY DOLLAR TO FORBES
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes officially ended his second GOP presidential
campaign Thursday in Washington after spending millions of his own
money. He said his candidacy was a ``fantastic, phenomenal
experience'' that ``changed the political landscape'' and forced
his rivals to rethink taxes, abortion and other issues. He declined
to immediately endorse another candidate. He said the cost his
campaigns in 1996 and this year _ more than $66 million _ was money
well spent. ``When you add it up, it's a formidable sum, but it
will get you a handful of ads in the Super Bowl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY'S SECRET WEAPON: MICHAEL JORDAN
</P>
<P>
   Basketball mega-star Michael Jordan has starred in TV
commercials for shoes, drinks, underwear and long-distance phone
service. Now the former Chicago Bull and North Carolina Tar Heel is
entering the political arena. Jordan will appear in TV ads
endorsing Bill Bradley, another former basketball star. The ad,
taped two months ago, will begin airing Friday in some Super
Tuesday states. Kristen Ludecke, Bradley's spokeswoman, wouldn't
say which markets the ad would run in. New York, California, Ohio,
Georgia and other large states are holding primaries March 7.
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA READY TO MARCH
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, in a step toward setting up a new
Independence Party, apparently plans to urge his state's Reform
Party delegates to vote to leave the national organization.
Minnesota state Reform Party Chairman Rick McCluhan said Thursday
that Ventura, the Reform Party's top elected officeholder, would
not leave the party unless delegates to the state convention agreed
to the plan. No time has been set for such a vote. Ventura has
scheduled a news conference for today to discuss a political
matter, the topic undisclosed.
</P>
<P>
   UNNECESSARY FORCE?
</P>
<P>
   A South Carolina state trooper turned on his siren and pulled
over the John McCain campaign bus Thursday. His goal: to meet
McCain. But unfortunately, reports Cox's Mark Sherman, the trooper
didn't count on a horde of reporters on the bus descending upon him
with cameras in tow. Now the trooper is worried he may lose his
job.
</P>
<P>
   A CALIFORNIA RUNAWAY FOR GORE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's close victory over Bill Bradley in New Hampshire is
translating into runaway success in California, the grand prize of
the Democratic sweepstakes. The latest Golden State polls show Gore
holding a commanding 41 point lead over Bradley with just four
weeks to the Super Tuesday primaries March 7. Gore will storm storm
into Silicon Valley today, Cox's Ken Foskett reports, and both
candidates will make crucial appearances before the California
state party convention Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENT VOTES WILL LOOK GOOD, BUT WON'T COUNT
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters like those who accounted for much of John
McCain's victory in New Hampshire won't help him win delegates in
California. Only Republican votes count in the GOP race for the
nation's biggest primary prize. Though independents will be able to
cast ballots in the state's presidential primary for the first time
this year, the Republican and Democratic parties will ignore those
votes when doling out convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   MIX AND MATCH, SLICE AND DICE
</P>
<P>
   In the movie ``Air Force One,'' Harrison Ford played a decisive
U.S. president. In real life, he finds presidential choices more
difficult. Campaign contribution records show that Ford donated
$1,000 each to Bill Bradley and John McCain. Ford wasn't alone in
his indecision. Federal Election Commission records for the fourth
quarter of 1999 show these split combinations: Bradley-George W.
Bush, 132; Bush-McCain, 94; Bradley-McCain, 33; Bush-Bradley, 3;
McCain-Al Gore, 2. No one, according to the records, contributed to
both Gore and Bradley, or Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   FAITH-BASED CHARITIES: WHO SAID WHAT?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton continued for a second day Thursday her attacks
on likely Senate opponent Rudy Giuliani over a fund-raising letter.
At issue was an eight-page letter Giuliani sent to conservatives:
``Hillary Clinton further revealed her hostility towards America's
religious traditions when she attacked Gov. George W. Bush's idea
that we should look toward America's faith-based charities more
than government programs to address social problems.'' Clinton
campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said Clinton had never attacked
Bush's proposal, and supports using faith-based charities to carry
out social programs if it is done in a constitutional manner.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-ABORTION NOD GOES TO BUSH
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest
anti-abortion organization, endorsed George W. Bush and criticized
John McCain as inconsistent on abortion. McCain's reaction: ``I
have no reaction except that the National Right to Life people have
turned a cause into a business.'' He called the group part of the
``Washington establishment,'' and said that he was confident that
abortion foes ``in South Carolina and around the country will
continue to renew efforts on my behalf because they know my 17-year
record is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   BETTER STAY HOME, DAD
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, described by the Orlando Sentinel as
``seething'' and ``angry,'' asked his father, former President
George Bush, to cancel a speech to the state Legislature that he
was scheduled to give five days before the March 14 Florida
primary. ``Given recent events, and the fact that the leadership in
the House and the Senate cannot guarantee that my dad will be
treated with the respect that he so deserves ... I have asked him
to cancel his appearances,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   HE'D RATHER MARVEL THAN SWITCH
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) says John McCain
is gaining the kind of momentum that could topple George W. Bush,
the candidate D'Amato endorsed a year ago. ``I think this
phenomenon has taken on a life of its own, and that people are
going to be turning out in increasing numbers to see and to hear a
refreshing candidate who took on his party. People love that,''
D'Amato said in an Associated Press interview. But if D'Amato is so
enthused about McCain, what's keeping him from switching? ``I am
excited for him, but there's a certain thing called keeping your
word,'' D'Amato said. He added that he was ``living vicariously
through McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY'D RATHER SWITCH THAN MARVEL
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of Democrats apparently are dropping their party
affiliation to vote for John McCain in the upcoming primaries. The
phone is ringing continuously at the secretary of state's office in
Massachusetts with questions from voters looking to switch parties
by next Wednesday's registration deadline. The AP reports a similar
trend in California, where McCain is gaining a surge of support.
Bush's campaign, however, had a different take on the situation.
Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman, said some Democrats may believe
McCain would be an easier candidate to beat than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   THE KEYES WAR ROOM
</P>
<P>
   Afraid the race is slipping away from him, Alan Keyes convened a
war room meeting with key state and national aides Tuesday night.
ABC reported that Keyes would like to get back to his Iowa routine
of holding a few daytime events, but primarily focusing on evening
events _ the sort that drew several hundred ``pumped up''
supporters, who would go back to their communities to spread the
Keyes gospel.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY VALUES: STUMPING FOR SON
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of the son seeking to follow in his footsteps, former
President George Bush accepted endorsements Wednesday from Michigan
law enforcement groups: the Police Officers Association of
Michigan, the state's Deputy Sheriff's Association and the Michigan
Fraternal Order of Police. ``I hope it rings out through this
state. I hope the folks in South Carolina hear it,'' he said. In
the meantime, mother Barbara was in Virginia addressing students at
the Youth Leadership Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN TO THE NITTY GRITTY
</P>
<P>
   With Steve Forbes gone, John McCain and George W. Bush settled
into a two-man race in South Carolina that could be shaped by the
state's Feb. 19 primary. Fighting to be known as the campaign's
true reformer, McCain called Bush an ``unwitting pawn'' of special
interests. And Bush questioned his rival's use of political action
committee donations.
</P>
<P>
   BUS STOP IN EVERY SENSE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain calls his campaign bus the ``Straight Talk
Express''; George W. Bush calls his the ``Victory Express.'' On
Wednesday, there was one phrase to describe them both: out of
commission. A jarring scrape brought McCain's bus to a stop. The
trailer hitch had caught on the pavement when the bus climbed
abruptly on an incline. The bus was towed out and put back in
service. For Bush, it was his first day in a new, customized bus
decked out with TVs, a satellite dish and a rack of stereo
components. The bus ground to a halt and wouldn't move out of fifth
gear. Fluid poured out of the transmission area. Bush had to move
to the only reliable form of transportation around: the press bus.
</P>
<P>
   HE COULD BE A NATURAL FOR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Being interviewed on a Columbia, S.C., radio station, George W.
Bush was asked to name his favorite movie star. When he didn't come
up with an immediate answer, they asked him which movie star he'd
like to meet. Bush didn't answer directly, but said he liked
campaigning for governor with actor and martial arts star Chuck
Norris. ``He's a Texan; he's a buddy,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one has taken the measure of that awesome monster
television with more audacious ingenuity than Nam June Paik, the
Korean-born electronics wizard who started his career in Germany as
a renegade musician. With boundless energy and manic obsession, he
has made television his own subversive creature, pushing it beyond
the banalities of network and cable into the realm of art and
critique.
</P>
<P>
   From mining the world for global imagery to creating a ``TV
bra'' for the cellist Charlotte Moorman, from blasting commercials
into gyrating geometrics to making spectacular video-generated
visual environments, Paik has given video his distinctive stamp,
putting it through paces undreamed of by more conventional
tinkerers.
</P>
<P>
   From his first primitive efforts in the early 1960s, mounting
magnets on monitors to warp the electronic signal, to more recent
multichannel projections of global events, he has tuned into
video's processes and possibilities with keen insight,
inventiveness and a wild sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 68, has Paik peaked? Not a bit of it, as proved by ``The
Worlds of Nam June Paik,'' his first American retrospective since
1982, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Organized by John G.
Hanhardt, senior curator of film and media arts at the museum, with
Jon Ippolito, assistant curator of media arts, the show contains
examples of Paik's major video endeavors since the early '60s as
well as several new works that tap the visual power of laser beams.
</P>
<P>
   In the rotunda the centerpiece of the exhibition is ``Modulation
in Sync (2000)'' _ done in collaboration with a laser-installation
expert, Norman Ballard _ a pulsating multimedia environment that
envelops the viewer in a wrap of sound and light.
</P>
<P>
   Its three components include two laser projection pieces that
give this incorporeal medium spectacular visibility. One is a
coruscating ``Jacob's Ladder (2000),'' whose colored light zigzags
down a seven-story waterfall cascading from the dome to the rotunda
floor. The other, ``Sweet and Sublime (2000),'' shoots bursts of
colored geometrics in rapid-fire sequence onto the oculus of the
Guggenheim's dome.
</P>
<P>
   The laser pieces share the rotunda with another element, a gang
of 100 video monitors with upturned faces, whose rapidly changing
multichannel imagery is repeated on six monitors the size of movie
screens.
</P>
<P>
   They are installed between the walls of the ramp that spirals
from the rotunda. Looked down on from any point, the monitors evoke
a turbulent pond of swimming images, while the double-faced screens
on the ramp enlarge the images _ among them Allen Ginsberg, Dick
Cavett, Merce Cunningham and a Japanese rock band _ to cinematic
scale.
</P>
<P>
   The High Gallery, which has served as a shrine for many
masterpieces of great but (by video standards) static modern art,
has been darkened to display ``Three Elements,'' a trio of ``laser
sculptures'' in which laser beams move and cross one another with a
kind of abstract choreography in infinite space. The eye-boggling
spectacle would give an old-line easel painter like, say,
Kandinsky, a 360-degree turn.
</P>
<P>
   What comes after this, on the way up the ramp, is a display of
Paik icons from the '60s and '70s, more than a dozen pieces, some
of which have been reconfigured for the ramp's curves. There are
cornball jokes like ``Candle TV'' (1975), an empty shell of a
monitor with a lone candle burning inside. (Not for nothing has
Paik been affectionately dubbed the ``village vidiot.'')
</P>
<P>
   And there are more ambitious undertakings, like the updated
version of ``TV Garden'' (1975), a lush, sprawling environment of
potted greenery that drapes over the edges of the ramp
(interestingly, a feature of Frank Lloyd Wright's original drawings
for the Guggenheim).
</P>
<P>
   Half concealed among the plants are some 30 video monitors
placed in upright and other positions. They are all tuned to
``Global Groove'' (1973), a sprightly, fast-paced mix of pop
performances, other artists' films and videotapes, manipulated
commercials and appropriated prime-time television material. It is
perhaps Paik's most influential broadcast production.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the candle piece a few steps further is ``One Candle
(Candle Projection)'' of 1988, in which a lone candle is videotaped
and its image then manipulated by a number of monitors to create a
discolike environment of flickering colored shadows on the walls of
three bays.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Evoking Paik's Asian origins is ``Mongolian Tent'' (1993), a
full-scale yurt on whose sanded floor sit three statuettes of
Buddha, watching ``Beuys Projection'' (1990), a performance by
Joseph Beuys filmed by Paik that throws projections on the walls
and tent poles.
</P>
<P>
   And displaying the Paik skill at mixing live with virtual is his
updated version of ``Video Fish'' (1975), a long bank of 52 tanks
in which live fish swim before monitor screens showing videotapes
of mixed images, among them other performing fish and Merce
Cunningham dancing, trailed by a ghostly doppelganger.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Tower Gallery, on the topmost ramp, is devoted to
Paik's early years, recapitulated in photographs, objects, tapes
(video and audio) and viewer-driven interactive pieces. Photographs
show his early rapport with the iconoclast composer John Cage,
whose random, chance-inspired scores suggested new approaches to
music, performance and visual art.
</P>
<P>
   Paik's audio tapes of mixed sounds and silences and his
``Klavier Integral'' (1958-63), an adjusted piano with many
nontraditional musical items added, sprang from Cagean notions.
</P>
<P>
   An early member of Fluxus, the loose-knit international group of
artists who used guerrilla tactics to savage conventional cultural
pieties, Paik entered vigorously into the action. A 1964 photograph
shows George Maciunas, Fluxus' founder, performing the Paik ``One
for Violin Solo'' (1962), whose score called for smashing the
violin to pieces. Playing the piano for his ``Mixed Media Opera''
(1968) at Town Hall, Paik is seen, stripped to the waist,
improvisationally banging on the keys with his head.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the Tower Gallery is devoted to Paik's redoubtable
collaborator, Moorman, the classical cellist and dedicated
avant-gardist who died in 1991. Working with him, she followed Paik
scores with relish, getting arrested at one point for performing
topless in his ``Opera Sextronique'' (1967) at the Filmmakers
Cinematheque in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later she heroically donned the Paik-designed device
``TV Bra for Living Sculpture'' (1969), in which a pair of tiny
televisions attached to her breasts produced images from the act of
bowing her cello.
</P>
<P>
   There are special rooms off the gallery for listening to Paik's
early audio tapes and watching his single-channel videotapes and
works for broadcast television. More material displays in this
gallery include the original Paik-Abe video synthesizer (1969-72),
a collaboration between Paik and the Japanese engineer Shuya Abe
that enabled the processing of live and taped video images to
produce a visually distinctive vocabulary a distance from the
language of commercial television. It was a giant step toward
forming the Paik's cool signature style.
</P>
<P>
   With a deep grasp of television's ideology, structure and effect
on our lives, and the artistic means to tackle it with wit and
passion, Paik is a singular figure in the art world. Dealing with a
recalcitrant medium that is very short on tradition, he has little
to do with the ``who's on first?'' game of ``mainstream'' art.
</P>
<P>
   But his skills as an artist, a shaper of ideas and, yes, an
entertainer, qualify him as national cultural treasure, a title he
already holds in his native country. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Worlds of Nam June Paik'' remains at the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500,
through April 26. &QL;

 &HT;    Atlanta group out to disbar Clinton
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton this week is expected to become the
first sitting president served with formal legal ethics complaints.
One of them is brought by the Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal
Foundation, which wants him disbarred.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is licensed to practice law in Arkansas, was mailed
two complaints Wednesday by certified mail by the Arkansas Supreme
Court Committee on Professional Conduct, foundation President
Matthew Glavin said. The foundation's complaint alleges ``willful
professional misconduct by lying under oath in a court of law'' by
Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton will be served another complaint stemming
from the contempt of court citation issued in April 1999 by U.S.
District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided over the Jones
case, Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Steve Boyd declined comment Thursday.
Clinton has 30 days to file a response, Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright fined Clinton $90,000 after finding he deliberately
misled the court about his sexual encounters with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conduct in the case led to his impeachment. The
question now is whether it will make him the first president to be
disbarred. (President Nixon gave up his bar license after resigning
over the Watergate scandal.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When a lawyer violates his professional oath, lies before a
court of law and obstructs justice, that lawyer must be held
accountable,'' Glavin said. ``Now that process can begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who received his law degree from Yale University,
taught law school classes and served as Arkansas attorney general.
If disbarred, he could not practice law after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Legal Foundation is a conservative public
interest law firm. It also represents white business owners in the
lawsuit against Atlanta's affirmative action program. Former
independent counsel Kenneth Starr will address its annual dinner in
April.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's ethics complaint was filed in September 1998 by
L. Lynn Hogue, a Georgia State University constitutional law
professor who also is licensed to practice law in Arkansas. He
chairs the foundation's legal advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the foundation asked the Arkansas Supreme Court to
order its Committee on Professional Conduct to begin the complaint
proceedings against Clinton. Two weeks ago, the court issued the
order.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported Thursday that three
members of the court's 14-member disciplinary panel have made
donations to Democratic candidates and the party. The newspaper
also reported that two other people designated to serve as
alternates gave money directly to Clinton's presidential campaigns.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two tributaries of the jet stream, a northern branch associated
with cold, dry air from Canada and a southern branch associated
with mild, moist air from the Pacific, were expected to merge this
weekend over the East, inciting a large storm. But the two branches
will remain separate, eliminating any chances for a widespread
snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, moderate to locally heavy snow will fall over parts
of central and northern Maine as a disturbance in the dry northern
branch gleans moisture from the Atlantic as it heads toward the Bay
of Fundy. Drizzle and patchy freezing drizzle will fall over
southern New England in the wake of the low, while steady snows
taper to snow flurries in northern New Hampshire and northern
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Large temperature contrasts will prevail across the state of
Texas Friday, with readings hovering in the 30s and, perhaps, the
upper 20s in the northern panhandle while the mercury soars into
the 80s in the lower Rio Grande Valley. Cold air in the panhandle
will mark the leading edge of arctic air spilling south across the
central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   A band of snow will move across the high Plains, affecting parts
of Kansas, Missouri and northern Arkansas before spreading toward
the Tennessee and middle Mississippi valleys Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Another in a series of Pacific disturbances will sweep into
central California during the day, accompanied by broken areas of
rain. Thunder and lightning are possible Friday night as the
system's destabilizing core of high-altitude cold air moves inland.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Philadelphia Story
</P>
<P>
   The ground has been white for a long time around Philadelphia.
On Thursday morning, 3 inches of snow were on the ground at the
official measuring site, marking the 21st consecutive day of snow
cover. The snow-covered period that began on Jan. 21 is the second
longest for the city since records began. Winter seldom gets a
strong foothold in Philadelphia where surges of mild air often
arrive from the Southeastern states. In recent weeks, a series of
snowfalls with persistent northwesterly winds have combined to
produce a tenacious mantle of white.

E-TAIL STILL NEEDS TO PROVIDE VALUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The other day I was talking with a local broker with
Merrill Lynch about the current stock market.
</P>
<P>
   He believes there are really two markets these days. There's the
one made up of old-line companies. And there's the new technology
market _ especially the dot-coms, the companies selling consumer
goods on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I think of that new technology group as the helium market. It's
being held up by expectations rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are betting on the come. They are paying high prices
not for current performance, which is often nil, but for the
expectations of future profits. So how realistic are those
expectations?
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Wharton School of Business at the
University of Pennsylvania suggests that the prospects are good.
But they just may not be as good as most people think they are.
</P>
<P>
   The Wharton School each year gauges the growth of the dot-coms.
The conclusion of their 1999 study is that while total online
spending is increasing, the rate of growth of online spending per
person is declining.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, more people are shopping online. But each
individual is spending less. And many former dot-com shoppers have
dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FUNDAMENTAL FACTORS CITED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how well electronic retailers have done this holiday
season, there are some fundamental factors that appear to be
eroding the growth of spending and the growth of the market,'' said
Jerry Lohse, research director of the Wharton Virtual Test Market.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 15 percent of consumers who bought online
in 1997 did not do so in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 50 percent of the dropouts from 1998 returned to make a
purchase in 1999,'' Lohse said. ``Further new buyers are not
arriving as quickly to take their place. The implication is that
online shopping is just another way of shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   One word of warning here. While the study is one of the most
extensive available on online shopping, it still uses data from
just three years. And as we all know, in business today _
especially online business _ things change rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Why do people buy online? The primary reason is convenience. The
farther customers are from stores that sell recorded music, for
example, the more likely they are to go to the Internet for that
product.
</P>
<P>
   The two demographic factors most driving online shopping are _
not surprisingly _ a person who spends a lot of time online for
other reasons, and who is too busy to find enough time for shopping
at a store.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROWTH TO $133 BILLION SEEN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown in rates of growth doesn't mean that growth is
slowing. The study estimates that currently consumers are spending
$29.2 billion a year online. That will still grow to $133 billion
by January 2004, Wharton estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The online shopping dropouts cite three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ They are concerned about what the online merchants are doing
with the information they provide to make their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   _ They worry about security issues. Will their credit card
number, for example, be snagged by a hacker?
</P>
<P>
   _ They have had a bad experience online and want to deal with a
real person. ``For example, try exchanging an airline ticket
online,'' Lohse said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, online merchants who need to grow enough to deserve
their soaring stock prices are going to have to address those
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   They also must use another often-ignored selling tool to attract
online shoppers _ low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The huge advantage of a wired world is allowing consumers to
easily compare prices on similar products.
</P>
<P>
   That means the most efficient producer can snag customers across
the nation, and the world for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers of intangible products will best benefit from this wired
world. You buy a physical item _ say a book _ and you're going to
have to pay to have it delivered to you. The delivery charge may or
may not be stated. But it's there. Plus, you must delay your
gratification and wait for it to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But if you need insurance on your house, car or life, a car or
house loan or an airline ticket, you can use the Internet to do
your shopping for the best price and have it delivered
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the insurance agent, local loan officer or
travel agent will disappear. But they will have to add real value
to the customer by providing useful advice to make up for the extra
cost of their services.

 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.

  OAKLAND, Calif. _ Not that the National Basketball Association is
overly commercial. It is just that the NBA is currently presenting
something it calls the Jam Session, a whole world of hoops under
three giant tents in the parking lot of the Oakland Coliseum. It's
part of the cultural explosion around Sunday's NBA All-Star Game,
not that the NBA qualifies as culture.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are neat things to do at the Jam Session, really there
are. The whole thing is presented by Fleer, the trading card
company. I tell you this as I type on my Compaq Presario laptop,
after I drove home in my Acura Integra and drank a glass of orange
juice by Minute Maid.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about brand names because everything at the Jam
Session has a sponsor. Hey, you want to see how many 3-pointers you
can sink? Try your luck at the AT&AMP;T Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe 3-pointers aren't your bag. Walk right over to the Upper
Deck Crash the Boards exhibit where you can shoot baskets while
jumping on a trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   You want more? There's the Topps Bungee Run. I quote from the
press kit: ``Players battle a bungee cord as they run down a
20-foot stretch and attempt to pass a ball through life-size NBA
player images. The pass must be completed before the bungee cord
reaches maximum length and springs back into a huge, inflatable
padded wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The press kit did not say what company made the inflatable
padded wall.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Gatorade Court of Dreams. It is a life-size
replica of the famous courts on West 4th Street in Manhattan, minus
the muggings, sewer smells and street crime. Eager participants can
choose up sides and play all day long.
</P>
<P>
   You still want more? You can't beat the Huffy Slingshot Jam.
This is my personal favorite, but first I need to give you some
background. Ever been to a Warriors game where they shoot T-shirts
at you from a giant slingshot? It is one of the high points of your
life, right? Well, at the Jam Session you can shoot a
mini-basketball from a mounted slingshot at a mini-hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is brought to you courtesy of Huffy.
</P>
<P>
   A nice young lady from the NBA named Caren Piela took me around
the three tents and the Center Court, a regulation court under a
tent with stands that seat 3,000. Piela did not have a sponsor tag
on her head, which I found surprising. She was just Caren Piela
from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grass-roots way of bringing the NBA to the people of
Oakland,'' Piela told me.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice sentiment, but frankly I had not heard that
Oakland qualifies as grass roots, as the boonies, as never having
heard of basketball. A few basketball players who came from that
burg are Bill Russell, Gary Payton and Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Piela. ``Not everyone can afford to get into a game.
Here, they can experience the sights and sounds of the NBA, and
it's cheaper than a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. It costs adults 15 bucks at the door, kids get in for
$10. It's cheaper if you buy in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is genuine family fun,'' Piela said. ``If you're good you
can try the slam dunk contest. If you stink at basketball, there's
something for you to do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all the video games, or the Measure Up exhibits where you
can measure your foot, wingspan, and vertical jump against those of
the All Stars, or the place where you can take a photo standing at
Elton Brand's locker, or at Center Court where you can shoot a
jumper and watch yourself doing it on a big-screen television, or
the simulated court where you can play virtual hoops on a video
screen.
</P>
<P>
   When you are done, you can relax in Champs, the official
retailer of Jam Session. In the Champs tent you can spend money: a
limited edition ball goes for $149, a game ball for $109. T-shirts
and hats seem reasonably priced. You can do all this and more at
the Jam Session.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention the Nestle Crunch Celebrity Slam Dunk, the Schick
Rookie Challenge, the Fleer Shootaround? One day, we will all see a
sign in the sky: Air by Microsoft, or something like that.

SEEKING THE TRUTH AT HISTORICAL SITES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of our most treasured travel experiences involve learning
about the people and events that helped shape our nation.
</P>
<P>
   But how often is the historical perspective thrust upon us
complete? Or even accurate?
</P>
<P>
   That's the focus of award-winning author James W. Loewen's new
book, ``Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong''
(The New Press, $26.95), based on five years of travel and research
and all but guaranteed to enlighten, trouble and even anger
readers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WIDESPREAD DISTORTIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why, Loewen asks, does Tennessee honor Confederate Gen. Nathan
Bedford Forrest with 32 historical markers _ more than any other
person in any state in America, indeed more than the combined
markers commemorating Tennessee-bred Presidents Andrew Jackson,
James K. Polk and Andrew Johnson _ and yet overlook Forrest's role
as the first national leader of the Ku Klux Klan?
</P>
<P>
   How do we reconcile that Abraham Lincoln's ``birthplace cabin''
in Kentucky was built after Lincoln's death?
</P>
<P>
   Why does a New York museum commemorating the U.S. battleship
Intrepid ignore the vessel's three tours of duty in Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   And what prompted folks in Helena, Mont., to dedicate a memorial
fountain ``in loving tribute to our Confederate soldiers'' in 1916?
``Montana never had any Confederate soldiers,'' Loewen writes.
``Montana hardly had any Union soldiers. Montana was not even a
(U.S.) territory during most of the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Loewen's basic premises in setting the tone for a 480-page
heavily footnoted volume:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Markers, monuments and preserved historic sites usually
result from local initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Americans like to remember only the positive things, and
communities like to publicize the great things that happened in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Guides almost always avoid negative or controversial facts,
and most monuments, markers and historic sites omit any blemishes
that might taint the heroes they commemorate, making them larger
and less interesting than life.''
</P>
<P>
   And:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``People who put up markers and monuments and preserve
historic houses are usually pillars of the white community.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loewen visited all 50 states and originally intended to read
every historical marker until he realized that Texas has nearly
12,000, more than those in the other states combined.
</P>
<P>
   Some misinterpretations and omissions, he suggests, are borne of
mere silliness or boosterism. But other lapses are less forgivable,
especially racism _ a recurring theme. Historical attractions,
Loewen asserts, too often ignore the plight and continuing
sensitivities of African-Americans, Hispanics and other people of
color.
</P>
<P>
   Loewen cites Dakota Indian leader Lame Deer's evaluation of one
American icon: ``What does this Mount Rushmore mean to us Indians?
It means that these big white faces are telling us, `First we gave
you Indians a treaty that you could keep these Black Hills forever
... in exchange for all the Dakotas, Wyoming and Montana. Then we
found the gold and took this last piece of land, because we were
stronger, and there were more of us than there were of you, and
because we had cannons and Gatling guns. ... After we did all this
we carved up this mountain, the dwelling place of your spirits, and
put our four gleaming white faces here. We are the conquerors.'''
</P>
<P>
   While I applaud and highly recommend Loewen's book, some
conclusions bother me, as they touch on attractions from which I
recently took away a different impression.
</P>
<P>
   One is Ivy Green, Helen Keller's birthplace in Tuscumbia, Ala.
``Ivy Green disables Helen Keller more completely than the
childhood fever that made her blind and deaf,'' Loewen writes.
``The site presents her as a bland source of inspiration to our
youth _ while omitting everything she stood for, every cause she
cared about. ... The Helen Keller they present, devoid of content,
does not challenge visitors to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Loewen points to misinterpretations of history, he runs
the risk of misinterpreting the impact a site may have on others.
Ivy Green, flawed or not, did challenge me to think _ and to want
to learn more about Keller. And my sense is that anyone who looks
carefully at exhibits, or who takes time to visit with museum
volunteers, can gain insight into the whole person Keller
represented.
</P>
<P>
   Also disturbing is Loewen's criticism of the National Museum of
the Pacific War (Nimitz Museum) in Fredericksburg. ``The museum
provides no real sense of what the Pacific War was like _ no feel
for the horror and brutality of combat,'' the author opines. ``The
Nimitz Museum not only prettifies the Pacific War, it also
prettifies America's role in it.''
</P>
<P>
   I toured the museum's new George Bush Gallery a few weeks back
and was profoundly moved by its visual and audio exhibits. I gained
renewed empathy not only for American war heroes but for enemy
soldiers. I felt the anguish and horror. I shivered when I thought
about the time my father spent on Iwo Jima.
</P>
<P>
   But then, maybe this kind of soul-searching is exactly what
Loewen seeks to elicit.
</P>
<P>
   One other thought: I've always been one to look at a glass as
half-full, not half-empty. And I am encouraged by current efforts
to correct some of the long-standing ills he recounts.
</P>
<P>
   I was visiting not long ago with Andrew Sansom, executive
director of Texas Parks &AMP; Wildlife, and as we discussed ways to
attract more minorities to our state's historical parks, Sansom
stressed the importance of better interpreting these sites for _
and from the perspective of _ Hispanics, African-Americans and all
other Texans.
</P>
<P>
   In recent travels elsewhere, I've sensed progress in relating
history from diverse viewpoints. Also, more and more cities now
publish brochures that focus on African-American, Hispanic,
Asian-American and American Indian history and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Lies Across America'' is a powerful follow-up to
Loewen's previous work, ``Lies My Teacher Told Me,'' recipient of
the American Book Award.

<P>
   VIENNA _ Stefan Gergely(CQ) cannot believe this is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we look like fascists, like Nazis?'' he asks an American
visitor to his popular Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna these days, such questions are put to visitors
frequently. Austrians long have considered themselves among the
most cultured of Europeans, their country noted for classical
music, sophisticated thought and elegant skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, they are angered by the indignity of having to
prove to the world that they are not barbarians.
</P>
<P>
   Gergely's lunchtime customers include well-dressed and
well-connected business people and politicians. They come to
Restaurant Silberwir, set on a sedate side street near the city
center, for the pasta and politics.
</P>
<P>
   These days there are only two deeply intertwined topics: Joerg
Haider and the world's enmity.
</P>
<P>
   Haider leads the populist right Freedom Party, which in recent
days was installed as a coalition partner in Austria's new
government. This caused waves of outrage across Europe, where the
Freedom Party is viewed as something between neo-Nazis and
conventional American Republican conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd sort of political quarantine, 16 nations _ Austria's
14 European Union partners, the United States and Israel _ have
restricted diplomatic contacts with the government. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright summoned the American ambassador to
Washington briefly for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   In Austria, this is all seen as a grossly unfair overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Gergely, 50, says with a half glass of beer in
one hand and a smoldering Cuban cigar in the other. ``Two-thirds of
the people didn't even vote for him. What is an average Austrian to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy answer.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, Vienna's cool serenity had been replaced by
tumult and a sense of siege. Each night, the city's streets filled
with thousands of angry, boisterous demonstrators who marched
through glitzy shopping districts and working-class neighborhoods
calling for the collapse of the fledgling government.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the new parliament meets under the protection of
hundreds of police in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   At the police barriers, the anger was palpable. ``We will come
every night until there is change,'' said Margaret Weninger, a
young artist who endured the cold and drizzle last Tuesday night to
demonstrate against the new government. ``We must not let the Nazis
take over our country. They say that we misunderstand Haider. I
think we understand him too well.''
</P>
<P>
   As the week progressed, the criticism seemed to escalate, even
as the government tried to show its munificence by pledging to pay
damages to people who worked as slaves during the Nazi
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, European rabbis on Thursday said they will move a
planned meeting from Vienna. ``A person like Joerg Haider is
unacceptable to the European family of nations,'' Aba Dunner,
secretary general of the Conference of European Rabbis, told a
Slovakian newspaper. ``The thoughts he has presented on the
Holocaust, Hitler, the SS and concentration camps are not
acceptable at the start of a new century and never can be, since we
know exactly what they led to in the 30s and 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider has renounced his past comments and frequently apologized
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he summoned foreign reporters to his headquarters in
the picturesque Alpine village of Klagenfurt. Haider, the very
picture of a harmless and misunderstood politician, gently scoffed
at assertions that he and his party are extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful to convince you that the Freedom Party is a
pure democratic movement on the basics of human rights, on the
basics of the common values of the European Community, and will
play an important role to promote these values in the future,''
Haider said, flashing a warm, reassuring smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if we stay in government and do make a good job in a
few months, the Freedom Party will be fully accepted and some
others will regret what they have said against the Freedom Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The party received 27 percent of the vote in October's
elections. Most analysts believe voters were moved by a powerful
desire to break up the 30-year hold on the government by coalitions
led by the mainstream Conservatives and Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Freedom Party rose to prominence espousing nationalism,
a reduction or halt to allowing foreigners into the country, and
other beliefs considered objectionable to the moderates and
leftists who control most of Europe's governments.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most alarming to them is Haider himself, the son of
dedicated Nazis who has from time to time expressed pro-Hitler
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, charismatic man with a nimble mind and athletic
vigor, Haider personifies a fear in Europe that something
terrifying lies beneath the civil and liberal patina that obscures
some dark truth about the continent 55 years after the destruction
of the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   His rhetoric hasn't helped calm fears. He has expressed
admiration for Hitler's employment policies and respect for the
Waffen SS, the heavily-armed and particularly vicious cadre of Nazi
storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   To describe the influx of foreigners, Haider and his party have
caused chills by using the term ``ueberfremdung'' _ a word coined
in the 1930s by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propagandist.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, he has shown the rest of the right how
to gain power.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe are an array of mostly unsuccessful parties that
share the Freedom Party's basic beliefs. They view the continent as
being overrun with undesirable immigrants and believe countries are
surrendering too much sovereignty to Brussels, the seat of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric of the European right is not far from American
conservatives in the 1980s who attacked the government in
Washington for having too much power and using it to
disproportionately benefit blacks and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has compared himself with an American politician he
admires, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Haider even borrowed a
page from the former Georgia congressman by offering a program
called the ``Contract with Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Haider likes to compare himself to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, much to the chagrin of No. 10 Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
   The condemnation from the left has boosted Haider's standing
with the right. In Germany, the anti-emigrant Republikaners party
wants to launch a campaign titled ``solidarity with Austria.''
Edmund Stoiber, the ultra-conservative governor of Bavaria,
condemned the sanctions as ``diplomacy run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, where the right-wing People's Party captured
22.5 percent of the vote in the last election, European governments
that opposed Haider were condemned as meddling. One poll showed
that half the Swiss opposed the action by the EU members.
</P>
<P>
   The Haider episode has energized the movement to keep the
historically neutral country's distance from the European Union.
Flavio Maspoli, a Swiss rightist, suggested that Austria's case is
proof that the EU would try to dictate internal politics if
Switzerland were to join the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never had a dictator and don't need to have one now
from Brussels,'' Maspoli told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the elder statesman of European
rightwingers, said he was encouraged by the events in Austria. Le
Pen said that Haider demonstrated that far right parties could
succeed if they could forge alliances with mainstream conservative
parties. ``This is a very encouraging development,'' he told a
French newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the far-reaching implications of Haider's success,
Austrians say they can handle him and that he is most safely
controlled by giving his party a share of government.
</P>
<P>
   Austrians generally deplore Haider's statements, but they take
them with a grain of salt. Foreign Secretary Benita Ferraro-Wadner,
who once vowed she would never sit in a government that includes
Haider, said Austrians understand Haider and are amused by his
antics. Few Austrians, however, regard him as a menace, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro-Wadner is from the conservative People's Party, which
says it was forced into an uncomfortable alliance with the Freedom
Party only after talks with other parties collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haider very often uses a very strong and sometimes folk-lorish
kind of language,'' Ferraro-Wadner said, describing Haider's
proclamations as ``beer-tent rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Austrians have known him for a long time, and for that reason,
we don't take these statements as seriously as other people do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Austrian politicians such as Ferraro-Wadner also say
they can live with the Freedom Party so long as Haider is not
personally part of the national government. Moreover, they are
comforted by his recent signature on a three-page statement that
rejects xenophobia, racism and demagoguery.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ferraro-Wadner also warned that past attempts to isolate Haider
have failed. Indeed, new polls show 70 percent of Austrians believe
the condemnation by other European nations was unfair and that
Haider's party would win outright if an election were held today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should not demonize him,'' she said. ``He is not a devil.
He is a tough and outspoken politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen one thing _ excluding him and not giving him any
responsibility only makes him stronger.''

   Austria isn't alone. Right-wing parties exist throughout Europe.
All favor increased nationalism, greater restrictions or an end to
immigration, and reduction of the European Union's political and
economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOM PARTY: Led by Joerg Haider, it won 27 percent of vote in
October elections and now is part of coalition government. Sixteen
nations _ including the other 14 members of the European Union, the
United States and Israel _ have announced reduced diplomatic
contact with Austria as a result.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BELGIUM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VLAAMS BLOK: Led by Fillip Dewinter, who wants to halt
immigration and create a separate Flemish state. Has 30 percent
support in Antwerp, Belgium's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DENMARK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DANISH PEOPLES PARTY: Led by Pia Kjarsgaard, who recently
proposed that the entire family of any immigrant convicted of a
crime should be deported. It won 7.4 percent of the vote in last
elections and holds 13 of 179 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL FRONT: Led by blustery Jean-Marie Le Pen, it's the most
established of Europe's right-wing movements. However, public
support dropped from 15 percent to about 5 percent in last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT: Led by Bruno Megret, former
follower of Le Pen. Creation of the party splintered French right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GERMAN PEOPLE'S UNION: In 1998, won 12 percent in regional
elections in eastern Germany. Last year, captured 5 percent in only
two of seven local elections. Draws strength from young East German
men.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLIKANERS: Won less than 2 percent in 1998 elections but
claims to be gaining in popularity. The party has a strong regional
presence in southwestern Germany, not far from Austria.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ITALY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL ALLIANCE: Led by Gianfranco Fini. Briefly in a
coalition government in 1994 after Fini, who has expressed
admiration for Fascist Dictator Benito Mussolini, moderated his
views. Now seen as acceptable members of government.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHERN LEAGUE: Led by Unberto Bossi, espouses views that not
only are anti-foreigner, but also urges Italy's northerners to take
control of a foundering economy and dump ``the welfare state'' the
League claims is rife in the south.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWITZERLAND &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLE'S PARTY: Led by millionaire Christoph Blocher. Second
strongest party in Switzerland with 22.5 percent of the vote.

   VIENNA _ Stefan Gergely(CQ) cannot believe this is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we look like fascists, like Nazis?'' he asks an American
visitor to his popular Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna these days, such questions are put to visitors
frequently. Austrians long have considered themselves among the
most cultured of Europeans, their country noted for classical
music, sophisticated thought and elegant skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, they are angered by the indignity of having to
prove to the world that they are not barbarians.
</P>
<P>
   Gergely's lunchtime customers include well-dressed and
well-connected business people and politicians. They come to
Restaurant Silberwir, set on a sedate side street near the city
center, for the pasta and politics.
</P>
<P>
   These days there are only two deeply intertwined topics: Joerg
Haider and the world's enmity.
</P>
<P>
   Haider leads the populist right Freedom Party, which in recent
days was installed as a coalition partner in Austria's new
government. This caused waves of outrage across Europe, where the
Freedom Party is viewed as something between neo-Nazis and
conventional American Republican conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd sort of political quarantine, 16 nations _ Austria's
14 European Union partners, the United States and Israel _ have
restricted diplomatic contacts with the government. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright summoned the American ambassador to
Washington briefly for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   In Austria, this is all seen as a grossly unfair overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' Gergely, 50, says with a half glass of beer in
one hand and a smoldering Cuban cigar in the other. ``Two-thirds of
the people didn't even vote for him. What is an average Austrian to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy answer.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, Vienna's cool serenity had been replaced by
tumult and a sense of siege. Each night, the city's streets filled
with thousands of angry, boisterous demonstrators who marched
through glitzy shopping districts and working-class neighborhoods
calling for the collapse of the fledgling government.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the new parliament meets under the protection of
hundreds of police in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   At the police barriers, the anger was palpable. ``We will come
every night until there is change,'' said Margaret Weninger, a
young artist who endured the cold and drizzle last Tuesday night to
demonstrate against the new government. ``We must not let the Nazis
take over our country. They say that we misunderstand Haider. I
think we understand him too well.''
</P>
<P>
   As the week progressed, the criticism seemed to escalate, even
as the government tried to show its munificence by pledging to pay
damages to people who worked as slaves during the Nazi
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, European rabbis on Thursday said they will move a
planned meeting from Vienna. ``A person like Joerg Haider is
unacceptable to the European family of nations,'' Aba Dunner,
secretary general of the Conference of European Rabbis, told a
Slovakian newspaper. ``The thoughts he has presented on the
Holocaust, Hitler, the SS and concentration camps are not
acceptable at the start of a new century and never can be, since we
know exactly what they led to in the 30s and 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider has renounced his past comments and frequently apologized
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he summoned foreign reporters to his headquarters in
the picturesque Alpine village of Klagenfurt. Haider, the very
picture of a harmless and misunderstood politician, gently scoffed
at assertions that he and his party are extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful to convince you that the Freedom Party is a
pure democratic movement on the basics of human rights, on the
basics of the common values of the European Community, and will
play an important role to promote these values in the future,''
Haider said, flashing a warm, reassuring smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if we stay in government and do make a good job in a
few months, the Freedom Party will be fully accepted and some
others will regret what they have said against the Freedom Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The party received 27 percent of the vote in October's
elections. Most analysts believe voters were moved by a powerful
desire to break up the 30-year hold on the government by coalitions
led by the mainstream Conservatives and Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Freedom Party rose to prominence espousing nationalism,
a reduction or halt to allowing foreigners into the country, and
other beliefs considered objectionable to the moderates and
leftists who control most of Europe's governments.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most alarming to them is Haider himself, the son of
dedicated Nazis who has from time to time expressed pro-Hitler
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, charismatic man with a nimble mind and athletic
vigor, Haider personifies a fear in Europe that something
terrifying lies beneath the civil and liberal patina that obscures
some dark truth about the continent 55 years after the destruction
of the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   His rhetoric hasn't helped calm fears. He has expressed
admiration for Hitler's employment policies and respect for the
Waffen SS, the heavily-armed and particularly vicious cadre of Nazi
storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   To describe the influx of foreigners, Haider and his party have
caused chills by using the term ``ueberfremdung'' _ a word coined
in the 1930s by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propagandist.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, he has shown the rest of the right how
to gain power.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe are an array of mostly unsuccessful parties that
share the Freedom Party's basic beliefs. They view the continent as
being overrun with undesirable immigrants and believe countries are
surrendering too much sovereignty to Brussels, the seat of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric of the European right is not far from American
conservatives in the 1980s who attacked the government in
Washington for having too much power and using it to
disproportionately benefit blacks and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has compared himself with an American politician he
admires, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Haider even borrowed a
page from the former Georgia congressman by offering a program
called the ``Contract with Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Haider likes to compare himself to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, much to the chagrin of No. 10 Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
   The condemnation from the left has boosted Haider's standing
with the right. In Germany, the anti-emigrant Republikaners party
wants to launch a campaign titled ``solidarity with Austria.''
Edmund Stoiber, the ultra-conservative governor of Bavaria,
condemned the sanctions as ``diplomacy run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, where the right-wing People's Party captured
22.5 percent of the vote in the last election, European governments
that opposed Haider were condemned as meddling. One poll showed
that half the Swiss opposed the action by the EU members.
</P>
<P>
   The Haider episode has energized the movement to keep the
historically neutral country's distance from the European Union.
Flavio Maspoli, a Swiss rightist, suggested that Austria's case is
proof that the EU would try to dictate internal politics if
Switzerland were to join the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never had a dictator and don't need to have one now
from Brussels,'' Maspoli told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the elder statesman of European
rightwingers, said he was encouraged by the events in Austria. Le
Pen said that Haider demonstrated that far right parties could
succeed if they could forge alliances with mainstream conservative
parties. ``This is a very encouraging development,'' he told a
French newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the far-reaching implications of Haider's success,
Austrians say they can handle him and that he is most safely
controlled by giving his party a share of government.
</P>
<P>
   Austrians generally deplore Haider's statements, but they take
them with a grain of salt. Foreign Secretary Benita Ferraro-Wadner,
who once vowed she would never sit in a government that includes
Haider, said Austrians understand Haider and are amused by his
antics. Few Austrians, however, regard him as a menace, she said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro-Wadner is from the conservative People's Party, which
says it was forced into an uncomfortable alliance with the Freedom
Party only after talks with other parties collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haider very often uses a very strong and sometimes folk-lorish
kind of language,'' Ferraro-Wadner said, describing Haider's
proclamations as ``beer-tent rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Austrians have known him for a long time, and for that reason,
we don't take these statements as seriously as other people do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Austrian politicians such as Ferraro-Wadner also say
they can live with the Freedom Party so long as Haider is not
personally part of the national government. Moreover, they are
comforted by his recent signature on a three-page statement that
rejects xenophobia, racism and demagoguery.

<P>
   Ferraro-Wadner also warned that past attempts to isolate Haider
have failed. Indeed, new polls show 70 percent of Austrians believe
the condemnation by other European nations was unfair and that
Haider's party would win outright if an election were held today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should not demonize him,'' she said. ``He is not a devil.
He is a tough and outspoken politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen one thing _ excluding him and not giving him any
responsibility only makes him stronger.''

   Austria isn't alone. Right-wing parties exist throughout Europe.
All favor increased nationalism, greater restrictions or an end to
immigration, and reduction of the European Union's political and
economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FREEDOM PARTY: Led by Joerg Haider, it won 27 percent of vote in
October elections and now is part of coalition government. Sixteen
nations _ including the other 14 members of the European Union, the
United States and Israel _ have announced reduced diplomatic
contact with Austria as a result.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BELGIUM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VLAAMS BLOK: Led by Fillip Dewinter, who wants to halt
immigration and create a separate Flemish state. Has 30 percent
support in Antwerp, Belgium's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DENMARK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DANISH PEOPLES PARTY: Led by Pia Kjarsgaard, who recently

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL FRONT: Led by blustery Jean-Marie Le Pen, it's the most
established of Europe's right-wing movements. However, public
support dropped from 15 percent to about 5 percent in last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT: Led by Bruno Megret, former
follower of Le Pen. Creation of the party splintered French right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GERMAN PEOPLE'S UNION: In 1998, won 12 percent in regional
elections in eastern Germany. Last year, captured 5 percent in only
two of seven local elections. Draws strength from young East German
men.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLIKANERS: Won less than 2 percent in 1998 elections but
claims to be gaining in popularity. The party has a strong regional
presence in southwestern Germany, not far from Austria.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWITZERLAND &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLE'S PARTY: Led by millionaire Christoph Blocher. Second

 &HT;    Garage goods only way to fetch Elton John tickets in Web site
promotion
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Elton John will play a special concert at the Phillips
Arena in mid-March, but if you want a ticket, don't call the arena.
Instead, start cleaning out your garage.
</P>
<P>
   You can't buy a ticket. The only way to get one is to put an
item up for bid on a new Web site called PefectYardsale
(www.perfectyardsale.priceline.com).
</P>
<P>
   John's one-time-only Atlanta-appearance is being sponsored by
PerfectYardsale in an attempt to introduce local residents to the
online virtual yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   PerfectYardsale is only available to residents of Atlanta, where
the service is currently being test-marketed. Sellers post the item
on the Web site and prospective buyers can decide how much they're
willing to pay. Buyers name their price and the service will try to
match them with a seller willing to part with the item for that
price.
</P>
<P>
   The site is part of Priceline.com, the Web site where buyers
decide how much they are willing to pay for a variety of items
ranging from airline tickets to long distance phone service.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the concert is designed to send metro-Atlanta
residents plowing through attics, basements and closets to find
some classy goods to add to the inventory of the fledgling site.
</P>
<P>
   PerfectYardsale is still settling details such as how tickets
will be allocated to sellers, but items put up for bid will
probably have to carry a $75 or greater price tag. More details,
including the date of the performance, will be available later this
month.

PUTIN'S TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In testimony earlier this week to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described a recent
three-hour conversation with Russia's new president, Vladimir
Putin. She found him businesslike and pragmatic but cautioned that
the jury is still out on his democratic intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she warned Putin that Moscow will be held
responsible for Andrei Babitsky, the Radio Liberty reporter who was
detained by Russian forces in Chechnya on Jan. 16 and shown in a
suspicious videotape 18 days later being handed over to a masked
man who was described as a Chechen field commander. A second
dubious videotape turned up Wednesday, purporting to show the
reporter in Chechen hands.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky had earned a reputation as a courageous war
correspondent whose dispatches from behind Chechen lines often
contradicted the Kremlin's version of events. His colleagues and
his wife fear that he was beaten and perhaps killed while in
Russian hands. They suspect that the official story _ of Babitsky
consenting to be exchanged for three Russian soldiers _ is a crude
disinformation operation mounted by the FSB, the security services
that succeeded the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Statements about Babitsky from Russian officials have been not
merely evasive and illogical, but suggestive of a certain malice.
One ominous undercurrent of their remarks is to assert that since
he is no longer in Russian custody, his fate cannot be Moscow's
responsibility. Even more ominous is the implication that if he
turns up dead, the fault will lie with his beloved Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Andrei Babitsky signifies not only an abuse of one
Russian citizen's human rights and contempt for freedom of the
press. If Russian security forces murdered an independent
journalist and tried to blame it on the Chechens, Western
democracies will have to recognize in that crime the signature of a
police state.
</P>
<P>
   Putin should be told that if he does not produce Babitsky within
the next few days, the jury of democratic nations will come in with
an unfavorable verdict on his democratic credentials.

MONITORING GENE STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many devastating diseases are caused in whole or in part by
genes that are defective or even absent. While medical researchers
have found non-genetic ways to keep a disease like cystic fibrosis
at least temporarily at bay, they yearn to treat this and other
ailments by correcting the basic genetic flaw.
</P>
<P>
   But gene therapy may be at a turning point. After years of
experiments with no clear successes, the whole approach is under
scrutiny because a young patient died in a trial he should not have
been participating in.
</P>
<P>
   It would be regrettable if the current review in Washington of
how such trials are monitored leads to a broad moratorium on this
line of research. Scientists expressed that concern this week after
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center suspended a gene-therapy trial
with hemophilia patients and a cystic-fibrosis research foundation
halted enrollment into its gene-therapy trials. Unlike a Beth
Israel gene-therapy cancer trial that was stopped last year after
three deaths, the trial for hemophilia had no such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Because gene therapy is so new and often relies on viruses to
transport normal genes into target cells, there is more than usual
concern that researchers not cut any procedural corners. But
corners were cut, with a tragic result, in a trial at the
University of Pennsylvania last fall. An 18-year-old boy with a
rare, gene-based liver disease died after his body was overwhelmed
by a virus serving as a transporter of genes. An investigation
showed experimenters had broken rules of the trial's protocol and
not gained genuine informed consent from the boy or his family.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, the procedures of all such trials should be
reviewed constantly, and the federal government might be wise to
tighten the requirements for reporting on ongoing experiments. But
it would be a grievous mistake to stop gene-therapy trials that
have not had problems. Properly conducted experiments could still
lead the way to breathtaking advances against diseases that strike
cruelly at the building blocks of life.

 &HT;    CDC HEAD REMOVES TOP OFFICIAL, VOWS TOP-TO-BOTTOM REVIEW
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE and M.A.J. McKENNA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention told a congressional panel Thursday that he was
ordering a top-to-bottom review of his agency and removing the
chief of a division blamed for deceptive accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fiscal management capability has not kept pace with the
growth in our scientific responsibilities,'' CDC director Jeffrey
P. Koplan acknowledged as he outlined his response to charges that
his agency misled Congress on how it was spending its money.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan acknowledged that ``preliminary analyses'' of fiscal 1999
expenditures indicated that some of the funds appropriated for
researching hantavirus, a fatal respiratory disease that broke out
in the Southwest in 1993, were used to study other viruses, such as
Ebola and Nipah.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a federal inspection turned up a similar diversion of
funds that Congress had designated for chronic fatigue syndrome
research.
</P>
<P>
   At a generally friendly House Appropriations subcommittee
hearing, Koplan announced that he had removed one of the central
figures in the controversy, Brian Mahy, who had been director of
the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``we are seeking new leadership for our viral
disease programs,'' Koplan announced that in the interim that
division would be led by James LeDuc, a virologist with 25 years'
experience. LeDuc is currently an official at the agency's National
Center for Infectious Disease.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials declined to offer specifics about Mahy, although
they said he was still with the agency. ``It is unclear where he is
going to be at CDC,'' Koplan said in an interview after the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the personnel change, Koplan's action plan
includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A review by an outside firm of CDC's fiscal management
processes to be completed in six months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring CDC program managers to review all 133 programs and
projects ``to make sure there are no other areas of concern.''
Koplan said that officials would have 90 days to ``fully and openly
identify'' areas where Congress might have been given faulty
spending data.
</P>
<P>
   _ An audit by the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers(cq)
of the hantavirus expenditures, with a follow-up audit of the rest
of the programs in the National Center for Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the subcommittee,
had called for a public showdown on the controversy a week ago. But
at the hearing Thursday, he applauded the Koplan reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very satisfied that you have taken this matter very
seriously, that you have a very well-thought-out plan to address
it, and that it will be abated and corrected and that it won't
happen in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, some other members of the panel expressed concern about
the reappearance of CDC's credibility problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back to where I'm losing confidence again,'' Rep. Jay
Dickey, R-Ark., told Koplan.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, asked if the misleading information
given Congress was ``intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've clearly had a failure to communicate,'' Koplan told the
panel. ``I think people just weren't thinking in their rush to do
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, that's all it is,'' Bonilla said. ``Let's hope that
people didn't _ maliciously might be too strong a word _ but try to
sneak around and do this behind people's back knowing it was a
wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps even more decisive action on your part would be
appropriate down the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan skipped much of his detailed discussion of his agency's
$3.5 billion budget request to deal with the controversy. But he
was upbeat after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with the committee's interest in us as a
public health agency,'' Koplan said. ``The meeting today was very
productive and helpful. they indicated their support of us. I
expect to get good support on our 2001 budget proposal.''

&HT;     FORBES' WITHDRAWAL LIKELY TO AID BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush appears to be in the best
position to benefit from publishing magnate Steve Forbes' departure
Thursday from the Republican presidential race, according to some
political analysts and party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, desperately battling Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in South
Carolina, which holds its primary Feb. 19, had already declared
himself ``the conservative in the race.'' His campaign welcomed the
endorsement Thursday of several Forbes supporters in South Carolina
and Forbes' campaign manager in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without doubt Bush is the major beneficiary,'' said Dale
Foreman, Republican chairman in the state of Washington. Bush's
message of tax cuts and his opposition to McCain's proposal for
overhauling the campaign finance system resonates better with the
strong conservatives who backed Forbes, Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Forbes had a ``grassroots following in
Washington'' and that ``grassroots people understand McCain's
campaign finance reform benefits big unions and Democrats, and
hurts Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, who is officially neutral in the race, said Forbes
could have won as much as 20 percent of the vote in Washington's
Feb. 29 primary and March 7 caucuses _ votes that Foreman predicted
would now go to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' departure, combined with conservative activist Gary
Bauer's exit last week, may well leave a void for hardline
conservative voters, many of them fundamentalist Christians who
view social issues such as abortion as crucial.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of them also are comfortable with Bush,
who in a December candidates' debate declared Jesus to be his
favorite philosopher. Exit polls at the Iowa caucuses Jan. 24
showed that a plurality of voters identifying themselves as
Christian conservatives voted for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the Palmetto Poll in South Carolina showed
Forbes with about 2 percent of the vote. David Woodard, director of
the poll and political science professor at Clemson University,
said the impact of Forbes quitting has less to do with his numbers
than his television ads.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes had aired ads attacking Bush's record as Texas governor.
One featured a Texas anti-tax advocate accusing Bush of violating a
no-new-taxes pledge made during his first gubernatorial campaign in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main significance (of Forbes withdrawal) is he won't have
these negative ads attacking Bush,'' Woodard said. ``They were
pretty harsh, and they could have damaged Bush when coupled with
McCain's negative ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, whose platform consisted of strong opposition to
abortion and a call for a flat tax instead of the current
graduated-tax system, formally left the race at an emotion-filled
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of himself, he said, ``The messenger may have gotten a
bit tripped up, battered in the electoral process. But if the
message is good, then you can't regret making the effort '' A
wooden campaigner, he admitted that he had ``charismatic
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Forbes declined to endorse anyone else. Bush issued a
brief statement saying, ``I appreciate Steve Forbes fighting for
what he believes in. Steve fought for conservative principles and
cultural change. His ideas on taxes, education, and medical savings
accounts were bold and imaginative.''
</P>
<P>
   To court conservative voters, Bush has endorsed the GOP
platform's strong anti-abortion stance and pushed his plan for a
$483 billion tax cut. But at the same time, he has styled himself a
``compassionate conservative'' who advocates reaching out to
constituencies, including Hispanics, not traditionally in the
Republican camp.
</P>
<P>
   He has declined to commit himself, if nominated, to picking an
anti-abortion running mate or, if elected, to appointing
anti-abortion judges. These stances have left some hardliners wary
of Bush's conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who had been a Forbes supporter, said Bush
could benefit from Forbes' withdrawal but not without significant
gestures to win conservative support. He said of the governor,
``He's moving in that direction. I hope it's sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Mark Miller, executive director of the
moderate Republican Leadership Council, said he hopes Bush ``will
see that victory lies in the center and not the far right.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Forbes, the son of publishing giant Malcolm Forbes, who created
Forbes magazine, spent about $32 million of his own money on the
current race. In his failed 1996 bid for the GOP nomination, he
shelled out $37.4 million, also from his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   His best showing this year came in the Iowa caucuses, where he
garnered 30 percent of the vote for a second-place finish against
Bush's 41 percent. McCain did not compete in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes got trounced in the New Hampshire primary Feb. 1 where he
came in third with 13 percent of the vote behind McCain, who won
with 49 percent, and Bush, who got 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Delaware on Feb. 8, Forbes came in third again with 20
percent, five points behind McCain who did no campaigning there. In
1996, Forbes won the Delaware primary. This time, Bush won with 51
percent.

 &HT;    Equifax buys direct marketing unit
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Equifax, one of the big three companies in the
consumer credit information business, is moving into direct
marketing with a $260 million acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company announced Thursday that it agreed to
buy the direct marketing unit of R.L. Polk &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax's credit data and the direct marketing information will
be kept separate, said Tom Chapman, Equifax's chairman and chief
executive officer. ``We'll continue to do the right thing with
data, just like we've always done.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts reacted positively to the announcement, and the stock
gained 43 3/4 cents to $21.93 3/4 on slightly heavier than normal
volume. The stock had been drifting lower since June, hitting a
52-week low of $19.87 1/2 on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people look at this stock, they're looking for growth,
and this is a strategy for growth,'' said David Easthope of Raymond
James.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of just buying back stock, Equifax is actually going
to acquire more products and customers, and it's going to
cross-sell its products to that customer base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will provide Equifax with a number of lifestyle and
consumer databases, the largest of which covers 105 million
households, along with ``a wealth of knowledge, expertise and a
company with a great reputation,'' said Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the R.L. Polk unit as a provider of marketing
information services will complement Equifax's strengths, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition also will enhance growth opportunities in
Equifax's North American information services operation, Chapman
said. Sales were flat in that unit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Easthope said the acquisition will allow Equifax to provide a
more comprehensive view of consumer behavior. ``Equifax's customers
can target potential customers more effectively,'' he said. ``They
can isolate the potential longtime and most profitable customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Equifax will pay Southfield, Mich.-based and privately held R.
L. Polk about $260 million in cash for a unit that's expected to
have sales of $165 million for the 12 months ending March 31.
Equifax had sales of $1.77 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 R. L. Polk employees are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the management team and employees to remain, and we
look forward to welcoming them to Equifax,'' said Lee Kennedy,
Equifax's president and chief operating officer.

BRITISH TROOPS TAKE OVER SOME FRENCH PEACEKEEPING DUTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ British peacekeeping forces took over
guard duties on a bridge in the ethnically divided town of
Mitrovica in northern Kosovo Thursday, replacing French troops that
had been accused of failing to protect ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the British, some 150 men from the Royal Green
Jackets regiment who are based in central Kosovo, is the latest
attempt by peacekeepers to ensure security and reduce tension in
the area that was the scene of bloody riots last week. During an
all-night rampage, angry Serbs took to the streets in retaliation
for the deaths of two Serbs who had been killed in a bus ambush.
</P>
<P>
   While the French commanders will continue to be in charge of
overall security, the British will patrol the bridge, which has
also been the scene of recent clashes. Angry Albanians, who accused
the French of favoring the Serbs, threw stones, bottles and
grenades at the French troops on the bridge last week, forcing them
to answer with tear gas and percussion grenades.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Jackets, who have extensive experience in urban
patrolling and civil unrest from serving in Northern Ireland, have
achieved some of the best results among all the peacekeepers; in
Pristina they reduced crime significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Their deployment will inevitably bring comparisons with the
French, who have been blamed by local Albanians and the media for
not helping those attacked last week, and also by the Serbs, who
said the French had done little to deter the Albanian grenade
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As criticism of the French grew, the commander of the
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, German Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, issued a
statement supporting the French. ``I have no doubt that they did
their best in very difficult circumstances,'' he said. He added
that complaints had come from both the Albanian and Serbian
communities, implying that the French had acted impartially.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt also stressed that the peacekeeping force was one
force. ``There is no French KFOR,'' he said. ``There is only one
KFOR. The troops of all 36 nations that have volunteered for this
force stand shoulder to shoulder as brothers in arms, and I have
full confidence in them. A criticism of one is a criticism of all
of us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A French Defense Ministry official also defended the troops'
performance. ``Everyone knows the French contingent is in the most
delicate of positions in Kosovo, in between two hostile
communities,'' said Jean-Francois Bureau, a spokesman in Paris,
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no favoritism by France,'' he continued. ``Our troops
act scrupulously according to NATO guidelines. The situation is not
calm and it is getting worse, but French authorities are determined
to obtain results.''
</P>
<P>
   The British were diplomatic about the deployment of the Green
Jackets. ``I think it is widely understood that the British have
experience of patrolling urban areas and in dealing with civil
unrest,'' said the British spokesman in Pristina, Warrant Officer
Mark Cox. ``Not to say that the French don't have that, every unit
that comes out to Kosovo goes through preparation training. But
when it comes to infantry units, most of our men have been in
Northern Ireland in the not too distant past.''
</P>
<P>
   But one KFOR spokesman said the French and the British had
argued over the number of British to be deployed, a hint perhaps of
injured French pride. A company of German troops, as well as
reinforcements of Danish and Belgian troops from the surrounding
area, were brought in last week to assist the French.

 &HT;    Mohawk Industries bests profit forecast
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mohawk Industries beat analysts' estimates by a penny
with a 3 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit.
</P>
<P>
   The world's second-largest carpet maker said Thursday that it
earned $40.2 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with $39.1
million, or 64 cents a share, before one-time charges. Sales rose 4
percent to $775.5 million, up from $746.9 million in the year-ago
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, Ga.-based Mohawk Industries was expected to earn 69
cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The company beat expectations even though there were four fewer
shipping days in the quarter compared with the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   The entire carpet industry enjoyed a strong 1999. Shaw
Industries, for example, recently reported a 28 percent increase in
profit, before charges. The Dalton, Ga.-based company is the
largest U.S. carpet maker.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the solid showings, stocks have suffered considerably.
Shares of Shaw Industries and Mohawk Industries have lost about 40
percent of their value in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Mohawk Industries closed at $22.18 3/4, up 43 3/4 cents. Shaw
Industries closed at $11.81 1/4, down 81 1/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street is looking at all of the down sides of the
interest rate concerns and not looking at any upsides of the
companies,'' said analyst Lorraine Miller of SunTrust Equitable
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   With such a focus on a slowdown in housing starts, Miller said,
investors are overlooking the main driver of the carpet business.
``About 85 percent of this industry is replacement-oriented,'' she
said. ``The business is not as cyclical as it has been viewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Home furnishing in general has suffered as ``myopic'' investors
rush to technology stocks instead, said Frank O'Neill, publisher of
Floor Focus magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaw and Mohawk are good, solid companies. There's no other
reason for the stock to be so deflated,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   If Wall Street can overcome its interest rate jitters, there are
bright spots to notice this year in the floor-covering industry,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales, which are dominated by Shaw Industries, Mohawk
Industries and Beaulieu of America, are expected to grow 3 percent
to 4 percent this year. Even if residential sales slow, a recovery
in the commercial side of the business will help offset that,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   A new focus on higher-priced products, such as hardwoods and
laminates, should boost their business.
</P>
<P>
   Recent price increases for carpet fiber could help
manufacturers, too _ if they're successful at passing the increase
on to customers, Miller said. All four major nylon producers
announced price increases ranging from 6 percent to 12 percent,
effective Jan. 1. So far, carpet mills have increased prices 5
percent to 7 percent for products that are being shipped now,
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will look at price increases as a ``litmus test'' to
see if the big carpet makers can act like the oligopoly they are,
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has typically happened is that carpet mills would raise
prices, then through the course of year give a lot of that price
increase back to customers,'' Miller said. ``If they can maintain
margins, and not get into price wars at the slightest downturn in
demand, investors may take notice.''

   NETRICH-CHARITY (Seattle) _ The Internet has created a spate of
young millionaires, and many of them are turning their attention to
philanthropy in their own unique, hands-on ways. They describe
their activities as ``venture philanthropy,'' modeled on their
business experiences, and some promote the concept of
``e-philanthropy,'' which involves finding ways to make charitable
giving easier much as ``e-commerce'' is designed to make buying
easier. Rather than giving to traditional charities, they see
themselves as ``investing'' in programs that will bring about
long-term change in such fields as education and the environment.

   AFGHAN-HIJACK (Stansted, England) _ The four-day hijacking of an
Afghan airliner at Stansted airport ended peacefully Thursday
morning, with no weapons fired and no injuries to the 150 or so
people aboard the plane. But no sooner had the British government
solved that crisis than it found itself embroiled in another: how
to cope with the rush of hijackers and hostages from the plane who
now say they want to stay in Britain. Twenty-one people have been
arrested in connection with the hijacking, the government said. And
at least 60 passengers, along with 14 dependents, are seeking
political asylum in Britain, apparently in an effort to flee the
repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan. By Sarah Lyall.

   INDONESIA-SUHARTO (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ In what appeared to be
a serious new effort to prosecute Indonesia's former president,
Suharto, the government named him for the first time on Thursday as
a suspect in a widening corruption investigation and summoned him
for questioning on Monday. Suharto's lawyers immediately responded
that he was too sick to attend. The former president is 78 and was
hospitalized twice last year after a stroke. By Seth Mydans.

its head, the battle in the New York Senate race has been focused
nearly entirely upstate in recent weeks. Both Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Rudy Giuliani are considered to be carpetbaggers up
there; both are spending sizable amounts of money in television and

every elected Republican official across New York. And there are

King, who says he hasn't seen such electricity around a challenger
since Ronald Reagan. By Richard Perez-Pena.

McCAIN OUTLINES EDUCATION AGENDA 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ Presidential hopeful John McCain laid out an
education agenda Thursday in a speech larded with pokes at
teachers' unions, Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plan backs favorite Republican points such as merit pay
for teachers, charter schools and vouchers to allow poor parents to
shift their children out of poorly performing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, primarily a compilation of items McCain has
discussed regularly in his campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination, were also intended to prove his conservative bona fides
in advance of the South Carolina primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must never let our national expectations or our state and
local standards be corrupted by those who preach the faithless
gospel of mediocrity _ those who would lower the bar of academic
performance so that no one be held accountable for failure,''
McCain said in a speech at the University of South Carolina at
Spartanburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our schools must focus on expanding minds rather than
protecting union jobs and coddling student egos,'' said McCain, who
conceded he had been ``less than an `A' student.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-esteem is not created by lowering expectations.
Self-esteem is created by achieving high standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for giving teachers ``the power to get violent
juveniles out of the classroom'' without worry about lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he and Bush, the other main contender for the
Republican presidential nomination, have a ``serious difference''
on school choice because the Texas governor would finance vouchers
from existing federal public-education funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we should fund choice by eliminating corporate
welfare doled out to the oil and gas industry, ethanol grants and
sugar barons,'' McCain said. Ending those programs, he said, could
finance vouchers for almost 1 million children ``from the neediest
families in the poorest performing schools.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also criticized Bush for giving schools three years to
shape up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should begin immediately,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain faulted Gore, the Democratic front-runner and vice
president, and President Clinton for opposing vouchers altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to appease union bosses, President Clinton and Vice
President Gore are perfectly willing to keep poor underprivileged
children locked in failing public schools, while they send their
own kids to the most exclusive, most expensive private schools in
Washington, D.C.,'' McCain said. ``That's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has long advocated merit pay for highly rated teachers
and filled in a blank by saying he would seek $500 million annually
to pass on to states prepared to match the program
dollar-for-dollar. Teachers' unions oppose merit pay, contending it
would be doled out to favorites of local administrators.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he also would challenge businesses, ``which need
better-qualified workers in this high tech age,'' to participate in
the merit pay program. He gave no details but added: ``This isn't a
federal mandate on private enterprises or on the states. It is a
national challenge issued by the American people for the sake of
our children. It will help us keep good teachers in the classroom
and ... keep you child's education in the hands of someone who know
your child's name.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said it must be ``a top national priority for every state
to devise education goals, benchmarks and tangible measures of
success.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator, however, faulted Bush and Gore for seeking to tie
schools' continued access to federal funds to ``federally approved
standards, and they would both continue to allow bureaucrats to
determine how federal funds should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the path to reform,'' McCain insisted, ``it's a
promise of continued failure.''

SOCIALIST CHARTS MIDDLE WAY FOR CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ With a month to go before he becomes the first
Socialist to lead Chile since Salvador Allende, President-elect
Ricardo Lagos is showing a strong streak of independence from his
party leadership and has appointed a relatively conservative,
U.S.-educated economic team that promises to keep down budget
deficits and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that his stature was diminished by a campaign that often
lacked direction and by the narrowness of his victory in January,
Lagos has worked hard to project a take-charge image. He has
quickly appointed his cabinet and announced the broad outlines of
an ambitious agenda that will focus on crime, housing and
education.
</P>
<P>
   He has broken new ground by appointing four women _ more than
ever before _ to the cabinet, obliging senior aides to disclose
their personal holdings as an anti-corruption measure and promising
to introduce a campaign finance law that would limit contributions
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   His governing style concentrates decision-making within a small
circle of aides known more for their technical abilities than
ideology. And he has shown that he will carefully balance the often
contradictory demands of his varied constituencies, ranging from
leftist Socialist Party stalwarts to the conservative business
community.
</P>
<P>
   Rising prices for copper _ Chile's primary export _ and a recent
pickup of economic growth after a yearlong recession have come at
just the right moment for Lagos. After he is inaugurated March 11,
he should be able to increase social spending without producing
inflationary budget deficits or major new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the Santiago daily El Mercurio this week, a
political writer, Blanca Arthur, said that Lagos, a 61-year-old
lawyer and economist ``has shown that he is secure and confident in
himself.'' She added, ``He has shown the disposition to conduct
presidential authority without submitting himself to party
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after his election Lagos consulted with the leaders
of the Christian Democratic and Socialist parties that constitute
his governing coalition, but he ignored their preferences. His
cabinet is heavily weighted with technocrats who are young and not
closely tied to any party. In a clear act of political revenge, he
ignored the conservative wing of the Christian Democratic Party in
his appointments after its leaders essentially sat out the
campaign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before Lagos left this week for a vacation at his country house
outside Santiago, he announced almost a barrage of policy plans.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would personally lead a stepped-up anti-crime program
that would coordinate the activities of the police with community
groups and focus more attention on drug addiction. He pledged to
set in motion a vast public housing program that would construct 1
million units in 10 years, housing every single person who lives in
shantytowns around the country. His appointed education minister,
Mariana Aylwin, announced that the new government would make a
major effort to reallocate resources to public schools serving
rural and impoverished communities.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Lagos distanced himself during the campaign from
Allende, who was overthrown in a U.S.-backed military coup led by
Gen. Augusto Pinochet in 1973, he has shown himself to be a
moderate as president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has appointed two orthodox economists as his economy and
finance ministers, mindful that business leaders and foreign
investors would be watching. Jose de Gregorio, a conservative
economist educated at MIT and with strong ties to Wall Street, will
oversee energy, mining and fishing as economy minister. And Nicolas
Eyzaguirre, a Harvard-trained economist, will step down as an
executive director of the International Monetary Fund to take over
the finance ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview with El Mercurio this week,
Eyzaguirre said that after creating jobs, the major economic goal
of the new government would be to create a budget surplus quickly.
``This is fundamental to reaffirm the credibility Chile has in
international markets,'' he said. He added that it would be
``undesirable'' for the annual inflation rate to rise above a band
of 2 to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos' most important cabinet appointment was of Jose Miguel
Insulza, currently the chief of staff of President Eduardo Frei, as
interior minister, a position that combines law enforcement and
vice presidential duties. Insulza is a Socialist Party member, but
his long defense of the government's attempts to block General
Pinochet's extradition from Britain to Spain to stand trial on
human rights charges has made him anathema to the party's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official who will most likely receive the most
attention is Soledad Alvear, a former justice minister, who will be
Lagos' foreign minister. A Christian Democrat, Alvear will fill the
most senior political position of any woman in Chilean history, and
she is already being talked about as a presidential contender in
2005.

 &HT;    Lodging industry gets boost from e-commerce
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While guests may not be ready to toss the brochures,
e-commerce has checked into the lodging industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts, which owns the Holiday Inn and Crowne
Plaza brands, says that online bookings are expected to reach $150
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The chief information officer for Atlanta-based US Franchise
Systems said Internet use by guests has risen so rapidly that the
company recently threw out its old projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge benefit,'' said Steve Jacobs of USFS, which
franchises the Microtel Inns &AMP; Suites, Hawthorn Suites and Best
Inns and Suites brands. ``The Internet is a very viable and
critical part of the day-to-day operations.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't always the case.
</P>
<P>
   Like many businesses, the lodging industry found consumers were
often hesitant to give credit card information over the Internet.
While consumers might use the Internet to visit a hotel site, they
would pick up the phone to make reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors also hindered growth.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers looking to make airplane reservations are most
concerned about price and time. But hotel guests want to know about
amenities and ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a lot of questions about hotels,'' said Fiona
Swerdlow, an analyst who follows digital commerce for Jupiter
Communications, a research firm. ``You can certainly convey some of
the information online, but its more difficult to express.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it's clear that e-commerce is going to have a big
impact on the lodging industry. In 1999, consumers spent $4.2
billion on the Internet for travel-related purchases, including
airline tickets, rental cars, hotels and cruises. That is expected
to grow to $6.3 billion this year and $16.6 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of the travel-related purchases are still air.
However, that is beginning to change,'' said Swerdlow. By 2003,
hotels, either through individual sites or third-party sites, are
projected to command 25 percent of all dollars spent online for
travel, up from 13 percent in 1998, according to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass PLC, which owns Bass Hotels &AMP;
Reports, recently told shareholders in London that online bookings
had ``exploded.'' The company expects Internet bookings to reach
$1.5 billion in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Also poised to gain from Internet-related bookings are small,
independent hotel companies and bed and breakfasts that may not
have the big bucks for fancy marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Claudia's Manor in Savannah's historic district
had a Web site before the doors to the 1906 refurbished mansion
even opened and responses have come from as far away as Italy.
``We've gotten a terrific response,'' said co-owner Larry Collins.
``We just decided this would be one of the better approaches for
us.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY,' starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis
Quaid, James Woods and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 160
minutes). Stone's brawling, hyper-macho professional football film
has enough in-the-thick-of-it playing-field action to satisfy the
fantasies of most armchair players. In the style of Stone's ``Wall
Street,'' the movie is also a crude morality play that pits the old
ways against the new, with the veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Pacino)
embodying tradition and a young hotshot quarterback, Willie Beamen
(Foxx), the new. Although the acting is uneven (Diaz is
disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are
shamelessly ``Rocky''-ish, the movie delivers a credible,
action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports
as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture (Stephen
Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,' starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd.
Directed by Stephan Elliott (R, 105 minutes). McGregor is a British
surveillance expert and Judd the serial-killing femme fatale he
falls in love with (while observing her kill a boyfriend) in this
ludicrous psycho-thriller. As McGregor's character, known only as
the Eye, follows the object of his obsession from city to city, the
movie tries futilely to capture some of the mystique of
``Vertigo.'' But the film, by the director best known for ``The
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' is so garish,
disjointed and incoherent that it feels like an extended music
video posing as a movie (Holden).
</P>

   `FANTASIA/2000,' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Levine,
Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and
Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial
version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and
classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the
original film (the wonderful ``Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring
Mickey Mouse). Despite the science fiction title and the Imax-size
screen on which it is shown, ``Fantasia/2000'' is more
backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are
``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to
the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to the music of Gershwin, and
the finale (set to Stravinsky's ``Firebird'' Suite), in which a
cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating,
destroying and renewing the planet's life forms. Celebrity
introductions lend the film the feel of a deluxe corporate
promotion. At the Sony Imax Theater (Holden). &QL;

   `GIRL, INTERRUPTED,' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.
Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being
several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who
oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen,
a college-age girl who lands in a Massachusetts mental institution
in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on
Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ryder has the
courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the small,
introspective movie is nearly stolen by Jolie as a charismatic,
brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's best friend
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GREEN MILE,' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the
death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments,
the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed
more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock.
Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble
acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man
(Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the
film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Hanks, as
a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's
redundant to say so (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GUN SHY,' starring Liam Neeson, Oliver Platt, Jose Zuniga and
Sandra Bullock. Written and directed by Eric Blakeney (R, 102
minutes). Last spring saw both a film comedy (``Analyze This'') and
a cable series (``The Sopranos'') about gangsters forcing
themselves to unload to a shrink. This year, in ``Gun Shy,'' we get
a shaken undercover Fed, Charlie Mayo (Neeson), seeing a
psychiatrist on the down-low. Charlie, a wreck who has lost his
nerve after he was exposed during an undercover operation, is
assigned to a job that involves his acting as an organized-crime
envoy. He moves between the preening Fidel (Zuniga), a yuppie
Colombian thug, and Fulvio (Platt), whose vulgar pride in his
violent streak is perverse. Blakeney has come up with one of the
most subtle and inspired comedies you'll see this year in his
feature-film writing and directing debut (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `HOLY SMOKE,' starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed
by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously
through North Africa as a young hippie mother in ``Hideous Kinky,''
Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong
young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother
coaxes her home, where a ``cult exiter'' named P.J. (Keitel) is
waiting to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru. But as the film
moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more
serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't
help that Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Keitel's P.J.
looking overmatched (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a
middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a
movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the
boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with
the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian
commune who took up Carter's cause and all but eliminating his
heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor
characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man
heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still
inspiring (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `ISN'T SHE GREAT,' starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane, Stockard
Channing, David Hyde Pierce and John Cleese. Directed by Andrew
Bergman (R, 90 minutes). In this bio-pic, Midler portrays the
author Jacqueline Susann, who took the lurid pulp genre to a new,
sweaty level. No one is more suited to playing a tease of a diva
than Midler, who can wring more comedy out of operatic
self-absorption than anyone else. And Lane, who plays Irving
Mansfield, Susann's husband, promoter and biggest fan, is a spark
plug: His voice shows up before he does. Yet in this adaptation of
the material, Susann's life is flattened, made campy and cute. Sly
hostility seems to be a facet of the screenwriter Paul Rudnick's
talent. But Rudnick and Bergman have so defanged ``Isn't She
Great'' that it's like watching a sketch from the old ``Carol
Burnett Show'' that has mildewed (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `PLAY IT TO THE BONE,' starring Woody Harrelson, Antonio
Banderas and Lolita Davidovich. Directed by Ron Shelton (R, 124
minutes). This screwball sports comedy stars Harrelson (with a
shaved head) and Banderas as fading middleweight boxers and best
friends summoned at the last minute to fight each other as the
opening act for a Las Vegas heavyweight bout. The formulaic road
movie follows them with their pal and mutual ex-girlfriend
(Davidovich) on their wisecracking way from Los Angeles to Las
Vegas, where they fight a brutal match. The dialogue has sass, and
the filmmaker's jaundiced vision of the professional boxing world
is very knowing, but the relationships don't track (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SCREAM 3,' starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courteney
Cox Arquette. Directed by Wes Craven (R, 116 minutes). At this
point it goes without saying that the ``Scream'' movies are like
episodes of ``Scooby Doo.'' Like the others, ``Scream 3'' belongs
on the Cartoon Network. This time for a better reason: The film is
funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more
satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jolts to
the spine. Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real
competition is not the recent hit films ``The Blair Witch Project''
or ``The Sixth Sense,'' but rather ``Scream'' itself. ``Scream 3''
doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much a personality
show as it is a slasher film (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,' starring Matt Damon, Jude Law,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written
and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this
glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of ``The English
Patient'' was no fluke, Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually
charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian
murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Damon as the
dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the
English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic
magnetism. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a
fine character actress, while Blanchett makes the delirious most of
her role as a needy American post-debutante. As the story's odious
playboy-snob, Hoffman is scene-stealingly wonderful. Gorgeously
photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITUS,' starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming,
Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R,
160 minutes). Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who
created transfixing stage pictures in ``The Lion King'' and ``Juan
Darien,'' has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, ``Titus
Andronicus,'' into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge
enacted throughout history. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic
as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a
devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation.
Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back.
Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting
styles don't mesh, Taymor's vision is realized with a shattering
force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome with
Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   FILM SERIES:
</P>
<P>
   `THE AMERICAN PLACE: LANDSCAPE IN THE EARLY WESTERN (AND A FEW
LATER CLASSICS).' An opportunity for a new look at the Old West is
at hand at the Museum of Modern Art, where a monthlong series
highlighted by early westerns is in progress. Spanning the history
of the genre, the series features more than 50 films in 30
programs, including works that extend from Edwin Porter, D.W.
Griffith, Thomas H. Ince, John Ford, Charles Chaplin and Allan Dwan
to Victor Fleming, Victor Seastrom, Sam Peckinpah, Mel Brooks,
Clint Eastwood and Jim Jarmusch. This weekend is highlighted by
``Biograph's Western Heroines: Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh and Blanche
Sweet.'' This program of four films, to be shown at 2:30 p.m.
Friday and at 5 Saturday, consists of four films, the first three
starring Sweet, who was Griffith's most spirited western heroine.
These three are 15-minute 1912 films: ``The Goddess of Sagebrush
Gulch'' and ``The God Within,'' both directed by Griffith, and ``An
Outcast Among Outcasts,'' directed by Wilfred Lucas. The fourth
feature is Griffith's 30-minute ``Battle at Elderbush Gulch''
(1913), with Marsh and Gish among the settlers besieged by Indians
and saved by the cavalry. On all four films the cinematographer was
Billy Bitzer, Griffith's longtime collaborator in the development
of filmmaking technique. The screenings will have a piano
accompaniment. Continuing through Feb. 24 at the Museum of Modern
Art, the series is free with museum admission: $10 for adults,
$6.50 for students and people 65 or older; free for visitors under
16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30
to 8:30 p.m. Screening information: (212) 708-9400 (Lawrence Van
Gelder).

   A Long Way From the Coast
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Near the business center of Williamsburg in Brooklyn
stands a huge, normally empty armory owned by New York state.
Inside the armory is the cabin of an airliner, and inside the cabin
is Ben Stiller, who is having an argument with a flight attendant
who wants him to check an oversize bag that won't fit into the
overhead compartment.
</P>
<P>
   This is the set of ``Meet the Parents,'' a comedy being filmed
for release this fall by Universal Pictures (domestically) and
DreamWorks (internationally). The producer is Jane Rosenthal,
Robert De Niro's partner in Tribeca Productions, and on this frigid
February morning, she is staying close to the tiny space heater
that is providing all the warmth in the cavernous building.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a need for studio facilities in New
York,'' says Rosenthal, pulling her parka tighter around her
shoulders. ``Kaufman-Astoria is really it in terms of large stages,
and they're booked.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second feature Rosenthal has filmed in the Marcy
Avenue Armory, after last year's ``Flawless.'' Like ``Flawless,''
``Meet the Parents'' is another bid to move De Niro beyond the
urban, macho films with which he has been identified. In this
nightmare comedy he's a retired CIA officer whose daughter (Teri
Polo of ``Felicity'') brings home her brand-new fiance ( Stiller).
The former spy's suspicions are aroused far beyond the normal
limits of parental concern, and he has all the high-tech equipment
to indulge them to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the jetliner, the armory contains a full-scale
mock-up of a two-story suburban home as well as several smaller
sets. Why go to so much trouble building all this in Brooklyn, when
many filmmakers would simply repair to the more accommodating
facilities in Hollywood to shoot their interiors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you get a certain flavor just by shooting in New
York,'' Rosenthal says. ``You have so many extraordinary actors who
will come in and do day parts because they're on Broadway and
working here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to do it at home is nice, too,'' adds Rosenthal,
who lives in Manhattan with her husband, Craig Hatkoff, a real
estate developer, and two young children. ``Why should I have to
commute 3,000 miles to go to work? Bob and I would keep getting
calls from people saying, `We've got a great project for you,' and
usually it would be some dark, quirky macho movie. I wanted to do
more comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   After joining the producer Nancy Tannenbaum on the film,
Rosenthal altered it from a broad farce to ``more of a
reality-based comedy,'' she says. ``We got involved with Jay
Roach,'' director of the ``Austin Powers'' films, ``and oversaw a
new rewrite. Then Ben Stiller came into it, and here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the jetliner Stiller is still exploding, as he feels his
way through a number of wildly different interpretations of the
scene under Roach's open, accommodating direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a performance-based film with a great cast,'' Roach
says. ``The challenge is to create an environment they can do their
best stuff in. So what I do is surround myself with really funny
people and make sure the camera is there with lots of film.''

</P>
<P>
   The entire staff of Rialto Pictures consists of only three
people, but the company has one of the most dazzling talent rosters
in the business, one that includes Federico Fellini, Carol Reed and
Jean Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   Dead they may be, but you can't have everything.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Bruce Goldstein, who heads the revival film program
at the Film Forum in Manhattan, and the entertainment lawyer
Adrienne Halpern, along with Mike Thomas on the West Coast, Rialto
specializes in rescuing classic foreign films that have fallen out
of distribution. Since the company was created three years ago, it
has distributed ``Nights of Cabiria,'' ``Contempt,'' ``The Third
Man,'' ``Peeping Tom'' and ``Grand Illusion,'' all in crisp new
prints made from restored negatives. Next up is the Luis Bunuel
masterpiece ``The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,'' to be
released in May or June, followed this summer by the legendary,
long-unseen French heist film ``Rififi,'' directed by Jules Dassin.
</P>
<P>
   The Rialto program has been made possible, in large part, by
recent changes in copyright law. Because their original
distributors never properly registered them in the United States,
many foreign classics fell out of copyright, allowing opportunistic
video companies to flood the market with poorly duplicated
cassettes. But now, Halpern said, international trade agreements
and new U.S. copyright laws have retroactively restored protection
to most European films.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'd be no reason for us to spend money on these films if
they had to compete with lousy public-domain copies,'' Goldstein
said. But dealing with the legitimate rights owners allows Rialto
to distribute the best available prints, adding up-to-date laser
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about making a killing, but we've played our
films in over 100 cities in the United States,'' Halpern said.
``And it's pretty amazing that a 1957 black-and-white subtitled
film like `Nights of Cabiria' could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said: ``We're looking for the same things distributors
were looking for when these films were first released:
exploitability and names. It's hard to rerelease a film with an
unknown director or star, although I would like to. But now we're
running out of big-name, obvious classics like `The Third Man' and
`Grand Illusion,' and we're veering toward lesser-known stuff.'' In
coming months this will include two movies by France's master of
film noir, Jean-Pierre Melville (``Le Cercle Rouge'' and ``Bob le
Flambeur''), and several other Bunuel films, for his centenary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the public something decent to see,'' Halpern said,
</P>
<P>
   Festival Notes
</P>
<P>
   _ The International Film Festival Rotterdam, which has acquired
a reputation as the most adventurous and innovative of Europe's
smaller festivals, concluded its 29th edition Sunday with the
announcement of three grand prize winners: Lou Ye's ``Suzhou
River,'' from China; Pablo Trapero's ``Mundo Gra,'' from Argentina;
and Katrin Ottarsdottir's ``Bye Bye Bluebird'' from Denmark. Each
film was awarded 10,000 euros (about $10,000) and commercial
distribution in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Luc Besson, whose ``Messenger'' bombed in the United States
but flourished in France, has been named the president of the 2000
Cannes Film Festival Jury. Speculation has begun on the films to be
included in the prestigious competition; one leading contender is
``Esther Kahn,'' the first English-language film by Arnaud
Desplechin (``My Sex Life''), about a Jewish girl (Summer Phoenix)
who dreams of becoming an actress in 18th-century London.

`SALLY HEMINGS': A SENTIMENTAL INTERPRETATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a prominent politician, a widower who had vowed never to
remarry. She was the beautiful, brilliant, socially inferior
mistress he could never acknowledge, despite the many children she
bore him. And at times throughout the three decades of their
illicit love affair, she would toss his own words back at him.
During one nasty lovers' quarrel, she yells, `` `We hold these
truths to be self-evident.' What truths? To whom?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so his words happen to come from the Declaration of
Independence, but ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal'' never lets
details interfere with its generic sentimental romance, its
simplistic interpretation of one of the most complex, fascinating
liaisons in American history.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question something happened between Thomas Jefferson
and his slave, Sally Hemings. Two years ago, a DNA study concluded
that Jefferson was definitely the father of one and very likely all
six of Hemings' children. Just last month, a study released by the
foundation that administers Monticello reached the same conclusion.
Yet when releasing this report, the foundation's president, Daniel
Jordan, astutely captured why the story has been such an enduring
psychological mystery. ``Whether it was love or lust, rape or
romance, no one knows, and it's unlikely anyone will ever know,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the enigma the two-part miniseries tries to sort out.
But all its heavy-handed historical references can't disguise the
film's soap-opera soul. Sam Neill is best in part one, when he
brings Jefferson down from Mount Rushmore and makes him a man with
sexual desires, and with emotional impulses he would rather not
explore.
</P>
<P>
   Sally arrives in Paris as a young maid to Jefferson's daughter,
and before long she is sitting on a bed next to him. He tells her,
``My God, you look exactly like my wife. The resemblance is
uncanny.'' The script would rather not explore that allure either.
It takes another hour before the film gets around to explaining
that Jefferson's wife and Sally were half-sisters. (Martha
Jefferson's father, John Wayles, also fathered Sally, by his slave
Betty Hemings.)
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson tries to resist Sally but can't. Their lifelong
coupling (discreetly shot) begins. He educates her. Tom Paine
dances with her at Versailles. By the time they return to Virginia,
she is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Solidly directed and prettily shot, the miniseries includes
stunning re-creations of Monticello in its various stages of
building. The English actress Carmen Ejogo makes Sally beautiful
and dignified. On the level of banal romantic storytelling, the
film asserts an undeniable pull. Yet these characters carry their
history and legends along, and Tina Andrews' mawkish script doesn't
know what to do with that. Instead of making its case for true love
between Jefferson and Hemings, the miniseries willfully posits the
idea, then reduces the characters to anachronistic cliches.
</P>
<P>
   At least four times, Sally quotes Jefferson's high-minded
writings about equality. Rather than illuminating contradictions in
his attitude toward slavery, she sounds like a woman pouting,
``When are you leaving your wife?'' He hedges, offering the
equivalent of, ``Yes, I know I promised, I just can't do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue includes this moment of pillow talk at Monticello.
``What do I mean to you?'' Sally asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are my own sweet Sally, and we should make the most of the
time that we have,'' says Jefferson. Here is the founding father as
just another slick guy.
</P>
<P>
   A few glimmers of thoughtfulness hint at what a more substantial
script could have done. Jefferson's capacity for self-delusion is
suggested in the way he always refers to Sally as a servant not a
slave.
</P>
<P>
   In the best scene, the pregnant Sally returns from Paris and is
confronted by her angry mother (played with fierce conviction by
Diahann Carroll). ``I made a choice, Mama, the same choice you made
with Master Wayles,'' Sally says. Her mother snaps, ``I didn't have
no choice'' and slaps Sally's face. This all-too-brief scene offers
the only sense that a truly free choice would have been impossible
under the circumstances. And despite some moments of brutality,
slavery seems no more than that, a nagging circumstance that gets
in the way of Thomas and Sally's love.
</P>
<P>
   On the miniseries' second night, Jefferson becomes president,
and the scandalmongering reporter James Callender (overacted by
Rene Auberjonois) writes about the liaison with Sally. Jefferson's
daughter Martha (Mare Winningham), determined to preserve his
reputation, denies what she knows to be true. Yet as Martha's own
husband tells a visitor, in one of the film's few memorable lines,
``Surely you've noticed Monticello is crawling with white slaves.''
None of this seems as important as the way Jefferson and Hemings
enter a sweet old age together, in their fake jowls, puttering
around the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries' flaws have nothing to do with the fusty issue of
fiction distorting fact; drama can invent whatever it likes, as
long as the invention makes sense. But this film ends with a
howler. After Jefferson's death, Sally waves a piece of paper at
Martha and says she was freed years before. She chose to stay with
him. This will be news to historians and is an even bigger problem
dramatically, as ``Sally Hemings'' brings the concept of smart
women, foolish choices, to an entirely new level.

 UNDATED: new level.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the start of ``Homicide: The Movie'' (9 p.m. ET Sunday on
NBC) Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), who led the Baltimore homicide
squad in the canceled series, is running for mayor. As he arrives
at an outdoor news conference among a crush of reporters, the
camera dashes in and out of the chanting crowd, picking out happy
and disgruntled faces, creating an ominous sense of claustrophobia.
Still, it comes as a jolt when Giardello is shot.
</P>
<P>
   For most films, creating that visceral shock might be enough,
but ``Homicide'' does more. Visually, the kinetic camera and
editing capture our national fears about guns, crowds, the
abruptness with which violence can change our sense of the world.
And by the end, the film moves even beyond that visual content to
reveal what always set ``Homicide'' apart from ordinary crime
shows: the series turned ambiguity and thoughtfulness into taut
drama.
</P>
<P>
   This ultimate reunion movie brings back every character who was
ever a regular, even the dead ones. Though it takes too long to
crank up the machinery that reintroduces 19 people, in the end this
is among the finest, most intense dramas ``Homicide'' has ever
created.
</P>
<P>
   As they wait to hear whether Giardello will live, past and
current homicide detectives turn up to help in the investigation.
One of the more tantalizing plot devices is that the heroic
Giardello wanted to legalize drugs, which opens a world of possible
new enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The early segments become a bit plodding as every character gets
the required two-sentence scene that brings viewers up to date.
Mike Kellerman (Reed Diamond) is a private investigator. Kay Howard
(Melissa Leo) has been transferred and tracks down fugitives. Not
very believably, Al's son, Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) has
left the FBI and become a beat cop.
</P>
<P>
   Once past that, the film plays to the series' great strength,
the partnership between Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher), now a
teacher, and his former partner Tim Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who has
handled his sexual identity crisis by taking a leave and going
fishing, carrying a cell phone along.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why I left homicide?'' Pembleton says as he and
Bayliss drive along, as in the old days. Slowly, forcefully,
emphasizing his decision with every word, Pembleton explains,
``Because I could not hear one more confession.'' He is, of course,
saying this to a man whose middle name is confession. Looking back,
when Braugher left several years ago, the series never recovered
creatively.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fontana, the mastermind and an executive producer of
``Homicide,'' has inserted some playful cameos that refer to his
other shows: Ed Begley Jr., a doctor on ``St. Elsewhere,'' turns up
as a belligerent doctor in Baltimore. And there are unexpected plot
twists throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Very near the end, when Pembleton and Bayliss seem to close in
on the would-be assassin, it is clearly too soon for the film to
end. ``Homicide'' then takes two astonishing turns that are as
daring and effective as anything you're likely to see on
television. A tense scene between Bayliss and Pembleton goes to the
heart of the issues ``Homicide'' has always handled so deftly:
moral responsibility, and how little we know other people, even a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The film was beautifully directed by Jean de Segonzac, who began
on ``Homicide'' as a cinematographer and has never gotten enough
public credit for its swirling-camera, textured look. The script
was written by Fontana and longtime ``Homicide'' writers Eric
Overmeyer and James Yoshimura. Their device for bringing back the
dead people wasn't such a great idea; this film was.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion-related art shows keep lining up on the
runway. The latest arrival is ``Hair in African Art and Culture''
at the Museum for African Art through May 28. It's a smashing
creation: generously contoured, rich in detail. It should provide a
box office hit for an institution with a proud scholarly track
record.
</P>
<P>
   The curators, Roy Sieber, professor emeritus at Indiana
University, and Frank Herreman, director of exhibitions at the
museum, have assembled a stimulating mix of objects familiar and
novel, from classic sculptures with exquisitely carved coiffures,
to ivory hairpins and bead-spangled wigs, to a fully equipped
kiosk-size barbershop straight from the streets of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   Field photographs add information throughout and supply the
closest thing to ``live'' hairdos. (Visitors to the show will
presumably make major contributions of their own in that
department.) The result is a shapely visual essay that suggests the
versatile role hair has played in African life, as a status emblem,
an aesthetic medium and an organic material with ritual
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Hairstyles are certainly the focal points of much African
sculpture, as two arresting and very different pieces at the start
of the show suggest. One is a wooden fertility doll from the Kuba
people of Congo. Standing about a foot high, and abstract but for a
hairline cut in shallow relief at the top, it has the swan-neck
profile of a milliner's mannequin.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing a vitrine with this minimalist gem is a spectacularly
florid crest mask from the Cross River area of Nigeria. The face,
with its downcast eyes, looks subdued enough, but the hairdo that
surmounts it aspires to the visionary, with five long, twisted
braids spiraling out into space like snakes from a Medusa head.
</P>
<P>
   This fantastic coiffure, or a modified version of it, once had a
real-life counterpart. It was worn early in the 20th century by
young Cross River women who had entered adulthood. It is one of
many examples of how the shaping of hair has been used to mark
stages in life. The heads of children were often shaved, except for
a small patch of hair covering a vulnerable spot in the skull.
Adolescents who had undergone initiation wore elaborate styles to
advertise their debutante status. Mourners left their hair unkempt,
as a sign of the disorder that a death brings.
</P>
<P>
   Hairstyling was traditionally a communal activity. Designs for
women could takes days, even weeks to finish. Only female relatives
or friends were asked to help with the job, partly so gossip could
be exchanged, but also because hair was regarded as a kind of
controlled substance. Its regenerative properties gave it magical
powers. A stray lock in the wrong hands could be used in
``medicine'' to cause harm.
</P>
<P>
   Coiffures were also badges of group identity. An elite style of
the Mangbetu people of northeastern Congo, in which hair was pulled
back over a kind of conical flared basket, was specific to the
region. It also became an international graphic symbol for Africa
itself, seen on colonial postage stamps and in American art
associated with the Harlem Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The Mangbetu ``look'' was unquestionably a structural tour de
force. But sometimes nature and art are uncooperative, and that's
what wigs are for. There are several in the show, from
Cleopatra-like cascades of braided fiber to a tidy mud-pellet
peruke. Hair accessories also abound: combs with gold handles,
hairpins that double as snuff dispensers, a formidable high-color
dangling ornament from Sudan made of bullet casings.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when an labor-intensive masterpiece was completed,
every effort was made to preserve it. For this reason, elevated
headrests were a crucial item of bedroom furniture, and those seen
in the show represent sculpture at its most inventive. Their format
was common in ancient Egypt but may have had earlier sub-Saharan
prototypes. Two examples from South Africa stand out: one has a
base resembling a tangle of looping vines, very pretty; the other,
carved as part of a man's walking stick, is a travel pillow shaped
like a Keith Haring break dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the symbolic function of hair has changed,
particularly in African cities. There, popular fashions are less
likely to indicate ethnic affiliation or life-stage status than
citizenship in the modern world. Styles, once vital for
generations, come and go overnight, as hand-painted salon signs
attest. Coiffures are no longer collective projects but the work of
professionals. The Ghanian barbershop in the show, though
magnetically painted, is small and cramped, not an easy place to
hang out and chat.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, one of the shop's most prominent decorative
motifs is the American flag, which appears on salon shop signs,
too, along with other references to American culture: men in Nike
sweats, a boy wearing a 1960's Afro. As Kennell Jackson, a
professor at Stanford University, notes in the show's catalog, the
traffic in hairstyles _ braids, extensions, weaves, fades, box cuts
_ among Africa, the United States and the Caribbean is steady and
runs in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is a function of global economics. The
Western-based fashion industry is a cash-hungry game of planned
obsolescence, its products as tasty, addictive and insubstantial as
fast food. At the same time style contributes to social change.
Afros and dreadlocks once served this purpose for the Black Power
movement in the United States and carried something like the
ritualistic and moral force associated with hair in African
tradition. (Both styles, it is worth noting, have been viewed with
suspicion in Africa itself.)
</P>
<P>
   The show touches on a whole range of similarly complex dynamics
without spelling them out. It doesn't need to. They are implicit in
African sculpture itself, which projects a concept of the body and
its adornment so holistic and multifaceted as to leave
market-driven notions of personal style in the dust. In traditional
African practice, fashion, like art, is far more than a vehicle for
individual expression. It is a primary shaper of values and
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a source of aesthetic pleasure, as virtually every
one of the 170 objects here demonstrates. Pleasure alone is reason
enough to see this exhibition and another one that, with a slightly
different anatomical slant, complements it perfectly, ``Body Art:
Marks of Identity'' at the American Museum of Natural History
through May 29. ``Body Art'' has been up for a while and is pulling
in crowds. ``Hair in African Art and Culture,'' more compact and
focused and, object for object, even more beautiful, should do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair in African Art and Culture'' travels to the Apex Museum
in Atlanta (July through September), the Cantor Center for Visual
Arts of Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif. (October through
December), the Charles H. Wright Museum of African-American History
in Detroit (January through April, 2001) and then to the California
African American Museum in Los Angeles.

FRENCH PROSECUTOR WANTS EX-FOREIGN MINISTER TRIED FOR CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A French prosecutor has asked that former Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas, together with a past mistress and six other
people, stand trial on corruption charges stemming from a
sex-and-kickback scandal involving the former national oil company.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Pierre Dintilhac, told investigators in the case
that evidence was sufficient to try Dumas as an accomplice in a
scheme to embezzle corporate funds.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the prosecutor said Dumas had helped his former
mistress, Christine Deviers-Joncour, get a job as a lobbyist with
the former national oil company, Elf Aquitaine, from which she
later received millions of dollars in illegal payments. He said
Dumas had benefited from Deviers-Joncour's windfall in the form of
cash and the use of a credit card and an expensive Left Bank
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In the request, much of which was published Thursday in Le
Monde, Dintilhac also accuses Dumas of seeking to mislead
investigators by various means, ``from refusals to answer to false
omissions, from half-truths to actual lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor recommended that Dumas stand trial together with
Deviers-Joncour; Loik le Floch-Prigent, former chairman and chief
executive of Elf; Alfred Sirven, le Floch-Prigent's closest
associate at Elf; and several other senior Elf executives. Elf,
which has since been privatized, merged last year with its domestic
rival, TotalFina.
</P>
<P>
   The special judges who conducted the investigation and presented
their results to Dintilhac must now decide whether to accept his
recommendation for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means clear that the silver-haired Dumas, 77 _ who
took a leave of absence last March from the Constitutional Council
presidency, the country's fifth-ranking office _ will ever face a
court. Later this month France's highest court will hear arguments
that the case be dismissed because of irregularities surrounding
the 1997 arrest of Deviers-Joncour, who was held for five months in
preventive detention.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecutor's request is granted, the trial will be the
first to emerge from a tangled six-year investigation into how a
knot of senior executives bilked Elf of hundreds of millions of
dollars between 1989 and 1993, when it was still government-owned.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has also illustrated how big, state-owned
French concerns were used for decades as giant slush funds by
politicians who appointed compliant cronies to run them. And it has
yielded a best-selling book by Deviers-Joncour, ``Whore of the
Republic,'' in which she described her relationship with Dumas and
Elf.
</P>
<P>
   If Dumas goes on trial he will most likely have to answer
charges that he accepted numerous gifts, including a pair of $1,700
handmade Italian shoes, and use of the Left Bank apartment, even
though he knew Elf illegally paid for them. Elf executives have
said Deviers-Joncour got $10.3 million all together, plus a yearly
salary of over $100,000 and the use of the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Dumas has never denied involvement with Deviers-Joncour but does
deny illegal acts. Last March he said with characteristic
assuredness, ``When the judicial procedures are done, I will retake
my place at the head of the Constitutional Council.''

MEXICO MAKING STRIDES TOWARD MODERN DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Mexico, in many respects, is quickly becoming a true
pluralistic democracy with a competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, in many respects, is much like the worst of Russia,
lawless and corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   This seeming contradiction, a Mexico lurching toward stability
while grappling with anarchy, is the picture that emerges from an
important new analysis on the country by the Pacific Council on
International Policy, a partner of the Council on Foreign
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   `Mexico Transforming` is about Mexico's future. If the crystal
ball is a bit hazy, it's only because the experts have not yet
determined which forces will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But the analysis does a superb job of describing those forces
and where each road could lead. And, of course, the United States
is intimately involved.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries' economies, some seven years after NAFTA, are
now even more intertwined. There is talk of tying the peso to the
dollar, a discussion that would have been anathema to the proud and
nationalistic Mexico of just 20 years ago and an indication of the
change occurring there.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that failure in Mexico spells problems for the United
States. Imagine this scary thought: Even more friction than now
between the United States and Mexico around the issues of
immigration, the drug war and financial bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For both countries, the other is now virtually a domestic
issue,'' the analysis understates.
</P>
<P>
   The report lays out the changes occurring in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it is no longer the one-party state of old.
Opposition parties control Mexico's lower house. The ruling PRI
controls the upper house, but all seats are up for grabs in
elections this year. Governorships have changed hands between
parties.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, an independent commission is ensuring that
Mexican elections are fairer than they've ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Although the presidency still comes equipped with uncomfortably
strong powers and the ability to dominate the political and
economic discussion, the most recent president, in particular, has
been willing to be less authoritarian. Witness the first-ever PRI
election primary last year to determine the successor to President
Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Mexico, thanks to the new economy and the influx of
`maquiladoras,` has made giant strides in income and education. Per
capita incomes there are similar to those of South Korea or Taiwan.
Skilled workers are finding that they can earn more than the $1.20
per hour that other Mexican factory workers typically earn.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican press is becoming more watchdog than lapdog.
</P>
<P>
   These have all been positive changes. There's a flip side,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is rampant. The courts and police are ineffective, corrupt
or both.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which has managed to remain out of internal
politics for 75 years, is now being called upon to step in because
federal, state and local police forces are unable or unwilling to
fight the drug war. It's unclear what this enlarged role for the
military portends.
</P>
<P>
   An insurrection in Chiapas revealed deep schisms and stark
differences between the relatively affluent North and the
still-poor South. This new economy has not lifted all boats.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that fewer than half of Mexicans study beyond
ninth grade and that, of every 100 primary school graduates, only
two will attend college and only one will graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has indeed become less protectionist and more
competitive. It has welcomed foreign investment and privatized key
industries, but not its oil industry. The oil industry consequently
underperforms and is ill-equipped to accomplish the technological
improvements necessary to make it more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Mexico has changed, but its institutions have not
evolved in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies Mexico's problem and its future, a future with
which we are inextricably tied. The report says it best:
</P>
<P>
   ``The central questions are whether and how Mexico will reshape
its laws, institutions and practices to meet the challenges of an
open international economy, of the technological revolution and of
democratic politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Mexico pull it off? I'm hopeful because I prefer a
description of Mexico that former Mexican Ambassador to the Unites
States Jesus Silva Herzog once offered: Mexico is not really, as
has been described, a perfect dictatorship. Rather, it's an
imperfect democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Democracies, even imperfect ones, generally try to do the right
thing.

TESSERACT (Phoenix) - The Phoenix area's premier private-school
chain will send letters home to parents reassuring them the schools
are OK. But are they? In recent months, the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based
company, which has schools nationwide, replaced its founding chief
executive officer, laid off one-fourth of its central
administrative workforce and closed three of its schools. Then last
week, Tesseract's interim CEO and its chief financial officer
resigned, and the company said it was running out of money. The
spate of troubles leaves the company's 37 preschools, private
schools, and public charter schools, which serve some 8,000
students nationwide, facing an uncertain future. By LAURA TRUJILLO.

   Mexico, in many respects, is much like the worst of Russia,
lawless and corrupt. This seeming contradiction, a Mexico lurching
toward stability while grappling with anarchy, is the picture that

Pacific Council on International Policy, a partner of the Council
on Foreign Relations. By O. RICARDO PIMENTEL. Story will move in

&HT;     SENATORS CALL FOR MORE SECURITY ALONG CANADIAN BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two months after the arrest of a terrorist suspect
at a border crossing in Washington state, senators on Thursday
called for heightened security along the vast frontier with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understaffing at our northern border is jeopardizing the
security of our nation, not to mention border personnel,'' said
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Immigration is examining
border security needs since the Dec. 14 arrest of Ahmed Ressam, an
Algerian national who was stopped at Port Angeles, Wash., after
driving from British Columbia. Inspectors found bomb-making
materials in the trunk of his rental car.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who chairs the immigration
subcommittee, said the apprehension of Ressam has focused renewed
attention on security along the northern border.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said the U.S. Border Patrol is ``significantly
understaffed'' in the north, with about 300 agents responsible for
more than 3,000 miles along the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Charles W. Winwood, the acting deputy commissioner of the U.S.
Customs Service, told the Senate panel that more personnel are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the dangers and threats we have, we need more
people,'' Winwood said. He said the Customs Service would present
to Congress in the next week an analysis of how many new agents are
needed and where they should be stationed.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service processes people and cargo coming into the
United States while the Border Patrol monitors the frontiers for
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of the Border Patrol is concentrated on the border
with Mexico and has been bolstered in recent years to stem the flow
of narcotics and illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said the Border Patrol is ``significantly understaffed''
along the border with Canada, with about 300 agents responsible for
more than 3,000 miles of territory.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said a lot of the best employees who work on the border
are leaving their jobs because of poor benefits and pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is committed to providing our federal agencies
with the support they need to stop terrorists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Canada has become a haven
for ``virtually every terrorist group in the world.'' Canada has
some of the world's most lenient immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   She said the northern border is full of holes and requires more
security and ``more cooperation with Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also said that terrorists who are based in Canada
``are more sophisticated than the average illegal alien'' who
travels across the southern border.
</P>
<P>
   Winwood testified that the number of passengers traveling across
the U.S. border has increased 10 percent to 15 percent per year,
while trade has doubled, straining Customs agents whose numbers
have remained constant for five years.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 6,400 U.S. Customs inspectors, with about
three-quarters of those on the southern border and one-quarter on
the northern border. Traffic across the borders, both north and
south, has risen dramatically since the North American Free Trade
Agreement took effect in 1994.

 &HT;    Rocker testifies before arbitrator
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Braves closer John Rocker testified before arbitrator Shyam Das
in New York on Thursday in his suspension case.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was the first witness for the players' union, which began
to make its case for overturning the 28-day suspension, $20,000
fine and ban on spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the second day of Rocker's grievance hearing as he
attempts to reduce or eliminate the punishment handed down by
baseball commissioner Bud Selig. Rocker made disparaging remarks in
Sports Illustrated about foreigners, minorities and gays. Rocker
and Selig reportedly had met privately Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Das is not expected to make a ruling until late next week, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The players' union, under the direction of lawyer Gene Orza, is
hoping to convince Das that the suspension is too severe and sets a
dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Braves president Stan Kasten was back in Atlanta on Thursday and
declined to comment on his role in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Kasten testified about the
effects of Rocker's remarks on the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Kasten also declined comment on speculation that the Braves are
trying to trade Rocker. The team president was among the last
witnesses called by Major League Baseball. Baseball's director of
security, Kevin Hallinan, was the final one to take the stand,
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Under baseball's rules, the commissioner's office puts on its
defense first, then the union calls its witnesses. Howard Ganz,
representing owners in their litigation with umpires, was the lead
lawyer for management.
</P>
<P>
   The union says the suspension was without ``just cause'' and
argues that speech should not be punished, even if it is offensive.

IN FINAL ECONOMIC REPORT, ADMINISTRATION TAKES A BOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a technological revolution, low inflation and
global integration in full swing, the current U.S. economic
expansion, already the longest in American history, shows few signs
of old age, President Clinton said in his administration's last
annual survey of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a 500-page report released Thursday that mixed politics with
an analysis of the country's record-breaking prosperity, the
president's top economic advisers said a combination of deft fiscal
management and a surge of entrepreneurial activity had made the
current economic expansion not only the longest in history, but
also by many measures the most unusual.
</P>
<P>
   By the late stages of previous economic booms, in the 1960s and
1980s, inflation surged, productivity ebbed and income inequality
rose, the report said. But this expansion, which began in March
1991, has defied gravity, with inflation tame, productivity rising
and the income gap narrowing after nearly a decade of growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long it can last, but the economic
fundamentals look very good,'' said Martin N. Baily, chairman of
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. ``As long as we stick to
the fiscal policy we have there is no reason this shouldn't
continue indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   The report updates projections on how fast the economy will grow
this year and next. It predicts the economy will expand at a
slightly slower rate of 2.9 percent this year, down from 4.2
percent in 1999, and 2.6 percent in 2001, with no recession in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also adjusted its estimate of the rise in
productivity, a measure of worker efficiency and a key determinant
of the longevity of an expansion. The more each worker can produce
in the same number of hours, the more the economy can expand
without straining resources and igniting inflation, the thinking
goes.
</P>
<P>
   The report predicts that productivity growth will average 2.1
percent a year for each of the next four years, far higher than the
1.4 percent average for the period between 1973 and 1995, but
slower than the average gains over the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that estimate could be conservative, Baily said.
Productivity actually grew at a 5 percent rate in the final half of
last year. If that were to keep up, then the overall economy could
probably grow much faster _ perhaps at almost 4 percent a year _
without serious risk of inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are sharply divided on whether Clinton, or any
president, for that matter, does much to influence the overall
direction of the economy. To the extent that the widespread use of
computers, the growth of the Internet and the stock market surge
has powered the economy, for example, the administration's
fingerprints are barely visible.
</P>
<P>
   But the report contends that Clinton deserves credit for what it
calls two of the most important ingredients of today's strong
economy: a sharp improvement in the financial status of the federal
government and the sizable increase in the role of trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expansion has been the result of a complementary set of
developments in policy and in the private sector,'' the report
said. ``Rapid technological change has occurred in an economy that
is more globalized than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton took office, the federal government was deeply in
debt and adding to the red ink in huge annual chunks. Today, the
government is running a hefty surplus and paying down the national
debt for the first time in decades. That reversal has freed
hundreds of billions of dollars for investment in more productive
sectors, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The sound economy and the resulting rise in tax revenues has a
good deal to do with that, of course. But some outside economists
agree that Clinton deserves a tip of the hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government spending declined as a share of the economy during
his term,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
``There was a surge in tax revenue, it's true. But in another era,
it could have been frittered away.''

   Another engine of the economy has been globalization. Trade _
the sum of exports and imports _ accounts for a greater share of
economic activity today than at any time since the turn of the last
century, the report says. Moreover, the flow of capital between
nations has exploded in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Clinton's push for market-opening initiatives around the
world, the White House argued. Clinton persuaded Congress to ratify
free trade agreements with Mexico and Canada and helped usher in
the creation of the World Trade Organization during his tenure. The
seeds for both those achievements were laid in the Reagan and Bush
administrations, the report acknowledges, but final credit for
making them a reality goes to Clinton, it says.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes two less rosy indicators, either of which could
eventually contribute to the next recession. Private households are
spending lots of money now based on expectations of future earnings
and a continuing run-up in stock prices, the report says. That
could foreshadow a sharp reduction in consumption if the stock
market slumps.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is also running a record trade deficit with
the rest of the world. Long term, the deficit threatens the
strength of the dollar and the reliance on cheap imports and
capital from abroad to help fuel the domestic economy.

 &HT;    Rocker testifies before arbitrator
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Braves closer John Rocker testified before arbitrator Shyam Das
in New York on Thursday in his suspension case.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was the first witness for the players' union, which began
to make its case for overturning the 28-day suspension, $20,000
fine and ban on spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the second day of Rocker's grievance hearing as he
attempts to reduce or eliminate the punishment handed down by
baseball commissioner Bud Selig. Rocker made disparaging remarks in
Sports Illustrated about foreigners, minorities and gays. Rocker
and Selig reportedly had met privately Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Das is not expected to make a ruling until late next week, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The players' union, under the direction of lawyer Gene Orza, is
hoping to convince Das that the suspension is too severe and sets a
dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Braves president Stan Kasten was back in Atlanta on Thursday and
declined to comment on his role in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Kasten testified about the
effects of Rocker's remarks on the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Kasten also declined comment on speculation that the Braves are
trying to trade Rocker. The team president was among the last
witnesses called by Major League Baseball. Baseball's director of
security, Kevin Hallinan, was the final one to take the stand,
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Under baseball's rules, the commissioner's office puts on its
defense first, then the union calls its witnesses. Howard Ganz,
representing owners in their litigation with umpires, was the lead
lawyer for management.
</P>
<P>
   The union says the suspension was without ``just cause'' and
argues that speech should not be punished, even if it is offensive.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves verified again Thursday that
cornerba ck and w ide receiver are team priorities for the
offseason. Otherwise details were fuzzy as NFL free-agency started
today. Fourteen Falcons players become free agents today, including
nine starters.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers seem to indicate that the organization will be more
active than before. By comparison, a year earlier, the only starter
to become a free agent was strong safety William White.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves played down the possibility that the Falcons would go
on a spending spree, even though they have more money to spend than
most teams.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, team officials had to cut linebacker Cornelius
Bennett and re-structure the contract of quarterback Chris Chandler
to fit under the salary cap, and make room for their only big
free-agent signing, strong safety Marty Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably will be about like most years,'' Reeves said.
``What did we sign last year -- six, eight free agents? Money has a
lot to do with it. We may sign less if we get quality, depending on
what we can afford. It also depends on how many we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   If the strategy is to sign one expensive player, the Falcons
have not indicated it would be unrestricted free-agent defensive
end Chuck Smith, who figures to command a signing bonus of at least
$7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely nothing going on,'' Smith's agent, Jimmy
Sexton, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will have to sign more than six or eight free
agents, to provide starters as well as bodies for training camp.
The team was to be some $15 million to $17 million under the salary
cap for 2000, which went into effect Thursday. But the numbers are
misleading. Recent contract and bookeeping moves have cut the teams
spending money roughly in half.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, an unrestricted free agent,
will sign a multi-year contract Monday. Reserve running back Gary
Downs and center-guard Evan Pilgrim signed multi-year contracts
Thursday, to avoid free-agency. Also, the positions that the
Falcons need help do not have much depth.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top free-agent cornerbacks are expected to be Thomas
Smith of Buffalo; Phillippi Sparks, who played for Reeves with the
Giants; and Terrell Buckley of the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Several others probably will stay with their teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' wide receivers are short, but Reeves said, ``What
we're looking at is a combination of speed, quickness and size.
Somebody who can stretch the field and compete to start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' Shawn Jefferson, who is unrestricted, is 5-11 and
fast. The nine-year veteran last season caught 40 passes, for a
17.5-yard average and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also need depth at running back and both lines.
``We've got to address defensive end, because we haven't been able
to sign Chuck (Smith) or (starting left end) Lester Archambeau,''
Reeves said. ``We've got a lot of concerns.''

SHAKEN McCAIN DEMANDS END TO NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
and JOHN GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ John McCain, shaken by a mother's claim that
her teen-age son had received an unsettling political ``push''
call, demanded Thursday that George W. Bush cease negative
campaigning in the increasingly bitter Republican presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer confirmed that the governor's
campaign was making several hundred thousand advocacy calls before
the South Carolina primary Feb. 19 but said the telephone contacts
were not abusive toward McCain. Most polls show Bush and McCain in
a dead heat in the critical first-in-the-South contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would fire anyone on his staff making calls that
denigrate McCain personally, but he defended his campaign's use of
calls to voters that blame the negative tone of the South Carolina
race on the Arizona senator. But Bush also complained that McCain
had ``besmirched'' him by comparing his character to that of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the calls is the latest sour turn in a
campaign that has become marked by almost daily charges and
countercharges about negative tactics, including rough-edged
television ads from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said both campaigns should drop the commercials but said
he was unlikely to take the step unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling on my good friend George Bush to stop this now,''
McCain said. ``He comes from a better family. He knows better than
this. He should stop it. ... Let's treat voters of South Carolina
with some respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene for Thursday's back-and-forth was set when Donna Duren
of Spartanburg told McCain in a public meeting that her son Chris
was almost in tears as he reported an unsolicited telephone message
Wednesday in which a caller said McCain is ``a cheat and a liar and
a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor did not apologize for the advocacy calls but
denounced the call described by Duren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept that kind of phone calling,'' Bush said. ``If
anybody on my campaign has done that they're going to be fired. I
agree with the senator that this kind of politics should not be
part of the American process.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no authorization _ and it's not going to happen
in my campaign _ for calling (McCain) a liar. It's just not going
to happen. I can understand why the mom was upset and I can
understand why Senator McCain was upset,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In public appearances, Bush continued to paint McCain as a
hypocrite, focusing on McCain's opposition in 1990 to a measure
allowing senators to shift funds from their congressional campaign
account to a presidential campaign. As he began his current
campaign, McCain transferred $2 million from his congressional to
presidential account.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say something, it's another thing to do it
in politics,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also suggested that it was easy for McCain to appeal to
Democrats to vote in South Carolina's open primary because the
senator has taken Democratic-like positions on some public policy
issues, including tax reduction and campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying that on key issues, Senator McCain and Vice
President (Al) Gore agree,'' Bush said. ``There's a big difference
between that and besmirching somebody's character by comparing them
to President Clinton,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy about negative campaigning often has the effect of
depressing voter turnout, especially among marginal voters who are
turned off by political tit-for-tat. In a normal Republican primary
in South Carolina that would probably advantage Bush, the favorite
of much of the party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Murphy, a McCain senior adviser, contended that the
negativity had reached such a level that turnout could be increased
because ``there's a repulsion at it. It's going to backfire'' on
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts estimate that four or five of Bush's negative
ads are running for each of McCain's negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll by American Research Group showed Bush ahead in South
Carolina, with 46 percent to McCain's 39 percent. This same polling
firm predicted Bush would win in New Hampshire; he lost by 19
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign distributed a copy of the script for the calls
that it said where being made by a Phoenix-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   The caller's points include the claim that Bush is ``a reformer
with results,'' the slogan his campaign adopted after losing to
McCain in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the caller says, ``the race has turned ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain has TV ads comparing Governor Bush to Bill
Clinton,'' the caller continues. ``Senator (Strom) Thurmond
(R-S.C.) said, `There is no excuse for the negative ads.' He called
it 'sad' and `the sort of message that the people of this country
have rejected.' Don't be misled by McCain's negative campaign
tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   The call closes with the question: ``Can I tell Governor Bush he
can count on your support for his reform message in next week's
Republican primary election?''
</P>
<P>
   Duren described her son's version of the call in remarks to
McCain at the Spartanburg event.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son has found a new hero,'' Duren, a McCain supporter,
said. ``I am so mad. I was so livid last night I couldn't sleep,''
Duren told McCain. ``I thank you for being above reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who later said Duren's statement ``rattled'' him, seemed
stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disillusionment of a young boy is ... something that I
think anyone of them _ as crass and base as some of the people that
get into this business become _ would be ashamed,'' McCain said.
``If they want to win, fine, but they don't need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain told Duren he would phone her son to talk with him about
the incident. As he left the stage, McCain met briefly with Duren
and hugged her.
</P>
<P>
   Following the event, McCain said the incident was ``the first
time in this campaign when I've been knocked a little bit off
stride.'' Later, in a conversation with reporters, McCain was asked
for details about his education proposal and said: ``I can't focus
on that exactly right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Duren said she did not know the source of the call to her son
Chris, but McCain quickly fingered Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had many other reports that they came from the Bush
campaign,'' McCain said. ``I would be glad to hear the Bush
campaign say that it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, McCain campaign leaders in South Carolina
accused the Bush operation of ``push polling,'' in which callers
make negative statements about a candidate in the guise of making a
public-opinion survey. Fleischer said those calls were for a
legitimate poll being taken by the campaign to determine which
issues were of most interest to voters.

MILLOY SAYS $35M DEAL WON'T HURT PATRIOTS' CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The National Football League's highest-paid
safety Thursday scoffed at the notion that his new seven-year, $35
million contract might hinder his employer from remaining a
perennial playoff contender while adhering to the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lawyer Milloy said the Patriots have taken another step
toward keeping the core of the team intact.
</P>
<P>
   He said the addition of coach Bill Belichick and an infusion of
young talent should be enough to get the underachieving squad back
to the playoffs, and added that the notion his deal could affect
that makes no sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to take the whole brunt of this situation on my
shoulders,'' said Milloy, who led the team in tackles (173) and
interceptions (4) last season. ``It was just my time, something
I've been working for the last four years. I put myself in this
situation. In order for a team to be successful, you have to have a
good nucleus, and I think we've done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sign the Ted Johnsons, the Lawyer Milloys, the Ty
Laws, the Willie McGinests, you have the makeup of the team. After
that, you fill in where it is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick introduced Milloy at Thursday afternoon's press
conference, and though he didn't stay to field questions, he did
say the contract reflects the team's commitment to a player he
coached as a defensive coordinator on the Patriots' 1997 Super Bowl
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has all the attributes I'm looking for in a football
player,'' said Belichick. ``I know this is a big commitment by the
organization to Lawyer and it's one I think is deserving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the system is set up now, there are only so many
players you can make this type of commitment to. You just can't do
it to everybody. That's just the way it's set up. But he's the type
of player I want to commit to and I'm proud to commit to, and I'm
happy to be back with him.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any doubt how important the team feels Milloy is to
its future, consider his pact: Milloy's lawyer, Ray Anderson, said
that over the first four years, Milloy will receive $15 million _
including a $6 million signing bonus that could be spread over the
length of the deal for cap purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, after the fourth year the Patriots have an option to void
the remaining three years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Anderson said if the team does not decide on the option by a
certain date before the beginning of free agency, Milloy can
decline the option and declare free agency. If he continues with
his contract, he will receive a $2 million option bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works extremely well for both parties,'' said Anderson,
``because it protects the team and it allows the team to go out and
continue and sign other guys they need to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what you believe, it's not all about the money all
the time. You don't have to have it all right now. Lawyer wants to
win, so we were intent on doing the best we can do for him while at
the same time not stretching the Patriots where they would
legitimately not be able to _ they're not going to be able to keep
them all, but that's out of our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those they already decided not to keep is heralded tight
end Ben Coates, who was released Wednesday, and mainstay offensive
lineman Bruce Armstrong, let go Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Law, who also received scrutiny last year after signing a $50
million deal, believes the Patriots will remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Patriots tight end) Rod Rutledge gets in there he does
well,'' Law said. ``You probably said the same thing when the
All-Pro tight end in front of Ben Coates left (Marv Cook). You have
to give people an opportunity. When I got drafted, everyone gave me
a hard time. You have to give people a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy said he didn't know about the releasing of Coates until
he read it in the newspaper before the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Ben, he's been a great player in
this league,'' he said. ``He was a crucial part to this team. He's
done a really good job. I know that it's a business. Whatever the
reason, it's not up to me, to keep a player or let them go. For
that you have to talk to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy said if it was a money issue, he could have pushed for
franchise player status or tested free agency. Yet considering his
deal, that would have been like holding out for a Porsche when
someone offers you a Mercedes. Moreover, he said given the
opportunity, he'd rather stay in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my agent if we can get it done to get it done as soon
as possible so we can go out and assemble this team as fast as
possible so we can get this camaraderie going early,'' he said.

GORDON SAYS HE'LL OVERCOME SURGERY AND PITCH THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ The prediction flies in the face of
conventional medical thinking, and perhaps common sense, too.
</P>
<P>
   But two months after undergoing surgery to reconstruct his right
elbow, an operation that usually sidelines a pitcher for 12 to 18
months, Tom Gordon sat on a picnic table here at the Red Sox
training complex and vowed that he will pitch in the big leagues
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt I'll be able to pitch this year,'' said
Gordon, who came here just days after his Dec. 13 surgery and began
the demanding exercise program required to strengthen his elbow.
``My goal this year is to get back on the mound. If I can do that,
everything else will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is less certain the Red Sox want him back, in light of
the strained relations that developed between the club, the player,
and his agents over the best course of treatment for the closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll pitch for Boston again,'' said Gordon,
who in 1998, his first full season as a closer after being
converted from a starter, was an American League All-Star and led
the league with 46 saves, including a major league-record 43
straight, a streak he extended to 54 last season. ``But I'll be
pitching somewhere, and I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day Gordon finally submitted to surgery in Los Angeles,
in which orthopedist Lewis Yocum removed a tendon from Gordon's
left wrist to use to rebuild the ulnar ligament in his right elbow,
Sox general manager Dan Duquette said it was ``unlikely'' the club
would exercise the $4.5 million contract option for Gordon to
return in the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the way he felt, making a decision (on the option)
right away, maybe he never cared for me in the first place,''
Gordon said Thursday. ``I don't see how he can make a decision on
you as soon as you get hurt. But he doesn't want me to be part of
the team and pick up my option, that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm one of the best people in the game, one of the
quality pitchers in the game, and one of the best closers. Someone
will want me. I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, after Gordon went on the disabled list for the second
time in three months, team doctor Arthur Pappas raised the
possibility that Gordon would need Tommy John tendon transfer
surgery in his elbow. But he recommended that Gordon first try rest
and rehabilitation, and as late as last fall, Pappas held out hope
Gordon would require less invasive surgery than total
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and his agents, meanwhile, solicited a second opinion
from orthopedist James Andrews, who recommended reconstruction,
prompting Duquette to fire off a menacing letter to Gordon's agents
demanding Andrews not be involved in Gordon's medical care. The
commissioner's office and the players' union had to intercede
before an agreement was worked out that Yocum would perform the
surgery, with Red Sox team doctor William Morgan in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   But even with surgery in the offing, Gordon attempted a
late-summer comeback, pitching in the minor leagues until the Sox
finally activated him in the last week of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted Thursday that he may have been mistaken in
continuing to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Yocum told me that maybe five or six months ago, I may not
have needed (reconstruction),'' Gordon said. ``I might have needed
it last spring. We don't know if I hurt it more. But I went out
there and continued to pitch. I had to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I should have come back or not, but they (the
Red Sox) should have an appreciation about who I cared for, the
guys I played with.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon said the surgery should have been done much
earlier, he absolved Pappas from responsibility. ``Dr. Pappas was
never a problem,'' he said. ``He was always good to me. I don't
think he ever said anything wrong to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon clearly was less forgiving toward Duquette. ``I don't
understand why some people took things as far as they did,'' he
said. ``They made it sound like it was all in my head. It's like
they don't want to feel like they did anything wrong. But if they
don't, fine. I don't have a problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At no time publicly did any Red Sox official suggest that Gordon
was imagining the severity of his injury. Duquette was not
enchanted, however, when Gordon's agents approached him last winter
about reqworking his contract even before his current extension
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried a number of different things,'' Duquette said in
December in discussing the club's decision to postpone surgery
during the season. ``The reason you delay, delay, delay is that you
hope you don't have to do a complete reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose elbow is in a protective wrap, has yet to pick up
a baseball since his surgery, though he said he is close to being
able to play some light catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``I feel happy. This is part of the
game. I look at this as a challenge.''

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC TO SHAKE UP MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Scientific Corp., beset by internal difficulties in
getting new cardiology stents developed and approved and losing
market share, Thursday said it will realign management that focuses
on product innovation and operations.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come as the Natick, Mass. company's shares have
fallen 57 percent since July and its position in cardiology stents
has dipped to third place from second, according to some Wall
Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific's chief executive, James Tobin, ``is putting
people and processes in place to improve their overall efficiency
and cost structure,'' said Jonathan W. Osgood, managing director of
health care research at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown ``It should make
Boston Scientific more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The realignment plan calls for creating a new business unit
focused solely on heart stents and stent-delivery system
development that reports to Tobin. Stents are small metal mesh
tubes used to hold open cleared arteries. Cardiologists
increasingly seek out the most advanced versions.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific shares, which had been as high as 46 1/2 last
July have fallen sharply, closing Thursday at 19 5/16, down 1 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boston Scientific experienced difficulties when one
model, known as the NIR on Sox cardiology stent, developed with its
Israeli partner Medinol Ltd. of Tel Aviv, was recalled. A second,
gold-coated model was also delayed and is awaiting US Food and Drug
Administration approval. Without them, Boston Scientific's share in
the $1.2 billion worldwide market has slipped to third behind
Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis and Guidant Corp. of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a mismatch between our company _ 13,000 people, $3
billion in revenue, and thousands of products _ and Medinol, which
is only focused on cardiolology stents,'' said Tobin. ``This
mismatch inhibits communications, makes it harder to get decisions
made and means that problems can creep into the relationship. That
changes now, as decision making gets streamlined and we go from
five layers of people down to two.''
</P>
<P>
   The separate cardiology stent business unit will be led by Fred
Colen, former vice president of research and development at SciMed,
the Minneapolis division that makes the cardiology stents. He will
report to Tobin. SciMed will continue to provide cardiologists with
products such as balloon catheters, guide wires, and guide
catheters.
</P>
<P>
   In another streamlining move, Tobin said James H. Taylor Jr., a
senior vice president for corporate operations who joined Boston
Scientific last August, will now oversee all worldwide
manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific will also shift chief scientist Arthur
Rosenthal to work closely with physicians and the scientific
community on their needs for emerging and future technologies
increasingly focused on less invasive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he will name a chief technology officer to the newly
created post, responsible for working more closely inside the
company, along with a new chief communications officer, who will
also oversee government relations.

DRUG TRAFFICKING SUSPECT WAS INVOLVED IN '96 PROFILING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After state troopers at Logan Airport seized nearly
$15,000 in cash from a Hispanic man in 1996, believing it was drug
money, US District Judge Nancy Gertner returned the money, accusing
the officers of ``blatant ethnic stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, the man with the money was back in court, charged
with running a large marijuana ring that operated in Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, Nevada, and California.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to the federal indictment unsealed Thursday in
New Hampshire, Manuel Espinola was involved in drug trafficking in
July 1998, when Gertner wrote a 30-page order accusing the troopers
of a rush to judgment in seizing the cash.
</P>
<P>
   Gertner wouldn't discuss the case Thursday nor would US Attorney
Donald K. Stern, whose office sought the forfeiture of Espinola's
money in the earlier case.
</P>
<P>
   Espinola, 27, of Tewksbury, was among seven people indicted on
marijuana conspiracy charges following an investigation by
Massachusetts and New Hampshire State Police, Haverhill Police and
the US Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that Espinola and a co-defendant
identified as Brian Reynolds shipped multi-pound quantities of
marijuana from California to New Hampshire and Massachusetts via
United Parcel Service and Federal Express over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Espinola was arrested Thursday morning in the Haverhill area and
appeared in US District Court in Boston, along with Jason
Mitchitson, 27, and Jennifer Meserve, 24, both of Haverhill. The
others charged in the case were arrested in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Espinola first attracted the attention of law enforcement
authorities on Nov. 7, 1996, when an x-ray machine at Logan Airport
showed a dark block in his briefcase and a search revealed it to be
bundles of twenty and fifty-dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   Espinola claimed he and his brother earned the money as
door-to-door salesmen for Equinox International and planned to use
it for a downpayment on a home in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed with the court, State Trooper Stephen G.
Lynch said he seized the money because Espinola appeared nervous,
didn't have a business card indicating that he worked for Equinox,
and couldn't remember the telephone number of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Espinola also was unable to provide the name of a realtor who
could support his claim that he was about to purchase a home.
Later, a drug-sniffing dog found narcotics residue on the money,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   After initially ordering Espinola to forfeit the money to the
government, Gertner later concluded that prosecutors failed to
prove that Espinola -- who had no criminal record -- was involved
with drugs. And she chastised the government, raising the spectre
of ethnic bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the byzantine world of forfeiture law, this case is an
example of overreaching,'' Gertner wrote. ``The government's
showing of probable cause is completely inadequate, based on a
troubling mix of baseless generalizations, leaps of logic or worse,
blatant ethnic stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment unsealed Thursday against Espinola calls
for a sentence ranging from a minium of five years to a maximum of
20, if convicted. Also named in the indictment were Meserve's
sister, Gretchen, Clinton Senter, and a man identified only as
Randy.
</P>
<P>
   US Magistrate Judge Robert Collings ordered Espinola held
without bail pending a detention hearing Monday after Assistant US
Attorney Dickens Mathieu said the government believes Espinola may
flee if released because he's facing a lengthy prison term if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Meserve was released on an unsecured bond and Mitchitson was
ordered held without bail because he is currently on probation for
an earlier drug conviction in Haverhill District Court.

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ John McCain's bus caravan came to a halt
Thursday on the shoulder of Interstate 26 at the command of the
blue flashing lights of a Highway Patrol cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the lead bus stepped out, followed by reporters,
camera crews and photographers. No one wanted to miss this brush
with the law.
</P>
<P>
   But Trooper Michael O'Donnell was not in a ticket-writing mode.
He wanted to meet his favorite candidate and tell him how well he
had done on a political TV program the night before.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, though, was in Columbia, meeting with local newspaper
editors while the reporters who have been covering him headed to
Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   The I-26 traffic stop was the latest, and perhaps most unusual,
example of a phenomenon that seems to follow McCain wherever he
goes.
</P>
<P>
   People want to meet him. What is more, they believe he is
approachable, which of course he is.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell had wanted to pull over the buses the other day, when
the traveling roadshowwas headed in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   But, O'Donnell explained to the horde of eager newspeople, his
car was pointed the wrong way and he ``couldn't get turned
around.''
</P>
<P>
   He was disappointed McCain was not there. The only elected
official aboard was Lisa Graham Keegan, the Arizona school
superintendent, who dutifully greeted O'Donnell and told him how
much McCain would have appreciated the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as cameras rolled and photographers snapped his picture,
O'Donnell became nervous that his action might be misinterpreted by
his superiors, not to mention South Carolina taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   All he wanted, he said, was to say hello to his hero.

YOUNG INTERNET MILLIONAIRES DEVELOP INNOVATIVE PHILANTHROPIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Texas, Calif., N.Y., Ariz.)   (bl)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At 25, Nicholas Lovejoy left his $27,000-a-year job as
a math teacher in suburban Seattle, took a pay cut and went to work
for a friend, Jeff Bezos, who was just then launching a start-up
site on the World Wide Web. He was the fifth employee in the door
at Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, proud of the company's strategic success but also
conflicted about what he called its mission of ``trying to be the
Wal-Mart of the Internet,'' Lovejoy sold his car, stored his
belongings and took off with his girlfriend, Barbara Gordon, to
travel around the world with a backpack. Even then, he could not
help getting rich, as the value of his stock options kept
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this one trip on a sailboat for three weeks where we
were totally out of contact with civilization,'' Lovejoy recalled,
describing a voyage from Tahiti to the Cook Islands in the South
Pacific summer of 1998. ``And when we got done,'' he added, shaking
his head in wonder, ``the stock had tripled.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 30, Lovejoy is back in Seattle, and he and Gordon, who is
now his wife, have a new vocation: philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has created a spate of young millionaires, and many
of them, like Lovejoy, are turning their attention to philanthropy
in their own hands-on ways. They describe their activities as
``venture philanthropy,'' modeled on their business experiences,
and some promote the concept of ``e-philanthropy,'' which involves
finding ways to make charitable giving easier, much as `e-commerce'
is making buying easier. Rather than giving to traditional
charities, they see themselves as investing in programs that will
bring about long-term change in such fields as education and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether all this will change the nature of philanthropy itself,
as some experts predict, remains to be seen. But there is no
question, they say, that, as measured by both the dollars involved
and the soaring numbers of small family foundations being created
around Seattle and the Silicon Valley, there has been a burst of
philanthropic activity.
</P>
<P>
   With assets of about $2.5 million, the Gordon-Lovejoy Foundation
is unlikely to overtake the $22 billion Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation. But like Gates and the other young Internet
philanthropists, Lovejoy and his wife are thinking hard about how
best to use not just their unexpected wealth, but also their
talents and time.
</P>
<P>
   And, lest anyone think the job is easy, Lovejoy, a deeply
earnest young man with a blond ponytail and a quick smile, offers
words that seem to echo the oil titan John D. Rockefeller Sr.'s
famous observation that he found it harder to give away money
intelligently than he did to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a harder problem,'' Lovejoy said. ``To figure out how to
sell books on the Internet may be a hard problem. But to figure out
what you want to change about the world and how to change that in
an effective way that makes people better off, it's just a far
vaster problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The philanthropy going on here is certainly notable for the
strikingly young age of many of the benefactors, said Vartan
Gregorian, the president of the New York-based Carnegie Corp. and
an informal adviser to Gates and many of these junior
philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates, despite all the criticisms against him for
waiting, has still broken the age barrier,'' said Gregorian. ``He's
done away with the whole rationale that you have to wait until your
Rockefeller's age, Carnegie's age, the last decade of your life and
so forth, to decide what to do with your wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than speaking of their legacies or putting their names up
on buildings _ not yet, anyway _ many young philanthropists speak
of expecting to live for another half-century or more. Thus, in
conversations about what motivates them to get into philanthropy,
they often tend to speak about the need for systemic change.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most forward-looking of these Internet philanthropists
is Rob Glaser, the billionaire founder of the Seattle-based
RealNetworks, whose Glaser Family Foundation has assets of about
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Glaser Foundation, among other things, is financing a
program at the University of Washington known as the Progress
Project, whose goal is no less than to help redefine how society
measures progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me _ maybe it's because I'm 38 and not 68 _ but I look at
this from a long-term perspective,'' said Glaser, a former
Microsoft executive whose company produces software that enables
audio and video uses of the World Wide Web. ``I am focused on
making the greatest and deepest long-term impact, and not
necessarily doing something that has an immediate impact but only
scratches the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone looks at how much the Nasdaq went up, or how much the
Dow Jones average went up,'' Glaser continued. ``But there are all
kinds of values embedded in having those be the metrics we use. By
not talking about global population growth, by not talking about
greenhouse gas emissions, by not talking about these other highly
measurable things, we're making value judgments. And if we really
step back and ask if those are the kind of value judgments we
should be making, most people, not everyone, would say no, those
aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Pitofsky, director of SEA Change (Social Entrepreneurs'
Alliance for Change), a New York- and San Francisco-based umbrella
organization that helps many young entrepreneurs hook up with
philanthropic causes, said many people were seeking both immediate
and long-term ways to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they don't want to be involved with just a Band-Aid,
or alleviation of conditions,'' Pitofsky said. ``They're also
interested in changing the conditions.''

 SEATTLE: the conditions.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of today's young philanthropists describe their activities
as a ``second career,'' but one that may well precede a return to
the business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of a cultural anthropology to all this that's
fascinating,'' said Catherine Muther, who worked from 1989 to 1994
as the senior marketing officer at Cisco Systems Inc., then
launched her own nonprofit foundation, the Three Guineas Fund,
which helps women get started in high-tech industries and
encourages them in philanthropic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the turn of the century, the average life span was much
shorter to begin with,'' she said. ``But now you have people who
have made a lot, very young, and they say: `Hey, I've got another
50 years to go. I could do one or two or three more careers
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   One other distinguishing characteristic of today's younger
philanthropists is this: many say they don't like the word
``philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `philanthropy' can be very off-putting in a way to
people,'' said Paul Shoemaker, 39, a former marketing executive at
Microsoft who left the company two years ago and is now director of
Social Venture Partners, a Seattle-based network of 236 members,
most drawn from the high-tech field, who pool their resources to
help nonprofit organizations with both money and business
expertise. ``It has sort of this blue-blooded connotation to it.''
(Among the terms that appear more in vogue are ``social
investment,'' ``venture philanthropy,'' and ``giving back to the
community.'')
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which was founded in 1997 by Paul Brainerd, a
desktop publishing pioneer who sold his Aldus Corp. for $450
million in 1994, has largely concentrated on children's and
educational programs. Donors typically spend 5 to 10 hours a week
working directly with the groups that Social Venture Partners is
supporting. Offshoot organizations with a similar mission have
sprung up in in Austin, Texas, and Phoenix, and another one will
soon do so in the Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly many Seattle and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs admit to
having very little time, amidst the cutthroat atmosphere of the
Internet industry, to even think about philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   And many argue, as Gates himself did for years, that the most
important thing they can do right now is to make sure their
companies succeed, thus increasing the wealth they might be in a
position to give away later on.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos, the Amazon.com founder who sought out Lovejoy as one of
his first employees, has often said that he hopes one day to work
as hard at giving away his wealth as he is now at amassing it.
</P>
<P>
   And for at least some donors, their motives may not even be
chiefly altruistic: by giving away stock in their companies,
especially at a time when the stock is sky-high, they reap
significant tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many who have succeeded wildly in high-tech ventures,
some of whom express befuddlement or even guilt at how quickly they
made so much, the time to act is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem fair that anybody could get that lucky,'' said
Lovejoy, who takes no salary from the work for his own foundation.
``It's like winning the lottery in a lot of ways. I mean, nobody
really deserves to earn that kind of money. So I feel like now I'm
responsible for handling it well and putting it to good use.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no precise figure for how many entrepreneurs have
turned to philanthropy in a major way, but the number of family and
community foundations in the country has more than doubled in the
last 15 years, and experts say there has been particular growth in
northern California and the Seattle area, where many high-tech
industries are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Community Foundation Silicon Valley has seen its
assets grow 25 to 40 percent in each of the past three years, and
expects contributions to double this year, said Peter Hero, the
president. It is now administering about 675 different
philanthropic funds that have been established by ``living,
breathing donors'' in the area, said Hero, most of whom are tied to
the high-tech industry in some way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word they use is `invest,''' he said. ``'How do I invest
in the community, how do I invest in education, and how do I
measure a societal return on that investment?' A lot of these
people are engineers. They're used to measuring things.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, Lovejoy and Gordon are members of Social
Venture Partners, which Brainerd describes in part as ``a safe
environment for people to learn where their passions lie.'' Many,
he say, come in feeling that they have been extraordinarily lucky
and wanting to give back something to the community, but unsure of
how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   The breakneck pace of the Internet industry seems to cut both
ways when it comes to philanthropy. ``For many people, hands-on in
Internet times means, I've got 10 minutes to give you here, 15
minutes there,'' said Denis Hayes, president of the Bullitt
Foundation, a non-profit fund that supports environmental
organizations in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, that is not unrelated to the phenomenon
that was involved in saving the Loomis,'' he added, referring to a
campaign last summer in which several high-tech entrepreneurs
quickly raised $13.1 million to preserve a magnificent swath of
forest in the North Cascade Mountains. ``It was like a super-fast
United Way campaign or something. Suddenly everyone piles on, and
they want to get up to the red line on that thermometer right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Gordon-Lovejoy Foundation has given out about
$120,000 in grants, most to environmental organizations and
projects that reflect the couple's interest in promoting
sustainable use of the earth's resources. The couple expects that
to grow as they add more to the fund and become more confident in
their choices.
</P>
<P>
   Lovejoy, in a conversation over a cup of tea the other day,
spoke at length about the ambivalence he felt during the
``all-consuming'' three years he put in with Amazon.com. He was
manager for financial systems in the information-technology group
when he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a person who necessarily tends to balance to begin
with, and I was just giving up on everything else,'' he said. ``I
mean, all the other things in my life _ keeping track of family,
keeping in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even playing ultimate frisbee, which is a big love of ours and
how we met,'' he said, looking at Gordon and breaking into a laugh.
``I mean, all those things just didn't matter.'' And so he left,
but he was quick to add that he learned a lot at the company that
he hopes to apply to his philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely convinced I can do anything that other people
think is impossible, because we did it regularly at Amazon,'' he
said. ``We did the impossible on a regular basis, and that's a
great experience to live through. And that's simply the attitude I
want to apply to what we're trying to do now.''

 &HT;    Super Show displaying lack of luster
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceThis 15th installment of the Super Show
<TEXT>
in Atlanta seems to lack the energy and synergy that have driven
past shows.
<P>
   The lack of superstars could be one reason since more
participating companies have decided to let merchandise and models
promote their business rather than the attraction of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Icon, a health and fitness company, was one of the few opting to
bring in a bona fide sports star. There was more than a two-hour
wait Thursday to see San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young,
who signed autographs for four hours, starting around lunch. The
line outside the huge Icon booth at the Georgia World Congress
Center stretched more than 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the show may lack its usual zip is that it's leaving
Atlanta after this year and moving to Las Vegas. The show has been
in Atlanta every February since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is different from other years, it could be because it's
a transition show,'' said Dave Tribble, who owns a local PR firm
and has handled the media for the Super Show since it came to
Atlanta. ``I've not had any experience with transition periods
before, but that might be a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   GET HEALTHY
</P>
<P>
   The health nut would have a field day at the 2000 Super Show.
The event features a line of healthful products that know no
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Power Lung is a company that offers weight training for your
lungs. Tanita says it's the No. 1 company in body fat monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Runner offered a line of space-age walking and running
machines that could have come straight out of a James Bond movie.
Heartalker offers a talking heart monitor.
</P>
<P>
   There were even 7-foot-tall capsules hooked up to hoses and
wires that were advertised as Aromatic Steam Capsules, which
stretched most folks' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO ...
</P>
<P>
   There is a company called Sunpentown Group that is displaying a
space-age bidet. It's referred to as simply a Super Clean Bidet.
</P>
<P>
   PAINTING THE TOWN
</P>
<P>
   If you thought paint ball was passe, think again. There are
thousands of square feet taken up by paint ball companies. If you
come by, you can take your shots at targets and sample the plethora
of colors available in the paint ball bullets.
</P>
<P>
   UNHEALTHY INDUSTRY?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wolfe, who worked for Spalding for several decades before
forming his own rep company, says the sports business may be on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these companies are going out of business,'' Wolfe
said. ``They've found out they simply can't make money. There are
too many Wal-Marts and stores like that who can undercut them on
price.''
</P>
<P>
   IMPOSSIBLE TO DODGE POWERBARS
</P>
<P>
   One thing has remained constant during most of the 15-year run
of the show. It's impossible to walk through the show for more than
an hour and not be handed a PowerBar. The latest favorite flavor
seemed to be peanut butter and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   GOING TO THE DOGS
</P>
<P>
   A new company in the mix is Glow Dog. Theoutfit makes stylish
reflective products for your pet. Glow Dog was started in 1997 and
made $85,000 that year before upping sales to more than $1.2
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   STICKING AROUND
</P>
<P>
   An old sport making a comeback is stickball. Spalding is out
with a pink Spaldeen ball and is selling slick, up-to-date
stickball bats.

JOB GROWTH IN `BRAIN' INDUSTRY DRIVING BAY STATE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In just five years, the Massachusetts economy has seen
explosive job growth in data processing, research, consulting and
other ``brain-intensive'' services, according to new government
data.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s economic expansion, the growth of these
services has propelled a near-doubling in the state's service
employment, from 545,398 in 1992 to 1.017 million in 1997, said
Craig Moore, University of Massachusetts professor of political
economy, in a new report. Moore based his analysis on new and more
detailed data on specific industries being released for the first
time by the US Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said that the jobs created in the knowledge-based service
industry are ``very well-paid positions'' that more than offset the
steep decline in the state's manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the old view of services, people would say, `That means
flipping hamburgers, and people in services don't make much money,'
'' Moore said. ``That's just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Service-industry pay ranges from an average about $11,000 a year
for employees of hotels and food service companies to an average of
$50,000 or more for business or other professional services, the
Commerce Department data show.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring of Massachusetts' high-tech economy has been
underway for more than a decade, since the decline of once-dominant
computer makers such as Digital Equipment Corp. That restructuring
continued during the 1991 recession and and accelerated as the
state and national economies boomed in the mid and late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The new government data reveal how dramatic the transformation
has been, not only in technology-related services but other
professional services. These brain-intensive services saw much
stronger growth in Massachusetts than in the nation as a whole, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   For example, overall employment in the US service industry grew
by 25 percent from 1992 through 1997. In Massachusetts, it grew 86
percent.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, total US manufacturing employment rose 4
percent, while Massachusetts manufacturers reduced their payrolls
27 percent, resulting in a loss in the state of 131,359
manufacturing jobs. The Commerce Department updates the industry
data every five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosperity we enjoy now,'' Moore wrote in his report, ``is
reflected in the changes that took place during the mid-1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kathy Bradbury, an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston, said a shift from manufacturing to services actually began
decades ago and has continued into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Citing federal non-farm employment data, she said manufacturing
has shrunk steadily over the past four decades. In 1969,
manufacturers provided 30 percent of all jobs in the state; that
figured declined to 13.5 percent last year. During the same period,
services surged from 19.7 percent of all jobs four decades ago to
36 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long-term trend, and it is a very strong trend _
there's no question,'' Bradbury said. The change was brought on by
``a shift in the mix of demand _ we're demanding more services
relative to goods.''
</P>
<P>
   A brisk expansion in services has helped offset a drop in
international exports by Massachusetts companies, said Andre Mayer,
senior vice president of The Alliance for the Commonwealth, which
tracks exports of manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
   After the Asian currency crisis slammed exports of manufactured
goods in 1998, goods exports began to recover last year due to
rising demand overseas.
</P>
<P>
   There are no data to measure exports of professional and
technology services, Mayer said. But, exports by services firms
such as Boston Consulting Group and State Street Corp. are clearly
playing a more important role in the state's export sector, he
said.

   ``The most rapid growth in our economy is in many of these
service fields, and we know those companies are involved
internationally,'' Mayer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet revolution has fueled much, though not all of the
growth in services, Commerce Department data show.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the information and publishing industry now employs
nearly 114,000 workers who earn $47,752, on average, per year.
Within this industry, software publishing has grown to one-quarter
of all jobs. Another quarter of the information and publishing
industry's jobs are in telecommunications and cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the software industry explains some of the growth
in the professional, scientific and technical job categories ,
where 188,329 workers in 1997 were paid on average, $52,100. Among
these workers, the largest groups are computer system designers,
management consultants, and research and development employees.
</P>
<P>
   Other large service industries important to the Massachusetts
economy are health care, which employed nearly 450,000; healthcare
workers, from doctors to receptionists, earned $28,332 on average.
The hotel and food-service industry employed 227,476, paying their
employees $11,348 on average.

 &HT;    New FAO Schwarz idea set for Mall of Georgia
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ FAO Schwarz has begun construction at the Mall of
Georgia on a store concept that's totally new for the upscale toy
retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The 20,000-square-foot store will be FAO Schwarz's first in the
country with the new look and will be one of three in the nation
with two floors of shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based retailer dropped its plans to be at the
Buford, Ga., mall last April but later changed its mind. The
opening is scheduled for mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to come to life,'' said company spokesman Alan
Marcus. ``We're going to take the brand and accentuate the
playfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Marcus would not describe the store's interior, he said
it will have a huge teddy bear. A 38-foot tall robot, almost as
tall as a full-grown Tyrannosaurus rex, will guard the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The store will be across from P.F. Chang's China Bistro and
Barnes &AMP; Noble, in the ``Village'' section of the mall, off
Interstate 85 and Ga. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, FAO Schwarz has had just one store in metro
Atlanta, a 5,000-square-foot site at Lenox Square mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``FAO doesn't do stores every five miles, and they do very few
flagship stores nationwide,'' Mall of Georgia co-developer Ben
Carter said of the retail complex's latest coup. ``It will be an
exciting year with these new tenants. Nordstrom will open, then
FAO, then Rich's.''
</P>
<P>
   FAO Schwarz, which is owned by Dutch retailer Vendex KBB, was
put in the national spotlight when Tom Hanks danced around on the
store's giant-sized piano in the movie ``Big.'' The retailer has
flagship stores in Manhattan, San Francisco, Chicago, Las Vegas,
and Orlando but also operates smaller stores in 38 cities across
the nation.

LAWMAKERS CAUTIOUS ABOUT PUBLIC BAILOUT FOR HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ Legislative leaders acknowledged Thursday that the
state may have to provide some financial backing to save Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care, but they said hospitals and other potential
investors should not assume that taxpayers will save the day.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, typically a tight-fisted
fiscal conservative, said that the Legislature could act quickly to
consider state-backed ``surplus notes'' or a low-interest loan for
Harvard Pilgrim _ if there are no solid proposals from private
investors and no other way to keep the health plan from
liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Finneran said he is ``hesitant to even say''
he's open to such possibilities because ``it's been a consistent
strategy of hospitals to get the taxpayers on the hook for this
situation. The preferable route is to have no taxpayer involvement
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, Mark C.
Montigny _ the Legislature's most outspoken opponent of selling
Harvard Pilgrim to a for-profit company _ said hospitals are making
a ``dangerous gamble'' if they assume the state will step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the hospitals are involved in a bit of a poker game on
this, it can have dangerous consequences,'' Montigny warned. ``They
should provide their last and best proposal tomorrow without
assuming the taxpayers will be providing resources.''
</P>
<P>
   With proposals from potential investors and buyers due Friday,
hospitals and state officials have engaged in a sort of
brinkmanship over the troubled HMO. State regulators hope that
hospitals, Harvard University, and other investors will agree to
invest $175 million in Harvard Pilgrim by buying surplus notes _ a
rescue plan that would keep the health plan nonprofit and allow it
to pay off hospital debts. The hospitals would demand a high
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives, who met Thursday to discuss a final
proposal, have indicated that there may be no deal unless the state
agrees to guarantee their investment. They want the Legislature to
step in and pay back their high-risk investment if the HMO
defaults.
</P>
<P>
   While Finneran said last month that he would not rule out state
aid, Thursday's comments were more detailed and came at a critical
juncture. He said that he would consider a ``creative'' plan that
would put the state at risk for part of the payments, but that he
would not let the hospitals off the hook entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals seem to want complete immunity from risk as part of
the solution,'' he said. ``I would want to make sure that Harvard
Pilgrim has every incentive to pay back the money and to improve
its performance. The taxpayers did not create this problem. . . .
And I'm here to make sure they're not assaulted by every interest
that's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Montigny agreed that ``we should be looking for a balanced
solution that shares the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The state could loan Harvard Pilgrim the money directly, similar
to the no-interest $12.1 million loan that the Legislature approved
in October for Quincy Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I would not rule it out,'' Finneran said. ``The
philosophical questions are all the same _ the Quincy Hospital
situation was also a situation of its own doing. The loan
arrangement was a way to recognize that Quincy Hospital
acknowledged the problem and mistakes that led to that circumstance
and also had a plan to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   But Finneran pointed out that the the Legislature attached a
unique condition to the Quincy Hospital loan: If the hospital fails
to repay the money beginning in 2005 the state will deduct the
payments from its local aid to Quincy. Finneran said he would need
``creative minds'' to come up with a comparable condition for
Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his office has not done an analysis of the
potential cost of a Harvard Pilgrim bailout because it was
premature. But he said that by early next week, after Attorney
General Thomas F. Reilly and investment bankers have time to review
the proposals, he would know whether state involvement is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For-profit companies including Cigna Corp., Anthem Insurance
Cos., and Oxford Health Plans signed confidentiality agreements
that allowed them to examine Harvard Pilgrim's books. But it
remains to be seen whether they will submit formal proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be in the position of beggars, and beggars may not be
choosers,'' Finneran said. ``Today we're not beggars. But I don't
know where there will be options _ profit or nonprofit. It all
depends on the proposals that are put forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Before putting the issue before the Legislature, Finneran said,
he would want to know the schedules for when employers pick new
health insurance plans and act in advance of those deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would probably want to proceed with some caution . . . but
would not want to have a legislative process that is so elaborate
and drawn out that we run into open enrollment and have negative
consequences because of lack of legislative response.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said early this week that he did did not know whether he
would have an announcement Friday. But by the end of the weekend,
Legislators should have some idea whether any of the proposals are
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see what comes forward and then see what, if any,
role the state can play _ and I stress `if any,' '' Montigny said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's some responsible role where we can be helpful to a
solution, we'll be open to it. But in terms of taxpayers bailing
out an institution, I think that's a bad precedent.''

CARTER WRIST WOES DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It sounds eerily familiar _ a Bruins forward who can't
take faceoffs or battle as effectively as he would like because of
a wrist injury.
</P>
<P>
   That's what put center Jason Allison on the shelf after trying
for months to still play. Now, right-wing-turned-center Anson
Carter is struggling with a right wrist injury, too.
</P>
<P>
   Against Washington Tuesday, coach Pat Burns said he looked up
and wing Dave Andreychuk was taking faceoffs, just as he did when
Allison wasn't able to.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who will suit up Friday night when the Bruins take on
the Rangers in New York, underwent an MRI Wednesday. He also had an
MRI on his shoulder, initially injured earlier in the season. He
was awaiting the results of the tests Thursday. Carter, a key to
the Bruins' postseason chances, said it isn't much fun and the
Allison comparison is not lost on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost scary,'' he said. ``I talk to Ally about it all
the time and see the things he went through. Right now, I'm not
taking any faceoffs for awhile. I didn't want to make a big deal
out of the wrist situation but it is a problem. I might take a
couple and see how it feels but at this point, I'm going through
the same thing Ally went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. You're trying to battle through practice and
trying to take shots. You're trying to stay sharp but at the same
time you don't want to overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest hasn't helped, which is also troublesome. With so many
players already playing out of position, the club can't afford to
have Carter ailing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hurts when I take slap shots and battling for
pucks,'' said Carter. ``I'm still trying to find a way to get
around that and changing my body position so I don't have to reach
and use my stick and use my wrist. Doing so, you're losing 3 or 4
feet because you use your stick so much during the game that now
you're having to make up that space with your body position. I was
off a little bit in the last game (Tuesday against Washington).''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he isn't as strong on the puck as he'd like to be
and his ability to score has been affected, despite setting up
Andreychuk for a nice goal against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of chances I had against Toronto when I first did it,
all I had to do was skate into it and tee it right up and hammer it
and I couldn't,'' he said of the Feb. 3 contest. ``I fluttered one
right into (goalie Curtis) Joseph's pads. (The Andreychuk goal) was
a matter of sucking it up and playing, I have to pick my spots.
There's no way I can be dominant on the puck all the time. I have
to know when I can be and when I can't be and really get a sense of
when I have the opportunity to bear down and make a play happen, it
has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at practice, Carter said there are certain motions that
cause him no discomfort and others, well . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a pass from Don Sweeney on my backhand and the pain
just was shooting up my arm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his wrist problems, Carter said he's impressed with the
new strategy the Bruins have been using the last several weeks _
abandoning the neutral-zone trap for an attack that matches power
for power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely worked really well,'' said Carter. ``We have
the right number of horses in the locker room who can play a lot of
minutes. I think everyone is starting to realize their jobs and
their roles. We're a pretty good trapping team, too. But I think we
had become lazy, we were sort of using the trap as a crutch. We
weren't moving our legs because we thought we didn't have to get
there because we're supposed to trap and everything is all hunky
dory. Well, that wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the club is using two players to forecheck and that has
made everyone more accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The onus is on the players to get on their horses and start to
skate and if you don't, it's pretty clear and pretty obvious and
(Burns) isn't going to put you on the ice,'' said Carter. ``So I
think this gets more guys involved. You hear people saying that
guys have tuned out the coaching staff. Well, that's not it at all.
It's that we became comfortable in the trap and instead of playing
the aggressive trap, we were playing the soft trap and we ran into
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hulbig (groin injury) made the trip although he's not
expected to play Friday . . . Defenseman Marty McSorley is also
expected to be sidelined for a third straight game because of a
shoulder injury. ``His shoulder lit up like a Christmas tree in
that MRI,'' said Burns. ``There are a lot of injuries in there,
there are a lot of old-time fist-swinging injuries in that thing.
He'll have to get that repaired probably at the end of his
career.'' . . . Burns said goalie Byron Dafoe will likely get every
start for the forseeable future. ``We have no choice,'' said the
coach . . . Right wing Joe Murphy, who was canned by the Bruins for
insubordination, surfaced with the Washington Capitals, who claimed
him off waivers Thursday.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    CURACA, Brazil _ As a blue flash appears across the evening sky,
Antonio Marcal dos Santos comes running through his backyard
yelling, ``Here he comes.''
 &HT;    Dos Santos is one of many peasants who watch over the blue Spix
macaw (cyanopsitta spixii), the last of its species to survive in
the wild. ``It gives me great satisfaction each day to know that he
is still alive,'' says the goatherd at his home near this small
northeastern town in Bahia.
 &HT;    The Spix macaw, the world's rarest wild bird, is the most
extreme example of the consequences of animal trafficking, a
worldwide business that is second only to drugs and arms in illegal
commerce. ``He is the last of the Mohicans, a symbol of resistance
against animal traffickers,'' says Francisco Neo, coordinator of
wildlife and flora for the federal environmental protection agency
known as Ibama.
 &HT;    Nobody knows exactly how much traffickers earn from the world's
illicit animal trade, but Interpol, an international police group,
estimates annual sales at US$5 billion, with Americans ranking as
the most frequent customers. ``The United States is undoubtedly the
world's largest wildlife-consuming country and center of commerce
for the world's animals,'' according to Traffic, the monitoring arm
of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF).
 &HT;    In Brazil, tropical birds such as the Spix macaw, along with
reptiles and small monkeys, bring in as much as $700 million a year
from collectors, pet shops and scientific institutions, says the
National Network Against Wild Animal Trafficking (known by its
Portuguese acronym as Renctas), an independent Rio-based
organization. And the rarer the species, the higher the price. The
Spix macaw, for example, would sell for as much as $60,000,
according to Renctas.
 &HT;    In South America, Brazil, Colombia and Peru are home to animal
traffickers' favorite fauna, while Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay
typically serve as transit points for Asia, Europe and the United
States. Peru, with its varied geography of desert and jungle, is a
prime hunting ground for iguanas, crocodiles and anacondas. In
recent years, outdoor animal markets selling such exotic animals
have been found even in downtown Lima. In Colombia, the second
richest after Brazil in biological diversity, poaching has driven
several parrot species to the brink of extinction. Leftist
guerrillas, however, have recently reduced the trade by banning
peasants from hunting wildlife in the Andean territories under
their control.
 &HT;    To be sure, deforestation, hunting and poverty have also helped
decimate regional wildlife. But most experts agree that the big
business of animal trafficking has played a major role in
endangering 218 Brazilian species, including 109 birds, 68 mammals,
31 invertebrates, nine reptiles and one amphibian, according to the
Belo Horizonte-based Biodiversitas Foundation.
 &HT;    Poaching is so prevalent that 30 percent of the Rio de Janeiro
zoo's 2,800 animals were acquired as the result of police raids on
traffickers, including 900 in July alone, says Marcio Martins,
president of the Rio Zoo Foundation.
 &HT;    Dener Giovanini, general coordinator of Renctas, says most
Brazilian wildlife is trapped by poor villagers in the impoverished
north and brought to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's largest
cities, by truckers and bus drivers. Police say endangered animals
are then smuggled out at airports or ports or sold at outdoor
markets. According to the authorities, there are 100 such markets
each week in Rio de Janeiro state alone. ``These traffickers are as
well organized as the drug and arms mafias,'' says Giovanini.
 &HT;    In recent months, Brazilian authorities have stepped up their
campaign to end animal trafficking by teaming for the first time
with the year-old Renctas and federal agency Ibama. ``Since many
species are near extinction, even politicians are listening to us
now,'' says Elizabeth MacGregor, Brazil representative for the
World Society for the Protection of Animals. ``And in every
Brazilian city, there is some type of organization that protects
animals.''
 &HT;    Results are becoming apparent. In February 1999, a U.S.
naturalized citizen named Manoel Lourenco Galo was arrested in Sao
Paulo trying to smuggle to Pennsylvania 24 hyacinth macaw eggs
estimated to be worth $10,000 each. Several months later, two more
traffickers were arrested trying to smuggle out blue Lear macaws,
whose population has dwindled to just 150. Like its cousin the
Spix, the Lear can earn a trafficker thousands of dollars on the
international market. And in August 1999, authorities confiscated
11 jungle animals from the private zoo of a federal senator named
Ludio Coelho, including two non-endangered macaws in poor
condition.
 &HT;    Moreover, police raids on outdoor city markets are becoming
routine. On a recent Sunday, 30 members of the Rio forestry
battalion donned flak jackets, packed rifles, and raided two such
markets in the suburban cities of Duque de Caxias and Sao Goncalo,
nabbing 174 live wild birds and six turtles crammed into crude
wooden cages. Each raid lasted about 15 minutes.
 &HT;    At Duque de Caxias, police fanned out through rows of live
birds, chickens, guinea pigs, dogs, parakeets and turtles, looking
under benches, parked cars and even in the bathrooms of local bars.
At Sao Goncalo, several men ran behind a church as police arrived.
No arrests were made at either market. ``We have to get in and get
out quickly so people don't get upset,'' says Major Jose Mauricio
Padrone, of the Rio Forestry Police Battalion, who led the raids.
``Many think the law is foolish.''
 &HT;    Many Brazilians believe banning the collection, transport or
sale of any wildlife without proper permits is too strict. Hunting
is also outlawed everywhere except in the southern state of Rio
Grande do Sul. Padrone and other law enforcement officials,
however, complain that Brazilian judges typically let traffickers
of even rare fauna go after paying a small bail. ``We bust them and
they are out in a few hours or the next day,'' he says. ``It's not
a priority for the justice system.''
 &HT;    Currently, anti-trafficking groups are pressuring the government
of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to beef up enforcement by
placing federal agents at every international airport and port,
and, in each state, creating centers in which police can house
confiscated wildlife. ``The government has to devise a concrete
program if we are going to win this war,'' says animal activist
Giovanini.
 &HT;    In Curaca, the Blue Macaw Project appears to be an exception to
the federal government's policy of neglect. After the discovery of
the lone wild Spix_ -there are others in captivity _ in 1990, the
government immediately mounted an unprecedented effort to save the
bird from extinction. It formed an international commission of
official agencies, scientists and private groups to stop
traffickers and promote the species' regeneration. The committee
includes the Houston Zoo and the World Wildlife Fund.
 &HT;    Many Curaca residents have also joined in as protectors. A large
sign on the town's outskirts says, ``Welcome to the Home of the
Blue Macaw.'' At the ``Little Blue Macaw School'' elementary
students write poetry about the rare bird and draw his picture.
``Leave him alone; he's the last,'' wrote 15-year-old fourth-grader
Geovane Jesus in a recent writing exercise, and Marcal dos Santos
spends hours whittling the Spix's image out of wood to sell to the
few birdwatchers who visit the area.
 &HT;    ``The people here see him as a symbol of their lives in the
drought-plagued northeast,'' says biologist Yara de Melo Barros,
the project's field coordinator. ``He confronts life's adversities
just as they do.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    CURACA, Brazil _ As a blue flash appears across the evening sky,
Antonio Marcal dos Santos comes running through his backyard
yelling, ``Here he comes.''
 &HT;    Dos Santos is one of many peasants who watch over the blue Spix
macaw (cyanopsitta spixii), the last of its species to survive in
the wild. ``It gives me great satisfaction each day to know that he
is still alive,'' says the goatherd at his home near this small
northeastern town in Bahia.
 &HT;    The Spix macaw, the world's rarest wild bird, is the most
extreme example of the consequences of animal trafficking, a
worldwide business that is second only to drugs and arms in illegal
commerce. ``He is the last of the Mohicans, a symbol of resistance
against animal traffickers,'' says Francisco Neo, coordinator of
wildlife and flora for the federal environmental protection agency
known as Ibama.
 &HT;    Nobody knows exactly how much traffickers earn from the world's
illicit animal trade, but Interpol, an international police group,
estimates annual sales at US$5 billion, with Americans ranking as
the most frequent customers. ``The United States is undoubtedly the
world's largest wildlife-consuming country and center of commerce
for the world's animals,'' according to Traffic, the monitoring arm
of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF).
 &HT;    In Brazil, tropical birds such as the Spix macaw, along with
reptiles and small monkeys, bring in as much as $700 million a year
from collectors, pet shops and scientific institutions, says the
National Network Against Wild Animal Trafficking (known by its
Portuguese acronym as Renctas), an independent Rio-based
organization. And the rarer the species, the higher the price. The
Spix macaw, for example, would sell for as much as $60,000,
according to Renctas.
 &HT;    In South America, Brazil, Colombia and Peru are home to animal
traffickers' favorite fauna, while Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay
typically serve as transit points for Asia, Europe and the United
States. Peru, with its varied geography of desert and jungle, is a
prime hunting ground for iguanas, crocodiles and anacondas. In
recent years, outdoor animal markets selling such exotic animals
have been found even in downtown Lima. In Colombia, the second
richest after Brazil in biological diversity, poaching has driven
several parrot species to the brink of extinction. Leftist
guerrillas, however, have recently reduced the trade by banning
peasants from hunting wildlife in the Andean territories under
their control.
 &HT;    To be sure, deforestation, hunting and poverty have also helped
decimate regional wildlife. But most experts agree that the big
business of animal trafficking has played a major role in
endangering 218 Brazilian species, including 109 birds, 68 mammals,
31 invertebrates, nine reptiles and one amphibian, according to the
Belo Horizonte-based Biodiversitas Foundation.
 &HT;    Poaching is so prevalent that 30 percent of the Rio de Janeiro
zoo's 2,800 animals were acquired as the result of police raids on
traffickers, including 900 in July alone, says Marcio Martins,
president of the Rio Zoo Foundation.
 &HT;    Dener Giovanini, general coordinator of Renctas, says most
Brazilian wildlife is trapped by poor villagers in the impoverished
north and brought to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's largest
cities, by truckers and bus drivers. Police say endangered animals
are then smuggled out at airports or ports or sold at outdoor
markets. According to the authorities, there are 100 such markets
each week in Rio de Janeiro state alone. ``These traffickers are as
well organized as the drug and arms mafias,'' says Giovanini.
 &HT;    In recent months, Brazilian authorities have stepped up their
campaign to end animal trafficking by teaming for the first time
with the year-old Renctas and federal agency Ibama. ``Since many
species are near extinction, even politicians are listening to us
now,'' says Elizabeth MacGregor, Brazil representative for the
World Society for the Protection of Animals. ``And in every
Brazilian city, there is some type of organization that protects
animals.''
 &HT;    Results are becoming apparent. In February 1999, a U.S.
naturalized citizen named Manoel Lourenco Galo was arrested in Sao
Paulo trying to smuggle to Pennsylvania 24 hyacinth macaw eggs

 &HT;    From beach-ready chair to vibrating fabric, sports products make
debut at Super Show
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes the most obvious item hasn't been invented,
and next thing you know it's on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Take the WearEver Chair. The lightweight chair with a headrest
and storage component doubles as a backpack. Slip it on, and you're
ready to hit the beach or an outdoor concert.
</P>
<P>
   From that chair to fabric that vibrates, the sporting industry's
latest products made their debut at the Super Show in Atlanta on
Thursday. The event at the Georgia World Congress Center and
Georgia Dome runs through Sunday. It isn't open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers and retailers are getting a sneak preview of the
innovative equipment and apparel manufacturers will soon be mass
producing. For the general public, that means those hot new items
will be making it to store shelves this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Welsh, owner and inventor of the WearEver Chair, strutted
around the trade show with his sitting device slipped onto his
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't anyone think of this,'' the
journalist-turned-inventor pondered. As his business card reads,
Welsh is the ``chair-man'' of Torrance, Calif.-based WelCom.
</P>
<P>
   His latest high-back model, priced at $60, should hit REI and
other stores within the next two months. The chair adjusts to four
reclining positions and boasts a cell phone pouch, fishing pole
holder and storage area roomy enough to hold a cooler. A cheaper
model, made of steel instead of aluminum, will be in Wal-Mart for
$19.95 in the next few days. Welsh said some 50,000 are in a
warehouse in Douglas in South Georgia right now.
</P>
<P>
   Since business began 18 months ago, Welsh said he has sold
200,000 chairs for an initial investment of $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any clue what I was getting into,'' he said.
``I'm trying to get filthy, stinkin' rich, but so far, I'm filthy
and stinkin'.''
</P>
<P>
   InfoEye Technologies Inc., a Santa Barbara, Calif., company
started last spring, hopes to make it big with its fiber-optic Time
Window 2000. The device, one of the hottest items at the show,
features a display that clips onto sports eyeglasses and swim
goggles, providing heart rate, stop watch and other functions.
</P>
<P>
   The Time Window 2000 retails for $89 to $130 (with the heart
monitor) and should be available by late summer. It's one of the 20
products competing for the Super Show's Nasdaq-Amex Sports Product
of the Year Award. The winner will be selected later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other Product of the Year semifinalists include the Shape 2000
jogbra by Champion with special support and cup construction that
doesn't compress; and Sterling Sports' inflatable chair decorated
with NFL football team logos and built-in stereo speakers that plug
into a boom box or television.
</P>
<P>
   While other products didn't make it as finalists, they are just
as interesting. For instance, Illumination Polymer Technologies
Inc. has come up with a cap with red digital displays that light up
the name of your favorite sports team. Coleman, the camping and
outdoor equipment giant, had an inflatable chair, and Holofiber had
vibrating fabric.
</P>
<P>
   As he passed by Illumination Polymer's display case, David
Marler, owner of Kennesaw, Ga.-based Express Products Inc., said
the caps looked cool. But he added, ``Us bald-headed guys don't
need to call attention to ourselves.'' Marler's company supplies
decorative apparel for the cheerleading industry.
</P>
<P>
   His consultant friend, Tate Chalk, pointed to the comfortable
Coleman chair. Chalk liked the chair, but thought the army green
color was all wrong. It would look better in neon, he said. The
chair also didn't have the stereo or NFL logo.
</P>
<P>
   David Horinek, co-founder of Holofiber Inc., so far has been
disappointed, but is still hopeful of making a splash at the show.
Holofiber is made with spun yarn that contains a ceramic substance
that makes the fabric vibrate when it's worn.
</P>
<P>
   Horinek claims fabric made from the yarn helps relieve muscle
and joint problems by massaging the body and ``increasing the
peripheral blood flow by 15 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Horinek seven years to get Holofiber off the
ground, and so far he's signed on Adidas to use the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to function optimally,'' Horinek said.

   Kerry Welsh, owner and inventor of the WearEver Chair, strutted
around the trade show with his sitting device slipped onto his
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't anyone think of this,'' the
journalist-turned-inventor pondered. As his business card reads,
Welsh is the ``chair-man'' of Torrance, Calif.-based WelCom.
</P>
<P>
   His latest high-back model, priced at $60, should hit REI and
other stores within the next two months. The chair adjusts to four
reclining positions and boasts a cell phone pouch, fishing pole
holder and storage area roomy enough to hold a cooler. A cheaper
model, made of steel instead of aluminum, will be in Wal-Mart for
$19.95 in the next few days. Welsh said some 50,000 are in a
warehouse in Douglas in South Georgia right now.
</P>
<P>
   Since business began 18 months ago, Welsh said he has sold
200,000 chairs for an initial investment of $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any clue what I was getting into,'' he said.
``I'm trying to get filthy, stinkin' rich, but so far, I'm filthy
and stinkin'.''
</P>
<P>
   InfoEye Technologies Inc., a Santa Barbara, Calif., company
started last spring, hopes to make it big with its fiber-optic Time
Window 2000. The device, one of the hottest items at the show,
features a display that clips onto sports eyeglasses and swim
goggles, providing heart rate, stop watch and other functions.
</P>
<P>
   The Time Window 2000 retails for $89 to $130 (with the heart
monitor) and should be available by late summer. It's one of the 20
products competing for the Super Show's Nasdaq-Amex Sports Product
of the Year Award. The winner will be selected later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other Product of the Year semifinalists include the Shape 2000
jogbra by Champion with special support and cup construction that
doesn't compress; and Sterling Sports' inflatable chair decorated
with NFL football team logos and built-in stereo speakers that plug
into a boom box or television.
</P>
<P>
   While other products didn't make it as finalists, they are just
as interesting. For instance, Illumination Polymer Technologies
Inc. has come up with a cap with red digital displays that light up
the name of your favorite sports team. Coleman, the camping and
outdoor equipment giant, had an inflatable chair, and Holofiber had
vibrating fabric.
</P>
<P>
   As he passed by Illumination Polymer's display case, David
Marler, owner of Kennesaw, Ga.-based Express Products Inc., said
the caps looked cool. But he added, ``Us bald-headed guys don't
need to call attention to ourselves.'' Marler's company supplies
decorative apparel for the cheerleading industry.
</P>
<P>
   His consultant friend, Tate Chalk, pointed to the comfortable
Coleman chair. Chalk liked the chair, but thought the army green
color was all wrong. It would look better in neon, he said. The
chair also didn't have the stereo or NFL logo.
</P>
<P>
   David Horinek, co-founder of Holofiber Inc., so far has been
disappointed, but is still hopeful of making a splash at the show.
Holofiber is made with spun yarn that contains a ceramic substance
that makes the fabric vibrate when it's worn.
</P>
<P>
   Horinek claims fabric made from the yarn helps relieve muscle
and joint problems by massaging the body and ``increasing the
peripheral blood flow by 15 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Horinek seven years to get Holofiber off the
ground, and so far he's signed on Adidas to use the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to function optimally,'' Horinek said.

   NETRICH-CHARITY (Seattle) _ The Internet has created a spate of
young millionaires, and many of them are turning their attention to
philanthropy in their own ways. They describe their activities as
``venture philanthropy,'' modeled on their business experiences,

finding ways to make charitable giving easier. Rather than giving

 &HT;    Super Show displaying lack of luster
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceThis 15th installment of the Super Show
<TEXT>
in Atlanta seems to lack the energy and synergy that have driven
past shows.
<P>
   The lack of superstars could be one reason since more
participating companies have decided to let merchandise and models
promote their business rather than the attraction of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Icon, a health and fitness company, was one of the few opting to
bring in a bona fide sports star. There was more than a two-hour
wait Thursday to see San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young,
who signed autographs for four hours, starting around lunch. The
line outside the huge Icon booth at the Georgia World Congress
Center stretched more than 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the show may lack its usual zip is that it's leaving
Atlanta after this year and moving to Las Vegas. The show has been
in Atlanta every February since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is different from other years, it could be because it's
a transition show,'' said Dave Tribble, who owns a local PR firm
and has handled the media for the Super Show since it came to
Atlanta. ``I've not had any experience with transition periods
before, but that might be a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   GET HEALTHY
</P>
<P>
   The health nut would have a field day at the 2000 Super Show.
The event features a line of healthful products that know no
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Power Lung is a company that offers weight training for your
lungs. Tanita says it's the No. 1 company in body fat monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Runner offered a line of space-age walking and running
machines that could have come straight out of a James Bond movie.
Heartalker offers a talking heart monitor.
</P>
<P>
   There were even 7-foot-tall capsules hooked up to hoses and
wires that were advertised as Aromatic Steam Capsules, which
stretched most folks' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO ...
</P>
<P>
   There is a company called Sunpentown Group that is displaying a
space-age bidet. It's referred to as simply a Super Clean Bidet.
</P>
<P>
   PAINTING THE TOWN
</P>
<P>
   If you thought paint ball was passe, think again. There are
thousands of square feet taken up by paint ball companies. If you
come by, you can take your shots at targets and sample the plethora
of colors available in the paint ball bullets.
</P>
<P>
   UNHEALTHY INDUSTRY?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wolfe, who worked for Spalding for several decades before
forming his own rep company, says the sports business may be on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these companies are going out of business,'' Wolfe
said. ``They've found out they simply can't make money. There are
too many Wal-Marts and stores like that who can undercut them on
price.''
</P>
<P>
   IMPOSSIBLE TO DODGE POWERBARS
</P>
<P>
   One thing has remained constant during most of the 15-year run
of the show. It's impossible to walk through the show for more than
an hour and not be handed a PowerBar. The latest favorite flavor
seemed to be peanut butter and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   GOING TO THE DOGS
</P>
<P>
   A new company in the mix is Glow Dog. Theoutfit makes stylish
reflective products for your pet. Glow Dog was started in 1997 and
made $85,000 that year before upping sales to more than $1.2
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   STICKING AROUND
</P>
<P>
   An old sport making a comeback is stickball. Spalding is out
with a pink Spaldeen ball and is selling slick, up-to-date
stickball bats.

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CURACA, Brasil _ Cuando un relampago azul cruza el cielo
nocturno, Antonio Marcal dos Santos se acerca corriendo por el
patio y grita: ''Ahi viene!''
 &HT;    Dos Santos es uno de muchos campesinos que observan al guacamayo
Spix azul (cyanopsitta spixii), el ultimo de su especie que
sobrevive en la selva. ``Cada dia me da una gran satisfaccion saber
que todavia esta vivo,'' dice el pastor de cabras en su casa, cerca
de este pequeno pueblo de Bahia.
 &HT;    El guacamayo Spix, el ave salvaje mas rara del mundo, es el
ejemplo mas extremo de las consecuencias del trafico de animales,
un negocio mundial solo superado en el comercio ilicito por las
drogas y las armas. ``Es el ultimo de los mohicanos, un simbolo de
resistencia contra los traficantes de animales,'' dice Francisco
Neo, coordinador de flora y fauna en la direccion federal de
proteccion ambiental conocida como Ibama.
 &HT;    Nadie sabe exactamente cuanto ganan los que comercian
ilegalmente con animales, pero la Interpol calcula que las ventas
alcanzan US$5.000 millones al ano y que los norteamericanos son los
que mas compran. ``Estados Unidos es el pais con mas demanda de
animales salvajes en todo el mundo y centro mundial del comercio de
animales,'' segun Traffic, rama de supervision del World Wildlife
Fund for Nature (WWF).
 &HT;    Los coleccionistas, las tiendas y las instituciones cientificas
pagan hasta US$700 millones al ano por aves tropicales de Brasil
como el guacamayo Spix, ademas de reptiles y monos pequenos, segun
la Red Nacional Contra el Trafico de Animales Salvajes (Renctas),
organizacion independiente de Rio de Janeiro. Y mientras mas rara
es la especie, mas alto es el precio. Por el guacamayo Spix, por
ejemplo, se paga hasta US$60.000, informa Renctas.
 &HT;    En Brasil, Colombia y Peru viven los animales favoritos de los
traficantes, mientras Argentina, Paraguay y Uruguay suelen ser
puntos de transito para Asia, Europa y Estados Unidos. Peru, con su
variada geografia de desierto y selva, es un gran coto de caza de
iguanas, cocodrilos y anacondas. En los ultimos anos, se han
detectado hasta en el centro de Lima mercados al aire libre donde
se venden esos animales. En Colombia, segundo pais despues de
Brasil en diversidad biologica, la caza ilegal ha llevado a varias
especies de cotorras al borde de la extincion. Pero la guerrilla ha
reducido recientemente el comercio al prohibir a los campesinos que
cacen en los territorios andinos que controlan.
 &HT;    La deforestacion, la caza y la pobreza han diezmado a la fauna
de la region. La mayoria de los expertos coincide en que el gran
negocio del trafico de animales ha puesto en peligro de extincion a
218 especies brasilenas (109 aves, 68 mamiferos, 31 invertebrados,
nueve reptiles y un anfibio), segun la Fundacion Biodiversitas, de
Belo Horizonte.
 &HT;    La caza ilegal esta tan extendida que el 30 por ciento de los
2.800 animales del zoologico de Rio de Janeiro provienen de las
redadas de la policia contra los traficantes de animales, dice
Marcio Martins, presidente de la Fundacion Zoologica de Rio. Solo
en julio se adquirieron 90 animales.
 &HT;    Dener Giovanini, coordinador general de Renctas, dice que la
mayor parte de los animales en Brasil son capturados por campesinos
pobres del norte, y luego camioneros y conductores de autobuses los
llevan a Sao Paulo y Rio de Janeiro. La policia dice que despues
los contrabandistas sacan a los animales por los puertos y
aeropuertos, o los venden en mercados al aire libre. Segun las
autoridades, cada semana hay 100 mercados de ese tipo solo en el
estado de Rio de Janeiro. ``Estos traficantes estan tan bien
organizados como las mafias de las drogas y las armas,'' dice
Giovanini.
 &HT;    En meses recientes, las autoridades brasilenas han arreciado su
campana contra el trafico de animales, asociandose con Renctas,
establecida hace un ano, y con la entidad federal Ibama. ``Como
muchas especies estan al borde de la extincion, ahora hasta los
politicos nos escuchan,'' dice Elizabeth MacGregor, representante
en Brasil de la Sociedad Mundial de Proteccion de los Animales. ``Y
en cada ciudad brasilena hay algun tipo de organizacion que protege
a los animales.''
 &HT;    Los resultados ya saltan a la vista. En febrero de 1999, el
ciudadano norteamericano Manoel Lourenco Galo fue arrestado en Sao
Paulo cuando trataba de sacar de contrabando a Pennsylvania 24
huevos de guacamayo azul purpura con un valor de US$10.000 cada
uno. Meses despues, dos traficantes mas fueron arrestados cuando se
disponian a sacar de contrabando guacamayos Lear azules, cuyo
numero se ha reducido a solo 150. Como su primo el Spix, con el
Lear un traficante puede ganar miles de dolares en el mercado
internacional. En agosto de 1999, las autoridades confiscaron 11
animales selvaticos del zoologico privado de un senador federal
llamado Ludio Coelho, entre ellos dos guacamayos enfermos.
 &HT;    Ademas, las redadas policiales en los mercados al aire libre ya
son cosa de rutina. Un domingo reciente, 30 miembros del batallon
de guardabosques de Rio, con fusiles y chalecos blindados, tomaron
por asalto dos de esos mercados en Duque de Caxias y Sao Goncalo y
rescataron 174 pajaros y seis tortugas.
 &HT;    En Duque de Caxias, la policia avanzo por entre hileras de
pajaros, pollos, curieles, perros, pericos y tortugas, mirando
debajo de los bancos, los autos estacionados y hasta en los banos
de los bares. En Sao Goncalo, varios hombres corrieron hacia la
parte trasera de una iglesia cuando la policia llego. No se arresto
a nadie.
 &HT;    ``Tenemos que entrar y salir rapidamente para que la gente no se
disguste,'' dice el mayor Jose Mauricio Padrone, del batallon de
guardabosques de la policia de Rio, que dirigio los asaltos.
``Muchos piensan que la ley es tonta.''
 &HT;    Muchos brasilenos opinan que prohibir la captura, transporte y
venta de un animal salvaje sin los permisos adecuados es demasiado
estricto. Cazar tambien esta prohibido en todas partes, excepto en
el estado de Rio Grande do Sul. Pero Padrone y otros agentes de la
ley se quejan de que los jueces suelen dejar en libertad a los
traficantes de animales tras pagar una pequena fianza. ``Los
arrestamos y salen en unas horas o al dia siguiente,'' dice
Padrone. ``No es una prioridad de la justicia.''
 &HT;    Los grupos contra el trafico presionan al gobierno del
presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso para que refuerce la
vigilancia colocando agentes federales en cada puerto maritimo y
aeropuerto internacional, y creando ademas en cada estado centros
para albergar a los animales salvajes confiscados por la policia.
``El gobierno tiene que trazar un programa concreto si se quiere
ganar esta guerra,'' dice el activista Giovanini.
 &HT;    En Curaca, el Proyecto del Guacamayo Azul parece ser una
excepcion de la politica de negligencia del gobierno federal.
Despues del descubrimiento del solitario Spix (hay otros en
cautividad) en 1990, el gobierno inmediatamente organizo una
campana sin precedentes para salvar al ave y tambien formo una
comision internacional de organismos oficiales, cientificos y
grupos privados para detener a los traficantes y promover la
regeneracion de la especie. En la comision participan el Zoologico
de Houston y el World Wildlife Fund.
 &HT;    Muchos vecinos de Curaca tambien colaboran como protectores. En
las afueras del pueblo hay un gran cartel que dice: ``Bienvenidos
al hogar del guacamayo azul.'' En la escuela primaria ``El
Guacamayo Azul,'' los alumnos escriben poemas sobre el ave y la
dibujan. ``Dejenlo solo; es el ultimo,'' escribio Geovane Jesus,
estudiante de 15 anos de edad que esta en cuarto grado, en un
reciente ejercicio de redaccion, y Marcal dos Santos pasa horas
tallando la imagen del Spix en madera para venderla a los pocos
observadores de pajaros que visitan la comarca.
 &HT;    ``La gente lo ve como un simbolo de sus vidas en el Nordeste,
plagado por la sequia,'' dice la biologa Yara de Melo Barros,
coordinadora del proyecto en el terreno. ``El ave se enfrenta a las
adversidades de la vida igual que ellos.''

 &HT;    CURACA, Brasil _ Cuando un relampago azul cruza el cielo
nocturno, Antonio Marcal dos Santos se acerca corriendo por el
patio y grita: ''Ahi viene!''
 &HT;    Dos Santos es uno de muchos campesinos que observan al guacamayo
Spix azul (cyanopsitta spixii), el ultimo de su especie que
sobrevive en la selva. ``Cada dia me da una gran satisfaccion saber
que todavia esta vivo,'' dice el pastor de cabras en su casa, cerca
de este pequeno pueblo de Bahia.
 &HT;    El guacamayo Spix, el ave salvaje mas rara del mundo, es el
ejemplo mas extremo de las consecuencias del trafico de animales,
un negocio mundial solo superado en el comercio ilicito por las
drogas y las armas. ``Es el ultimo de los mohicanos, un simbolo de
resistencia contra los traficantes de animales,'' dice Francisco
Neo, coordinador de flora y fauna en la direccion federal de
proteccion ambiental conocida como Ibama.
 &HT;    Nadie sabe exactamente cuanto ganan los que comercian
ilegalmente con animales, pero la Interpol calcula que las ventas
alcanzan US$5.000 millones al ano y que los norteamericanos son los
que mas compran. ``Estados Unidos es el pais con mas demanda de
animales salvajes en todo el mundo y centro mundial del comercio de
animales,'' segun Traffic, rama de supervision del World Wildlife
Fund for Nature (WWF).
 &HT;    Los coleccionistas, las tiendas y las instituciones cientificas
pagan hasta US$700 millones al ano por aves tropicales de Brasil
como el guacamayo Spix, ademas de reptiles y monos pequenos, segun
la Red Nacional Contra el Trafico de Animales Salvajes (Renctas),
organizacion independiente de Rio de Janeiro. Y mientras mas rara
es la especie, mas alto es el precio. Por el guacamayo Spix, por
ejemplo, se paga hasta US$60.000, informa Renctas.
 &HT;    En Brasil, Colombia y Peru viven los animales favoritos de los
traficantes, mientras Argentina, Paraguay y Uruguay suelen ser
puntos de transito para Asia, Europa y Estados Unidos. Peru, con su
variada geografia de desierto y selva, es un gran coto de caza de
iguanas, cocodrilos y anacondas. En los ultimos anos, se han
detectado hasta en el centro de Lima mercados al aire libre donde
se venden esos animales. En Colombia, segundo pais despues de
Brasil en diversidad biologica, la caza ilegal ha llevado a varias
especies de cotorras al borde de la extincion. Pero la guerrilla ha
reducido recientemente el comercio al prohibir a los campesinos que
cacen en los territorios andinos que controlan.
 &HT;    La deforestacion, la caza y la pobreza han diezmado a la fauna
de la region. La mayoria de los expertos coincide en que el gran
negocio del trafico de animales ha puesto en peligro de extincion a
218 especies brasilenas (109 aves, 68 mamiferos, 31 invertebrados,
nueve reptiles y un anfibio), segun la Fundacion Biodiversitas, de
Belo Horizonte.
 &HT;    La caza ilegal esta tan extendida que el 30 por ciento de los
2.800 animales del zoologico de Rio de Janeiro provienen de las
redadas de la policia contra los traficantes de animales, dice
Marcio Martins, presidente de la Fundacion Zoologica de Rio. Solo
en julio se adquirieron 90 animales.
 &HT;    Dener Giovanini, coordinador general de Renctas, dice que la
mayor parte de los animales en Brasil son capturados por campesinos
pobres del norte, y luego camioneros y conductores de autobuses los
llevan a Sao Paulo y Rio de Janeiro. La policia dice que despues
los contrabandistas sacan a los animales por los puertos y
aeropuertos, o los venden en mercados al aire libre. Segun las
autoridades, cada semana hay 100 mercados de ese tipo solo en el
estado de Rio de Janeiro. ``Estos traficantes estan tan bien
organizados como las mafias de las drogas y las armas,'' dice
Giovanini.
 &HT;    En meses recientes, las autoridades brasilenas han arreciado su
campana contra el trafico de animales, asociandose con Renctas,
establecida hace un ano, y con la entidad federal Ibama. ``Como
muchas especies estan al borde de la extincion, ahora hasta los
politicos nos escuchan,'' dice Elizabeth MacGregor, representante
en Brasil de la Sociedad Mundial de Proteccion de los Animales. ``Y
en cada ciudad brasilena hay algun tipo de organizacion que protege
a los animales.''
 &HT;    Los resultados ya saltan a la vista. En febrero de 1999, el
ciudadano norteamericano Manoel Lourenco Galo fue arrestado en Sao
Paulo cuando trataba de sacar de contrabando a Pennsylvania 24
huevos de guacamayo azul purpura con un valor de US$10.000 cada
uno. Meses despues, dos traficantes mas fueron arrestados cuando se
disponian a sacar de contrabando guacamayos Lear azules, cuyo
numero se ha reducido a solo 150. Como su primo el Spix, con el

 &HT;    Author takes `Millionaire' to next level
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald was right. The rich are different. Just how
different was the theme of Thomas J. Stanley's 1996 best seller,
``The Millionaire Next Door.'' The group profiled lived frugally,
drove used Fords or Chevrolets, and accumulated their wealth on
annual incomes of $80,000 to $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now the former Georgia State University professor is back with a
new book, ``The Millionaire Mind'' (Andrews McMeel, $26.95), that
moves into a new neighborhood of really rich folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people whose average net worth is $9.2 million
and who have an annual income of $749,000,'' Stanley says. ``What I
wanted to do in this book is go much deeper and find the factors
that contributed to their success. How they selected their stocks,
how they selected their vocations, their school experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   What he found will be disturbing to students on the dean's list:
Most of the millionaires in Stanley's study group had average
grades and SAT scores of about 1190.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find a whole lot of correlation between grades in
college and wealth accumulation,'' Stanley says. ``Actually, the
majority of these people did not go to prestige colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning leadership qualities and participating in competitive
sports was much more important to them than getting A's, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for their lifestyles, Stanley says it's not so much a matter
of frugality as it is an emphasis on saving their own valuable
time. That's why few millionaires build custom houses (it takes too
much supervision), do their own home repairs or cut their own
grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they tell me it's much simpler to get their shoes repaired
than to spend the time shopping for a new pair. The same is true
for furniture. They buy a good couch and they keep getting it
reupholstered.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Flashback: Writers are always asked where they get their
ideas. Liza Nelson got hers for her debut novel from a wanted
poster. The Atlanta writer was in a neighborhood post office when
she spotted the face of a fugitive who looked familiar. She didn't
know him, as it turned out, but the incident inspired Nelson to
write a short story about a woman who recognized her former lover's
face on a wanted poster. The story eventually evolved into
``Playing Botticelli'' (Putnam's, $23.95), a novel about the
relationship between a mother, Godiva Blue, and her teenage
daughter, Dylan. The story revolves around Godiva's discovery that
her ex-lover _ and the father Dylan never knew _ is wanted by the
FBI. When Dylan discovers the poster in her mother's studio, she
sets off in search of her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It approaches the '60s experience from a slightly different
perspective than most books,'' says Nelson, 49. ``It's not an
apology for the '60s, it's not about the '60s, but it's informed by
my having experienced the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who is married and the mother of a 20-year-old son and a
14-year-old daughter, moved to Atlanta after graduating from the
University of Michigan. She wrote profiles for the alternative
weekly The Great Speckled Bird, as well as other free-lance
articles for newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Although she and her character Godiva have similar backgrounds,
Nelson says the novel is not autobiographical. Her daughter was not
a teen when she wrote the book, but now that she's approaching the
age of Dylan, Nelson finds the prospect a little frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if I'm foretelling dangers that may come to pass. I
don't know how to protect her. The times are different and the
risks are greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson will sign copies of her book at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Chapter
11 bookstore at Peachtree Battle. 2345-A Peachtree Road N.E.,
404-237-7199.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New deals: Stephen King may be bruised and battered, but he's
richer than ever. The author recently signed a three-book deal with
his British publisher, Hodder and Stoughton, rumored to be worth
$48 million. A separate deal with Simon &AMP; Schuster covering
hardbacks, paperbacks and audio books is expected to make the deal
worth eight figures. The U.S. contract gives King a smaller advance
but a bigger share of the profits, says Simon &AMP; Schuster spokesman
Adam Rothberg. ... Industry publications report little interest
from Hollywood in the new novel from Michael Ondaatje, author of
``The English Patient.'' A political tale set in 1980s Sri Lanka,
``Anil's Ghost'' is described as ``subdued and esoteric.''
</P>

 &HT;    A conversation with Frederick Busch
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the function of a dust-jacket blurb to hyperventilate, but
heavy breathing doesn't necessarily keep people from telling some
version of what they consider the truth.
</P>
<P>
   When Frederick Busch's novel ``The Night Inspector'' came out
last year, the dust jacket bore these words from James Lee Burke:
``This man's gift and skill are enormous.'' And these, from Scott
Spencer: ``... a first-rate American storyteller.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would call Busch second-rate, but writers know how
reputations rise and fall, a few establishing themselves in the
firmament, the rest sinking out of sight. ``How would you like to
be remembered?'' a young woman asks him.
</P>
<P>
   Not every man of 57 welcomes a question that seems to suggest
he'll be checking out of the game shortly. But writers live for
posterity, and Busch knows it will be her generation, and
generations to follow, that one day will consign him to his proper
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be remembered as a really honest, minor writer of
the 20th century. I'll take that,'' he tells the woman with
believable conviction. And then he says, ``You see to it, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   All he can do is keep cranking out the words, which he has been
doing for some 30 years now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have to do it, don't be a writer,'' he was
telling an audience at Emory University on Wednesday. ``Be a
dentist and give pain to others.''
</P>
<P>
   He poor-mouths (``I'm not smart enough to plan a novel; I write
until I find out where it's going, and then I go back and make it
look like I planned it that way''), but you can afford to do that
when you have 18 novels and three volumes of nonfiction under your
expansive belt. ``The Night Inspector'' was nominated for a
National Book Critics Circle Award in fiction this year, and Busch
has been honored by, among others, the American Academy of Arts and
Letters.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not on the tip of every tongue.
</P>
<P>
   In black slacks, black shirt, gray tie and a gray jacket whose
speckled pattern seems coordinated with his salt-and-pepper
whiskers, he looks a little like the late Al Hirt, the French
Quarter trumpeter. If the brow isn't quite so broad, the belly is,
and he has a way of holding forth that has a touch of theater.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the self-mockery there is a serious point. You don't
find writers doing cartwheels down the street. They are not often
the life of the party. They usually aren't even at the party, no
matter what you read and hear about literary cocktail parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lead a very boring life,'' Busch tells his audience. ``When
I get up in the morning,'' he says, ``I trudge 50 yards across a
field to a barn where I have an office. I check my e-mail _
nothing. I check my voice mail _ no one's called.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, maybe, there'll be a letter. But probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Writers know all about avoidance maneuvers. They have to write
but don't want to write. Soon enough they come face to face with
it: ``You have to make the words, no matter what you do,'' Busch
says.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1966 he has taught creative writing at Colgate University
in upstate New York. ``The one subject I've not figured out,'' he
says, ``is how to teach creative writing. The problem is that we
are teaching a mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery, all things considered, might be that anyone would
want to write. But writers write for the same reason singers sing
and dancers dance. It's not just what they do, but who they are.
</P>
<P>
   Busch is a student of both the work and life of Charles Dickens,
and he titled one of his early novels ``The Mutual Friend.'' The
son of a Manhattan lawyer and a high school science teacher, he saw
nothing in his childhood remotely like Dickens' _ no American child
today does. But he understands the wellspring of Dickens' novels.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a patio at his hotel, he says, ``When Dickens was 11
or 13, his father was sent to a debtor's prison. In those days,
your wife and children could stay there with you, and Dickens'
mother and their other children did. But Charles was old enough to
earn money. He was on his own for maybe three months, living alone,
among a rough crowd of boys. Years later, when he was famous and
rich, he said, `How easily they gave me away. I never forgot, and I
never forgave.'''
</P>
<P>
   So when people ask Frederick Busch how he'd like to be
remembered, he knows it's enough, perhaps, to have published more
than 20 books and to have won the regard of people he respects. Not
everyone can say as much.
</P>
<P>
   He compares it to big-league baseball players. A minority are
ever named to all-star teams, and fewer still are inducted into the
Hall of Fame. Many play only long enough to prove they can't play
well enough. And then there are others who play year after year,
steadily if unspectacularly, appreciated by those who've played the
game more than by those in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Busch sees in this something of himself, a minor
writer and a good one. ``When I'm done,'' he says, ``you'll be able
to say I hit .266, and had a good glove.''
</P>

 &HT;    Enigmatic Lang still dancing to his own tune
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just what is the Austrian ex-patriate Helmut Lang thinking?
Since he declines interviews and photo ops, and provides no program
notes at his shows, one can only guess. Except for the chicly
savage style of Lang's fur coats, his painstakingly tailored men's
suits, and the authoritative appearance of his metal-detector
shaped handbags, much of what he showed looked rather curious.
Lang's a self-contradicting iconoclast: His label's plastered on
the roofs of taxis all over this city, yet he tends to design in
the most off-putting of ways. His favored fall dress style is a
quasi-Grecian tunic that's sewn together between the knees. And his
collection's most memorable men's suit-shirt-tie combo was shaded
``beat me up'' pink.
</P>
<P>
   There were covetable pieces, but it's hard to make peace with it
as a whole.

 &HT;    `Homicide' detectives face emotional case
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Homicide: The Movie'' doesn't waste time reintroducing itself.
It gets you at hello: Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), the
long-suffering, politically cagey lieutenant who oversaw the city's
murder-investigation squad, is on the stump, running for mayor of
Baltimore, when someone pulls a gun and shoots him.
</P>
<P>
   The shot rings out like a dinner bell: Everyone who ever worked
for ``G'' drops what he's doing to come work the case.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pembleton (Emmy-winning Andre Braugher), the
Jesuit-centric detective, is teaching a college religion class. Tim
Bayliss (Kyle Secor), Pembleton's ever-searching partner, is fly
fishing. Bolander (Ned Beatty) is drinking his breakfast, Kay
(Melissa Leo) is on the fugitive squad, Munch (Richard Belzer) is
working on another TV show in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``My, my, my,'' clucks an old station-house nemesis, bemused by
the spontaneous reunion. ``All the old boys and girls are gathered
again.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever a reunion movie had a chance to be more than a reunion
movie, this is it. For at least five of its seven seasons on NBC,
``Homicide: Life on the Street'' was TV's best cop show. It was
also the least appreciated, its stylish brilliance never
translating into much more than ho-hum ratings.
</P>
<P>
   To NBC's credit, the drama, produced by Barry Levinson (``Rain
Man'') and Tom Fontana (``Oz''), lasted longer than most
ratings-impaired network shows. So when ``Homicide'' was laid to
rest last season, its memorable cast mostly vanished, longtime fans
had to be relieved. The show's slide from great to just pretty good
had become an awkward thing to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Homicide'' returns Sunday night, with every major cast
member (including the dead ones) back, and it comes this close to
actually working.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to be as much reunion as movie finally does it
in. Needing to give everyone a role, scenes are shoehorned into
places they don't really fit, stretching a tightly wound premise
into an overlong conceit.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting exercise for the show's regular viewers, a
kind of dramatized alumni notes, with the arty camerawork and
rockin' soundtrack _ the old show's signatures _ holding them until
the don't-miss end.
</P>
<P>
   For those who missed the series the first time around, Sunday's
special is a cut above the usual TV movie, but not enough to make
you sorry you missed it.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. You missed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide: The Movie''
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Sunday on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: (fans of the series): B+. Others: C+.

 &HT;    Fanciful look at Hemings' romance
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Thomas Jefferson tenderly says to his lover, Sally Hemings,
``You belong to me,'' it has a queasy double meaning. What is
normally a sweet endearment is literal here, since Sally is his
slave.
</P>
<P>
   But many viewers may be queasy well before Jefferson gets to
that line. Some will be put off by how CBS has made this important
part of American history into a pulpy melodrama; it could be a
paperback romance with ``Theirs was a forbidden love!'' scrawled
across the front cover in florid gold script.
</P>
<P>
   Others may be questioning how much of what they're seeing is
historically accurate, the answer to which is: Your guess is as
good as anyone's.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about ``Sally Hemings'' is Sally, or at least the
actress who plays her: Carmen Ejogo, a British actress who is
half-black (a Nigerian father) and half-white (a Scottish mother)
and all grace. She's had small roles in movies that few people saw
(``Absolute Beginners'') and is new to American TV. It's not just
that she's gorgeous, which she is, but that she can act. No matter
what frippery the movie puts her through, she is radiant.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Neill (``Jurassic Park''), on the other hand, plays
Jefferson as if constantly wondering if he left the iron turned on
in his dressing room. Of course, Jefferson here is the underwritten
love interest role normally played by the woman in traditional
Hollywood films; this is Sally's story.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where ``An American Scandal'' gets even stranger,
because very little is truly known about Sally Hemings. DNA testing
has recently confirmed that Jefferson fathered several children
with her while she was his slave, but other than that, the
historical record is nearly blank. That doesn't stop the movie,
however, from making up enough to fill four hours.
</P>
<P>
   According to the script by Tina Andrews (who played Kunta
Kinte's girlfriend in ``Roots,'' and let's not go there as a
comparison) Hemings was taught to read and write (illegal at the
time), and to speak French. She then taught other slaves, worked on
the Underground Railroad and bantered with Tom Paine, the firebrand
author of ``Common Sense.'' No one can prove she didn't do all
this, but be aware as you're watching that it's all an invention.
</P>
<P>
   As for her relationship with her owner, the subject of much
speculation, it is presented here as a pure, nonexploitative love
match, a romance that began when she was a teen (Jefferson was 38
and a widower) and lasted until his death years later. They laughed
together, quoted Shakespeare to one another, made out by
candlelight and might have lived happily ever after if not for the
fact that she was a slave.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Sally quotes Napoleon that ``history is but a series
of agreed-upon lies.'' It's as if the show was warning viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Even folks who don't care a whit for historical accuracy may
find themselves dozing off in the torpid second half, which airs
Wednesday. There's no dramatic arc to the story of Sally and Tom,
just a bunch of scenes, beads on a string, separated by titles that
say ``Five years later.'' He ages, she ages, and the tension of the
first half _ race vs. romance _ just dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that CBS is devoting four hours in sweeps to
an interracial romance, or what was called long ago
``miscegenation.'' This would have been hard to imagine a few years
ago, but it seems like no great shakes now, after it's been done,
matter of factly, on shows from ``ER'' to ``Ally McBeal.'' What
matters is whether it is done well, and mostly, it isn't.

COMMENTARY: NEW YORK'S HOLY WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: note language) 
(jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A U.S. Senate race in New York is a rare and wondrous
thing. Who among us can forget the one that Alfonse D'Amato won on
the issue of whether ``Fascist'' was an anti-Italian slur? In 1998
Charles Schumer was elected after a contest dominated by a debate
over the meaning of the word ``putzhead.'' Now we venture forth
once again, and the latest controversy of the Year 2000 campaign is
whether or not Hillary Clinton is an enemy of religion.
</P>
<P>
   There's no point for those of you from other states to feel
jealous. You have options. If you're bored, go nominate a
professional wrestler for something.
</P>
<P>
   Back in October, it seems, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sent out an
eight-page fire-breathing fund-raising letter for his Senate
campaign, which later fell into the hands of Wayne Barrett, a
reporter for The Village Voice. Among many, many, many, many other
things, the letter depicted Clinton as a soldier in ``a relentless
30-year war the left-wing elite has waged against America's
religious heritage.'' It also accused her of ``hostility toward
America's religious traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may not be the most skillful candidate in the history of
American politics, but she knows what to do in the event of a
public sliming. First, grasp your heart and collapse in a swoon.
Second, issue multitudinous press releases. Within hours, New
Yorkers knew much more about the religious convictions of the first
lady than we had picked up during seven years of first-ladyhood.
Certainly, without Giuliani's efforts the media would not have had
cause to pass along the fact that Clinton served as the keynote
speaker at the 1996 General Conference of Methodists.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Clinton Senate campaign officially began last
weekend, Giuliani has been on TV more than Regis Philbin, defending
his fund-raising letters and discussing his qualifications. ``I
think that Foreign Affairs would be one committee where I could
make a very, very big contribution,'' said the mayor, whose
overarching theory on international relations might best be
summarized as Vengeance is Mine. (``I don't forget,'' he said after
he had Yasser Arafat ejected from a concert at Lincoln Center a few
years back.) He also depicted himself as a person who gets along so
well with others that he was able to work harmoniously with the
Democratic City Council. The Council, which has been embroiled in
six separate lawsuits with Giuliani, was fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor dismissed the fund-raising letter as old news, a
peculiar stance from someone who's so keen on not forgetting. But
he defended the content, particularly the part about how teachers
should be permitted to post the Ten Commandments in their
classrooms. ``Not only do I stand by the letter, I'd like everyone
in New York State to read the letter,'' he said. Thursday at City
Hall, after unveiling a seemingly endless series of graphs
illustrating the latest Mayor's Management Report (management, the
mayor reported, is super-excellent), a grinning Giuliani clicked to
a final slide that showed the Decalogue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says the Supreme Court has already ruled out hanging the
Ten Commandments in public schools. It looks as if Giuliani, who
has been having trouble finding issues where he disagrees with her,
now wants to emphasize his willingness to post warnings about not
coveting your neighbor's wife for the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time in this quasi-campaign that Giuliani
has lurched suddenly to the right on a rather tangential social
issue. Remember his attempt to evict the Brooklyn Museum of Art
over the ``Sensation'' exhibit, when we learned so much about the
religious connotations of elephant dung?
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the kinds of crusades that are particularly popular
in New York, and a conspiracy theorist might wonder if they were
intended to help the mayor's fund raising. Giuliani is strongly
pro-choice, pro-gun-control and supportive of gay rights, yet he's
made a ton of money with letters aimed at social conservatives who
want to stop Hillary. If his sudden interest in religiously
sensitive political issues wasn't deliberately manufactured to
appeal to the anti-Clinton right, it certainly does give him
something to write to them about.

   VALLEY-IDENTITY (Los Angeles) _ The San Fernando Valley got an
identity Thursday, and it doesn't look half-bad.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's economy is propelled by a diverse business
community and its residents are optimistic about the future. What
few dark clouds they see - public services, safety, room to grow -
they think can be fixed if the Valley is given more autonomy, or
even split off from the city of Los Angeles. By Harrison Sheppard.
(Will run in the ``a'' national and ``n'' state news files.)

<P>
   VOICES-VALLEY - San Fernando Valley residents like living in the
nation's most famous suburb, but they believe their community is
snubbed by a centralized government located ``over the hill'' that
doesn't care about their interests. Business leaders are in
agreement and believe that it'll take a decentralized, responsible
government to fix what ails the Valley. By Chris Sieroty. (Will run
in the ``a'' national and ``n'' state news files.)

<P>
   ALMANAC-SHOWBIZ - This must be why it's called Valleywood.
Entertainment companies are the leading engine of the San Fernando
Valley's economy, according to the first comprehensive tabulation
of the Valley's business climate in the modern era. Entertainment
has surpassed the aerospace companies that were largely responsible
for the Valley's growth in the post-WWII era. By Marla Matzer Rose.

TAX GROUP TALKS SUIT TO BLOCK LICENSE FEE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci's most important allies in his
fight for an income tax rollback say they will file suit to block
the governor from maintaining the $33.75 driver's license renewal
fee.
</P>
<P>
   The threat from Citizens for Limited Taxation could disrupt
Cellucci's plan to prepare the state financially for a possible
bailout of the Big Dig, which just announced a $1.4 billion
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Limited Taxation says license renewal fees cannot
be used to pay for the massive highway project.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the governor is proposing is clearly illegal,'' said
Barbara Anderson, the longtime leader of the anti-tax group. ``Fees
charged by the Registry of Motor Vehicles can't be used for
anything except covering the cost of the Registry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci administration officials disagree and say the governor
will not change the ``insurance policy'' he unveiled for the Big
Dig tunnel and highway project on Wednesday that includes keeping
the $45 million in annual license fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respectfully disagree with Barbara Anderson and think this
is an appropriate use of these funds,'' said Administration and
Finance spokesman Joe Landolfi, noting that Registry fees are
currently used to fund state transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson said the Registry's current fees are illegal
because they generate $375 million in revenue while the agency's
budget is just $60 million a year. She also claimed Cellucci could
lose most Registry revenues, as well as revenues from fees assessed
by other agencies, if Citizens for Limited Taxation returns to
court to press the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's $45 million,'' Anderson said. ``Why fight about
it when it's going to be so much more if we win?'' Cellucci also is
facing criticism from a second anti-tax organization working to win
voter approval of a ballot question that would allow car owners to
deduct local auto excise taxes and tolls from their state income
tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to the guy who said he never met a tax cut he
didn't like?'' asked Doug Barth, chairman of the Commuter Tax
Relief Coalition. ``The governor is either getting very bad
political advice or the problems of the Big Dig are a lot bigger
than he's leading the public to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Barth said his anger over Cellucci's decision to oppose the
question on excise taxes and tolls was further inflamed by Andrew
S. Natsios, Cellucci's secretary of administration and finance, who
said Wednesday that residents of the Metro West area who use the
Massachusetts Turnpike to commute to Boston are able to pay toll
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the richest regions in New England,'' Natsios
said. ``They can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just unbelievable,'' Barth said. ``We have a lot of
support from school teachers and others in Metro West who are very
blue collar and who will tell you that $500 to $1,000 a year is a
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Gray, Cellucci's top political adviser, said the governor's
opposition to the ballot question on tolls and excise taxes could
help win passage of the income tax rollback because it would
undermine the argument of opponents who say the state can't afford
the combined fiscal impact of the three tax-cutting measures that
are likely to appear on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be much more difficult for them to make that
case with the governor opposing the question on tolls,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   But James St. George, executive director of the Tax Equity
Alliance for Massachusetts, said the apparent fissure between
Cellucci and Anderson will be a boon for opponents of Cellucci's
plan to cut the state income tax to 5 percent from 5.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Citizens for Limited Taxation not only oppose
Cellucci's plan to maintain license renewal fees but also support
the ballot question to provide a state rebate for excise taxes and
tolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it very difficult for the income tax rollback
coalition when one leader is saying we can afford passage of both
questions and one is saying we can only afford one,'' said St.
George.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Cellucci had responded to questions about
whether he would support the excise tax/toll rebate question with a
familiar mantra: ``I never met a tax cut I didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   But he came out against the measure Wednesday after hearing a
presentation by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an
independent fiscal watchdog group, that claims the combined fiscal
impact of the three ballot measures could be $2.4 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he was particularly struck by estimates showing
the impact of the question of excise taxes and tolls could be as
high as $700 million the first year it goes into effect. The income
tax rollback would take an estimated $1 billion from state revenue
but would be phased in over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a ballot measure allowing residents to take state
income tax deductions for charitable contributions would take an
estimated $200 million from state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Cellucci's plan to maintain drivers license
renewal fees at $33.75 every five years is illegal under a 1984
Supreme Judicial Court ruling that says money from government fees,
unlike general taxes, can only be used to benefit persons paying
the money.
</P>
<P>
   In the late-1980s, Anderson and others sued the Dukakis
administration over the issue. They agreed to drop the suit after
William F. Weld was elected governor and agreed to cut user fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Cellucci has proposed is a reversal of that agreement,''
Anderson said.

 &HT;    McCain accuses Bush of dirty campaigning
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ The mother of a teen-age boy told Sen. John
McCain on Thursday that a telephone caller claiming to be a
poll-taker called McCain ``a cheat, a liar and a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice alleged by Donna Duren of Spartanburg is called
push-polling. Under the guise of conducting an independent survey,
a caller spreads information that is critical of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting at the Fine Arts Center in Spartanburg,
Duren said her 14-year-old son, Chris, took the call at home
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who called him. I don't know who's responsible.
But he was so upset when he came upstairs and he said, `Mom,
someone told me that Senator McCain is a cheat and a liar and a
fraud.' And he was almost in tears,'' Duren said. ``I was so livid
last night I couldn't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who appeared shaken by Duren's account, blamed Gov.
George W. Bush. ``I'm calling on my good friend George Bush to stop
this now. He comes from a good family. He knows better than that.
... I'll pull every negative ad I have,'' McCain told reporters
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush at first dismissed the incident, but later, in Fort Lawn,
S.C., said, ``If anybody in my campaign has done that, they're
going to be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is telephoning thousands of South Carolina
voters with a message that is critical of McCain. But a script of
the phone message released by the campaign Thursday does not slur
McCain in the way described by Duren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be misled by McCain's negative campaign tactics,'' the
script reads.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a month ago that Bush and McCain shook hands at a
debate in Michigan to seal an agreement to conduct positive
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Their exchanges turned unpleasant last week following McCain's
drubbing of Bush in the New Hampshire primary, and new polls that
showed McCain had erased Bush's once sizable lead in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Now each side is accusing the other of having launched the
negative ad war that is running on South Carolina television.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has an ad that links McCain to ``Washington Democrats.'' In
another ad, McCain compares Bush to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When the question of push-polling first arose last week, each
side accused the other of employing it while denying any use of it.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina State Rep. John Hawkins, a McCain supporter, told
the crowd in Spartanburg that Bush's attacks on McCain are ``a sign
of desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of negative campaigning is going on right now. A lot of
untrue things are being said,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers fear that the negative campaigning will
depress voter turnout in the Feb. 19 primary. If that were to
occur, it almost certainly would benefit Bush because the people
most likely to vote are core Republicans. Those most likely to stay
home are people who might find something they like in McCain's
message of reform, but who become turned off by negative politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign introduced a new element into the equation
Thursday, charging that McCain raised the push-polling issue to
divert attention from a fund-raising reception in Washington on
Thursday night that was expected to raise $200,000 and be
well-attended by lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's relentless campaign against ``special interests'' and
lobbyists who have access to politicians has made him susceptible
to charges of hypocrisy, according to Bush supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself has stopped just short of calling McCain a
hypocrite. On Thursday, Bush criticized McCain for transferring $2
million from his Senate campaign to his presidential campaign last
year. The practice is legal, but Bush said McCain criticized it 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tiff over push-polling shoved aside McCain's remarks about
education Thursday. He proposed giving teachers $1 billion a year
in performance bonuses, reducing federal regulation of local school
districts and implementing a $5.4 billion, national three-year test
of school vouchers in the poorest school districts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had previously spoken about some of these ideas. But his
speech Thursday emphasized local control of schools and anti-union
sentiment in a state with right-to-work laws and a history of
opposition to a strong federal government.
</P>
<P>
   He made five separate critical references to labor unions, three
times citing ``union bosses.'' McCain also endorsed voluntary
prayer and the posting of the Ten Commandments in schools.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's remarks omitted many details. Questioned by
reporters, he struggled to explain how he would reduce the
paperwork teachers must complete.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides were still working on the education speech in the
bar of the Hilton Hotel in Greenville on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's state school chief, also tried to
clarify McCain's plan for reporters. His call to reduce paperwork
was less a concrete set of proposals than ``a mindset,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had criticized McCain for his failure to lay out a
comprehensive education program so far in the campaign. McCain
aides denied that Thursday's speech was in reaction to Bush.

<P>
   PARIS _ Airbus aircraft are strange birds.
</P>
<P>
   Their wings are made in Britain, their bodies in Germany and
parts of their tail assemblies in Spain. They are put together at a
factory in southern France. Yet this cosmopolitan creature has
become a symbol of the challenge facing Boeing, Airbus' lone
remaining rival.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Airbus has clawed its way to roughly half the
world market for commercial jetliners, often evoking a mixture of
aggression and disdain from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to orchestrate this remarkable feat, Airbus has relied
largely on a cheery 49-year-old native of Rockville Centre, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that man, John J. Leahy, senior vice president for
sales at Airbus Industrie, does not see it as a one-man show. He
stresses the size of his sales team, the 500 people stretching from
brochure designers to finance experts, and the company's seven
sales regions, including North America, Europe, China and the old
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as America pioneered deregulation, European
airlines have often turned to American executives to transplant a
rough-and-tumble spirit to Europe. Jeffrey G. Katz, a former
American Airlines executive, is chief executive of Swissair.
Frederick W. Reid, another American Air veteran, was president of
Lufthansa before leaving last year to become chief of marketing at
Delta. Three years ago, when British Airways started a no-frills
carrier, Go Fly Ltd., it hired an American, Barbara Cassani, to run
it.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Leahy has benefited from an industry consolidation.
With Boeing's 1997 acquisition of its rival McDonnell Douglas, the
field has essentially been reduced to two, Boeing and Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Leahy's remarkable rise is also a result of deregulation. As
head of the Airbus division in North America in the 1980s, when
deregulation unleashed unprecedented competition and forced
airlines to examine their cash flows, Leahy persuaded many airlines
that buying an Airbus was more economical over the long haul than
buying a Boeing. In the 1990s, as deregulation lapped across the
Atlantic, he brought that pitch to Europe, where Airbus was already
strong.
</P>
<P>
   His scorecard is impressive. In 1995, his first full year as
global head of sales, Airbus booked 106 orders, against 468 for
Boeing. Last year, though Boeing continued to turn out roughly
twice as many planes, Airbus had signed orders for 476 planes,
against 391 for Boeing. By now, the companies' order backlogs are
roughly equivalent _ about 1,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   As the European partners that control Airbus seek to transform
it into an independent company and launch its biggest project ever,
a 550-seat super jumbo jet, Airbus' thirst for private capital is
growing sharply. Increasingly, Leahy has assumed the role of Airbus
ambassador, intensifying a practice he began not long after moving
to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, in the south of France, of
explaining the company's strategy to international investors and
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his success, few airlines remain all-Boeing. One is
the Israeli airline, El Al, and Leahy's efforts to change that
illustrate the challenges he and Airbus often face.
</P>
<P>
   After Leahy and his team briefed El Al pilots and executives and
flew an A330 to Israel for a demonstration, the board of El Al,
which wanted to expand its long-range fleet, voted in October to
purchase new Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s.
</P>
<P>
   The sales effort was out of all proportion to the size of the
deal, which was worth about $400 million, an amount Airbus often
books in a single month. Yet the victory had symbolic importance.
Israeli economic dependence on the United States had made El Al
reluctant to buy planes anywhere but in America. If El Al bought
Airbus, the reasoning went, it would have to be because Airbus was
better.
</P>
<P>
   In December, however, after extensive lobbying by American
officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Israel
froze the decision pending a review by the government, which
controls El Al.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy ``staked a lot of his reputation on convincing El Al to
buy Airbus,'' said Jim Frank, the Boeing sales representative
responsible for trying to secure the deal. ``I'm glad to say he
didn't win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank has never met Leahy, but ``based on hearsay,'' he said in
an interview, Leahy is ``a real charmer, a smooth talker.'' El Al
executives, Frank said, told him ``they had never met a better
marketer and salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Nachman Kleiman, the El Al spokesman, who saw Leahy in action,
described him as ``very personable,'' and added: ``I would buy a
used car from the man. You have a sense of trust. And cars don't
cost over $100 million.'' The Airbus deal, he said, was suspended
until the Israeli government decided whether ``El Al can buy and
pay for the planes.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said he remained confident that El Al would stick to the
deal and chided the State Department for its interference, accusing
American officials of ``forgetting all their lectures on free
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's ultimate weapon, of course, would be to hire Leahy
away. Yet Frank said he was not aware Boeing had ever sought to do
so. In the early 1990s, McDonnell Douglas tried, asking through a
headhunter whether Leahy would become senior vice president for
marketing at its Douglas aircraft division. Leahy declined.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy's mix of entrepreneurial flair and a passion for flight
became evident early on, when he earned his pilot's and flight
instructor's licenses after graduating from Fordham University.
While working toward an MBA at Syracuse University, Leahy flew
cargo planes four nights a week from Syracuse to Chicago to help
pay tuition. (He stopped flying seven years ago, when he was unable
to fly the 50 to 100 hours a year he feels are necessary to fly
safely.) After getting his degree, he joined Piper Aircraft in
Pennsylvania. In 1985, at age 34, he was hired by Airbus of North
America.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, efforts by Airbus to crack the North American
market had stalled, with few orders following a big sale to Eastern
Airlines, now defunct, in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, executives involved in hiring Leahy marvel at his
doggedness. ``He would not take no for an answer,'' said Alan S.
Boyd, a former Amtrak president who was then chairman of Airbus
North America. Leahy, he added, possessed ``bulldog tenacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the key to Leahy's success, he said, lay in the growing
influence of financiers in America's newly deregulated airline
industry. ``There were no more people in silk scarves and leather
helmets,'' Boyd said, in an industry that ``was being taken over by
money men.'' Airbus' idea, he said, was ``to put MBAs out on the
road, who could talk their language. John knew that language.''

   &QL;   &UR; Marriage Tax Bill is Like a Box Of Chocolates &QL;   &UR; By Laura J.
Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000 States News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON (Feb. 10) - House
Republicans passed a bill Thursday they say will sweeten the state
of matrimony in time for Valentine's Day. But some tax watchdog
groups say the box of chocolates is somewhat stale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're young and not all that rich and rent, the bill
helps. But if your buying some property, shack up. This bill won't
do you any good,'' The GOP-sponsored legislation, which the House
of Representatives passed on a 268 to 158 vote, would cut income
taxes for all married couples by $182 billion over 10 years. The
vote was timed so the Senate could take up the issue on Monday -
Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Forty eight Democrats also voted for the bill, which was drafted
to end the so-called ``marriage tax' that penalizes 25 million
married couples. The changes in the tax code, however, apply only
to couples opting to file their taxes without itemizing deductions
- such as state and local property taxes and mortgage interest
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions in the GOP bill would raise the standard tax
deduction for married couples to twice that of single filers, from
$7,351 to $8,800; adjust the 15 percent tax bracket from $43,850 to
$52,500; and hike the income cutoff for the earned income tax
credit, for lower-income couples, by $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic version of the bill was defeated 233 to 192.
President Clinton threatened to veto the Republican bill, saying
the cut in government revenue would threaten Social Security and
Medicare solvency for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans touted the day's vote as just the beginning of a
series of tax reform bills they say will not only limit government,
but return some of the budget surplus back to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a tax code that doesn't punish married couples,'' said
House Speaker Dennis Hastert. R-Ill. ``They need to buy braces for
the kids. They need to buy insurance for the car and for the home.
They don't need the federal government picking their pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Sepp argued that, while the timing of the bill may be a bit
romantic, the GOP love falls flat if the married couple wants to
own their own nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things stand with this bill is if you are a middle
class two-earner married family who owns a home rather than rents,
and you itemize your deductions you will see very little relief,''
Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us this is like shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic.
Our tax system is sinking in a morass of complexity,'' said David
Keating, spokesman, of the Americans for Fair Taxation, a tax
watchdog group. ``The thing that is being left out of this debate
is that if we have an income tax the way it is today, you will
always have a marriage income tax penalty or a single income tax
penalty.

PARIS: that language.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Leahy hauled in his first big catch when Northwest
Airlines agreed to buy Airbus planes.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Solon, managing director of Avmark International, an
airline consultancy in London, agreed that deregulation was
crucial. ``At the time, Northwest was in play, and the industry was
taken over by financial players. They were potentially receptive,
and you could induce them to buy other than Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Leahy's early years were not all smooth. At times, the flip
side of his charm appeared to be aggression. Noel Forgeard, the
Airbus chief executive and Leahy's No. 1 fan, described him as
``the best marketing person I know.'' He added: ``He's always
angry. He cannot relax. He's always in movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, former chairman of Airbus North America, said Leahy
sometimes treated employees harshly if they did not perform, and
cut them off from communication. ``I talked to him about that
several times,'' he said. ``But he considered me an old fogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Other executives defend him, arguing that what might appear as
aggression is his relentless drive. ``People notice that he's
extremely focused on the matter of the day,'' said Nick Tomassetti,
president of Airbus North America. ``And guess what? They're
right.'' Yet, he said, Leahy ``means no disrespect in an angry
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Tomassetti worked for International Aero Engines,
a consortium of engine makers that included Pratt &AMP; Whitney and
Kawasaki of Japan, Leahy cobbled together an innovative package of
low-interest loans from aircraft-leasing companies and engine
suppliers that enabled America West Airlines to acquire the Pan Am
shuttle in exchange for America West's agreement to buy or lease
more than 100 Airbus aircraft. Such loans have since become
familiar features of aircraft purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Leahy moved with his wife and three children to
France, one immediate goal was to crack British Airways, a
stubbornly all-Boeing carrier. Four years later, British Airways
purchased its first Airbuses, the single-aisled, short-haul A319,
after Leahy put the 319 side by side with a Boeing 737-700 on the
tarmac and invited British executives to compare them. The Airbus
offer, said Robert J. Ayling, chief executive of British Airways,
``was a better value than the competitive offer.''
</P>
<P>
   But can Leahy keep up against the giant of the industry, Boeing?
</P>
<P>
   To do so, Airbus is now busily transforming itself from a loose
consortium into a unified company. The agreement last year to merge
three of its partners _ Aerospatiale Matra of France,
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany, and Construcciones
Aeronauticas of Spain _ to form the European Aeronautic, Defense
and Space Co., or EADS, leaves Airbus in effect with two
shareholders _ EADS, with 80 percent, and BAE Systems, as British
Aerospace is now known, with 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Airbus plans the 550-seat jumbo, the A3XX, to compete
with Boeing's 747 on the high end. If Airbus decides later this
year to build the A3XX, Solon of Avmark said, it may be the first
aircraft launched not by a single big airline order but by the
alliances of airlines that increasingly dominate intercontinental
travel. KLM and Alitalia, the core players in an alliance that also
includes Northwest, have already decided to merge their fleet
planning and purchasing activities.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size and cost of the A3XX, Solon said, alliances will
have to ask, ``Can we make sense of this?''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy disagrees. The A3XX, he said, with an estimated list price
of up to $220 million, will be costlier than Boeing's biggest
plane, the 747-400, which costs up to $180 million, ``but we are
not talking double the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he doesn't underestimate the scale of the challenge. ``Life
isn't fair,'' he likes to tell his team. ``If all things are equal,
they're buying Boeing.'' He added, ``We have to show them it's not
equal, that we've got a better mousetrap.''

TEXAS SCHOOL HAS A DEVIL OF A TIME DEALING WITH `GOD' BANNER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Deep in the heart of the Bible Belt, a
religious confrontation has pitted East Texas pagans against
Christians over a banner at Stephen F. Austin State University.
</P>
<P>
   The sign, which came down Tuesday but is scheduled for
resurrection in two weeks, unequivocally explains who controls the
state-funded university.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campus belongs to God,'' according to the banner strung
across Vista Drive, the main entrance leading to the administration
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Earth is the Lord's and everything in it, the world and
all who live in it,'' the sign continues, quoting Psalms 24:1.
</P>
<P>
   The banner has gone up during a spasm of campus religiosity
following a recent dispute over whether the school should sanction
a pagan society.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, a small band of Wiccan students won approval for a
campus pagan society in what Student Government Association
president Sean Bradley said was the most heated issue of his 1 1/2
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote, 16-15, came after religious leaders opposed
including the pagans amid the roughly 180 student groups that vie
for about $50,000 in student fees each year. More than 12,000
students attend SFA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hot, very hot last fall,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   For a few months, until after the first of the year, the dust
seemingly had settled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Jan. 18, chalk drawings were placed around the
University Center inviting students to pagan meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One, for example, had a blue pentacle, a five-pointed star used
in magic, with a tree growing out of it. Looking down was the eye
of Ra, the sun god of ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   A week and a half later, after the drawings had been scrubbed
from the sidewalks, Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship hung its banner
over the school entrance off North Street.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the fellowship, which is associated with the
Assemblies of God, posted fliers around the campus and bought two
full-page ads in the campus newspaper with the same message: ``This
campus belongs to God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely is retaliation,'' said Sarah Hudson, founder
and president of the Pagan Students Alliance. ``We thought about
coming back with some kind of response, but there really doesn't
seem to be any reason to stir the pot any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Paschal, Assemblies of God campus minister, said there is
no connection between the banner and the pagan society. Alphi Chi
planned to make a big push for Christian awareness during the
spring semester, Paschal said, and the banner is part of the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   He said Alphi Chi will put up the sign again in two weeks and
hopes to continue that through the semester.
</P>
<P>
   According to university rules, the sign can go up for 14 days,
must come down for two weeks and then can return for another 14
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a coincidence,'' Paschal said. ``Some feel like this
is a response to the pagans because of the timing. But this isn't a
slam against them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the banner has been criticized by some students and others
who believe it infringes on the constitutional separation of church
and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absurd,'' said Jim Harrington, director of the
Austin-based Texas Civil Rights Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a big problem using public facilities to endorse
religious beliefs for such a long period,'' he said. ``It's not
like allowing a free-speech area to be used for an hour. The
university is allowing the sign to stay up for 14 days.''
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman James Hoard said the school is allowing
students another constitutional right: freedom of speech. The
school allows any campus organization to use the banner space
across Vista Lane, as long as the message isn't threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want free speech to be exercised,'' Hoard said. ``If the
pagan group wants to put up a sign, and the location is available,
then it can.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL; 
While last fall's debate over allowing the pagans a place on campus
was a big issue, the banner topic hasn't caused much of a stir.
</P>
<P>
   A satire by student newspaper columnist Justin Klatt called,
``God, SFA form divine merger'' sparked a small wave of
letter-writing, pro and con. And a group of Christian students
prayed for Klatt's soul.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, or so, this would have been a big issue on
campus,'' said political science professor Wayne Johnson, a
self-described campus activist for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the students aren't particularly excited about this
church-and-state issue,'' he said. ``The issues that concern them
most evolve around money, like grants and the stock market and jobs
in their future.''

SCORES OF AFGHANS ON HIJACKED PLANE ASK BRITAIN FOR ASYLUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ No sooner had the government orchestrated a peaceful
end to a four-day hijacking of an Afghan airliner at Stansted
airport Thursday morning than it was faced with another crisis: how
to sort the hijackers from the hostages and deal with all those
suddenly clamoring for political asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the government said, police have arrested 21 people in
connection with the hijacking, people who may well be seeking
refuge in Britain. And at least 60 of the 150 or so passengers
aboard the plane, along with 14 family members, have formally
requested asylum in Britain, apparently in an effort to flee the
repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly why the hijackers seized the Ariana Airlines Boeing
727 on Sunday just after it took off from Kabul, the Afghan
capital, still remains unclear. The authorities said they did not
know whether political asylum was the goal all along, or even
whether the Afghans had meant to finish their trip in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they know exactly which passengers were victims who
wanted to return home and which were hijackers who wanted to stay
here. And, of course, there were perhaps passengers who had come
along for the ride against their will but, once in Britain, decided
asylum was not such a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed reports Thursday suggested that at least 40 people
on the plane knew about the hijacking in advance and were in on the
scheme, but police said they did not think the episode represented
one vast asylum-seeking plan. Whatever led to the crisis over
asylum, British authorities were faced with one clear fact Thursday
morning: well over half of the passengers on board did not want to
go back to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult for us to have an understanding of why
they had taken the plane,'' David Stevens, chief constable of the
Essex police, told reporters at the airport. ``It only became clear
in the last hour that the people on board were expressing concern
about the political situation in Afghanistan. For the first 75
hours, they didn't talk about the political situation at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange hijacking, by many standards. The hijackers
apparently used little violence, except perhaps to tie up some of
the crew members. And Tuesday, they pushed a member of the crew
roughly down the stairs (he hit his head, but was otherwise
unhurt). By international hijacking standards, their weapons were
puny indeed: just four handguns, five knives, two detonators, a
knuckle-duster and two grenades with their fuses missing.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers issued few threats, made almost no demands, and
gave up peacefully without firing a single shot. There was no quid
pro quo, and many of the passengers smiled and waved through the
windows as police escorted them onto buses and drove them away from
the remote runway on which the plane had been parked.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The surrender from the plane was unequivocal,'' the home
secretary, Jack Straw, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps not surprising that so many Afghans from the
plane, which was making a domestic flight when it was seized and
diverted, are seeking to escape the Taliban regime. One resident of
Kabul told Reuters on Thursday that he was ``extremely sorry that I
was not on the plane myself, otherwise I would have asked the Brits
to let me stay in their homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Having made what may have been a daring escape from an
oppressive government, though, the Afghans are finding that they
are most unwelcome in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the House of Commons, a hard-talking Straw said that
he would take the extraordinary step of ruling personally on the
Afghans' asylum requests, with the goal of ejecting them as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 71,160 people applied for political asylum in
Britain. More than 102,000 refugees are waiting for decisions on
whether they can remain here, decisions that can take years. Prime
Minister Tony Blair recently pushed a tough new immigration law
through Parliament, a law that will force many asylum seekers to
live in special detention centers and face drastic cuts in public
benefits while their applications are being processed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Straw said the singular situation of these particular asylum
seekers had put them in a separate category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subject to compliance with all legal requirements, I would
wish to see removed from this country all those on the plane as
soon as reasonably practicable,'' Straw said. ``As a matter of
public policy, I believe that the clearest and unequivocal signals
must be sent out so as to discourage hijacking, whatever its
motive.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is vulnerable to the perception that Britain's
disorganized immigration service makes the country an attractive
prospect for asylum seekers. That puts Straw under enormous
political pressure to act quickly and make it clear that hijacking
planes is no way to seek permanent status in Britain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The opposition Conservative Party lost no time in seizing on
that very point. Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary,
challenged Straw to get tough on asylum seekers, who are
relentlessly portrayed in right-leaning newspapers here as
opportunistic economic refugees who come to Britain for a better
way of life, not because of political persecution at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the United Kingdom?'' she said, warning Straw that the
government must work quickly to debunk the myth that its asylum
procedures are ``noticeably softer'' than those of other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did it decide it would land here and take advantage of our
asylum procedures?'' she asked, referring to the plane. ``Is it
that those procedures are known to be more congenial than some
which appertain in other countries?''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Marsden, a specialist on Afghanistan at the British
Refugee Council, said in an interview that such rhetoric _ both
from the government and the opposition _ was decidedly unhelpful,
particularly because the motives of the hijackers and passengers
were still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that the hijackers, who conducted their
negotiations in English, are members of Afghanistan's educated
elite and thus not in favor with the Taliban, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfortunate to prejudge a situation that way,''
he said. ``If it is the case that an element in the plane were
involved in the hijacking in order to seek asylum, it could
indicate a high level of desperation. Unless they were totally
naive, the perpetrators would presumably expect lengthy prison
sentences. For people to sacrifice years of their lives in that way
so their families can gain asylum is pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to
the Status of Refugees, Britain is obligated to consider every
application for asylum and cannot deport refugees before they have
gone through the complicated immigration process. Asylum seekers
who are arrested, as the suspected hijackers have been, must first
go through the criminal justice system here, serve whatever prison
sentences they might receive, and then have their applications
considered. But Straw still vowed to move as swiftly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I must and will act in accordance with the law, I am
determined that nobody should consider that there can be any
benefit to be obtained by hijacking,'' he said.

MIGRANTS IN BEIJING FIND VALUE IN GARBAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The odor in the air could be a bit sweeter _ actually,
a lot sweeter. And the flies and rats could be, well, less
numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, He Dayang and his wife are happy to be living here, with
their ruddy-cheeked little daughter, in a shack beside a fetid city
dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to make money,'' said He, 26, who moved to this
trash lot on the south side of Beijing three years ago from a
hopelessly overcrowded patch of Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
   Where others might see mountains of rotting garbage, long since
gleaned of obvious valuables like empty bottles and cans, this
couple sees the opportunity to earn a respectable poor-folks'
living. Patiently sifting through the rubble for torn plastic bags,
scraps of cardboard and metal and the soles of worn-out shoes,
together they can earn up to $120 a month, a sum inconceivable back
home.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife are part of a remarkable legion of some 82,000
rural migrants in Beijing _ nearly half of them from a single
county in Sichuan _ who rummage through the waste of this
burgeoning city, extracting everything of conceivable value and
selling it to recycling factories in a neighboring province.
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling private enterprise was organized over the last
dozen years by a few migrant ``garbage kings'' who have divided up
the entire city and made fortunes as middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the workers lack the documents required for
outsiders to reside in Beijing, a system of control that remains in
place in China's larger cities. And far from receiving official
support for their contributions to the economy and the environment,
they live in constant fear of police harassment, capricious
detentions and deportation to their former homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're performing a valuable service for the city but everyone
looks down on us,'' He said. ``And we still get picked up by the
police.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome or not, the workers in these elaborate garbage networks
are visible in every neighborhood. The bane of impatient car
drivers, they laboriously pedal along city roads in three-wheeled
bicycle carts heaped with sheets of cardboard or bags of tin and
glass. Those in the lower niches pedal giant drums of food scraps,
destined for suburban pigs, or drums of rancid cooking oil,
extracted from restaurant grease traps for remanufacture into cheap
soap.
</P>
<P>
   Through their specialized labors, these migrants reduce the city
government's costly garbage burden by one-fourth, according to a
study by Wang Weiping, a sympathetic city environmental official.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, reflecting the contradictory attitudes that Chinese cities
have toward poor migrants, the garbage pickers are despised by many
permanent residents and officials as unwelcome invaders. At least 8
of 10 such workers lack Beijing residential permits, leaving them
vulnerable to police shakedowns and the city's frequent campaigns
to sweep out ``excess'' migrants.
</P>
<P>
   If not from personal experience then from migrant lore, the
garbage pickers all seem familiar with a large white-brick compound
in Changping County, just north of the city. As the sign in front
declares, it houses Beijing's main holding center for criminal
suspects. But inside is also a separate, unadvertised facility for
the temporary custody of detained migrant workers as well as
homeless people, vagrants and others the police want to remove from
the streets _ sometimes including demonstrators from the banned
Falun Gong spiritual movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Changping facility is one of hundreds of similar ones around
the country, part of an administrative system, parallel to criminal
detention, known as Custody and Repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   The system operates largely without judicial oversight,
according to a report last fall by the New York-based Human Rights
in China. With arbitrary detentions, forced labor, poor living
conditions and an absence of the protections supposedly granted to
criminal detainees, it violates official Chinese as well as
international legal standards, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the garbage pickers can testify to the arbitrary and
sometimes harsh side of the detention system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a night in Changping last year, then was put on a
train back to Henan and a local detention center,'' 28-year-old Li
Xueguo said the other day as he sorted out plastic bottles and
aluminum cans he was purchasing from another migrant's cart for
later resale.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the Henan center, his family had to pay a stiff fine to
get him out, Li said, while those with no money had to work for at
least one month before being released. Conditions in the centers
were ``pretty bad,'' he said. ``They just gave you some bread and
vegetable soup to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Li said, the police do not actually detain the
migrants themselves, they just confiscate and burn their
three-wheeled carts _ a devastating loss for many.
</P>
<P>
   A garbage picker from Sichuan said he was taken to the Changping
center last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you agree to work for them, they won't ship you back
home,'' he said. In his case, he worked hard at the center for two
weeks doing farming and construction, then was released to stay on
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But when his mother, who had also come to try her hand at
garbage picking, was detained in Beijing last summer, she was
immediately sent back to Sichuan because she could not do heavy
work, he said. To pay her $70 fine and get released, he said, ``the
family had to sell off the pig they were fattening up for the New
Year festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes if you have all the right documents, you won't have
any trouble,'' the man said. ``But sometime they just don't care,
and because they think we're dirty and dangerous they pick us up
anyway.''

CYBER VANDALS CAUSE LITTLE HARM, E-COMMERCE SITES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The FBI has vowed to track down the electronic vandals who
struck several major e-commerce Web sites this week, in one of the
biggest coordinated attacks on computer systems to date.
</P>
<P>
   But arrests would be only a start in the long process of
assessing penalties and determining damages, since the harm caused
is hard to quantify; companies' reputations may have suffered more
than their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, computer hackers have argued their intrusions
didn't cause signficant financial impact. This week, companies
targeted by the so-called ``denial-of-service'' attacks, including
Yahoo Inc., ETrade Inc., and ZDNet themselves said that the
financial impact of the attacks was minor at most.
</P>
<P>
   In all seven major e-commerce firms were struck, including
retailer Amazon.com and auction site operator eBay Inc; no more
incidents were reported Thursday. If caught, the government says
the vandals could face up to 10 years imprisonment and fines of
$250,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   But to win sentences that high, authorities might need companies
to state losses more severe than seems the case so far, said Bob
Thomas, an attorney at Testa Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault in Boston and a
former federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   That might be difficult, given how carefully some companies try
to manage their image.
</P>
<P>
   Most ``want to reassure the public and their customer base that
everything is fine,'' Thomas said, and might be reluctant to
discuss exactly what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the curtain they would have to be concerned about the
intangibles,'' such as how the disruptions might have hurt customer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Quantifying the exact value of outages has become one of the
thornier issues in evaluating the impact of unauthorized intrusions
into computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Clara, Calif.-based Yahoo, the Internet's biggest
portal site, servers were rendered inaccessible for several hours
Monday afternoon by the attacks and prevented some users from
logging in.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo spokeswoman Diane Hunt said the shutdown caused ``no
signficiant financial harm to us'' and declined even to specify
whether the cost of fixing the company's computers met the $5,000
threshold usually needed for prosecutors to pursue a case at the
federal level.
</P>
<P>
   Others are skeptical, noting the outage occurred during some of
Yahoo's peak viewing hours. Based on the company's income of around
$58 million last quarter, the service problems could have cost the
company about $116,000 in lost access alone, estimated Barry
Bycoff, chief executive of Netegrity Inc., a consulting firm in
Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Companies ``are put in a very difficult position, because
prosecution means they have to come forward and prove their
damages,'' said Kerry Timbers, a partner at Bromberg and Sunstein
in Boston and chair of a Boston Bar Association committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they do that they have to admit to the public how
vulnerable they were,'' Timbers said. ``That's the opposite of the
impression they want to give to the consuming public.'' Also,
quantifying the value of break-ins often is difficult, said John
Thomas, vice president at Averstar Inc., a Burlington, Mass.
consulting firm. ``It gets down to just how you value information,
and we're just growing into that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our damages are things that involve the loss of
workers' time or the lost use of a piece of equipment, areas that
are really new territory.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, disputes over damages have become a common feature
of hacking cases. In late 1998 US attorneys in Boston convinced a
21-year-old Rhode Island man to plead guilty to charges of
``computer abuse,'' though a judge questioned whether his actions
really cost victimized companies the $67,500 the government
claimed. (The perpetrator, Sean Trifero, recently finished a
one-year prison sentence.)
</P>
<P>
   In California last month, 36-year-old Kevin Mitnick was released
under the terms of a plea agreement after spending five years in
jail on hacking charges. Once accused of causing damages in the
seven figures, Mitnick agreed to pay $4,125 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Even when damages are minor, Allison Burroughs, an assistant US
attorney in Boston who specializes in cybercrimes, said cases are
often worth prosecuting for their deterrence value. ``If companies
report the small things, and get them into the system, maybe they
could avoid the huge things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Burroughs said the exact damage amounts sometimes
aren't as important as the loss of confidence companies may suffer
if unauthorized intrusions aren't punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society, if we want to be investing in e-commerce, that
would be a big loss,'' she said.

 BEIJING: up anyway. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One migrant who has learned to work around official disdain, and
definitely has his papers in order, is Du Maoxian. Du, 41, arrived
from Bazhong County, Sichuan province, in 1988 without a cent. Now,
in a loose conglomerate with another pioneer from the same county,
Xu Jicai, he has control over the pickings from 60 percent of
Beijing's garbage, according to his own estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The figure was corroborated by Wang, the city official who made
a survey of the migrant garbage trade last year.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the powerful role of personal connections in Chinese
migration, some 40,000 people from Bazhong County have followed Du
and Xu to work in the Beijing garbage empire, Wang estimates.
Through quirks of recent history, garbage picking has become a
specialty of the county's residents. Close to one-third of Bazhong
County's 600,000 official residents are pursuing similar work in
cities all over China, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   Du said he had been making only $4 a month as a teacher in
Bazhong when he moved to Beijing. He tried sorting out garbage at
the same city dump where He and his family now operate, and
discovered that he could make $70 a month, he recalled in an
interview. ``I saw I was making a living and decided to make
something bigger out of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After two years as a lowly picker, he bought a three-wheeled
pedal cart and started buying and selling extracted goods, upping
his income. Then he started systematically organizing fellow
migrants into picking, sorting and selling the glass, metal, paper,
rubber, food scraps and oils that were collected.
</P>
<P>
   He made informal arrangements at city garbage collection points,
paying for the first crack at incoming loads. Other migrants under
his aegis began paying modest fees to apartment buildings, hotels
and restaurants for the right to sift through their rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Workers said last week that they pay as much as $50 a month to
larger hotels and restaurants to gain access to recyclable
materials and food scraps they can sell for $200 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Du said he profits mainly through his role, atop the garbage
chain, in selling materials to small, privately run recycling
factories in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing. He keeps
several hundred pigs himself and owns a large plot of land adjacent
to his original garbage dump, where he lives with his wife and
three children and is building new offices. But he otherwise
betrays little evidence of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he
has earned over the years.
</P>
<P>
   With Wang's encouragement, Du is trying to ``regularize'' his
business, as he put it. Last year he registered a company and he
has signed official contracts for picking rights at about 40 of the
city's 762 neighborhood garbage collection stations _ just a
fraction of those where his people are already collecting goods
under informal arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope my company can exercise unified management over garbage
collection and processing throughout Beijing,'' Du said. But
whether the city government can bring itself to publicly embrace a
central role for migrant-run private enterprises remains to be seen
_ and policies toward migrant laborers, in general, remain
contradictory and punitive.
</P>
<P>
   Similar informal networks are processing garbage in all of
China's major cities, Wang said. But even though several other
cities have higher incomes, their garbage is not as ``rich'' as
that of Beijing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beijing is an ancient cultural capital,'' he tactfully put it.
``People are too proud to pick through their garbage themselves,
and they are careless about what they throw out.''
</P>
<P>
   The migrants have a more direct saying: ``Beijingers wouldn't
bend their waists to pick up five grains of rice.''

 &HT;    Bradley pins waning hopes on California
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Vice President Al Gore and rival Bill Bradley
arrive here today in advance of back-to-back speeches they will
deliver to nearly 2,000 Democratic faithful at the state party
convention Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been allotted 30 minutes to speak; Bradley first, then
Gore. But already there is little doubt about who is getting the
warmer welcome. Tonight, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis is hosting a
reception for delegates, the overwhelming majority of whom are
backing the vice president, and Gore is the guest of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring your stopwatch and see if we both get a half an hour,''
said Gale Kaufman, Bradley's California director. ``We're walking
into a convention that is pretty much stacked for the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's 2-1 win over Bradley in Iowa and narrow victory in New
Hampshire may have given him the biggest bounce in the Golden
State, the grand prize of the presidential sweepstakes.
California's 434 delegates account for 10 percent of those at stake
_ the most of any state _ and are allocated proportionally based on
returns. A big win for Gore on March 7 could put the nomination
away.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll from the Field Institute, the state's oldest
nonpartisan surveyor of voter opinion, showed Gore with a whopping
41-point advantage over the former New Jersey senator, up from a
28-point margin just three weeks ago. Gore led Bradley in every
region of the state and among every income and age group. The
poll's margin of error was 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These early primary victories have clearly helped Al Gore and
the perceptions of his campaign,'' says Mark Baldassare at the
Public Policy Institute of California.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bradley hasn't been able to broaden his appeal beyond
affluent liberal voters concentrated in San Francisco's Bay area,
Baldassare says. ``He faces a big mountain to climb,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After his 4-point loss to Gore in New Hampshire, a state that
appeared well tailored to his message of personal integrity and
bold government action, Bradley says he needs victories in some of
the 15 states, including Georgia, holding primaries or caucuses on
March 7 to remain viable.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will spend close to half the time between now and March
7 in California, Kaufman said, and he will launch an expensive
media campaign in a ``couple of weeks'' when the campaign believes
most voters will be tuning in to the contest for their first look.
</P>
<P>
   But other developments this week signaled that Bradley's time is
running out. Monday was the deadline for voters to change their
party affiliation or register to vote before the primary. Anecdotal
reports indicate that more voters registered as Republicans, says
political scientist Larry Gerston at San Jose State University, a
sign that voters perceive the action to be in the Republican
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, appears to be solidifying his support among
California's ethnic minorities, a powerful voting bloc, and among
union members, Gerston says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the glacier is starting to move,'' he says.
``And once it moves, it's hard to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley campaigned in Los Angeles on Thursday to promote his
plan to register and license the nation's 65 million handguns, a
potent issue here. Bradley also came to California armed with a
plan to double federal funding for schools serving poor children.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Bradley's campaign announced that basketball
superstar Michael Jordan will endorse Bradley, a former New York
Knick, and appear in new television commercials for him that will
air here and in a dozen March 7 primary states.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will seek to challenge Gore on the environment by
claiming that he would do more to stop offshore oil drilling,
Kaufman said, and he will continue to mention Gore's votes in
Congress against abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bradley's California supporters also are urging the
candidate to translate his campaign of big ideas into more
practical issues of immediate concern to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are issues that are profound here, and he needs to be
situated in the middle of them,'' says state Sen. John
Vasconcellos, who consults regularly with Bradley. Vasconcellos
said poor children's access to information technology is one such
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, will campaign aggressively on record economic
expansion, fueled in part by the the technology industry in Silicon
Valley. Gore also can point to a long list of federal programs and
money that Washington has directed toward California since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Risker, an accountant for Adobe Systems, the software
giant based here, said she already voted for Gore on an absentee
ballot because she believes he will continue President Clinton's
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has really been growing here,'' says Risker, who
adds that her personal income has increased by 25 percent in just
three years. ``I've been very happy the past eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Risker's rosy view is shared by most Californians today, says
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at Claremont Graduate
University, and that's good news for Gore. ``We are as happy with
our economic status as we have been in decades,'' Jeffe said. ``I
don't see any agitation for change. The anger that we once saw
simply isn't there.''

A TOAST TO LARRY SUMMERS, BOND SALESMAN OF THE YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Summers is taking heat for the way he has handled the bond
market. I say it's a bum rap. He just saved the taxpayers a billion
dollars while leaving Wall Street baffled. He is the salesman of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the situation the Treasury secretary found himself in
three weeks ago. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds had climbed to
6.75 percent, and the market value of such bonds was down 9 percent
in just two months. Sentiment indicators showed that investors
disliked bonds more than at any time since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Treasury's job to sell bonds into that market. With
sentiment like that, it looked like the Treasury would have to pay
a high interest rate. It's not easy to sell something that the
buyers have come to hate.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Summers do? He put on a dazzling display of fakes
and feints that would have made Michael Jordan proud. Suddenly,
Wall Street seers who hated bonds came to love them, and there was
talk about a shortage of bonds. Then Summers seemed to switch gears
this week and hint that maybe the government would not be buying
back as many long Treasuries as he had indicated.
</P>
<P>
   He left Wall Street traders stumbling and gasping for air. Some
of them are mad. A few weeks ago, they were happily selling bonds
short _ only to get ambushed by Summers. So Thursday they bought
bonds in advance of the 30-year auction, secure in the knowledge
that demand would be huge and prices would rise after the auction.
They lost money again, and they blamed Summers.
</P>
<P>
   The reality here is that the supply of Treasury bonds is not a
very important issue for the long term. Anyone who fears that there
won't be enough bonds to go around has not paid much attention to
corporate America, which has been eagerly issuing bonds. But
Summers managed to get a much better rate for the Treasury. It paid
6.34 percent at Thursday's auction, down from the recent market
rate of 6.75 percent. Taxpayers will save $1.4 billion in interest
payments over the life of the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue on interest rates remains the same as it was
before Summers faked out Wall Street. As Robert J. Barbera, the
chief economist of Hoenig and Co., noted, Alan Greenspan has made
it clear that short-term rates ``are going to go up until the
economy slows down.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions remain how long will it take for that medicine to
have the intended effect, and will the slowdown turn into a
recession? If a recession were coming, you would expect long-term
interest rates to fall even as short-term ones were rising, which
is just what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you would also expect the stock market to fall if a
recession were coming, and the Nasdaq composite hits new highs
almost every day. But the strength of the technology stocks that
dominate major indexes has obscured general weakness. The Morgan
Stanley index of cyclical stocks _ companies that generally prosper
in a booming economy and suffer in a weak one _ is down 17 percent
in three weeks. Most bank stocks are lower than they were during
the 1998 scare over Asian and Russian collapses. The Dow has fallen
9 percent in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of stock market action is not what you would expect if
the economy is destined to stay as healthy as almost everyone
thinks it is. Perhaps the stock market will soon reverse, and the
longest period of economic growth in American history will
continue. If not, it may turn out that long-term interest rates
were going to fall soon even without the help of Summers' brilliant
salesmanship.

MORE MEMBERS OF FALUN GONG ARE BEING DETAINED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ At least 2,000 followers of the banned Falun Gong
spiritual movement have been detained in China in the past week, an
official holiday period for the Chinese Lunar New Year, according
to a Hong Kong human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   The detentions were in cities across China, although the largest
number, 500, were conducted here, around Tiananmen Square, said the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China. The numbers could not be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those detained were foreigners, and at least one, Tracy
Zhao, 30, a Beijing-born U.S. citizen and resident of New York who
was not carrying her passport when she was arrested, remained in
custody, friends of Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, individual members of the banned sect have staged
almost daily acts of defiance in the vast crowded plaza of
Tiananmen, sometimes unfurling small banners, but generally just
meditating or identifying themselves as practitioners to the
dragnet of policeman who now routinely patrol the square looking
for Falun Gong members.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has acknowledged that there have been
tens of thousands of encounters between police and practitioners
since Falun Gong was declared illegal last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of detentions resulted from a somewhat larger
silent protest, involving hundreds, that group members said they
had planned in Tiananmen Square around the Chinese New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Although witnesses saw several vans of practitioners removed
from the Square last Friday night, New Year's Eve, and a few more
on Saturday, it is difficult to estimate the actual number of
participants or arrests since the silent protests have been
sporadic and their margins hard to define amidst the throng of
revelers on Tiananmen welcoming the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   The role and size of the overseas contingent in this week's
protest are also unclear. A number of foreign Falun Gong members
came to China in the anticipation of some sort of event, some to
take part but others as a gesture of comradery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the Beijing practitioners needed our support,'' said
Lin Chongli, a U.S. practitioner, also from New York, who said that
he observed, but did not actively participate in the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here is dangerous for us too,'' he said. ``It shows the
local practitioners that we're also willing to make sacrifices.
We'll encourage others in the U.S. to make similar trips.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong's founder, Li Hongzhi, lives in exile in the United
States, where the movement has become especially popular among
Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months into the Chinese government's crackdown on Falun
Gong, the group is clearly diminished but is not utterly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Just last spring, Falun Gong practice groups, consisting mostly
of middle-aged retirees, thrived in virtually all of Beijing's
parks. Practitioners of Falun Gong, which combines slow-motion
traditional Chinese exercises and meditation with a smattering of
Buddhism and Taoism, say it enhances health and moral behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after months of anti-Falun Gong propaganda and almost
daily arrests, Beijing's parks are barren compared to a year ago,
devoid not only of Falun Gong followers, but also of many unrelated
groups devoted to traditional exercise and meditation practices who
fear police scrutiny and worry that they too might be labeled
``superstitious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Falun Gong members face criminal charges, and some
have been sentenced to prison terms exceeding 10 years. Human
rights groups say thousands have been detained for short periods or
placed in labor camps for re-education.
</P>
<P>
   With the stakes so high, most casual Falun Gong members have
given up practice or moved onto another form of exercise, although
some have continued to exercise in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are in detention, but a lot of others are very
clandestine because they are under heavy surveillance,'' said Lin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit of a chasm in the group: Some feel it's their
duty to make their practice known, to educate people about Falun
Gong,'' he said. ``But others feel they should focus on their own
personal cultivation. So they practice at home rather than getting
thrown in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin said he and Zhao had come to China with a group of six
American Falun Gong practitioners. He said that one person in the
group, Zhao's mother, was turned away at immigration because she
had been detained in December in Beijing for protesting the ban on
Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao, who moved to the United States at age 20, is a flight
attendant for Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was not meditating or actively participating in any
protest action on Feb. 4, she was detained while photographing the
arrests of other Falun Gong followers, Lin said. Also detained
around that time, he said, were Shelley Jiang, an Australian, and
14-year-old David Cui, a Chinese with an American green card who
had come to Beijing with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Lin said that Thursday evening, acting on a request from the
Beijing Public Security Bureau, he had brought a ``companion pass''
_ essentially a blank airline ticket to the United States _ to the
police office. He said he hoped this meant that Zhao would soon be
on a U.S.-bound Northwest flight.

BUSH RIPS MCCAIN ON VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The escalating hostilities between Governor
George W. Bush and Senator John McCain _ displayed in a nasty
exchange of television commercials raising questions of trust this
week _ have also spread to a constituency once considered McCain's
domain: the 375,000 veterans who live in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The first shots were fired by Bush at a rally in Sumter, S.C., a
week ago, when a group of retired generals and Medal of Honor
winners endorsed the Texas governor. At the event, another
prominent veteran, J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the National
Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Committee, complained that McCain
``had the power to help the veterans. He came home, forgot us.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign responded this week by calling Burch ``a
discredited trial lawyer'' and demanded an apology, which has not
been forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   While a handful of veterans have begun setting up picket lines
at Bush events to protest the attack on McCain's record, Bush's
communications director in South Carolina, Tucker Eskew, said the
Texas governor would continue to carry out raids on ``McCain's
turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Using McCain's senate title _ a Bush campaign device to link
their rival to Washington _ Eskew said, ``We will concede nothing
to Chairman McCain in getting the veterans' vote.'' Eskew also
minimized the role that McCain's corps of veterans will play,
speculating that no more than 10 percent of South Carolina's
veterans would vote in the Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Carolina holds a reputation for having the
largest number of veterans per capita in the country, federal data
don't support that claim. At least 25 states have a higher
percentage of veterans in their voting-age population.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, South Carolina has a strong military tradition and
McCain drew heavily upon his background as he began building his
campaign organization in South Carolina a year ago. Veterans seemed
a natural base for the Arizona senator. As he describes himself in
his best-selling autobiography, ``Faith Of My Fathers,'' McCain is
a third-generation Navy officer, a combat pilot who spent more than
five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's effort to undercut McCain's following among the veterans
flared after McCain's decisive victory in last week's New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   At first, McCain dismissed the Bush offensive by citing the
endorsements he has received from veterans groups. But after the
issue simmered for a few days, McCain's campaign issued a broadside
aimed at Bush and his advocate, Burch.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, a South Carolina Medal of Honor winner,
Michael Thornton, said, ``Governor Bush invited Mr. Burch onto his
stage, stood silently by while this unscrupulous man lied about
John McCain's record and thus smeared a man I consider a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Burch was faulted for admitting in a television interview after
the Sumter event that he could not back up his charges that McCain
opposed health benefits for soldiers harmed by Agent Orange or Gulf
War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Burch's remarks, Bush's spokesman Eskew said,
``Those were his words, not ours.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign showed no sign of backing away from the
controversy. ``The McCain campaign is squawking because we hit them
where they hurt,'' Eskew said. ``McCain and the media created a
myth of the military monolith, and we exploded that. We challenged
him on his greatest point of pride, and they stomped their feet,
pointed fingers, and whined.''

COMMENTARY: MR. BUSH'S HOMEWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times Op-Ed page sponsored a forum Thursday for
people to give advice to George W. Bush on how to reinvigorate his
campaign. I'm a day late, but here's my entry:
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Gov. Bush needs to grasp is the context of his
campaign. He should consider just a few facts:
</P>
<P>
   1. When Bill Clinton was elected president seven years ago there
were 50 pages on the World Wide Web. Today there are over 50
million.
</P>
<P>
   2. In 1992 no one had heard of e-commerce. This year retail
e-commerce alone in the United States will hit $50 billion _ all of
it untaxed, which is starting to drive mayors and governors crazy,
because they're losing their tax base. The original Boston Tea
Party was colonists throwing tea into the harbor under the motto
``No taxation without representation.'' The new Boston e-party will
be mayors and governors throwing Internet servers into the harbor
under the motto ``No representation without taxation.''
</P>
<P>
   3. The three biggest foreign relationships the United States has
today _ with Japan, Russia and China _ have all been turned upside
down, as all three countries go through the painful adjustment to
globalization. While U.S. foreign policy in the Cold War was about
how to manage the military strength of Russia and China and the
economic strength of Japan, today U.S. foreign policy is about how
to manage the weakness of Russia, China and Japan. The old security
agenda has been inverted, and with cybervandals disrupting Yahoo,
eBay, ETrade and Amazon.com, who knows what new threats are
emerging?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the whole context for this campaign is that we
are now in a period of radical change, possibly more sweeping and
complex than in any period since 1776-1789. While the candidates
are not talking about it, many voters feel it. And this leads to
Gov. Bush's biggest problem _ that many wonder whether he is up to
managing this complexity.
</P>
<P>
   You remember that silly picture of Michael Dukakis riding in a
tank, with an ill-fitting helmet on his head, in the 1988 campaign?
That picture helped to destroy Dukakis' chances because, at the
height of the Cold War with Russia, who could vote for someone who
looked so dopey in military headgear? Well, the dunce cap is to
this presidential campaign what that Army helmet was to the 1988
campaign. Any candidate who looks too comfortable in a dunce cap
has a real problem today.
</P>
<P>
   George W. is not a dunce, but he has not exactly demonstrated
that he is a master of complexity, and that is a particular
liability in this campaign. Voters look for one of two things in a
candidate: convictions or capabilities. Ronald Reagan was not the
smartest president, but he conveyed strong convictions about the
biggest issue of his day _ how to confront the Soviet Union _ and
people connected with that on a gut level. So much so that they
gave Reagan the freedom to pursue a nuanced, far-reaching arms
control policy toward Moscow. President Bush was not ideologically
consistent, but his curiosity and instincts made him
extraordinarily capable at managing the complexities of ending the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   What hampers George W. Bush today is a gnawing sense that he has
neither the convictions nor curiosities to cope with this new
world. (But beware John McCain: he may have too much conviction
about the Cold War foreign policy, and be too quick to invade in
all the wrong places.) George W. doesn't convey any sense that he
understands the period of radical change we are entering, or has
any big ideas _ other than a big tax cut _ for how to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   He also has another problem: We all know him, or at least we
think we do, because we all went to high school with him. We all
had a kid in our high school class _ the charming, pampered
goof-off, whom you let peek at your homework _ whom you loved for
fraternity president, but not student council president.
</P>
<P>
   A president doesn't need to be a genius to be successful, if he
has strong convictions relevant to his times. A president doesn't
need to have strong convictions to be successful, if he has
capabilities relevant to his times. But in a period of radical
change, a president must have one or the other. If George W. is to
survive, he must prove that he indeed has one or the other, that we
really don't know him, and that he really isn't just copying his
advisers' homework.

`PUSH POLLING' INCIDENT RATTLES MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ This was supposed to be ``Here's the beef''
week for Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, replete with confetti explosions and heady jubilation
after his New Hampshire triumph, was all about photo ops, screaming
college students, and prolonging the bump. Next week will be a blur
of handshakes, autographs, and organizing, a rush to win every last
heart, and vote, before the primary here on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   This week was to have been all about substance, about backing up
the appeal of the former prisoner of war's character and
personality _ which many of his strongest supporters cite as the
sole reason for their devotion _ with several large servings of
policy. It was McCain's chance to protect himself from the
devastating question Walter Mondale asked rival Gary Hart in 1984:
``Where's the beef?''
</P>
<P>
   So, McCain has delivered three formal addresses this week, on
crime, Social Security, and education.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't worked out quite as the Arizona Republican might
have hoped, and Donna Duren, a Spartanburg mother who came Thursday
to hear McCain's 20-minute education address at the University of
South Carolina, got right to the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son has now found himself a hero,'' she told the senator
during the question-and-answer period, starting, as many of the
questioners did, by heaping praise on McCain. Her 14-year-old son
wanted to be just like him now, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But yesterday,'' Duren said. ``(My son) was push-polled. I
don't know who called him, I don't know who is responsible, but he
was so upset when he came up the stairs, and he said, `Mom, someone
told me that Senator McCain is a cheat and a liar and a fraud,' and
he was almost in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so mad,'' Duren said, tears welling. ``I was so livid
last night I couldn't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, put off stride by Duren's comments, was far more
emotional than he usually is at town hall meetings, barely able to
speak at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disillusionment of a young boy is something I think any of
them, even as crass and as base as some of the people can get in
this business, would be ashamed of,'' McCain told her.
</P>
<P>
   (In push-polling, a campaign or advocacy group, under the guise
of conducting a poll, pushes its point of view to the people being
questioned.)
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, McCain spoke with Duren and embraced her,
promising to call her son personally. At a press conference outside
the university auditorium, McCain told reporters he was unable to
answer questions on the specifics of his education policies because
he was too rattled by what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said they have no doubt the Texas governor George
W. Bush was responsible for the call to Duren. But Bush spokesman
Ari Fleisher said the governor had nothing to do with Duren's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased to release a text of our advocacy calls and we
call on Senator McCain to release a text of his advocacy calls,''
he said. ``The charge that Governor Bush is making these calls is
as wrong as wrong can be.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an important time for McCain and issues, as the press
and pundits turn more of their energies to looking beyond his
personal appeal, particularly at his domestic policies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain only occasionally gives prepared speeches, but in South
Carolina, he has given three such speeches in three days.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he spoke on his plans to reduce crime and drug
problems. On Wednesday, he appeared before the American Association
of Retired Persons to outline his policies on Social Security. His
education-reform address Thursday pulled together themes McCain has
been voicing throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Though he provided few details, he mentioned plans for a $5.4
billion, three-year test voucher program for 1 million
schoolchildren, to be funded ``by eliminating corporate welfare,''
or tax breaks for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also called on states to develop high, uniform standards,
and for the federal government to withdraw from education, making
block grants directly to the schools, and leaving education
decisions to people who ``know your child's name.'' He closed by
calling for a reintroduction of virtues, voluntary prayer, and
patriotism in schools.

 &HT;    Texas education official reviews textbook approval process
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The vice chairwoman of the Texas State Board of
Education, in a move closely watched by textbook publishers
nationwide, began a review Thursday of the state's method of
approving schoolbooks _ a $200 million a year enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Miller (R-Dallas) said she is reviewing the system in
hopes of passing board rules _ and state legislation _ that will
reinstate some of the board's control over content in textbooks,
which the Legislature stripped in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to fix this system _ it's broken,'' Miller said in
an interview. ``Under the old system, we were able to get better
books. There were a lot of checks and balances.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Miller can convince the 15-member board to extend the
board's reach on textbooks, she may be tilting at political
windmills when it comes to the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say with the current situation on that board, I'd be
surprised if the Legislature put more authority back in the hands
of that board,'' said Sen. Bill Ratliff (R-Mount Pleasant),
chairman of the budget-writing Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature in 1995 aimed to give local school districts
more choices and ease jitters of publishers whose books were
snagged in factional feuding among board members. Under legislation
Ratliff helped author, the education board is legally required to
approve textbooks if they are error free, meet manufacturing
standards and cover curriculum standards, called the Texas
Essential Elements (TEKs).
</P>
<P>
   Books that meet 100 percent of the TEKs are placed on a
so-called conforming list. Those that contain less than that are
put on a ``nonconforming'' list. Local school districts can pick
books from either list and the state still picks up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   David Dunn, a spokesman for the Texas Association of School
Boards, said he doubts that local districts would welcome a return
to the old system because the new system offers them far more
choices in textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and others point out that the old centralized process,
which prior to 1995 gave the state board virtually total control
over textbooks, including the power to edit content, went a long
way in improving the quality of textbooks at a time when books,
curriculum and academic standards varied dramatically among local
Texas school districts.
</P>
<P>
   But the same centralized process that brought higher quality
textbooks to public schools subsequently set off wars over
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The battles, which pitted the board's social conservatives, all
Republicans, against the more moderate Democrats and Republicans,
centered on issues of God, mother and country. Prior to the change
in law, health books were ensnared in arguments about whether they
should contain photographs of a professional woman carrying a
briefcase, illustrations of a woman's breast depicted in a
self-examination and how human reproduction organs should be
defined.
</P>
<P>
   Science books also were entangled in feuds over whether the
books should contain biblical references to creationism alongside
scientific theories of evolution. Other battles involved history,
math and environmental science, all which triggered costly
revisions for publishers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, publisher Holt, Rinehart and Winston Inc., pulled its
health book from the Texas market, one of the nation's largest and
most influential, rather than make costly revisions ordered by the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the latest controversy over first-grade readers
triggered the review. Miller and a majority of board members
directed publishers to make last-minute revisions to add more
phonics to the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear what she wants to do is return to the days of
glory before (the state law) when the board had absolute power,''
said one lobbyist who represents a publisher who asked for
anonymity, saying he feared retaliation by the board. ``Publishers
feel the new law is working well.''

   Jordan, who had never before endorsed a political candidate,
will begin appearing Friday in television ads in which he praises
Bradley's promise to curb the epidemic of gun violence, whose
victims include Jordan's late father. The ads will air in several
states, including Califonia, New York and Ohio, with primaries on
March 7 that are crucial to the Bradley campaign's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's entry into the Democratic primary, at the possible risk
of alienating devotees of his vast array of commercial products,
may give Bradley a sorely needed publicity boost as he trails badly
in the race for presidency. But Jordan's seal of approval also
raises questions about the value of a celebrity endorsement, even
when the backer is Jordan, arguably the most idolized sports figure
on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be a big help,'' said Bradley, a former New
Jersey senator and Hall of Fame basketball player, said Thursday in
east Los Angeles after blasting Vice President Al Gore's record on
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Though Oprah Winfrey's support might be the only celebrity
endorsement more coveted than Jordan's, several political analysts
said Jordan, for all his superstardom, is highly unlikely to sell
Bradley with as much as success as he has moved Gatorade, Big Macs
and Air Jordan sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basic view is that it doesn't translate,'' said
California-based Democratic consultant Bill Carrick. ``I'm
skeptical about any of these endorsements doing much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's celebrity is colossal and international. When he
visited France for a McDonald's champshionship game, a Paris
newspaper reportedly gushed, ``Michael Jordan is in Paris. That's
better than the Pope. It's God in person.'
</P>
<P>
   But he has never lent the power of his image to a political
cause. Indeed, Jordan's reticence to discuss politics has drawn
criticism in the past from such athletes as the late tennis great
Arthur Ashe and former NFL running back Jim Brown, who once said
Jordan ``is more interested in his image for shoe deals than he is
in helping his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan often bristled at such criticism. ``I can't save the
world by no means,'' Jordan said at his 1999 NBA retirement press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, with an assist from Phil Jackson, his former teammate
on the New York Knicks, convinced Jordan to tape the ad two months
ago. Jackson, now coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, was coach of the
Chicago Bulls as Jordan won five Most Valuable Player awards and 10
scoring titles in leading the Bulls to six championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked hard to bring new people into the political
process,'' Bradly said, ``and to bring people together around a
shared vision for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said they waited to release the ad in part to
bolster Bradley's attack on Gore's gun-control record, though some
analysts suggested Bradley wanted to save the ad but was compelled
to exploit it now because of his poor standing in some polls.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, in addition to praising Bradley's leadership on gun
control, looks directly into the camera lens in the television
spots and expresses admiration for the former New Jersey senator's
stance on health care and several other issues. Bradley aides
refused to release a tape or script of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's staff, careful not to be seen as critical of Jordan,
responded to the endorsement by tweaking Bradley and noting the
vice president's NBA endorsements, most notably Los Angeles Lakers
center Shaquille O'Neal and New Jersey Nets forward Jayson
Williams. In addition, the Gore camp said, Jordan's mother,
Deloris, is behind the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan is awesome,'' said Gore spokesman Doug
Hattaway. ``But I'm not sure he can do for the Bradley campaign
what he did for the Bulls. Bradley's message is out of juice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has lost the first three presidential contests, in Iowa,
New Hampshire and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Democratic consultant Dan Payne said that while
Jordan's endorsement may not automatically win Bradley votes, it
will refocus attention on his campaign at a time when he has been
obscured by a resurgent Gore and the dramatic rise of Arizona
Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will get attention,'' Payne said. ``I think it will raise
brand awarenmess, but its unlikely to boost sales. People will know
that it happened but it isn't neccessarily going to deliver them to
the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has tried with little success in recent days to loosen
Gore's grip on the core Democratic constituencies, particularly
minorities, that are expected to decide the contest by March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Carrick said the Bradley campaign may be hoping the Jordan ad
will sway black voters, whom some polls suggest support Gore by as
much as a 2-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his aides said they are targeting a wide audience
with Jordan's message. Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said Bradley
and Jordan have no public appearances scheduled together, though
both will attend the NBA All-Star festivities Saturday in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan endorsement overshadowed a growing skirmish between
Gore and Bradley over gun control. Bradley, citing Gore's support
for National Rifle Association initiatives when he served in the
Congress in the 1980s, said the NRA could have made Gore ``NRA man
of the year'' at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane admitted that the vice president had
changed his position on gun control, an evolution he said occurred
in the late 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times change. And solutions change,'' Lehane said. ``The
public responds to a leader who responds to changing times. His
position on gun control has changed. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore became more pro-gun control after episodes of gun violence
in the 1980s, Lehane said, although he could not name a specific
episode which moved Gore to alter his view.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference between the candidates on gun control is
that Bradley has called for the licensing and registration of all
65 million handguns in the country, while Gore wants similar
regulation only for newly purchased handguns.

LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES PRESS SEARCH FOR WEB SITE DISRUPTERS 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Expressing concern about the economic damage,
including stock market sell-offs, caused by the attacks on leading
Web sites this week, the Justice Department said Thursday that
tougher criminal penalties might be necessary to prevent malicious
disruption of internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider this a prank,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder said Thursday at a news conference. ``These are very serious
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Thursday that as part of the
investigation, it had begun a check on some 7,600 military computer
systems to determine if any had been used as relay points by the
internet attackers. At the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a
spokesman said that four field offices had opened formal
investigations: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not cyberterrorism, this is cybercriminality,'' said
an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. And
it has frightening implications, he said. If they can shut down
Ebay or Yahoo, the next target may well be the National Security
Agency or satellites, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, attacks have blocked access to several major
Internet sites, sometimes for several hours. They have included
Yahoo; Buy.com, a retail site whose stock began trading this week;
ETrade, one of the largest online brokerage firms, and eBay.com,
the online auction site.
</P>
<P>
   As the attacks appeared to taper off, law enforcement agencies
and computer security experts pressed their search for those
responsible, turning up some evidence but acknowledging the
difficulty of the investigation. They said many Web sites remained
vulnerable because of inadequate security precautions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been holding meetings for the past two years
with computer industry leaders to discuss security, and another
meeting is set for next week, David Leavy, a White House spokesman,
said Thursday. He declined to say who would attend, but said that
the purpose would be for the government and private industry to
cooperate in enhancing computer security.
</P>
<P>
   While the government recognizes an obligation to prosecute
criminal activity on the internet, there are knottier questions
about the obligation to protect a private internet company from
vandalism and just how much protection is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are moving into relatively new ground: no crime
scene, no rubble to comb through, no DNA. At the same time, experts
say, in the end some of the traditional police techniques, from
developing informants to picking up tips on the street, may be what
eventually cracks the case.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been expanding its computer
crime-fighting capabilities in recent years and has established
computer crime squads in FBI offices around the country, and
trained prosecutors in U.S. attorneys' offices. At the FBI, a
National Infrastructure Protection Center was established to help
coordinate such investigations, and Holder said the president is
seeking an additional $37 million next year to further expand these
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He said the extra money would help set up regional computer
forensic labs that would respond more quickly to problems. ``Time
is important in these matters,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that the first obligation for protecting against
hackers is on the company. ``The company has to hire their own
guards,'' said William Arkin, an expert on the national security
dimensions of the internet. He used the analogy of a house
burglary: Law-enforcement agencies have an obligation to search for
and prosecute the criminal. But the government does not have an
obligation to install an alarm system in your home, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The police do, of course, have patrols that are intended to
provide protection in the neighborhood. ``There are no patrol cars
on the internet,'' Arkin noted.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton pointed to cyberspace's perils as
well as its benefits. ``We live in an age when one person sitting
at one computer, can come up with an idea, travel through
cyberspace and take humanity to new heights,'' he said. ``Yet,
someone can sit at the same computer, hack into a computer system
and potentially paralyze a company, a city or a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever resources the government puts into its investigative
efforts, it will be impossible to protect against all invasions,
said John Thomas, commander of the Pentagon's Global Operations
Security Center for four years until his retirement last summer. He
is now with AverStar, an information technology company with its
headquarters in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Given that there is no absolute defense against computer crime,
a company, like the government, has to ask what information must be
protected and how much it is willing to pay. ``You would spend a
corporate treasury, or national treasury, trying to protect
everything,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said it was possible to become alarmist about the risks
from computer crime. But he added, it is not possible to know who
the attackers are, and who might be behind them. ``Who is to say it
is not been mentored by organized crime, corporate espionage,
foreign governments, or terrorists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Internet's anonymity, there are fingerprints, in a
sense, because every computer connecting to the internet has a
unique address. But it is possible to bury this address under
layers of data, just as a money launderer hides his activities
through layers of shell corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this case will be solved, if it is, ``in physical
space, not cyberspace,'' said Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will have to go onto the streets, as they do
routinely, looking for informants or someone the hackers bragged
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hackers will do a lot to cover their tracks in cyberspace,''
he said. ``Where they're vulnerable is physical space.''

INVESTORS SHUN U.S. AUCTION OF 30-YEAR BONDS

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For several weeks, the Treasury bond market has been
whipsawed by uncertainty associated with the government's plan to
buy back some publicly held long-term debt with the budget surplus.
There have been sharp daily moves, then reversals a day later. And
traders say that they have often been on the wrong side of the
action, causing painful losses for some.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Wall Street dealers and traders indicated that they
had had enough. They shunned the Treasury's auction of $10 billion
in new 30-year bonds, leaving the government with the least demand
ever at such a sale. ``People didn't want the risk of participating
because they didn't know where it would come out,'' said Louis
Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Those results, and growing frustration over the signals from the
Treasury _ even though some have been misinterpreted _ sent
Treasury prices tumbling while yields, which move in the opposite
direction, shot higher.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the yield on the 30-year bond, which is usually
higher than that on short-term securities to entice investors, has
fallen below that of the two-year note. Then Thursday the spread
between the yield on the two-year note and the 30-year bond
narrowed sharply, giving the bond market another sudden jolt.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the new 30-year bond, which was auctioned at 6.34
percent, finished at 6.32 percent, well up from the 6.17 percent
Wednesday in the so-called when-issued market. The yield on the old
30-year bond jumped to 6.42 percent from 6.31 percent, while the
price fell 1 12/32 to 96 1/32.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the two-year note rose to 6.65 percent from 6.63
percent Wednesday. On Tuesday, the yield on the two-year note was
6.67 percent, while the yield on the new 30-year bond was 6.10
percent, a spread of just over half a percentage point. That spread
has now narrowed to a third of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   These swift and costly swings are the result of the distortions
that have occurred in the market since the Treasury confirmed on
Jan. 13 that it would be buying back longer-term debt. The yield on
the 10-year note has also been distorted as Wall Street firms
indicated that it would replace the 30-year bond as the market
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   The distortions were exacerbated last Wednesday, when a few more
details about the buybacks were announced along with the news that
the amount of the the new 30-year bond offering, being sold
Thursday and in May, would be much smaller than expected. The
prospect of limited supply led to panic buying last Thursday. As
the price rose, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.13 percent,
from 6.28 percent Wednesday and then jumped back up to 6.26 percent
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say these swings produced big losses but no one is
owning up to them so far.
</P>
<P>
   Before a Treasury auction, dealers on Wall Street usually go
short on the issue to be sold _ that is, in this case, they sell
30-year bonds they own to make room for the ones they expect to buy
when they bid in the auction. This assures that they do not wind up
with more than they want.
</P>
<P>
   But because so many dealers wanted nothing to do with the new
30-year bond, they did not go short ahead of the auction, traders
said. They then made very weak bids in the auction, leaving the
bonds to insurance companies and pension funds that need them for
investing and money management purposes.
</P>
<P>
   This meant that the new bond's yield soared. Just before the
bidding closed, the yield in the when-issued market was 6.24
percent and the yield of the auction was 6.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't feel confident going short,'' said Charles
Parkhurst, managing director for government bond trading at Salomon
Smith Barney, explaining that dealers just did not want to risk
being short 30-year bonds if the price suddenly took off again and
did not want the new bond either.
</P>
<P>
   N. Graham Allen, managing director for global fixed income at
Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles, said he was not interested
in the new 30-year bond because the trading distortions had sent
the yield down too low and ``we couldn't see what was going to
maintain that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion Thursday were comments made on Wednesday
by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. Many investors took his
remarks as a signal that the Treasury would also buy back
shorter-term securities, leaving many investors to conclude that
the 30-year bond was not so special after all. Although the
Treasury indicated this interpretation was wrong and that the
buybacks would be of long-term securities, investors sold the
30-year bond Wednesday, pushing the yield higher.
</P>
<P>
   But the flight from the 30-year bond may not be so bad. Crandall
said the two-day selloff was unwinding some of the distortions that
had racked the bond market.  &QL;

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``The McCain organization?'' chuckled Thomas J.
Kirwan, a New York state assemblyman. ``In my district, that's me
and three fellows I've never met.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, armed with a modest amount of money
and no organization to speak of, remains the underdog against Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who has plenty of both. On March 7,
McCain's limited resources will be stretched thin by having to
compete in Republican primaries in 16 states, including New York
and California.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many supporters of Bush, the overwhelming choice of the
party's leaders, are worried. And some prominent New York
Republican elected and party officials, who did not want their
names used, are concerned that they jumped on the Bush bandwagon
too soon, failing to anticipate McCain's challenge and Bush's
weaknesses _ though all insist they have no plans to change
allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is some of that going on, but I think it's
ill-advised,'' said Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau County
Republican Party chairman, who is running to be a Bush delegate.
``I still think Bush is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mondello and many Bush supporters have been sensing a
buzz for McCain in the weeks before the rarest of events in recent
Republican history in New York state. There has not been a
genuinely contested presidential primary since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk with my club members, my committeemen and people
in general, there's a lot of talk about McCain,'' Mondello said.
``Right now, John McCain is hot. My feelings are that in this
state, this is a pretty close thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter T. King, a Bush backer, learned this week to his
surprise that even his wife plans to vote for McCain. ``New York's
definitely in play,'' King said. ``Every time I walk across the
street from my office in Massapequa Park to go to the deli, people
stop me to talk about McCain. Everywhere I go, people spontaneously
bring up his name. That's not something I've seen since Reagan.
This may not last through March 7, but the Bush people should
definitely be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An upstate Republican county chairman put it more bluntly. ``All
I'm hearing is McCain, McCain, McCain,'' he said, a chant that was
fed by the party's ill-fated efforts to keep the senator off the
New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will be campaigning in New York on Friday for the first
time since winning a place on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp insists that it has no fears about New York, or
about what amounts to a national primary March 7. McCain ``may rue
the day that he got on the ballot,'' said Zenia Mucha,
communications director for Gov. George E. Pataki, Bush's leading
booster in New York, ``because now he's going to have to decide
which state he's going to compete in, New York or California, and
he certainly doesn't have the money, the organization or the time
to compete effectively in both.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, McCain's immediate disadvantage in New York is
that he cannot count on independents, who provided most of his
margin of victory in New Hampshire, and are expected to contribute
strongly to his showing in the next primary state, South Carolina.
Only registered Republicans can vote in New York's Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the enormous gulf between the candidates'
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people carrying petitions for us who had never done it
before, no idea what they were doing,'' said Seth N. Arluck, a
retail lumber dealer who is a McCain volunteer in Orange County.
``But all 400 party committeemen in Orange County got Bush
petitions to carry. They've got vote phone banks, and we're
scraping by to find people with multiple phone lines who'll let us
use one.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither camp has begun handing out literature and posting signs,
but when they do, Arluck said, ``we don't even know yet if the
campaign will be able to buy the stuff we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every prominent Republican, at the state or local level,
supports Bush. Of the 93 people running to be Bush delegates in New
York, three in each congressional district, more than 50 are
elected officials, including members of Congress, state legislators
and county executives. Most of the rest are party officials.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has the support of only three elected officials _ Kirwan,
of Newburgh, his state campaign chairman, Borough President Guy
Molinari of Staten Island, and state Sen. John Marchi. Not one
party official is backing him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said it was ``very, very hard'' even to find people to
run as delegates. ``We had to reach out to a lot of people with no
experience in politics, people who e-mailed messages of support to
McCain's headquarters. We had to confirm that they were registered
Republicans, that they lived in the right districts, give them
instructions on how to fill out their petitions.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush's institutional support translates into an army of foot
soldiers. The elected and party officials have staffs, political
clubs and corps of volunteers from previous campaigns that they can
tap to find people to work for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is money. At last report, McCain had $7.7 million in
hand, though his campaign says it expects to raise $5 million or
more between New Hampshire and New York, plus nearly that much in
federal matching funds. Bush, who is forgoing matching funds, has
$31 million in hand, and is raising more.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At times, the broader the playing field, the more important
money becomes, because the battle is fought mostly over the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain did, what, 105, 110 town meetings in New Hampshire,
which has a population smaller than the Bronx,'' said state Sen.
Guy Velella, the Bronx Republican chairman who is running as a Bush
delegate. ``If he did 105 town meetings in the Bronx, he'd probably
win there, too, but there isn't time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he added, ``we've got to be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the built-in disadvantages of a lack of money,
troops and time would doom McCain, but this is no ordinary contest.
New York has almost no experience with contested, statewide
Republican primaries, because the party bosses have seen to it by
pressuring candidates to drop out, or keeping them off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Republican voters could choose among Bob Dole, Steve
Forbes and Patrick Buchanan, but it was a foregone conclusion that
Dole would win the primary and the nomination, and turnout was just
14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 and 1988, the eventual presidential nominees, Ronald
Reagan and George Bush respectively, were running unopposed by the
time of the New York primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The last real contest in a New York Republican presidential
primary was in 1976, when Reagan unsuccessfully challenged
President Gerald Ford. New York has not had a contested Republican
primary for a statewide office since Alfonse D'Amato defeated Sen.
Jacob Javits in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual factor is the extremely high interest in this
contest, with its compelling subplots like McCain's experience as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, his ballot access fight in New York,
his strong victory in New Hampshire, and the contrasts between his
lean operation and freewheeling style, and the cautious Bush
juggernaut.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In a primary, the main effect an organization has is alerting
voters and getting them out, because most people don't vote in a
primary,'' King said. In this case, he and others argued, turnout
is likely to be relatively high, perhaps 30 to 40 percent,
diminishing the importance of organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks ago, I would have said it was Bush all the
way in New York,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist
College Institute of Public Opinion. ``But I think right now all
bets are off.''

CREDIT CINCINNATI WITH A STEAL IN GRIFFEY DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds had their cake Thursday, and they ate it,
too. Icing? They had plenty.
</P>
<P>
   With their general manager, Jim Bowden, executing his strategy
perfectly to the end, the Reds acquired Ken Griffey Jr. from the
Seattle Mariners for a bargain package of players and an even
bigger bargain financially.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who wanted to play in Cincinnati, his hometown, agreed
to a nine-year contract worth $116.5 million, an average of
$12,944,444 a year, which falls $2 million short of the game's
highest annual average salary. Last year, he rejected a Seattle
offer of $148 million for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who has hit 398 home runs in 11 seasons, will have a
$12.5 million salary each year, deferring $5.5 million the first
year and $6.5 million each year after that. The deferred money will
not accrue interest until he reaches the payout period, which will
run from 2009 through 2024. The contract has an option year for
2009 at a $16.5 million salary or a $4 million buyout. Bowden, who
two months ago ostensibly had given up his pursuit of the player he
says is his favorite in the game, sent the Mariners four players,
but none of the best ones Seattle wanted. The Mariners accepted
Brett Tomko, a still developing starting pitcher; Mike Cameron, the
center fielder Griffey will supplant, and two minor-leaguers,
Antonio Perez, a second baseman, and Jake Meyers, a relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners did not got first baseman Sean Casey, second
baseman Pokey Reese, starting pitcher Denny Neagle or reliever
Scott Williamson, the National League rookie of the year last
season. They didn't even get Travis Dawkins, a good-hitting
shortstop, who was considered the Reds' best minor-league prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' an executive of another club said upon hearing of the
Reds' double-barreled steal that gave the National League Central
the three top home run hitters of recent seasons _ Griffey, Mark
McGwire of St. Louis and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs. In the
past three seasons, they have slugged a total of 518 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this thing three months ago,'' Pat Gillick,
the Mariners' general manager, said by telephone from Seattle,
``the guys that were rumored we were asking for we were asking for.
But they never put them in the deal. Anytime we tried to introduce
them into the deal, they basically would not talk about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Reds retain the good players the Mariners
wanted, but they also kept a lot of their money, paying Griffey far
less than a player of his caliber, arguably No. 1 in all of
baseball, would normally command.
</P>
<P>
   Some management people expected the Players Association to be
upset with the contract because it was so far below market value,
but Donald Fehr, the executive director, said the deal was
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it demonstrates,'' Fehr said, ``is that contrary to the
beliefs some people have, players don't always insist on top
dollar, and other things matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, a Los Angeles Dodgers' pitcher, is the highest-paid
player at an average salary of $15 million a year. Derek Jeter is
expected to wind up with a seven-year, $118.5 million contract from
the Yankees ($16.9 million a year). The Detroit Tigers recently
offered Juan Gonzalez a contract said to be worth $140 million over
eight years ($17.5 million a year), and an executive of another
club said Thursday he heard that the deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   Had Griffey waited until the end of the coming season and become
a free agent, he could have topped them all, given the Mariners'
offer that averaged $18.5 million a year. But Griffey wanted to
play in Cincinnati, where he grew up and where his father is a
coach and supposedly manager-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   As one of baseball's low-revenue teams, the Reds usually are
paring payroll, not expanding it with an eight-figure salary. But
once the Mariners announced last November that they planned to
trade the 10-time all-star because he did not intend to sign a new
contract with them, the Reds jumped into the pursuit along with
other teams.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the Reds became the only team Griffey said he
would accept a trade to. He had that right as a player who has
played 10 years in the major leagues, the last five with the same
team. The New York Mets thought they had a chance to snatch Griffey
in a trade in December, but he rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, Dec. 11, Bowden had declared the Reds out of
the chase, saying he wouldn't give up one particular player the
Mariners insisted on having. The general manager didn't identify
the player, but it was Reese, and he wasn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden held to his position, and Gillick eventually dropped
Reese from their talks. Still, the talks weren't going anywhere
because Bowden resisted giving Gillick other players he wanted. But
Gillick was not dealing from strength.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four players the Mariners received, the one they seemed
to want most was Cameron, a 27-year-old center fielder, whom the
Reds had obtained from the Chicago White Sox a year ago. He batted
.256 last season, hitting 21 home runs, driving in 66 runs and
stealing 38 bases.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko is a 26-year-old right-handed pitcher with a 29-26 record
for his three seasons in the major leagues. Last season, he had a
5-7 record with a 4.92 earned run average in 26 starts and seven
relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, a Dominican Republic native, has played two seasons in
the minor leagues. The 18-year-old second baseman batted .288 and
had 35 stolen bases last season with Rockford of the Class A
Midwest League. Meyer, a right-handed reliever, has pitched for
three seasons, splitting last season between Rockford and
Chattanooga of the Class AA Southern League.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a chance to get Ken Griffey Jr. for those
players,'' said the executive who said ``wow,'' ``that's a very
good trade for Cincinnati. Seattle got put into a box and couldn't
get out.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House passed a Republican-sponsored bill
Thursday that would cut taxes for married couples by $182 billion
over the next decade, brushing aside the Clinton administration's
position that any such tax cut should be far smaller and be enacted
only after more pressing issues are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 268-158, with 48 Democrats voting in favor and no
Republicans voting against.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was presented by its Republican sponsors as a
reduction in the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that
pushes some two-income married couples into higher tax brackets or
limits their deductions, making them pay more taxes than they would
if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   But its benefits would go to all married couples, including
those who are not affected by the penalty and those whose tax bill
is lower because they are married. It would provide no tax cut to
single people.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal-leaning
research group, found that when fully phased in, the House bill
would give an average tax cut of $193 a year to couples with
incomes of $20,000 to $30,000. For couples with incomes of $75,000
to $100,000, the reduction would be $1,003, and for couples with
incomes of $100,000 to $200,000 it would be $1,016, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tax cut would not take effect until the second half
of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal budget surplus rising, taxes are sure to remain
an issue of heated debate between Republicans and Democrats this
year, both in Washington and in the presidential race. Although
White House officials attacked the bill passed Thursday, members of
both parties held out some hope for a compromise on marriage
penalty relief this year.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that Thursday's vote was as much about election
year politics as about advancing toward a deal, with Republicans
eager to put Democrats on record as voting against a politically
popular measure.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first in a series of narrowly targeted tax cuts that
Republicans plan to bring up this year in an effort to portray
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Democrats in Congress
as unwilling to return the government's excess revenues to
taxpayers. Clinton vetoed a $792 billion Republican tax cut last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said eliminating the marriage penalty was a matter
of simple fairness. They said there was no excuse for waiting,
given the projections of a large and growing surplus. They called
the tax-reduction bill an early Valentine's Day gift to couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more immoral than taxing people just because they fall
in love?'' said Rep. Tillie Fowler, a Republican from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the House and administration officials said they
support the goal of reducing or eliminating the marriage penalty.
But they said that the Republican approach was too expensive, and
that the issue should be put on hold until Congress and the White
House settle on an overall budget plan that would provide for
eliminating the national debt and assuring the long-term solvency
of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Before approving the Republican bill Thursday, the House
rejected a Democratic alternative. The bill would have reduced
taxes on some married couples by $95 billion over 10 years, but
only on the condition of a bipartisan agreement to deal with debt
repayment, Social Security and Medicare. The vote to reject it was
233-192, largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Enacting a big tax cut before the nation has dealt with its
long-term fiscal problems, said Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri,
the Democratic leader in the House, ``threatens our prosperity and
risks our future.''
</P>
<P>
   While they stopped just short of an outright veto threat,
administration officials made clear that Clinton would not sign a
bill like the one passed by the House. The White House has offered
its own plan, valued at $45 billion over 10 years, that would be
restricted mostly to couples with moderate incomes who claim the
standard deduction on their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we should genuinely ease the marriage penalty for both
middle- and lower-middle-income groups,'' Clinton said in a meeting
Thursday with Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the Senate plan to bring up their own
marriage penalty legislation this year, although they have not
settled on details.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty stems in part from efforts dating back to
1948 to smooth out other inequities in the tax code, including a
once-widespread problem that led a single-earner household to have
a higher tax bill than a two-earner household with the same income.
It has become more of a political issue as more women have entered
the work force and continued working after marriage.
</P>
<P>
   No one in either party Thursday defended the elements of the tax
code that created the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the marriage penalty only hits two-income couples, mainly
those in which the two partners make roughly similar amounts of
money. Many other couples, especially those with a single income,
actually receive a marriage bonus _ a lower tax bill than they
would have if they were single and filing separately.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by analysts at the Treasury Department
concluded that of 51.4 million joint returns filed in 1999, 24.8
million, or 48 percent, had a marriage penalty, averaging $1,141.
</P>
<P>
   Another 21 million couples, or 41 percent, had a marriage bonus,
averaging $1,274. The remainder have neither a penalty nor a bonus.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ Like most children growing up across North
America in the 1960s, Jim Compton took cultural clues from the
family television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had six-shooters and a cowboy outfit,'' said Compton, a
member of the Saulteaux tribe in Saskatchewan. ``I identified more
with John Wayne. Not with the Indian that got shot down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a 20-year career in television, Compton has his hands
on a tool that he hopes will improve the television images that
will wash over the next generation of Canada's indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   In December, from newly completed studios in this city on the
central plains, broadcasting started for the Aboriginal People's
Television Network, APTN. Compton is program director for what he
bills as ``the world's first national aboriginal television
network.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cultural collision between Indian America and European
America grinds into its sixth century, the aboriginal network seeks
to create an electronic home and meeting place for Canada's million
Indians, Eskimos and Metis, or people of mixed race. Aboriginals
constitute the fastest-growing segment of the population. But
native communities are often the most troubled, with high rates of
suicide, unemployment, incarceration and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indians say the intrusion of European-dominated television
programming into native houses contributed to cultural dislocation
and loss of pride. In the 70s, a group of Eskimo elders in the
Eastern Arctic described television as ``an atomic bomb that leaves
buildings intact, but destroys the lives and souls of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, they were getting images that did not reflect
their cultures,'' Compton said of television's demoralizing
effects. ``All of a sudden, native people had to try be like Barbie
and Ken.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, an Indian-centered view of the world is the fare on
APTN, which is now included by law in the basic cable package
received by all Canadian subscribers, nearly 8 million households.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching into the far corners of Canada, the network started
broadcasting in September from studios in Yellowknife, where it
supplanted a decade-old network that served only Inuit communities
in the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inuaraq teaches his son how to survive using the old ways:
driving dogs, building igloos, catching seals in open water and
running down caribou to feed the family,'' says the network program
guide about ``Dog Team,'' an Inuit, or Eskimo, show broadcast in
English, the lingua franca of the large majority of Canada's
indigenous peoples. About one-fourth of the programming is in one
of about 18 aboriginal languages.
</P>
<P>
   For young people, there is also ``Spirit Bay,'' a half-hour
drama told through the eyes of children who live in a village in
the northern wilderness. The program guide summarizes, ``Lives of
trapping cabins and fishing boats, freezing winter storms and quiet
summer afternoons.''
</P>
<P>
   For aboriginal peoples steeped in ancient oral history
traditions, there is ``Storytime,'' English-language segments
filmed at the Yukon International Storytelling Festival. For Inuit
speakers of Inuktitut, there is ``Kippinguijautit,'' described on
the network's Web site, www.aptn.ca, as ``funny and interesting
stories of traditional and contemporary Inuit ways of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching on political issues, the network has broadcast
``Hunters and Bombers,'' a documentary on the fight by Labrador
natives against low-level military flights over their homeland, and
``Unfinished Business,'' a documentary about native struggles to
have the government live up to land treaties.
</P>
<P>
   For perspective, the network has shown films on tribes in
Brazil, Papua New-Guinea and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure a high percentage of Canadian content, the federal
broadcasting authority limits ``foreign'' programming on all
stations. So APTN is allowed only 12 hours of shows considered
foreign out of the weekly broadcast of 120.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Indian world view, Compton said, this rule
electronically reinforces the artificial, European division of
North America, where Blackfoot, Dine, Mohawk, Ojibway and other
tribes straddle the U.S.-Canada border.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a province with a sizable Ojibwe population, Compton
predicted that regulators would rule that a six-part series under
production on the Ojibway of Minnesota was ``foreign.''
</P>
<P>
   The network hopes to generate advertising revenue by telecasting
some programs intended to draw large white crossover audiences.
This year, a weekly aboriginal ``blockbuster'' film program will
begin, with Gary Farmer, a Cayuga from Ontario who acted in the
movie ``Smoke Signals,'' as the host. Popular programs already
shown include a music special by Buffy Ste. Marie, a Cree from
Saskatchewan, and ``Cooking With the Wolfman,'' an aboriginal
cooking presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had 14,000 hits on my Web site, a lot of queries about
recipes,'' said the host, David Wolfman, a member of the Lillooet
tribe of British Columbia. ``People are liking the caribou and
venison recipes. But we also have done vegetarian recipes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In March, the network plans to start a regular native-affairs
news program.
</P>
<P>
   Late last fall, when there was a violent confrontation between
Mi'kmaq Indian fishermen and white lobstermen in Atlantic Canada,
an APTN reporter found that he enjoyed special access among
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reception was open arms,'' said Dan David, an aboriginal
who is a veteran television reporter and who has been hired as the
network news director. ``It was, `Come onto our boats, come into
our homes.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the network only weeks old at the time, Compton said, he
was pleased by the instant recognition and acceptance by rural
native communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would only talk to him,'' Compton said, recalling the
warm reception for David by Mi'kmaq fishermen and self-defense
groups. ``They knew he would get their point of view across.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton, who worked for nine years here as a reporter for the
Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the government-controlled network,
added, ``Our people do not trust the mainstream media to be
forthcoming on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The national press has largely given a sympathetic welcome to
the network, which under the terms of its approval by the federal
licensing authority, draws most of its $10 million annual budget
from mandatory cable fees, $1.25 a year for each subscribing
household. Although an Angus Reid poll conducted in 1998 indicated
that two-thirds of Canadians supported the concept of a national
aboriginal network, some caustic press reviews reflect a deep
racial and cultural divide among some Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only white liberals will watch the Aboriginal Peoples
Television Network,'' headlined a column by Kevin Michael Grace in
Western Report, a conservative newsweekly that is widely read here
on the prairie.
</P>
<P>
   After complaining that the network budget was ``picked from the
pockets of cable subscribers,'' Grace predicted that its
programming would be ``endless reairings of ponderous
government-funded documentaries with lots of long lingering shots
of water, trees and rocks and lots of elders condemning the endless
perfidy of the white man.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day the network went on the air, The National Post
greeted it with an editorial denouncing it as ``an electronic
reserve'' maintained by ``an aboriginal TV tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Making cable subscribers to support the network perpetuates
``the stereotypes of Indians as people who must be given a handout
to succeed,'' said the paper, which is edited in Toronto and sells
nationwide. ``It also sends the message that a politically favored
ethnic group can force its way into our living rooms and wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments fall flat in the APTN newsroom in Winnipeg, where
projections indicate that the work force will be 25 percent
aboriginal in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't judge us with racist attitudes,'' said Compton, whose
goal is to rub out the old stereotypes of Indians as sidekicks or
savages.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to a future with a prouder, more self-confident
aboriginal population in Canada, the television executive, who long
ago traded his Roy Rogers outfit for jeans and a braid, summarized
the network's philosophy as, ``Yeah, I can be Indian in this world
_ and make a go of it.''

IN NEW YORK'S SENATE RACE, UPSTATE EMERGES AS KEY BATTLEGROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y. _ By the usual rules of statewide political
campaigns, upstate New York is for Republicans. The green and
gritty expanse of small towns and cities, farmland and mountains
that roll north and west from Westchester County to Canada has for
50 years been the part of New York where Republicans could turn to
counterbalance the lopsided Democratic vote that inevitably emerges
from New York City. For Democrats, upstate was a place to just hold
down the losses.
</P>
<P>
   But as New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani arrived in this
suburb of Buffalo for a quick visit Thursday evening _ following
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who campaigned here Monday _ it was clear
that the geographic forces that once governed politics in New York
have been turned on their head. For reasons having to do with the
peculiarities of this U.S. Senate race and its candidates, upstate
New York is in play as it rarely has been before; if aides to
Clinton and Giuliani agree on anything now, it is that the outcome
of their race is likely to be determined beyond New York City and
its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks the suburbs are key,'' Sen. Charles E.
Schumer, D-N.Y., who toppled the Republican incumbent Sen. Alfonse
M. D'Amato in 1998, said in an interview, noting what once had been
common wisdom about the geopolitics of New York. ``But to me,
upstate is the key battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, this is, to a large extent, the politics of
necessity. Giuliani's popularity in New York City, and his proven
success at drawing the enthusiastic support of Democratic voters in
both of his mayoral victories, threaten to cut Clinton off from
what should be an easy source of votes, forcing her to turn here to
make up the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, and against most Republicans, such a gambit by a
Democratic candidate might prove futile, given the region's decided
Republican registration advantage and generally conservative edge.
In this contest, though, many politicians, pollsters and academics
have concluded the advantage of Giuliani's Republican party
affiliation is offset by what he is most famously known as: the
hard-fighting mayor of New York City, a place that has long been
viewed by voters here as both culturally alien and as a drain on
the state treasury.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't vote for a New York City mayor to run the state,''
said Clarence Scholes, 62, a state prison guard who was eating a
cheeseburger Tuesday at a restaurant in Albion, where Clinton had
stopped by to shake hands and have breakfast. ``New York City is a
whole lot different than New York state. What might be all right
for New York wouldn't be all right for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Josefson, an assistant professor of political science at
Syracuse University, noted, ``Democrats have historically gotten
killed upstate,'' but added, ``Giuliani is so associated with New
York City that it is really possible to me that that could be
dampened this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that the battleground is shifting was clear even
before Giuliani arrived in Williamsville on Thursday night, in
preparation for a news conference Friday morning in which he will
join a lineup of elected officials celebrating the inauguration of
cut-rate airline service from New York to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after announcing her candidacy in Westchester County on
Sunday, headed straight upstate; she has not spent a day in New
York City or its suburbs since. Giuliani's aides Thursday traveled
from Albany to Syracuse to Buffalo, unveiling ``the mayor's newest
upstate ad,'' as the press announcement put it, this one on
domestic violence, the latest in an unusually early stream of
advertisements that Giuliani's campaign started placing in upstate
markets in October. The tag line on the mayor's advertisements is,
``Rudy Giuliani: For All New York.''
</P>
<P>
   By the count of Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, the
first lady has made 30 trips upstate since last summer. Her first
major policy speech, on Monday in Buffalo, was aimed directly at
the issues that have proved central in upstate contests:
deregulating utilities, lowering in-state airfares and creating
jobs by investing in broadband Internet lines. And Giuliani, after
being pressed by some upstate supporters worried that he was
conducting a long-distance campaign here (with television
advertisements and radio interviews by telephone), plans to
campaign upstate for several days next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fight like the dickens up there to get our
message out,'' said Adam Goodman, Giuliani's media adviser. Over at
the Clinton campaign headquarters, de Blasio said: ``We're going to
be pounding away upstate. No Democrat running for statewide office
has ever done what we are doing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not expected to win in this part of the state, which
accounted for 46 percent of the electorate in 1998, compared with
24 percent in the suburbs and 31 percent in New York City. It
remains decidedly Republican: in a survey of voters leaving the
polls after the 1998 race for Senate, 40 percent identified
themselves as Republicans, compared with the 31 percent who said
they were Democrats. Statewide, Democrats hold a 41 to 32 percent
registration edge over Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And even in losing to Schumer by nearly 10 points in 1998,
D'Amato still captured 50 percent of the upstate vote. In 1992,
when he was re-elected in a contest against Robert Abrams, the
former state attorney general, D'Amato won 53 percent of the vote.
Polls now show Giuliani with about 50 percent of the vote upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's supporters say they doubt that Clinton can cut into
that edge, repeatedly arguing that the simple fact that until a
month ago she had not lived in New York, and what they describe as
her cultural differences with the state, will counteract any
disadvantage Giuliani may have because of his identification with
New York City. ``That would be the case for anybody but Hillary,''
said Rep. John Sweeney. ``Hillary Clinton is going to have a hard
time, frankly, connecting with upstate voters. I believe their
strategy is try to play the gender card and try to connect with
working women.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But a few early signs have given the mayor's supporters pause
and they account for what Giuliani's aides said will be his
stepped-up attention to the region.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Giuliani's investment in television time in an
effort to lock down upstate has not yet appeared to have taken
hold, pollsters say. Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist
College Institute for Public Opinion poll in Poughkeepsie, said he
had detected no gains for Giuliani since he began advertising in
October, and that he was struck by the high number of undecided
voters, 17 percent, which he attributed to uneasiness about
Giuliani's association with New York City. ``Upstate is being
offered, in a sense, dual carpetbaggers,'' Miringoff asserted.
Similarly, Josefson, the political scientist from Syracuse, said,
``The constant worry you hear here is that the state is sending
huge amounts of money to New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Those observations were reflected in conversations throughout
upstate New York this week. ``I don't buy this carpetbagger stuff
at all,'' said Ed Bujanowski, 24, a Republican from Buffalo,
referring to one of Giuliani's criticisms of Clinton. ``Giuliani is
from the state of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Kieran P. Mahoney, the Republican consultant who worked as a
chief strategist for Pataki and D'Amato, said that he routinely
invokes the specter of New York City in running legislative
campaigns upstate. ``I've run campaigns in upstate New York against
guys by simply the other guy voted for `x' for New York City,''
Mahoney said. ``Just flat out.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's position as a Republican candidate may be further
complicated by ideology. The positions that have helped him in New
York City _ his support of abortion rights, gay rights, gun control
and rent regulations _ are problematic upstate, as is his
endorsement of Mario M. Cuomo in 1994 over Gov. George E. Pataki, a
position that continues to rankle some Republican leaders here. The
likelihood that Giuliani will not capture the Conservative Party
endorsement also threatens to underline any upstate ideological
uneasiness with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton so far has also been helped by what one senior adviser
described as the ``celebrity factor'': her visits here tend to be
huge news, particularly in small communities, where voters have
never seen a governor, much less a first lady. Her trip to Buffalo
on Monday took up most of the front page of the Buffalo News, which
presented three photographs of the first lady from an interview she
did with the newspaper's political reporter, Robert J. McCarthy, as
well as two separate articles.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani would not be the first New York City mayor who found it
tough going in New York state: Ed Koch's failed campaign for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1982 foundered famously
north of the Westchester County line. But Goodman, here Thursday
night to join Giuliani in unveiling a new advertisement, argued
that Giuliani's record in New York City would overcome any baggage
that comes with that association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling I have, and I think what we're hearing on the
trail, is if he can do here what he did there, hallelujah,''
Goodman said. ``I think that goes beyond the traditional
upstate-down, big-city-mayor-running precedent.I think he breaks
through that.''

 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Helmut Lang and Anna Sui are hardly two peas in the
same fashion pod. Lang is a minimalist from Vienna, Austria, who
likes reruns of ``The Golden Girls.'' Sui is an extravagant from
Dearborn, Mich., who can remember what Bianca Jagger wore the day
she wed Mick.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each burst the momentum of glamour that has been building up
like a Lawrence Welk soap bubble this week at the New York fall
2000 collections _ Lang by using classic tailoring techniques, like
darts, to force unexpected hints of volume in a starkly modern
silhouette, and Sui by deconstructing ladylike dressing.
</P>
<P>
   In her collection, which she presented Wednesday night against
an enormous backdrop of a Fauvist painting, Sui seemed to transform
herself from a club habitue who always knew what was happening
below 14th Street to a mature designer whose inspirations might be
a Ken Russell film or a rococo palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to cities where I never saw anything but
nightclubs,'' Sui said after her show.
</P>
<P>
   Her clothes still draw heavily on the rock star style made
famous by the late English designer Ossie Clark and its most
swinging practitioners, Marianne Faithfull and Anita Pallenberg.
And perhaps only Sui would happen to show an orange suede coat with
turn-lock metal closures within a few days of the death of one of
her style icons, the American designer Bonnie Cashin, who also used
turn-lock fasteners in her sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   But Sui has moved on. Here were clothes that very clearly
conveyed a dressed-up sensibility: a scallop-pattern wool coat in a
melange of olive, brown, cream and caramel; a drizzle of a chiffon
blouse in an abstract print with a soft tie at the neck; a blue
suede skirt with front lacings worn with a psychedelic-print top;
and a slinky cardigan edged with tiny mohair embroidery, all in
vivid Fauvist acid tones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was this difference: Sui used no linings, no
conventional hems, and all the blouses and jersey tops were simply
machine sewn, zigzag style, so they would look light but still
chic. For instance, for a plaid mini-kilt she used ribbon closures
instead of typical leather straps, and in lieu of a constructed
waistband, she used a thin strip of mohair-embellished ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was a sophisticated look that relied not on obvious
symbols of glamour, like pearls and trailing boas, but on such
simple modern ideals as lightness and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   As Sui said, putting her finger precisely on the trouble with
the current wave of society-page revivalism, ``Anything that was
too constructed looked wrong to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The clue to Lang's show Thursday at Pier 94 off the West Side
Highway was the two-word description in his program notes:
``Continental tailor.'' He then went on to make his point with
all-black ensembles _ skinny tab-front trousers with scoop-neck
jersey tops inset with tulle, and leather or wool overcoats
trailing mysteriously with straps and fluffed with padded collars
that recalled his travel pillows of last season, although they are
now considerably deflated.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a mess. Indeed, some of Lang's attempts to give
his clothes a novel sense of volume _ putting darts, for instance,
in the hems of coats to make them turn slightly under and playing
around with the draping of spare silk dresses _ came off rather
eccentrically.
</P>
<P>
   But he is on to something. He seemed to be saying, through the
way a puffball dress drooped like an oversize sweatshirt or the way
the hanging straps from a coat resembled the offhand shape of a
shirt tied loosely at the waist, that you can use modern gestures
to create a new silhouette in tailored clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to push things forward,'' Lang said. ``I think people
are going to be bored out of their minds if fashion goes back to
the old ways of dressing up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking of which, James Purcell and Randolph Duke certainly did
their bit for uptight chic. Purcell can, in a sense, be forgiven
his excesses, because he can't seem to help himself. He sees a
little black patent leather and some polka dot chiffon and _ voila!
_ he makes a Christmas-ball skirt bouncing with dots and cinched
with a wide shiny waistband of leather.
</P>
<P>
   His show on Wednesday veered all over the place, from slick
sheaths of pinstriped white satin to extravagant ball dresses
blossoming with pink and orange roses. But his helpless affection
for the frivolous is somehow endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, whose show was briefly interrupted by another anti-fur
demonstrator, showed his signature glamour look, including some
simple keyhole dresses in black wool, fur coats and beaded dresses
and pants in herringbone and houndstooth check pattern, and a
slinky spaghetti-strap dress spiked with what looked like ecstatic
porcupine quills.
</P>
<P>
   Much harder to fathom was a shearling bubble coat worn by a
model whose black-leather-gloved arms looked about as animated as a
pair of prostheses.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Natiello, a former assistant at Bill Blass' company, made
his debut Thursday as the new designer of Halston, and it was good
start. Although he occasionally seemed to be of two minds, showing
a simple Halston-like shirt dress in black Ultrasuede with
rhinestone buttons and then a rambunctious ball dress gathered up
in the back and pinned with a silk rose, Natiello will no doubt
settle down. A fisherman-knit sweater, glossed with tiny sparkles
around the neck and shown with a woven leather skirt, was a
promising indication.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Rogers isn't a big name, and her show on Tuesday
afternoon was kind of a haphazard affair in her showroom in the
garment district, with inexperienced models stumbling out of their
shoes and complaining loudly backstage. But if she could make her
name and living on one perfect piece, it would be a little ink-navy
cocktail dress with an illusion neckline, a flutter of ruffles at
the sleeves and a fabric rose exploding softly at the throat.

WASHINGTON: nor a bonus.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The penalty arises out of two basic elements of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   First, the standard deduction taken by couples who do not
itemize their deductions _ generally couples with lower incomes _
is less than twice the standard deduction taken by single filers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, though tax brackets are increased for couples, they are
still less than double those for single people. This means that two
people with the same income are often pushed into a higher tax
bracket once they are married. As a result two individuals who
might each pay a top rate of 15 percent, for example, when they are
single will frequently face a top rate of 28 percent when they
marry.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the House Thursday addressed both elements of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It would gradually increase the standard deduction for couples,
which this year is $7,350, until it is twice the one for single
people, currently $4,400.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also reduce the problem of the tax brackets by
gradually expanding the 15 percent bracket for couples, which
currently ends at $43,850, until it is twice the amount for single
people. The 15 percent bracket for singles currently ends at
$26,250. The brackets are adjusted for inflation each year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also has a provision intended to reduce the marriage
penalty paid by low and moderate income couples who receive the
earned income tax credit, a subsidy for the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   The tax reductions would vary widely depending on a couple's
financial situation. About half of the $182 billion over 10 years
would go to couples paying the penalty, with the rest going to
those who suffer no adverse consequence from the current tax code
or who benefit from it _ mainly couples in which only one partner
works.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they had written their bill that way on
purpose, to provide a tax break to families where a mother stays
home to take care of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We unabashedly also help the stay-at-home moms,'' said Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee.

<P>
   Sales of big, thirsty pickups and sport utility vehicles have
boomed in recent years as the economy hummed and gasoline prices
sagged to record lows.
</P>
<P>
   But this winter, gas prices have surged to all-time highs. Will
gas-pump sticker shock start to affect sales of large SUVs?
</P>
<P>
   Economists who work for Detroit automakers say there is no
reason to think so. They say that truck sales are affected more by
other factors, like low unemployment, rising incomes, high consumer
confidence, stable vehicle prices and record corporate profits that
bring fat profit-sharing checks.
</P>
<P>
   But David Littmann, corporate economist for Comerica bank in
Detroit, predicts that gas prices will bite into auto sales this
year. The increase so far _ to a national average of slightly more
than $1.30 a gallon for unleaded regular _ could cost each consumer
about $300 more a year, economists say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher gas prices, combined with higher interest rates, will
hit consumers' wallets, and that will slow _ not stop _ auto sales
and probably cause a shift in the vehicle mix,'' Littmann said in
an interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He expects buyers to take notice by the second half of this
year. In response, he predicts, automakers will offer sales
incentives on large, high-profit vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Littmann is among many economists who predict an
unprecedented seventh year of vehicle sales topping 15 million. And
he expects trucks to outsell cars for a second consecutive year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so far, higher gas prices have not hurt car sales and
have not brought a shift to smaller vehicles. Indeed, January
vehicle sales ran at a sizzling annual rate of 18 million; sales
for all of 1999 set a record of just under 17 million. Sales of
full-size pickups and sport utilities remain strong while small,
fuel-efficient cars go wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say there is no magic gas price that will suddenly
cause consumers to shift their buying habits. Rather, they say,
behaviors will change only in the face of negative economic news,
sustained high gas prices and shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists predict gas prices to rise further and stay
there for the next year. Van Bussman, corporate economist for
DaimlerChrysler, expects prices to peak this summer at $1.40 a
gallon and gradually come down. But he predicts that vehicle sales
will be only slightly below last year's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, meantime, hope higher prices will benefit
efficient vehicles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not for increased gas prices per se,'' said Charles
Griffith, director of auto projects for the Ecology Center in Ann
Arbor, Mich., which campaigns for cleaner, more fuel-efficient
transportation. ``But higher gas prices might well cause
manufacturers and consumers to reflect on the cost of the
automobile on the environment.'' &QL;

   Ten or 20 years ago, some employers even had policies
prohibiting his or her return. But in these days of worker
shortages, the exit door can look more like a revolving door as
more companies start using the ``Beverly Hillbillies'' refrain:
``You all come back now, hear?''
</P>
<P>
   Based on anecdotal accounts and surveys of clients worldwide,
Management Recruiters International in Cleveland has found that
employers are more willing to hire their former workers. Allen
Salikof, the firm's president and chief executive, advises these
alumni to take care in planning their return. ``It's not as easy as
just walking back in,'' Salikof said.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, they should use common sense. ``If your
departure was acrimonious, it's a lot harder to come back,'' he
noted. ``But if you go with good will and keep in touch in a
professional manner, the door may stay open for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, he said, find a champion at the company, and have a
clear sense of what new skills and experiences you now can offer,
so you can return at a higher level with more pay.

SIBERIAN'S PLIGHT MIRRORS FRAGILE HOPE FOR ALL TIGERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``Tigers in the Snow''; by peter matthiessen; north point press,
$27) 
 
By FRITZ LANHAM 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next time you're feeling Texas proud, ponder these statistics.
Only 4,600 to 7,000 tigers remain in the wild. The real number is
probably toward the low end of that range.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lone Star State is home to some 2,000 tigers _ in
cages. ``Enough,'' Peter Matthiessen acidly remarks, ``for an
impressive herd on the King Ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tigers in the Snow'' is at once a brief primer on the
beleaguered animal and a report on efforts to save it in its
natural habitat. Efforts that may well be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   A rare specimen himself, Matthiessen is both an accomplished
novelist (``Far Tortuga''; ``Killing Mr. Watson'') and a prolific,
much-lauded nature writer.
</P>
<P>
   He won a National Book Award for ``The Snow Leopard,'' his 1978
book about a scientific and spiritual quest to the Himalayan home
of that legendary felid. This new book isn't in the same league.
Brief (174 pages) and somewhat meandering, without the
introspection and dense description of his best work, it's
Matthiessen lite.
</P>
<P>
   Lite, however, hardly describes the fervor the author brings to
the telling. While not strident in tone, ``Tigers in the Snow'' is
clearly written out of a passionate regard for the tiger's fate.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the book is devoted to Matthiessen's visits to
Siberia, to the coastal area north of Vladivostok that is home to
the Siberian tiger and to a joint Russian-American project to study
and protect the surviving population there.
</P>
<P>
   Also known as the Amur tiger, after the Amur River that flows
through the region, Siberians (the tigers in the snow of the book's
title) are the largest of the species; a large male can be 9 to 12
feet long and weigh more than 600 pounds. At present perhaps 450,
including juveniles, remain in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers originated in northeastern Asia, Matthiessen tells us.
They spread westward as far as the Caspian Sea and eastern Turkey,
south into the Indian subcontinent, through China and Southeast
Asia and across the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra, Java and Bali.
(Incidentally, Helen Bannerman got it wrong in ``The Story of
Little Black Sambo''; there are no tigers in Africa.)
</P>
<P>
   Tigers have disappeared in some of these areas within living
memory. The last sighting of a Balinese tiger was 1939. The
population around the Caspian Sea disappeared in the late 1960s;
the late 1970s saw the last Javan tigers.
</P>
<P>
   India is now home to the largest number of these cats, perhaps
half of the world's total. But they are scattered in geographically
separate pockets, many of which are probably too small to sustain a
tiger population in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   In Siberia, on the other hand, tigers' last redoubt is a
600-mile stretch of mountainous, forested land between the Amur
River delta in the north and the North Korean border in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The government-funded Sikhote-Alin Reserve, an area about the
size of Yosemite National Park, was established there in 1936, when
estimates of the Siberian tiger population were as low as 50. In
1990 U.S. scientists joined forces with Russian scientists to
create the Siberian Tiger Project.
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen's visits in 1992 and 1996 are by far the most
interesting parts of the book. He joins in tracking tigers over
snow-covered ground and describes how they are sedated and fitted
with radio collars. He introduces us to the researchers. And most
important, he talks to the locals and explores the economic and
cultural forces arrayed against the Siberian tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers are hunted not only for their gorgeous fur but for body
parts, long used in Asian folk remedies. Booming economies in
Pacific Rim countries in the 1980s and early '90s ratcheted up
demand and prices. Matthiessen says that between 1975 and 1992
South Korea alone imported 8,200 pounds of dried tiger bone from
Indonesia _ the equivalent of 338 to 620 animals.
</P>
<P>
   The male tiger's potency, ``which permits it to mate vigorously
several times each hour through a period of several days,'' made
the poor beast's genitalia prized items among Asian men battling
impotence.
</P>
<P>
   A dried tiger penis _ it resembles, Matthiessen tells us, ``a
coiled eel'' _ commanded up to $2,500 in Singapore or Taiwan, while
hot penis soup went for $300 a bowl. (In Hong Kong, $15 fake tiger
penises snared the unwary.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, most of the blame was laid on the Chinese, who were
willing to pay a middleman up to $10,000 for a single tiger _ more
than an ordinary Russian might make in five years' work,''
Matthiessen writes.
</P>
<P>
   A breakdown of law and order and serious economic hardship for
people in eastern Siberia followed the collapse of the Soviet
Union. That meant not only an upsurge in poaching but heavier
hunting of elk and other large animals that are the tiger's food
supply. Aggressive timber harvesting has also damaged habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The locals are understandably ambivalent about the tigers. For
one thing, the big cats can be a threat. They do on occasion
attack, kill and eat people. Matthiessen describes two fatal
attacks on hunters, one in 1995 and the other two years later; it
makes for chilling reading.
</P>
<P>
   These deadly events occur more frequently in India, with its
greater density of both people and tigers. Something like a million
Asians have been killed by tigers in the past four centuries,
according to the author.
</P>
<P>
   (Tip: If you think a tiger is sizing you up for supper, don't
bend over at the waist; you'll look like the four-legged animals
that are its preferred fare. Actually, if a tiger is sizing you up
for supper, you probably won't know it until it's too late. The cat
will attack from behind and go straight for your neck and throat.)
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen doesn't conclude on a note of despair, but he's hard
pressed to find many rays of hope. Several of the animals captured
and marked with radios by Siberian Tiger Project researchers have
been killed by poachers.
</P>
<P>
   But poachers aren't the biggest threat to the Siberians'
existence, Matthiessen writes. The decline in the number of elk and
deer and other hoofed animals on which the tigers feed is the
biggest threat. Resilient creatures, tigers can survive in a
variety of habitats. But they must have enough to eat, and in the
harsh world of Siberia, the prey species have never been dense.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the appeal of ``Tigers in the Snow'' are superb color
photographs taken by American natural scientist Maurice Hornocker.
Ironically, most were taken not in the wild but in a research
facility where Russian animal researcher Victor Yudin has enclosed
five acres and re-created the vegetation of the tiger's range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a few photographs of wild Siberians are known to exist,''
Hornocker writes in the introduction, ``and most of those are of
dead tigers.''

I AM BIG. IT'S GADGETS THAT GOT SMALL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Electronics manufacturers seemingly have ample
technology _ and ample will _ to create wondrously tiny, portable
gadgets. If only they could engineer smaller human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Consider John Bolin, a burly man with big hands. In another era,
he might have been able to use that gift in such primal pursuits as
killing for food. But today there is trouble when he dials his
cellular phone: his meaty index finger often strikes more than one
number _ when he can see the tiny keypad, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need glasses just to see the numbers,'' he growled. ``This
all is driving me nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   I bumped into Bolin at the Consumer Electronics Show, held
annually here. This season, as usual, gadget makers touted their
strides in making everything smaller. One company introduced a
wristwatch with speech recognition software that announced the time
aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the company plans a version equipped with Internet
access, which may seem innovative and exciting _ until you consider
the size of a watch face. Perhaps the watch might also be able to
tell us when we have lost our minds.
</P>
<P>
   This is the perspective of some critics of the shrinking gadget.
And I have to agree that it might not be very entertaining to surf
the Web on a wristwatch, especially if you're already occupied with
watching television on your tie pin.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the question begged by Bolin, a conventioneer who
sold portable DVD players at the electronics show: Must man himself
be shrunk to accommodate machines? Maybe evolution will favor the
thin-fingered and hawk-eyed who can use the little laptops and puny
digital organizers. Will it be a compliment, someday, to describe
someone at a party as ``spindly?''
</P>
<P>
   I put the issues to Jason Lin, an executive with Voice 2000
Inc., which sells the Mini-Phone _ a rounded, 1-inch-high,
2-inch-wide phone that could slip comfortably inside a small orange
but presents challenges to the beefy-fingered. Along with
competitors' products like the Super Genius Mini Phone and the Go
Chat Mini Phone, it is among the shrinking land-line phones
following in the ever-smaller footsteps of cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Lin didn't see big philosophical or biological issues in the
push to put gadgets on the Scarsdale diet. Instead, he offered an
appropriately succinct analysis. ``Mini is better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his company plans an even smaller version of its phone.
But he did acknowledge that the next incarnation raised a quandary:
What can you call something that is even smaller than the Mini
Phone? ``We have thought about this,'' Lin said, smiling as if
confiding a secret. ``We may call it the Tiny-Mini Phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it will become ever easier to pursue the manifest destiny
of miniaturization, given the growing power of the integrated
circuit _ the technology that permits a single computer chip to
perform multiple functions. Evidence is seen in an electronic
Koran, marketed at the show by the Good Hope Electronic Co &UR; . &LR;  of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   This $98 digital version of the Koran _ only about 3 inches long
_ includes the Islamic text in Arabic and English, numerous
commentaries, plus a function that tells Muslims when to pray and
in which direction to face.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can store addresses and phone numbers,'' said Sammy Chung,
a manager for Good Hope. ``It's an organizer, a calculator and does
currency exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that you never know when you'll need a currency
exchange feature at a mosque to calculate the proper offering. But
too bad the device doesn't come with a thesaurus, for the very
small phones aren't the only products presenting a vocabulary
problem.
</P>
<P>
   At the show, makers of those gargantuan portable stereos called
boom boxes featured a growing array of much smaller portable
players, often billed as offering equally rich and loud sound. Does
this new generation, despite being small enough to fit in the glove
compartment of a sport utility vehicle, still merit the title
``boom box''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it should be the (italics)mini(end italics) boom box,''
said a woman selling portable stereos. ``But I wouldn't go carrying
them around on your shoulder. You'd look pretty ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Or maybe we'll just have to evolve smaller shoulders.

CASH AND TIME, GONE WITH THE WIND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELLEN SARASOHN GLAZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The $2,000 was eating me up. It wasn't the amount that got me;
it was the way I lost it. Tricked. Scammed. Thieved by a carpenter
who ``needed the money for the windows in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend, a psychiatrist, said, ``Think of it as slippage.''
She didn't need to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we all spend money we didn't plan to spend. Not for
fun. Not for frivolity. Slippage is that frustrating kind of
expenditure that results from being half-smart, careless,
indulgent, lazy or easily intimidated. It is money that slips out
of our hands for no reasonable reason.
</P>
<P>
   Consider my recent minor accident, involving a young woman who
stopped short at an intersection. My car hit hers lightly. She got
out of the car and said that there was no damage, that a dent on
the car was there before. Later that day, I received a call from
her father. He said my car had enlarged an existing dent, adding,
``My daughter's neck is starting to hurt.'' Ouch. $250 of pure
slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the phone bill for the Russian exchange student
who was very homesick when she stayed with us. I guess I shouldn't
have been surprised when the $325 bill arrived a few weeks after
she left. By no means minor slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the rear of my refrigerator yielded two shriveled
green peppers; three identical, nearly full jars of pasta sauce
laced with mold; and a package of tofu, which, according to its
label, had just celebrated its first birthday. In the bathroom was
an alphabet of aging vitamins that had surely lost their potency.
Inevitably, housecleaning yields a fascinating array of slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was that huge water bill _ and I don't mean any
of those for the months when I overwater the lawn or when my
daughters spend too much time in the shower. No, I'm referring to
the $1,000 bill that came the month I didn't realize that my attic
toilet was running. Slippage, down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Slippage occurs with time as well as money. In fact, it seems
that the most aggravating time slippages occur when we're trying to
save money. Consider the trip to the supermarket for 89-cent
avocados that costs two hours because you locked your keys in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I found $20 on the street and chalked it up to reverse
slippage. Then I looked down at my own money pouch, unzipped as
usual, and wondered how many times my attempts to avoid time
slippage had cost me money slippage. Had I ever lost a $20 bill as
I stewed in line at the post office or tried to fill up my car at
the gas station and read the newspaper at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   ``Slippage is a good thing,'' my psychiatrist friend said. ``It
reminds us that we're not in control.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose so, but it is difficult to view a $2,000 loss as a
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your slippage account should be about full,'' my friend added,
suggesting that slippage was subject to certain accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a notion I like _ that slippage, though
uncontrollable, may be measurable, perhaps even predictable. So
far, I have three ideas about how to do that accounting: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MONTHLY TALLY If I totaled my slippage each month, I could
compare the total with that of the previous month or of the
comparable month a year earlier _ in much the same way that
companies report quarterly earnings. That would give me some sense
of whether I was doing better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there would be separate columns for money and time
slippage and formulas for balancing money spent to avoid time
slippage. (It never seems to work in reverse.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE ANNUAL REVIEW If I took account just once a year, the
slippages that looked so formidable when they occurred would be
reduced to mere blips. Paying $60 to the burglar-alarm repairman
after I'd unknowingly blocked the sensor with a vase might not hurt
so much with the passing of time. Neither would three hours spent
recovering my car because I hadn't read the tow-away zone sign. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE LIFETIME RECKONING Just the thought of this makes me happy.
I can imagine a system of compensation for those who have paid
excessively in slippage over the years. Perhaps there should be a
posthumous tax credit for the man who waited 20 minutes in the
supermarket checkout line because he didn't notice the small sign
indicating ``trainee at register.'' And one for the woman who
called the garbage-disposal repairman before discovering that her
husband had shut off the emergency switch. &QL;

 &HT;    Marino may void Dolphins contract, sources say
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Dan Marino may have taken his final snap with the
Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who holds virtually every significant NFL career passing
record, plans on telling the Dolphins today that he will void the
final year of his contract, sources say, thus making him a free
agent who can sign with any other team.
</P>
<P>
   While voiding his contract doesn't preclude him from returning
to the Dolphins for an 18th season, a source close to Marino said
he met with Tampa Bay Buccaneers officials on Wednesday and was
encouraged about the prospect of signing a one-year deal with that
club.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 38, thinks he has at least one more good season in him,
which would give the Bucs _ who advanced to the NFC Championship
Game, losing to the St. Louis Rams, 11-6 _ more time to bring along
rookie quarterback Shaun King.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins weren't saying much about Marino's future late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just talked to (Dolphins president) Eddie Jones, and he told
me we have not heard anything official from Dan,'' Dolphins
spokesman Harvey Greene said. ``I'm not saying that he won't (void
the deal), just that we haven't hear from Dan and until we do this
is all premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's possible departure, while ending an era that began when
the cocky kid from Pittsburgh was the Dolphins' first-round pick in
1983, would save the Dolphins almost $6 million in salary-cap money
and also spare the franchise the embarrassment of having to cut the
future Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt made it clear earlier Wednesday
while meeting with reporters that Marino has the call on whether
he'll return.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be Dan's decision,'' Wannstedt said. ``Dan is
weighing his options, as he has been. I'm not going to get into
specifics of speaking for Dan or the things that are involved at
his contract at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt clearly does not want to be remembered as the coach
who booted Marino out of the NFL, so he's showing the future Hall
of Famer the respect of being able to make his own call.
</P>
<P>
   There are two other recent developments that might lead Marino
toward Tampa Bay. The Dolphins last week hired ex-Dallas coach Chan
Gailey as their offensive coordinator, and not only will Gailey
change the offense, but he often sparred with Cowboys quarterback
Troy Aikman _ another Hall of Famer late in his career _ while in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it seemed odd last week when the Bucs fired offensive
coordinator Mike Shula after he had accompanied the coaching staff
to Hawaii to coach in the Pro Bowl. Ironically, Shula, whose
father, Don, made the decision to draft Marino, was hired this week
as the Dolphins' quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   If Marino leaves, the Dolphins would be looking at either Damon
Huard or Jim Druckenmiller as their starter, unless they sign a
free agent, draft a quarterback or make a trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For several weeks, the Treasury bond market has been
whipsawed by uncertainty associated with the government's plan to
buy back some publicly held long-term debt with the budget surplus.
There have been sharp daily moves, then reversals a day later. And
traders say that they have often been on the wrong side of the
action, causing painful losses for some.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Wall Street dealers and traders indicated that they
had had enough. They shunned the Treasury's auction of $10 billion
in new 30-year bonds, leaving the government with the least demand
ever at such a sale. ``People didn't want the risk of participating
because they didn't know where it would come out,'' said Louis
Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Those results, and growing frustration over the signals from the
Treasury _ even though some have been misinterpreted _ sent
Treasury prices tumbling while yields, which move in the opposite
direction, shot higher.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the yield on the 30-year bond, which is usually
higher than that on short-term securities to entice investors, has
fallen below that of the two-year note. Then Thursday the spread
between the yield on the two-year note and the 30-year bond
narrowed sharply, giving the bond market another sudden jolt.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the new 30-year bond, which was auctioned at 6.34
percent, finished at 6.32 percent, well up from the 6.17 percent
Wednesday in the so-called when-issued market. The yield on the old
30-year bond jumped to 6.43 percent from 6.31 percent, while the
price fell 1 12/32 to 96 1/32.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the two-year note rose to 6.65 percent from 6.63
percent Wednesday. On Tuesday, the yield on the two-year note was
6.67 percent, while the yield on the new 30-year bond was 6.10
percent, a spread of just over half a percentage point. That spread
has now narrowed to a third of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   These swift and costly swings are the result of the distortions
that have occurred in the market since the Treasury confirmed on
Jan. 13 that it would be buying back longer-term debt. The yield on
the 10-year note has also been distorted as Wall Street firms
indicated that it would replace the 30-year bond as the market
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   The distortions were exacerbated last Wednesday, when a few more
details about the buybacks were announced along with the news that
the amount of the the new 30-year bond offering, being sold
Thursday and in May, would be much smaller than expected. The
prospect of limited supply led to panic buying last Thursday. As
the price rose, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.13 percent,
from 6.28 percent Wednesday and then jumped back up to 6.26 percent
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say these swings produced big losses but no one is
owning up to them so far.
</P>
<P>
   Before a Treasury auction, dealers on Wall Street usually go
short on the issue to be sold _ that is, in this case, they sell
30-year bonds they own to make room for the ones they expect to buy
when they bid in the auction. This assures that they do not wind up
with more than they want.
</P>
<P>
   But because so many dealers wanted nothing to do with the new
30-year bond, they did not go short ahead of the auction, traders
said. They then made very weak bids in the auction, leaving the
bonds to insurance companies and pension funds that need them for
investing and money management purposes.
</P>
<P>
   This meant that the new bond's yield soared. Just before the
bidding closed, the yield in the when-issued market was 6.24
percent and the yield of the auction was 6.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't feel confident going short,'' said Charles
Parkhurst, managing director for government bond trading at Salomon
Smith Barney, explaining that dealers just did not want to risk
being short 30-year bonds if the price suddenly took off again and
did not want the new bond either.
</P>
<P>
   N. Graham Allen, managing director for global fixed income at
Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles, said he was not interested
in the new 30-year bond because the trading distortions had sent
the yield down too low and ``we couldn't see what was going to
maintain that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion Thursday were comments made on Wednesday
by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. Many investors took his
remarks as a signal that the Treasury would also buy back
shorter-term securities, leaving many investors to conclude that
the 30-year bond was not so special after all. Although the
Treasury indicated this interpretation was wrong and that the
buybacks would be of long-term securities, investors sold the
30-year bond Wednesday, pushing the yield higher.
</P>
<P>
   But the flight from the 30-year bond may not be so bad. Crandall
said the two-day selloff was unwinding some of the distortions that
had racked the bond market.  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As major Web sites came under day-by-day attack by
computer pranksters this week, so have Bryant Park's fashion shows
been disrupted by rolling anti-fur protests.
</P>
<P>
   A third catwalk was singled out Thursday morning by a protester
who aimed red paint from a juice bottle at a fur-wearing model in
the Randolph Duke show. He succeeded mainly in splashing
journalists and a stylist in the front row, staining their pricey
handbags and a lime green cashmere sweater.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most disruptive incident so far, following an attack
by tofu cream pie at the Michael Kors show Wednesday, and the
unfurling of banners reading ``Fur Shame'' at the Oscar de la Renta
show Tuesday. In all cases, the protesters were whisked away by
security men and arrested by the police, and the shows proceeded
with narry a broken heel.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbances were widely discussed by editors and store
buyers, though mostly in the blase tone of fashion people who have
already seen the same thing come around more than twice.
</P>
<P>
   Anya Sehulte, a stylist in the audience at the Tse New York
show, said she had brief second thoughts about wearing a rabbit
jacket _ ``You feel a little weird,'' she said _ but decided to go
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Elsa Klench, however, the host of ``Style With Elsa Klench'' on
CNN, was more shaken. ``It is like a terrorist attack,'' she said
at the Helmut Lang show, cradling a black Chanel bag stained red
from the attack at the Duke show two hours earlier. ``But the
government we live under is a democracy, and these things can
happen. Women got the vote because suffragettes chained themselves
to doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests were organized by People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals, said RaeLeann Smith, the group's anti-fur director. She
would not say whether there would be more disruptions during the
final shows Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fern Mallis, the executive director of Seventh on Sixth, which
organizes Fashion Week, said that security had been tightened after
the first incident, but that protesters were still able to get into
shows using invitations given to them by friends, or obtained from
fashion houses and their publicists by posing as journalists or
retailers. The paint-splasher at the Duke show, identified by the
police as Bruce Friedrich, apparently used a photographer's press
badge, Mallis said.
</P>
<P>
   Further tightening of security, such as checking handbags, would
intolerably slow the shows, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-fur protests come at a time when fur is enjoying a
renewed popularity with designers, and sales are up. Asked whether
the high-profile protests would dampen consumer interest, Kal
Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's, said,
``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judy Collinson, the general merchandising manager of Barneys
New York, was less sure. ``We have to be sensitive to the issue,
and we will be sensitive,'' she said. ``It will to a certain extent
guide our decision making.''

more than one person or group.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Expressing concern about the economic damage,
including stock market sell-offs, caused by the attacks on leading
Web sites this week, the Justice Department said Thursday that
tougher criminal penalties might be necessary to prevent malicious
disruption of internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider this a prank,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder said Thursday at a news conference. ``These are very serious
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Thursday that as part of the
investigation, it had begun a check on some 7,600 military computer
systems to determine if any had been used as relay points by the
internet attackers. At the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a
spokesman said that four field offices had opened formal
investigations: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not cyberterrorism, this is cybercriminality,'' said
an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. And
it has frightening implications, he said. If they can shut down
Ebay or Yahoo, the next target may well be the National Security
Agency or satellites, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, attacks have blocked access to several major
Internet sites, sometimes for several hours. They have included
Yahoo; Buy.com, a retail site whose stock began trading this week;
ETrade, one of the largest online brokerage firms, and eBay.com,
the online auction site.
</P>
<P>
   As the attacks appeared to taper off, law enforcement agencies
and computer security experts said evidence now suggested that the
four days of digital assaults had been the work of more than one
person or group. They said many Web sites remained vulnerable
because of inadequate security precautions.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been holding meetings for the past two years
with computer industry leaders to discuss security, and another
meeting is set for next week, David Leavy, a White House spokesman,
said Thursday. He declined to say who would attend, but said that
the purpose would be for the government and private industry to
cooperate in enhancing computer security.
</P>
<P>
   While the government recognizes an obligation to prosecute
criminal activity on the internet, there are knottier questions
about the obligation to protect a private internet company from
vandalism and just how much protection is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are moving into relatively new ground: no crime
scene, no rubble to comb through, no DNA. At the same time, experts
say, in the end some of the traditional police techniques, from
developing informants to picking up tips on the street, may be what
eventually cracks the case.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been expanding its computer
crime-fighting capabilities in recent years and has established
computer crime squads in FBI offices around the country, and
trained prosecutors in U.S. attorneys' offices. At the FBI, a
National Infrastructure Protection Center was established to help
coordinate such investigations, and Holder said the president is
seeking an additional $37 million next year to further expand these
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He said the extra money would help set up regional computer
forensic labs that would respond more quickly to problems. ``Time
is important in these matters,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that the first obligation for protecting against
hackers is on the company. ``The company has to hire their own
guards,'' said William Arkin, an expert on the national security
dimensions of the internet. He used the analogy of a house
burglary: Law-enforcement agencies have an obligation to search for
and prosecute the criminal. But the government does not have an
obligation to install an alarm system in your home, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The police do, of course, have patrols that are intended to
provide protection in the neighborhood. ``There are no patrol cars
on the internet,'' Arkin noted.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton pointed to cyberspace's perils as
well as its benefits. ``We live in an age when one person sitting
at one computer, can come up with an idea, travel through
cyberspace and take humanity to new heights,'' he said. ``Yet,
someone can sit at the same computer, hack into a computer system
and potentially paralyze a company, a city or a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever resources the government puts into its investigative
efforts, it will be impossible to protect against all invasions,
said John Thomas, commander of the Pentagon's Global Operations
Security Center for four years until his retirement last summer. He
is now with AverStar, an information technology company with its
headquarters in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Given that there is no absolute defense against computer crime,
a company, like the government, has to ask what information must be
protected and how much it is willing to pay. ``You would spend a
corporate treasury, or national treasury, trying to protect
everything,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said it was possible to become alarmist about the risks
from computer crime. But he added, it is not possible to know who
the attackers are, and who might be behind them. ``Who is to say it
is not been mentored by organized crime, corporate espionage,
foreign governments, or terrorists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Internet's anonymity, there are fingerprints, in a
sense, because every computer connecting to the internet has a
unique address. But it is possible to bury this address under
layers of data, just as a money launderer hides his activities
through layers of shell corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this case will be solved, if it is, ``in physical
space, not cyberspace,'' said Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will have to go onto the streets, as they do
routinely, looking for informants or someone the hackers bragged
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hackers will do a lot to cover their tracks in cyberspace,''
he said. ``Where they're vulnerable is physical space.''

 Alecia Swasy, author of ``Changing Focus: Kodak and the Battle to
Save a Great American Company,'' is assistant managing editor for
business at The St. Petersburg Times.  
 By ALECIA SWASY

<TEXT>
<P>
   You know it's time to go home when you turn giddy over a new
issue of Delta Air Lines' in-flight magazine. You find yourself
muttering about seat-back trays in the upright and locked position
and eating 12 peanuts for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   You are on yet another airplane full of sleepwalking
globetrotters like yourself _ here a rumpled gray suit and IBM
luggage tags, there multiply pierced body parts and a marked-up
draft prospectus for a dot-com IPO, and seemingly everywhere
management consultants from Andersen or McKinsey.
</P>
<P>
   But that fellow with the notebook and the British accent is up
to something perhaps a bit more profound: trying to locate ``home''
in a rootless age. He is Pico Iyer, who chronicles his search in
``The Global Soul: Jet Lag, Shopping Malls and the Search for
Home'' (Knopf, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Iyer circles the planet as a writer for Time magazine, making
occasional pit stops at his family's home in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
and his own near Kyoto, Japan, and frequent visits to modern
crossroads of civilization like Los Angeles International Airport
and Atlanta's Olympic village.
</P>
<P>
   But first, he endures a few natural disasters, starting with a
raging fire that consumed his parents' house; he escaped with a
coughing cat and a manuscript. Then came earthquakes and mudslides.
By Page 7, you want to summon the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Losing one's shelter must be jarring, but getting rid of all
that stuff could be liberating _ less to dust, for one thing. The
loss left Iyer searching for something beyond a building and
furniture, perhaps something invisible, to anchor him.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him on this trip can be discombobulating. He often
starts his day in one continent, then dozes off in another, at a
pace he likens to a childhood game of spinning around until he
collapsed in a ``dizzy heap on the floor.'' He concludes that
modern lives are just ``joy-riding in somebody else's Porsche, at
90 miles an hour, around blind curves.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, some of us are tooling through a school zone in a Honda.
Everyone knows the experience of waking up on Monday, blinking and
finding that it's already Friday. I myself misplaced all of last
May through July. But that is a different kind of busy than Iyer's.
My own former days as a frequent flier led me to the epiphany about
the in-flight magazine and an urgent desire to get a life.
</P>
<P>
   Not Iyer, who clearly enjoys a lifestyle that has racked up 1.5
million frequent-flier miles and a stamp-filled passport. Born to
Indian parents and brought up in England and California, he writes
that the very notion of home is foreign to him.
</P>
<P>
   The book captures people in the layovers of life, beginning at
LAX, a hub for the Global Soul, full of people from somewhere else.
It may have a $10 million post office and a 23,000-space parking
lot, he writes, but the airport is a ``centerless mess with no real
defining principle or heart.'' He describes a bit too much of that
mess when he visits an adults-only establishment near the airport
Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Toronto better, finding New York's intelligence without
its neuroses. But pity Atlanta, he writes, because the South rising
again has turned the place into a ``center of emptiness,'' a city
of freeways leading to off-ramps leading to generic suburbs. Here,
too, he manages to find the lap-dancing joint, this time one with a
``corporate atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to Atlanta offers the opportunity for a few jabs at a
corporate sibling of his employer, Time Warner. At the CNN Center,
he writes, a bumpkin tour guide who clearly isn't aware that CNN is
a Global Soul embarrasses a visitor from Iraq with rude questions.
</P>
<P>
   Iyer finds the same lack of global brotherhood in the confused
aftermath of the Centennial Park bombing during the 1996 Olympics,
when a white man yells at a visitor from the Middle East: ``You see
what happens when we let you people in?''
</P>
<P>
   What Iyer discerns in this is not so much provincialism and
bigotry as a strong case for slowing life down a bit and
understanding the people around us. When there are people around us
at all, that is: everyone is busy sending e-mail, but a smiley
emoticon can hardly replace a good laugh in a friend's company.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, a friend of mine wrote recently that dinner
tables ought to get more use than just Thanksgiving Day. (And while
we're at it, let's agree to be sillier among strangers in
elevators.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of Iyer's best moments come in talking to strangers. At the
Olympic village in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992, he finds an archery
team from Bhutan that had never seen a stadium before. His writing
is most graceful in simple description, as when the temple bells
ring on the Philosopher's Path in Kyoto. His pace slows in the
final pages _ at last! _ and a reader can almost hear the clumps of
snow falling from the dark trees.
</P>
<P>
   Iyer does find a place to call home when his personal life draws
him to rural Japan. But even there he is treated as a gaijin, an
alien. He endures customs checks that would send most of us
screaming for the American Embassy; he describes being
strip-searched after agents found a Sudafed tablet in his bags.
</P>
<P>
   For all the relative serenity of the final pages, though, a
reader cannot count on Iyer's staying home, wherever that is, for
long. In the book's acknowledgments, he thanks his travel agent.

 By JANE WOLFE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's halftime at the Nokia Sugar Bowl. The crowd quiets down as
a randomly chosen fan, Robert Moderhak, 54, a retired school
administrator, walks onto the field to try winning $500,000 by
throwing a football through a 2-foot-square target 15 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   A chant begins in the stadium. ``Go! Go!'' Amid all the noise,
you'd think that executives of Nokia, the sponsor, would be falling
silent, fearing the prospect of having to write a
half-million-dollar check. Instead, they are cheering the loudest.
</P>
<P>
   The only people not rooting for Moderhak are from SCA Promotions
of Dallas, which, for a $50,000 fee from Nokia, took the risk that
the fan could not beat the odds.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, SCA bet wrong and, after Moderhak's pass sailed
through the target, paid up. But when Robert D. Hamman, SCA's
founder and chief executive, heard the news, he barely winced. Even
the best oddsmakers miss some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Hamman does not miss often. SCA, which stands for Sports Contest
Association, has paid out $65 million in prizes since its founding
in 1986. But that amount is less than 1 percent of the $10 billion
it has underwritten. Revenues vary widely from year to year, but
are, on average, slightly more than twice the payouts, Hamman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a viable business, we need winners,'' Hamman
explained. ``But what we really root for are close misses, because
the customer thinks it was almost going to happen, and yet we
didn't have to reach for our checkbook.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement over TV game shows like ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' he said, has made more companies want to offer
bigger promotional contests without increasing their financial
risk. That is part of the reason that he expects SCA's revenues to
grow by one-third this year _ to $37 million. The company is
privately held; Hamman owns slightly more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His Dallas office is teeming with fresh-faced account executives
who call him ``Bob'' and have the air of the contestants in the
contests he underwrites _ after they win. ``The cornerstone of our
business is that our clients pay us a fixed fee, regardless of the
outcome of the contest,'' he said. ``Even those who can afford to
pay the cost of the prize they're offering do not want to have to
worry about whether it's a smart thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing odds is something Hamman has done well since at least
the age of 18. That is when he began playing bridge. Now, at 61, he
is a 10-time world champion bridge player, and is currently the
top-ranked player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Warren E. Buffett, who has played with him in regional bridge
tournaments, has become an admirer. ``He can watch a basketball
game and eat a sandwich at the same time he's playing and still
know precisely what he's doing,'' Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   With his loud, striped, open-neck shirts and disarming laugh,
Hamman looks and acts less the bridge-playing mathematician than a
Las Vegas high-roller. Many other executives cultivate gray
blandness, but, as Buffett said, ``he comes in Technicolor.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Pasadena, Calif., Hamman recounts in his autobiography
and bridge guide, ``At the Table,'' (DBM Publications), how, at the
age of 5, he won money playing in his father's poker games. His
education in figuring odds came from extensive math courses at
Occidental College, UCLA and California State University at
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   He was so busy playing cards, he says, that he never earned a
degree. In 1969, he moved to Dallas to join a bridge team competing
for the world title, which it won the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, at the age of 47 and with his own insurance brokerage
firm, he was asked to underwrite a hole-in-one golf contest. After
years of responding to acts of God or nature, he said, he liked the
challenge of analyzing a created risk and decided to start a
business.
</P>
<P>
   This year, SCA will underwrite 5,000 promotions, including radio
and TV contests, scratch-and-win games and lottery and casino
jackpots.
</P>
<P>
   Hamman prefers contests with pure mathematical odds, like many
casino games, but he will take a chance on almost anything. For
years, he covered a $50,000 prize to be given to any member of the
World Pumpkin Growing Federation who grew a 1,000-pound pumpkin. He
paid in 1996, when a grower produced a winner the size of a
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   He can tell the odds of a basketball fan's sinking a shot from
half-court: 1 in 25. And the odds of a golf hole-in-one: 1 in
6,500, on a 175-yard hole. When SCA agreed to underwrite a Memphis
radio station's $1 million ``Find Elvis Alive'' contest _ requiring
the winner to produce the King's current dental records _ Hamman
put the odds at less than 1 percent. The fee was $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often a sponsor will say to me: `This will never happen. The
fee should be really cheap,''' Hammon recounted. ``And I'll say:
`In that case why are we discussing it? Tell me how it came out.'''
SCA's fees range from 2 percent to 20 percent of the prize value,
depending on the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Hamman rarely has a sleepless night. That, however, was not
always the case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, SCA, for a $25,000 fee, underwrote a contract for
American Express and Best Western Hotels to pay $250,000 to Little
League Baseball if Nolan Ryan of the Texas Rangers pitched a
no-hitter that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan was 42 at the time,'' Hamman recalled. ``There had never
been a pitcher in the history of baseball at age 42 to pitch a
no-hitter. The previous season he'd been pitching in the
Astrodome,'' for the Houston Astros, ``and now he'd be pitching
outside in the Dallas heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he was no threat whatsoever, so anything we got
paid was a gift. Soon after, I'm listening to the game and Ryan is
dominating it, and I'm thinking, `God, this is a lot scarier than I
thought.' Several times that season, he reached the eighth and
ninth innings with no-hitters. The real problem was that it was a
nationally visible promotion that our underwriters signed off on,
and they're opening up the newspaper each morning seeing what an
idiot Bob is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan did not pitch a no-hitter that year, but he did the next
two years. ``We weren't involved in those,'' Hamman said with a
smile.

   House Passes Bill to Cut Taxes for Married Couples
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a Republican-sponsored bill that would cut
taxes for married couples by $182 billion over the next decade,
brushing aside the Clinton administration's position that any such
tax cut should be far smaller and be enacted only after more
pressing issues are resolved. While they stopped just short of an
outright veto threat, administration officials made clear that
Clinton would not sign a bill like the one passed by the House.

   Dell Meets Revised Profit Estimates

<P>
   Dell Computer reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income that
matched the lowered expectations of investors. Shares of Dell had
increased in regular trading by $3.23, to $38.80, in anticipation
of the numbers, but fell in after-hours trading to $37.88. The
results were far short of what Wall Street had been anticipating
before the company disclosed on Jan. 26 that earnings would be hurt
by a component shortage and by what the company said was the
failure of corporate customers to increase purchases after worries
about the Year 2000 rollover had subsided.

INDICTMENT OF LEWIS AND 2 OTHERS WILL BE SOUGHT

   ATLANTA _ Prosecutors plan to ask an Atlanta grand jury to
indict the Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis and two
other men on Friday in the murders of two young men outside a
nightclub on the night of the Super Bowl, the authorities said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and two men described as old acquaintances fled
``literally dripping with blood'' after stabbing the two men in a
street brawl, Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, has been held without bond for 10 days since the
police named him as the chief suspect in the case. A stretch
limousine hired by Lewis was reported to have raced away from the
fight scene and was found hours later less than two miles away at a
hotel where Lewis was staying.
</P>
<P>
   The two other suspects were identified by the police as Reginald
Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, and Joseph Sweeting, 34, of Miami. They
have not been arrested and are being sought by local and federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Both Oakley and Sweeting have extensive criminal records, and
Oakley is considered ``armed and dangerous,'' Deputy Chief Carter
B. Jackson of the Atlanta police said at a late afternoon news
conference at which the decision to indict all three suspects was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The limousine driver, who has not been identified by the police,
is the principal witness to the crime, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Lewis and the two other suspects bought a
pair of knives at an Atlanta sporting goods store on Jan. 29, the
day before the Super Bowl. A knife found at the scene of the
stabbings in the prosperous Buckhead section on the north side of
Atlanta is believed to be one of the murder weapons, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Lewis had been uncooperative when they
questioned him at his lawyer's home on Jan. 31, the day after the
Super Bowl, and misled investigators when he was asked about his
role in the brawl and who had accompanied him in the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that Lewis was an active participant in the brawl
outside the Cobalt Club and that several people including Lewis
``punched and kicked'' the victims before they were stabbed,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Lewis, a 6-foot-1-inch, 245-pound former
University of Miami all-American, have called him a ``horrified
bystander'' who had attempted to break up a scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lawyers have said he was acting as a peacemaker during
the fight that led to the deaths of Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth
Baker, 21, both of Decatur in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garland, one of the lawyers representing Lewis, said at a
news conference Thursday that a witness had seen Lewis holding
people back in an attempt to break up a fight between his friends
and the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is not responsible for acts that he didn't know were
taking place while he was trying to break up a fight,'' Garland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis knew neither the criminal history nor the real names of
Sweeting and Oakley, Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been hangers-on with Ray, groupies, for years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a case against a celebrity and they're going to
try to make it stick no matter what the facts are,'' Garland said.
``We're going to bring them the facts, and those facts will
exonerate Ray Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the news conference of the police and prosecutor, which
was also attended by Campbell, a very different picture of Lewis
was presented. Jackson said Lewis had refused to answer basic
questions about the fight that led to the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Lewis has not cooperated at all, other than to provide
misleading statements and outright lies,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said, ``The perpetrators were literally dripping with
blood, and yet not a single occupant, not a single passenger has
contacted the police to provide any information about what
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Paul Howard, the Fulton County district attorney,
said witnesses had seen Lewis fighting with one of the victims just
before he was stabbed. Lewis can be charged with murder if he was
involved in the fight, even if someone else stabbed the men.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has refused speak to investigators since his first
interview before his arrest. In that interview he misled
investigators, including saying that the former University of
Maryland football player A.J. Johnson was one of the men with him
the night of the killings, Jackson said. Johnson was not in Atlanta
during Super Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   Garland said Lewis was confused about the names of some of the
men in the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did know one of the men by the name A.J., and under the
pressure he was under of that moment, he got the last name wrong,''
Garland said. ``He was being grilled and being treated in a very
hostile fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses who could clear Lewis are afraid to come forward
until Oakley and Sweeting are arrested, Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is a three-time Pro Bowl player who led the NFL in tackles
last season. He could face life in prison or the death penalty if
convicted.

LEBANON FIGHTING EBBS IN CLAIMS OF VICTORY

   JERUSALEM _ A flare-up of fighting in Lebanon subsided Thursday
as people in northern Israel emerged from bomb shelters and the
United States called a meeting of a monitoring group to curb the
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Both Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
declared victory in the latest round of violence, an indication
that it may be coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli warplanes struck once more at Hezbollah targets north of
the Israeli-controlled zone in southern Lebanon. The strikes, which
wounded two guerrillas, were similar in scope to routine air raids
that accompany the daily war of attrition in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aims of the operation in the realm of deterrence have been
achieved,'' said the Israeli army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul
Mofaz, summing up the airstrikes that began Tuesday with attacks on
three power stations across Lebanon. ``Israel's strategic
deterrence has been strengthened.''
</P>
<P>
   Mofaz noted that Israel had changed its pattern of response, by
reacting this time to military casualties as it previously had to
rocket attacks on civilians in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that the Israel Defense Forces have
attacked infrastructure in Lebanon in response to army
casualties,'' Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
   The airstrikes were ordered after five Israeli soldiers were
killed in southern Lebanon in less than two weeks. A sixth was
killed on Tuesday, after the bombardments began.
</P>
<P>
   Understandings on the rules of engagement reached in April 1996
barred attacks on or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein Haj Hassan, a senior Hezbollah official, rejected what
he called an Israeli attempt to impose new ground rules on the
conflict. ``The equation the enemy is trying to impose,
infrastructure and civilians in exchange for Israeli soldiers, is
unacceptable,'' he said. ``The only acceptable equation is the
April understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel asserted Thursday
night that such strikes remained ``part of the army's array of
options'' in response to military losses.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said
the United States had arranged a meeting on Friday of a group that
monitors the April 1996 understandings. The group, including
military representatives of Israel, Lebanon, Syria, France and the
United States, is expected to meet at the headquarters of the U.N.
force at Naqoura in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The meeting is ``an important development in trying to defuse
the current crisis,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   People in northern Israel emerged from bomb shelters after three
days of tense expectation of possible rocket attacks by Hezbollah.
Police officers and soldiers drove through the streets after
sunrise, announcing through loudspeakers that life was going ``back
to normal.'' Thousands of people who had left the Israeli town of
Qiryat Shemona began returning to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear why Hezbollah broke with its practice of
firing Katyusha rockets at Israel in response to the strikes. Some
Israeli analysts speculated that Syria, which is the dominant force
in Lebanon, had responded to diplomatic pressure and reined in the
guerrillas. Foreign Minister David Levy of Israel warned on
Wednesday that ``the soil of Lebanon will burn'' if rockets were
fired.

ENGINEERING STRIKE COULD AFFECT MORE THAN JUST BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. isn't the only institution that will be
pinched by a prolonged engineering strike at the company.
Restaurants, department stores and car dealerships could all suffer
if workers miss more than a few paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   When the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace struck on Wednesday it temporarily stripped 17,000 jobs
from the Puget Sound economy. Those workers will probably a buying
a wide range of consumer goods, from clothing and restaurant meals
to televison sets and cars, according to local economists.
</P>
<P>
   So, the strike threatens to take a bite out of department and
appliance store sales and restaurant receipts, especially if the
two sides can't settle their differences quickly. Neither Boeing or
the union provided any sign of a breakthrough Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only things they are going to do is buy groceries, gas and
make mortgage payments'' during the strike, said Roberta Pauer, a
Seattle-based economist for the Employment Security Department.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that union members can't tap into a deep strike
fund to help make ends meet during the labor dispute. Instead, they
will rely on a patchwork of personal savings, loans and new jobs to
pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   The union also begun soliciting donations for a Striker Relief
Fund, dedicated to ``extremely needy'' union members, on its
website.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the strike drags on the deeper it will cut into
retail sales and other spending throughout the region, according to
economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two months becomes more meaningful in terms of the economic
impact because you are beginning to have a more measureable effect
on businesses'' and spending trends, said Doug Pedersen, a regional
economist at Pedersen &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's unclear how long the dispute will last. The
engineering union has only struck once before, and then only for a
day. In addition, only 63 percent of the roughly 22,000 Boeing
workers covered by the contract actually belong to the union.
</P>
<P>
   The broad economic impact of the strike is also muted by the
fact that striking engineers and technicians only constitute 1.1
percent of the workforce in Puget Sound, and only 1.4 percent of
the region's salary dollars, according to Pauer. So, the loss of
their discretionary spending doesn't pose a major threat to the
economy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While firms outside Boeing could suffer, the union claimed the
aerospace giant was already feeling the effects of the longest
strike in the history of the technical union.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Qantas Airways jet was stuck at a Bangkok airport
after union engineers dropped their tools and flew home to honor
the strike, according to the union.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Boeing crewswere continuing to work on the
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The union also claimed the strike halted some deliveries of
parts at Boeing's Renton plant and suspended a paint job on a
Singapore Airlines airplane. In addition, some trains were unable
to enter facilities in Tacoma, the union claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials couldn't confirm those disruptions. However,
the manufacturer is striving to maintain operations ``to the
highest degree possible,'' said Peter Conte, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to assess any potential impact,'' Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   Conte added he was unaware of any delays in airplane deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The labor battle also stretched across the country to Boeing
offices in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Seventeen of the 35 Florida-based
union members erected a strike banner yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is also drawing Democratic presidential candidate Bill
Bradley, who had already planned a Seattle appearance. Bradley is
scheduled to march with striking workers Friday, according to Bill
Dugovich, a spokesman for the union.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, however, was unmoved by the fight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's stock rose 75 cents a share to close at $39.75
Thursday. The stock rose on a day when the broad Dow Jones
Industrial Average, of which Boeing is a component, fell 55.53 to
close at 10643.63.
</P>
<P>
   As union members manned picket lines throughout the region
Thursday, they pledged to stay off the job as long as necessary to
win a better contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are committed to lasting as long as it takes ... to
get the respect that they need from this company,'' said Paul
Almeida, president of the International Federation of Professional
and Technical Engineers, the international affiliate of SPEEA.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began after talks collapsed earlier this week. The
union wants higher pay and for Boeing to guarantee a greater
portion of future wage increases. The company and the union are
also clashing over Boeing's proposed changes to existing health
care and life insurance benefits.

DESPITE KNOWN DANGERS, ASBESTOS USE, SALE STILL LEGAL IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER and CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everyone believes that the mining, production, sale and
use of asbestos in America has been banned.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors linked asbestos to deadly disease 100 years ago. Since
then, tens of thousands of U.S. shipyard workers, construction
workers, miners and others have died slowly and painfully from
asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, three U.S. government worker-safety
agencies and the World Health Organization declared asbestos a
killer.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve countries have outlawed the lethal, cancer-causing fiber
and more nations are wading through diplomatic quagmires to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   But it still remains legal to mine, import and sell asbestos in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this are well-documented:
</P>
<P>
   _The administration of President Bush refused to defend a ban
instituted by its own environmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   _The asbestos industry has been relentless _ and successful _ in
efforts to cajole Congress into blocking controls on its deadly
product.
</P>
<P>
   _And the Canadian government, with pit-bull intensity, has
fought all efforts to ban or control the use of asbestos. Canada,
the world's second-largest exporter of asbestos, has sued the
Environmental Protection Agency, challenged its European allies and
financed questionable science to try to prove that asbestos,
especially Canadian asbestos, really isn't dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that lives are still at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Lemen, former assistant surgeon general and deputy
director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health, was an observer and participant in many of the early
battles to regulate asbestos until he left the government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The efforts of every government agency _ OSHA, NIOSH and EPA _
to limit exposure to asbestos were made more difficult when the
Reagan administration came into the picture,'' says Lemen, who is
now a professor at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 12 years we had a Republican administration which was not
ready to act upon ridding the country of that hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan and J. Peter Grace, then chairman of the W.R.
Grace Co., a leader in the asbestos industry, had a close
association. In February 1982, Reagan named Grace to head a
private-sector survey on how to control government costs, known as
the Grace Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the White House opposition, the EPA was not shy in its
early attempts to ban asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, soon after the creation of the agency, its
health and toxicology specialists began urging their bosses to do
something about the abundance of asbestos-laced products.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologists and other medical sleuths had tallied the body
count at thousands of workers and their family members. With the
support of then-President Carter, they had documented the risk to
the public from exposure to consumer products containing the deadly
fibers and extrapolated the number of funerals that would continue
to occur if asbestos wasn't banned.
</P>
<P>
   The asbestos industry did not sit silently by as the EPA worked
to control the product it was mining, producing and selling. The
industry's lobbyists doled out enormous campaign contributions to
influential members of Congress to thwart or at least water down
the agency's effort to ban the money-making fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the EPA experts soldiered on through the political and
scientific minefield.
</P>
<P>
   When Chuck Elkins became the EPA's director of the Office of
Toxic Substances in 1986, the team he took over had already been
working on the asbestos ban for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 10 years and about $10 million to put the ban
together,'' Elkins says. ``But the science and medicine backing it
was solid and clearly supported that at least 94 percent of all
asbestos products should be banned.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1989, the EPA issued regulations that banned the
manufacture, importation, processing and selling of almost all
products containing asbestos. The ban was to be implemented in
three stages over nine years. This, the agency said, would permit
industries using asbestos to find safe alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Almost instantly, U.S. asbestos manufacturers, supported by the
governments of Canada and Quebec province, sued the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, 1991, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans overturned the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not unexpected,'' Elkins recalls. ``The Canadians felt
the ban was an anti-Canadian effort by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't convince them that the EPA staff doesn't have the
foggiest idea about foreign policy. This was strictly a
public-health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge appellate court did not take issue with the
EPA's science or medical opinions on asbestos' health hazards.
Rather, the judges faulted the agency for technical errors in the
cost-benefit analysis required by the Toxic Substance Control Act.
</P>
<P>
   The staff that developed the science and legal justification for
the ban was devastated. It was the first time in the 14 years since
the act was passed that the agency had actually used it to protect
the public's health. A decade of work was negated.
</P>
<P>
   Many memos were written by EPA staff members and scientists to
then-EPA Administrator Bill Reilly, telling him that asbestos was
still killing people and that the court ruling wasn't going to make
that tragic fact disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asbestos poses an unreasonable risk to human health and
nothing can be done to diminish its lethality but banning it,'' one
team of scientists wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who had frequently angered the Bush White House that
appointed him by putting environmental health issues before
political niceties, supported the concerns of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, 1992, the EPA's general counsel asked the Justice
Department to appeal the overturning of the ban to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened. In fact, Justice never officially replied to
the thoroughly documented 10-page plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we got was a verbal reply from Justice saying the
administration didn't want to go forward, and by administration it
was fairly obvious they meant the White House,'' says John Melone,
the current director of the EPA's National Program Chemical
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many members of the EPA's technical staff still say the
rejected ban should be taken before the Supreme Court. They believe
that the 5th Circuit's opinion would be overturned now.
</P>
<P>
   Melone agrees with his staff on the chances of victory, but says
the decision to appeal the ruling ``would have to be made at a
level a lot higher than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Melone and the EPA's regional asbestos experts have valid reason
for concern. An enormous amount of asbestos products are moving
through commerce in this country. The United States Geological
Survey, which monitors all commercial activities involving
minerals, says that in 1998 more than $300 million worth of
asbestos products were imported or exported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 products are traded in this country, including
pipes, construction materials, floor tiles, abrasives for cutting
and grinding, and aircraft and automotive brake parts.
</P>
<P>
   EPA staff members are concerned that most people, even workers
who routinely use products containing asbestos, don't know that
there is no ban to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People knew about the ban when we were trying to do it in the
late '80s, but unfortunately they didn't get the message that the
ban was overturned in 1991,'' says Neil Pflum, asbestos coordinator
for the EPA's Region 5 in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone thinks they're still protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle to eliminate the threat of asbestos continues, but on
an international scale. In December, while viewers around the globe
watched protesters mix it up with police in the Seattle streets,
Canadian diplomats and scientists were duking it out with other
nations over which asbestos fibers are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. diplomats are as puzzled as EPA officials in trying to
pin down why the Canadians are so zealous in their defense of a
Quebec industry that employs fewer than 1,600 miners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's politics,'' says Steven Guilbeault, an environmental
specialist with Greenpeace in Vancouver, B.C..
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes understandable when you know the desire of the
federal (Canadian) government to gain as much public support in
Quebec as it can. Its support of Quebec's asbestos miners must be
visible to prevent the sovereignist movement from using the
argument that the federal government is in no position to defend
the interest of the Quebec population.''
</P>
<P>
   France banned asbestos in 1997, but the Canadian government is
fighting the French efforts before the World Trade Organization
courts, insisting that chrysotile, the asbestos that Canada
exports, is not carcinogenic.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the asbestos lobby continues to be
enormous and powerful. In the last decade five leading
asbestos-product companies alone and their political action
committees have contributed $2.2 million to federal campaigns, led
by the W.R. Grace Co. at $764,618.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has a responsibility to tell the truth but a poor
record of doing so,'' Lemen says. ``There were cover-ups of the
hazards documented in the '30s and '40s, and through the '60s, '70s
and '80s. They are going on to this present day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of responsible scientists has requested a ban on all
new uses of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the United States, a country that is advanced
scientifically, not one of the leaders in banning a substance known
for its toxicity for the last 100 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is political. No one is willing to go up against
the asbestos companies. The U.S. government is not willing to go
against the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, the public continues to get exposures that will
kill.''

 &HT;    Dell's growth slows as company profit barely beats last year's
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. put behind one of its
toughest quarters in recent memory Thursday, earning only slightly
more than it did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's $436 million profit met analysts' recently lowered
expectations and underscored what Dell has been saying for the past
year: The days of revenue and earnings growth at 50 percent a year
are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a small company you can grow at that rate, but at
our size it just isn't logical to expect. We think the low 30
(percent range), that's about it,'' said Dell Vice Chairman Kevin
Rollins.
</P>
<P>
   Dell endured a difficult fourth quarter fraught with chip-supply
problems and Y2K-induced skittishness among corporate buyers to eke
out a 3 percent earnings increase from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Net income was $436 million, compared to $425 million in the
same period last year. Earnings per share rose to 16 cents per
share, up from 15 cents a year ago, thanks in part to Dell's
growing investments in other young technology companies. Investment
gains added 1 cent to per-share earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were $6.8 billion for the quarter, up 31 percent from $5.2
billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's stock rose $3.23 to $38.80 in trading Thursday before
earnings were announced, up 9 percent from Wednesday's close of
$35.56. The price dropped to $37.88 in after-hours trading
following the earnings announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The results were anti-climactic in the face of a warning from
Dell two weeks ago that it would not meet Wall Street's previous
estimates of 21 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we were not satisfied with the results, and we're
taking action to correct some of those issues,'' Rollins said of
the fourth quarter. ``But I think we're seeing a more stable
component environment, and I think the Y2K issue is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-year results were more positive with revenue of $25.2
billion, up 38.5 percent from last year. Net income rose 13 percent
to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were
61 cents, up 15 percent from last year, including the one-time
charge. Total shipments were up 50 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is physics,'' said Jimmy Johnson, an analyst at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``There's nothing wrong with Dell's
model or Dell. It's just the law of large numbers. They continue to
take a lot of market share, overtaking Compaq domestically. But the
overall model is starting to slow a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a surprise to Dell. When the company reported fiscal
1999 results a year ago, Chief Executive Michael Dell warned that
growth would slow to the upper 30 percent range. But it took
warnings from the company in the third and fourth quarters that
sales would not be as strong as Wall Street was expecting for the
message to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wall Street has) known that for long time, whether it's been
verbal or not,'' Johnson said. ``But the market's the market: A lot
of times it doesn't pay much attention. This is the wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock remains 26 percent below its recent high of
$52.69 in late December. A year ago, shares were trading at $48.50.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Meredith, Dell chief financial officer, noted that the
company's lower growth rate is still much faster than the rest of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to set the standard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were several bright spots for the company last year.
Dell's server business grew 55 percent last year as it became the
No. 2 server company in the United States and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Servers and notebooks, which have higher margins than desktop
computers, now account for 45 percent of the company's sales.
That's up from 37 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's online sales, begun just four years ago, skyrocketed to
about $40 million a day and account for nearly half of the
company's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith and Dell spent most of their time during a 90-minute
conference call after the market closed talking about the future,
especially the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's betting heavily that it can build on its own e-commerce
expertise and growing lineup of servers and storage products to
become a major provider of Internet hardware. Analysts estimate
that U.S. companies will spend $200 billion a year on Internet
systems by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the exact spot where billions of dollars will be
spent building online infrastructure,'' Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also asked whether the introduction next week of
Microsoft's more powerful Windows 2000 would help increase
corporate sales. Dell said he didn't expect any immediate impact
because large corporations move more slowly than consumers. Sales
are more likely to be impacted in the second half of the year, he
said.

CANADIAN ASBESTOS INDUSTRY FIGHTS BANS AROUND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER and CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the deadly, microscopic fiber it mines, the Canadian
asbestos industry is small but potent.
</P>
<P>
   Shielded by Quebec's political clout, the industry is fighting
to build its markets, even as asbestos deaths mount around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Although it employs fewer than 1,600 miners and operates only
three mines, the Canadian industry has fought asbestos bans in the
United States and Europe, frustrating public-health watchdogs that
would just as soon see the asbestos industry gasp its last breath.
</P>
<P>
   Centered in the eastern townships of Quebec, the Canadian
asbestos industry is the world's second-largest producer of
chrysotile, the predominant form of asbestos in use today. It mines
more than 320,000 tons of asbestos a year, more than 90 percent of
which is exported to other countries, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 the Canadian asbestos industry, in conjunction with U.S.
asbestos interests, successfully challenged the Environmental
Protection Agency's ban on asbestos products in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the United States imported 15,700 tons of crude
asbestos from Canada. It also imported $138.7 million worth of
asbestos-containing goods from Canada, Mexico and elsewhere, an
increase of 17 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The main U.S. imports, based on tonnage, are asbestos-cement
sheets, panels and tiles for use in construction. In terms of
value, the biggest imports are brake linings and pads.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is fighting bans in other countries as well.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, nine of the 15 members of the European Union
(Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Sweden) have banned asbestos on the grounds there is
no safe exposure level to the cancer-causing fiber. Britain has
proposed a similar ban.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing global expansion of the ban, Canada has taken its battle
to the World Trade Organization. In 1998, Canada demanded that
France, its largest European customer, repeal its unilateral ban on
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The fight against the French ban is a strategic move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that this case concerns, strictly legally
speaking, only the ban applied by France, the decision of the WTO
panel will undoubtedly have serious implications for any WTO
country wishing to ban asbestos in its territory,'' said Barry
Castleman, a Baltimore-based environmental consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision in Canada's favor would threaten national bans
across Europe and beyond,'' said Castleman, who served as a
consultant to the European Union during recent WTO asbestos
hearings in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Canada claims chrysotile asbestos is safe if used properly.
</P>
<P>
   But a report by the Scientific Committee on Toxicity,
Ecotoxicity and the Environment of the European Commission found
that ``there is sufficient evidence that all forms of asbestos,
including chrysotile, are carcinogenic to man.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada has argued, in part, that the safety of substitute fibers
has not been adequately studied, and used that to combat the
burgeoning ban movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always people talking about (bans,),'' said Tom
Coleman, vice president of operations for LAB Chrysotile in
Thetford Mines, Quebec, the country's largest asbestos producer.
``If we hear of it, we make an effort through the Asbestos
Institute to (educate people) on how to use it safely.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight against the French ban is considered a test case,
Castleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real target of the case is the Third World, mainly Asian
countries that are the major importers of Canadian asbestos
today,'' he said. ``Canada doesn't want Third World countries
asking why they should use a product so deadly that it is now
scheduled to be banned by all countries in the European Union by
2005.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders counter that they are sending experts to Third
World countries to educate workers about safety.
</P>
<P>
   A decision in the WTO case is expected in May.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason Canada is fighting so hard against bans.
</P>
<P>
   The bans have already cut into asbestos sales. In 1997, LAB had
to close a mine because it was no longer economical to operate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canadian trade figures, chrysotile shipments were
down 23.9 percent in 1999 compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   And politics are involved as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the federal government wants to do everything it
can to make it look like it's sensitive to the concerns of
Quebec,'' said Steven Guilbeault, a campaigner with Greenpeace in
Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more at stake than just the asbestos industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other reason that the federal and provincial governments
are still actively involved in defending the interests of the
asbestos industry is that they're looking at magnesium as the next
aluminum industry and they are going to mill the magnesium from the
asbestos waste,'' Guilbeault said. ``It's cheaper to produce than
aluminum because it's produced from asbestos waste.''
</P>
<P>
   The vein of asbestos that runs through Quebec is buried in
deposits of rock rich in iron and magnesium. Noranda Inc. of
Toronto, with backing by the government, has developed a method for
extracting magnesium from asbestos tailings.
</P>
<P>
   Magnesium, which is lighter and stronger than aluminum, could be
used to make lighter vehicles with better fuel economy. Market
analysts for mining companies project that the market for magnesium
could explode in the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Societe Generale de Financement du Quebec holds a 20 percent
interest in Magnola Mettalurgy, a subsidiary of Noranda which has
just built its first plant for mining magnesium from asbestos waste
in Quebec. Production is expected to begin this year.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman of LAB Chrysotile said the battle to keep the asbestos
industry alive is as much about a way of life as it is about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, their families have been employed in it over
100 years,'' Coleman said. ``Many (people) in our work force have
spent 35 to 40 years in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Their livelihoods now depend on fighting the image of asbestos
as a deadly killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to change the image,'' he said. ``We invite
anybody to come and visit. There's a tourist association that
brings a bus up here and goes down to the open pit and goes into
the mill so people can see for themselves.
</P>

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO END `MARRIAGE PENALTY`

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled House sent a $182 billion
Valentine to married taxpayers Thursday, offering tax relief not
only for dual-income couples hit by the ``marriage penalty'' but
for stay-at-home moms as well.
</P>
<P>
   But with the bill's future in the Senate cloudy, and the White
House all but threatening a veto, this latest tax proposal may well
turn out to be more election-year manifesto than tax-season
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 268-158 Thursday in favor of a 10-year measure
that takes aim at the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' the numerous
aspects of the tax code that force 25 million dual-income couples
to pay more in federal income taxes than they would if they were
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong to penalize people in the tax code for being
married, and it's right to fix it,'' Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the chief tax
writer in the House, said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called the bill
``unaffordable'' and based on ``fantasy budget numbers.'' Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers has already urged the president not to
sign the bill if it ever reaches his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000 would increase
the standard deduction for married couples to double the deduction
allowed for singles. For tax year 2000 that would mean raising the
standard deduction from $7,350 to $8,800, an increase of nearly 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since raising the standard deduction wouldn't help those
taxpayers _ mostly homeowners _ who would continue to itemize their
deductions, Archer's bill would also expand the lowest, 15 percent
tax bracket for married couples to twice that of singles.
</P>
<P>
   In the current tax year, the 15 percent bracket covers the first
$26,250 of income for a single but only $43,850 for married
couples. The bill, over time, would raise the 15 percent bracket
for families to $52,500.
</P>
<P>
   To help the working poor, the proposal would raise the phase out
level for the earned income tax credit, saving some families as
much as $421 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats pointed out that more than half of the tax breaks in
Archer's bill would go to families that don't suffer the marriage
penalty. Families living on one income, rather than a penalty,
enjoy a ``marriage bonus.'' They too would receive tax cuts under
Archer's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We unabashedly help the stay-at-home moms,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted by the Joint Committee on Taxation calculated
a family in 2005 with two children taking the standard deduction
and earning $20,000 a year would save $463 a year under Archer's
plan. A family earning more than $200,000 would save $1,158 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., called Archer's bill ``as sneaky as
a Valentine's (Day) suitor wearing a mark on his left finger where
the ring has been removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats supported a smaller, 10-year, $95 billion plan that
would increase the standard deduction but not expand the 15 percent
tax bracket. The Democratic plan was contingent upon the government
following through with plans to wipe out the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the ranking Democrat on the Ways
and Means Committee, said the real difference between the
Republican and Democratic bills is that Archer's version ``is going
to be vetoed, and the Democratic alternative can be signed into
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' bill was rejected 233-192.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's bill did attract 48 Democratic votes. And while
somewhat embarrassing for House Democrats, that is not enough to
override a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart predicted the Archer measure would not survive the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all indications are the Senate is going to have a more
realistic process,'' Lockhart said. ``We want a marriage penalty
bill that is affordable. We've put forward a plan to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With such strong Democratic opposition ``in the short term, this
bill is going nowhere,'' said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy
for the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche in Washington. ``It's a
political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   But a consensus does appear to be building in Washington behind
the notion of providing some kind of tax relief to dual-income
couples, sometime down the road. ``I don't think it will be this
year,'' Stretch said.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage penalty relief was perhaps the most popular element of
the Republican's failed $792 billion tax-cutting plan last year.
Republicans have threatened to resurrect key elements of that tax
plan again this year to throw back at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he would like to see how the marriage penalty
proposal fares in the Senate and get a look at the latest budget
numbers in mid-March before deciding whether to pursue further
tax-cutting legislation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, called the Democrats' alternative proposal
``a better bill, offering more relief for working families and
maintaining fiscal responsibility for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brady, R-Texas, called reducing the marriage penalty just
``common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is terribly unfair and simply wrong to tax families more
because they are married,'' Brady said. ``Besides, my wife thinks
it's penalty enough to be married to me. Uncle Sam doesn't need to
pile on.''

SENATE AND CLINTON STILL STALLED ON NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Alaska, Wash., Texas, Colo.)   (bl)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost two decades ago, Congress ordered the Energy
Department to choose a place for permanent storage of the tons and
tons of radioactive nuclear waste building up at reactors in 40
states.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending $6 billion just to study the issue, the
government is not much closer to establishing a permanent waste
site, stymied by years of machinations that have transcended party
lines and led to some of the most audacious power plays in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after grappling for years over the rules of waste
disposal and the question of whether Yucca Mountain in Nevada is a
suitable place for the waste site, Congress and the White House
failed once again to come up with a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 64-34, the Senate passed a bill that would begin
setting the rules for turning Yucca Mountain, an arid spot 100
miles northwest of Las Vegas, into a permanent disposal site by
2007, although several hurdles remain.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton is expected to veto the bill if it ever
clears the House, which is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called the legislation
toothless because it lacked environmental protections and several
make-or-break provisions regarding deadlines and liability.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, who sponsored the bill, fell shy of the 67
votes needed to override a veto after the second-ranking Democrat,
Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, persuaded many of his colleagues to
oppose the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process had absolutely nothing to do with science,'' said
Sen. Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev., a former governor who was elected to
the Senate in large part because of his vigorous opposition to
nuclear waste sites at Yucca Mountain or anywhere else in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reeked of politics, and it continues to this very day,''
Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, there is agreement from the bill's chief sponsor,
Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, the chairman of the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the White House of failing to address a critical
issue facing the nuclear-energy industry _ the growing stockpile of
nuclear waste _ in an effort to placate Nevada lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is opposed to addressing this on their
watch,'' Murkowski said, zeroing in on Vice President Al Gore's
presidential run and his ties to environmental groups. ``It's
perfectly logical considering Gore and Clinton and the
environmental pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   For most politicians and lawmakers, small-town concerns drive
the debate. ``Nobody wants the waste,'' Murkowski said. ``But you
throw it up in the air and it has to come down somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been searching for a place to bury nuclear waste
since 1954, when the Atomic Energy Act permitted commercial nuclear
reactors to generate electricity. The federal government was made
responsible for disposing spent nuclear fuel. Since then, nuclear
waste has piled up in holding tanks at reactors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, President Jimmy Carter vowed not to leave the waste in
temporary storage sites for future generations to deal with.
Congress got busy and in 1982 instructed the administration to
start choosing a permanent site. That is when politicians started
throwing sharp elbows.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, an election year, President Ronald Reagan assured
voters in the Southeast that they did not need worry about being
selected as the location of a permanent waste site. The list
narrowed to three states: Texas, Washington and Nevada. But Rep.
Jim Wright of Texas, who was speaker of the House, shielded his
home state, and Rep. Thomas Foley of Washington, who was speaker
after Wright, protected his state as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada, a sparsely populated state that has only four members of
Congress and is the test site for nuclear bomb blasts, drew the
short straw. In 1987, Congress chose Yucca Mountain as the only
prospective site.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been studying the site ever since, and the
government has spent $6 billion from a nuclear energy fund,
collected from nuclear energy rate payers, for the research. The
total fund is $15 billion. There is still no firm conclusion on
whether the site is suitable, or how to make it suitable.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from Nevada say it is wrong to place all the nuclear
waste in one site.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one contended that in the interest of science all the
nuclear eggs should be in one basket,'' said Bryan, who says Nevada
became the choice because it had no political clout.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the political tweaking that goes on, just this
week Murkowski sought to get Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo.,
on his side by adding clause that would have barred the waste from
passing through Colorado. But the clause upset too many other
senators, so it was struck from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear industry is warning that several of its plants will
run out of storage space for nuclear waste in the next few years
and that the problem is only getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely easy to use scare tactics in order to oppose
progress on this issue, because it's nuclear,'' said Ted Garrish,
vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear plants produce more than 22 tons of nuclear waste a
year. Most environmental groups oppose moving the waste, saying
that trucking it across the nation is too perilous, a contention
the nuclear industry disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevadans tend to see it the same way as the
environmentalists. ``It's a mobile Chernobyl,'' Bryan said.

HIS LEAD SHAKEN, BUSH TRIES A BREEZIER, LESS CEREMONIAL STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also REPUBS-SC) 
(lh) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAWN, S.C. _ There was, for starters, his altitude.
</P>
<P>
   As Gov. George W. Bush addressed the gathered fried-food lovers
at the Catawba Fish Camp here Thursday afternoon, he did not tower
several feet above them, on the kind of stage or raised platform
that he had previously favored.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Texas governor was down among the diners, who
pressed in so close that Bush could almost reach out and touch the
batter-dipped catfish on their styrofoam plates.
</P>
<P>
   His tone was different, too: punchier, folksier, flat-out
funnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I take that word `briefly' as a hint?'' he ribbed a man at
the restaurant who asked him for an abbreviated explanation of his
intended policy toward China. The crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``W.,'' Bush assured them, referring to his middle initial,
``doesn't stand for windy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinvention would be too strong a word for what Bush is
attempting as he shakes off the humiliation of New Hampshire, where
he was crushed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and looks for
redemption in South Carolina. Many of his talking points remain the
same, and he articulates them with his trail-tested trove of catch
phrases and slogans.
</P>
<P>
   But the chastened candidate who hit the road this week, after
several days of strategizing and soul-searching on his home turf of
Texas, is trying a few new tricks on for size, and maybe, in the
process, finding a style that suits him better.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign appearances are becoming shorter on canned
oratory and more indulgent of questions from his audience, a ratio
much like that of McCain, his chief rival for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is placing himself smack in the middle of his crowds, much
as Bill Clinton did in 1992, when he was making the case that he
was more in touch with Americans than Bush's father, the president
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's new tactics represent more than simple mimicry, more
than a mere makeover. They are an earnest response to one of the
central conundrums of his candidacy: Why does Bush so often have
trouble projecting, in public, the sharpness and charm that are so
vivid in private, and that have persuaded so many Republican
politicians and benefactors to throw their support and dollars his
way?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too cautious before,'' said one of Bush's advisers,
reflecting on the overwhelming advantage Bush had held in the polls
for so long. That lead argued for the safest strategy, and it
consigned Bush to rote, redundant ways.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser said Bush's campaign was headed by people who
knew him so well, and liked him so much, that they did not fully
realize the need to package and market his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It is a new ballgame now. Bush is wandering more frequently and
freely among reporters. And the bodyguards are learning to blend
into the background, as are the gaggle of staff members whose
omnipresence gave Bush's campaign events the formal air of a
presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, he is trying to keep his formal remarks shorter and
his answers to questions terser, with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, facing lively crowds, Bush was crisp and
energetic, and he reveled in a Texas drawl that was much more
pronounced than it had ever been in Delaware or New Hampshire,
states that he clearly viewed as colder than South Carolina, in
more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   His new theme, ``a reformer with results,'' allowed him to focus
more sharply on his Texas record, even if the phrase seemed to
define him in terms of, and in response to, McCain.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bush got off to a slower start, but he was rolling
by the time he caught a whiff of the hush puppies and the adulation
among the overflow crowd at the Catawba Fish Camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign had actually given the new
theater-in-the-round format that it used at the restaurant a name,
``One on One With Governor Bush,'' but the banner bearing those
words was no more conspicuous than the sign that said, ``No Food
Taken from Tables Unless Boxed or Bagged by Your Waitress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stood at a microphone and pivoted 360 degrees as he
appealed to the people on all sides of him.
</P>
<P>
   As he covered issues, including health care and education, he
cast himself as a true conservative, although he seemed careful not
to tilt too far to the right, perhaps keeping the general election
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's George W. versus Chairman McCain and Al Gore,'' he said,
deftly distilling into one short, loaded line his criticism that
McCain has been in Washington long enough to head a Senate
committee and has taken too many Democratic positions.
</P>
<P>
   Indulging a trademark reverie about the blessings of freedom in
America, Bush did not stutter toward a vague conclusion, but
finished with a rousing recitation of what those blessings were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of religions!'' Bush shouted. ``Freedom of elections!
Freedom of the press!'' He threw his whole body into it, as if
determined to turn oratory into aerobics and a once-cool campaign
into something hotter.

 &HT;    Woods leaves door open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   La Jolla, Calif. _ As he attempts to keep alive The Streak,
Tiger Woods offers something different for mere mortals of the PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Tease.
</P>
<P>
   It came in the form of a 1-under-par 71 Thursday in the first
round of the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines Golf Course, but no
one considers it hugely meaningful. Owning six consecutive PGA Tour
wins and moving closer to Byron Nelson's incredible string of 11,
the 24-year-old Woods came out Thursday, hit it all over the North
Course on a blustery day _ he actually bogeyed two of his first
three holes _ and still finished under par.
</P>
<P>
   In relative terms, this brings hope to his gaping PGA Tour
colleagues, but not much. Woods left the 18th green, where he
needed to sink a 10-footer for par, and described a game you'd have
assumed was in total chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play very well,'' Woods said at a tournament where
the media assemblage jumped from 100 to 300 following his Monday
miracle at Pebble Beach. ``I didn't hit it very well. I didn't putt
very well. It was just one of those days when I didn't have it. . .
. I think I just really need a day off. I've been grinding really
hard lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody but CBS and the USA Network, of course, wishes Woods
would take off a couple of months. Stay home in Orlando and try to
beat himself on his video game. Do a few more Buick commercials. At
least this week perhaps a Davis Love III or a Phil Mickelson will
be chasing the defending champion, rather than someone as wobbly as
a Matt Gogel. Love is atop the leaderboard with a 7-under 65, a
stroke ahead of Mickelson. Both are former champions at Torrey
Pines.
</P>
<P>
   As gutsy as it would be to say they are playing their own games
and not pondering Woods, it would be absolutely bogus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always thinking about it,'' said Love. ``After last
week, anything is possible. When guys see his name creeping up the
leaderboard, they start to panic a little.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' said Mickelson, ``Tiger's play is forcing
everybody to play at a whole other level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody plays that good for that many times in a row,'' said
J.L. Lewis, who also shot 67. ``It's the greatest thing I've ever
seen. . .Obviously, you've got to play real good, because he can
play bad and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' scattered play notwithstanding, there were glimmers of
his streaking self. Starting on the back nine, Woods countered an
unplayable lie on the 11th hole that became a fortunate bogey with
a 35-footer for eagle at the 14th to get to even.
</P>
<P>
   It never felt much like a Thursday of what's normally a
middle-tier PGA Tour event. With Woods still 90 minutes from his
tee time, the No. 10 teebox was three-deep in fans. When Woods
finally appeared for his 11:12 a.m. tee time, it became reminscent
of the Tigermania I in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 7 baby,'' said the guy at the gallery ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to see what he looks like up close?'' a dad asked
his son.
</P>
<P>
   In navy sweater and charcoal slacks, Woods shook hands with the
starter, whose age suggested he was doing this before Tiger's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the batting order?'' Woods asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're No. 1,'' the man said.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, everybody already knew. Even if it wasn't a
day when the machine ran without squeaks, as Tiger said, ``I'm
fine. There are a lot of holes to play.''
</P>
<P>
   He was seven shots behind at Pebble after two rounds and it
didn't matter. He was seven shots back with seven holes left in the
tournament. If a back-nine showdown were to develop Sunday, Love
will expect every aspect of his game to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become an intimidating player to play with,'' Love said.
``You start wondering what he's going to do down the stretch and
you lose track of what you're doing.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: FOR CLINTON, TIME GROWS SHORT IN FORGING A MIDEAST
PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ISRAEL-LEBANON) 
(js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the election of Ehud Barak as the prime
minister of Israel last year, some senior Clinton administration
officials were almost giddy with the prospect of peace in the
Middle East. They even had their eye on creating an enduring White
House photograph: the trifecta of the Syrian, Palestinian and
Israeli leaders all lined up with President Clinton as the
triumphant peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   But time is running out on Clinton's administration. Though the
president has pledged to work until the very end of his term on a
Middle East accord, realistically, he would like to have the
makings of a peace deal fashioned in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   And circumstances in the region are not marching apace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is no longer seen as the popular new man easily able to
make bold moves on the peace front. Rather, he is a leader weakened
by a party fund-raising scandal and facing an electorate
distrustful of a deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is described by diplomats
as furious that the Syrians, with whom he has poor relations, are
getting so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, appears to have retreated
to his Damascus palace, where he is busy trying to calm internal
familial squabbling over who will succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the new crisis in southern Lebanon _ inspired,
many Israelis believe, by Assad _ where Hezbollah guerrillas have
killed six Israeli soldiers and Barak reluctantly responded with
retaliatory air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has concentrated on counseling
restraint on all sides. But at the very least, these events will
delay a resumption in the Israeli-Syrian talks, officials said.
Syrian state radio gave a taste of this in a bulletin on Wednesday,
saying, ``Barak has wasted opportunities for peace and pushed the
region towards a scenario where all options are open.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Clinton administration, such delays are decidedly
unhelpful. The longer the Syrian talks are on hold, a Western
diplomat in the region said, the harder it will be to restart them.
But restarting them will remain a particularly tantalizing
objective for Washington, the diplomat added, because the issues
separating the Syrians and the Israelis are fairly stark,
especially when compared to the complicated issues between the
Palestinians and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad, who is embroiled in fights between his army officers
and backers of his brother, Rifat, and his desire to have his son,
Bashir, succeed him, appears disinclined to return to the
negotiating table. ``The Syria talks won't get off in a hurry,''
the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   A hurry is what is needed. By July, Clinton runs into the
political convention season. In September, the general election
will be underway. Another consideration is his wife's Senate
campaign in New York, where the large number of Jewish voters will
be closely watching for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every month that goes by, the time factor looms larger and
larger,'' said Thomas Smerling, the Washington director of the
Israel Policy Forum. ``The clock is ticking on the longevity of the
administration, on the longevity of Arafat and Assad,'' both of
whom are ailing.
</P>
<P>
   Fairly soon, said Smerling, the administration may have to lower
its sights on what can be realistically accomplished between now
and the end of the year. This may well entail choosing where to put
the emphasis: the Syrian track or the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
   If the administration tries to plug along on both tracks, as is
most likely the case for the moment _ because this is Barak's
preference _ decisions will have to be made on whether to aim for a
final agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis as called for
by Sept. 13 or to make do with what is called a general framework
agreement. The latter was supposed to have been achieved by next
week, but is now hung up on bickering between Barak and Arafat over
a land transfer on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has what he believes to be a trump card: If a final
agreement is not reached by September, he has said he will declare
a Palestinian state anyway. Such a state would be a patchwork
affair of disjointed pieces of the West Bank as well as Gaza but
would probably be recognized by some European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tight timetable, administration officials claim to
be relatively upbeat that Clinton can manage a decent Middle East
outcome, if not the whole success that they had envisioned when
Barak came to power.
</P>
<P>
   They are counting a payoff from seven years of dealings by
Clinton and his aides in the Middle East _ ranging from former
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's work with Assad to the
accords between the Palestinians and the Israelis at Wye, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, Democrat of Delaware and the ranking minority
member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that no
other president had amassed ``the degree of trust among all the
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the trust Clinton may have built with the Middle
East leaders _ or the ``comfort level,'' as the president's aides
describe it _ Clinton remains at their mercy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the leaders in the region will act to satisfy their
own interests, not Clinton's desire for a page in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American role is still limited,'' said Abraham H. Foxman,
national director of the Anti-Defamation League. ``The United
States can only do as much as the parties allow them to do. The
question is how important is it for them to have the Clinton
package?''

 &HT;    Griffey to join Cincinnati Reds
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. got what he wanted Thursday. And cordon off the
National League Central, which just became an artillery range.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most significant trades in the game's history,
Griffey returned to the city of his youth as the Cincinnati Reds
completed four months of efforts to acquire the 10-time All-Star
from Seattle. In return, the Mariners received center fielder Mike
Cameron, pitcher Brett Tomko and two minor leaguers, second baseman
Antonio Perez and pitcher Jake Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   In one swoop, the Reds went from playoff possibility to World
Series contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully soon,'' Griffey said. ``My thing is, I want to get
there. I want to wear a ring like my dad has.''
</P>
<P>
   One season after missing the postseason in a one-game playoff,
the Reds have acquired, between Griffey and ex-Colorado Rockie
Dante Bichette, a total of 82 home runs and 267 RBIs. That's plenty
of noise, even in a division already including St. Louis' Mark
McGwire and Chicago's Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to see quite a few people coming out,'' said Reds
captain Barry Larkin, who last winter contemplated leaving the
franchise. ``It's going to be great not only in Cincinnati but all
the National League. They're going to be able to see the premier
guy, the player of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   While the trade did not exceed in scope the Mike Piazza-Gary
Sheffield deal of 1998 between Florida and Los Angeles, it was
historic for including an MVP (1997) in the prime of his career.
Historians might compare the day to St. Louis' traded 30-year-old
Rogers Hornsby to the New York Giants in 1926 after a string of six
straight batting championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great. It's great for the National League,'' said Atlanta
manager Bobby Cox. ``And hopefully we can get him out sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   After fretting that Griffey could ravage the game's salary
structure, his price came relatively cheap. The Reds gave up their
best young starter in Tomko and their center fielder in Cameron but
kept Gold Glove second baseman Pokey Reese, a critical component
who caused negotiations to break off in December because Reds GM
Jim Bowden would not part with him.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who will earn $8.25 million next season in the final
installment of a four-year contract, signed a nine-year extension
with a total worth of $116.5 million. Not only does that pale to
the eight-year, $148 million deal he turned down from the Mariners
last year. It also skews current market value.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Juan Gonzalez is considering a $140 million offer that
will pay him an average $17.5 million over eight seasons. Griffey's
average annual salary starting in 2001 will be $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never about the money,'' Griffey said. ``It doesn't
matter how much you make. It's where you feel happy and to me,
Cincinnati is the place that I thought I'd be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey hit 398 homers as a Mariner and brings a .299 career
average and 1,152 RBIs to his new team. While credited with saving
baseball in Seattle and making new Safeco Field possible, he leaves
behind a franchise that could offer him everything but his real
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball as in life,'' Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln said,
``there comes a time when people simply have to move on. And this
is what is happening here.''

 &HT;    Chance encounter unleashed deadly passions during Atlanta
slayings
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was supposed to be a night to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Though Richard Lollar had never much cared for football, the
Super Bowl was coming to town and he and his Decatur roommate,
Jacinth Baker, were going to party hard in Buckhead, where
glittering and glamorous people were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar, a barber, and Baker, an aspiring artist, had friends and
relatives coming from Akron, Ohio, their hometown, and the duo,
close since their teen years, was anxious to show them the city.
Lollar and Baker wanted to treat their friends to a night they'd
remember.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered all right, but for the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar, 24, was engaged; his fiancee expects their first child
this month. Baker, 21, was just starting to come into his own as an
artist, sending money to his grandmother in Akron.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after one of the few Super Bowls to live up to the name,
Lollar and Baker were lying in a puddle of blood just outside a
brick apartment complex at the corner of East Paces Ferry Road and
Grandview Avenue, the heart of Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar was dead at the scene. Baker died at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The fight scene _ there is still a trace of blood on the road _
is just two blocks from Cobalt Lounge, the last club, according to
friends and relatives, that Lollar and Baker visited before they
decided to call it a night.
</P>
<P>
   With its dark blue and purple exterior, Cobalt Lounge beckons
movie stars, professional athletes, supermodels and recording
artists. It also was the place football great Ray Lewis had chosen
to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Pro athlete had watched the Super Bowl at the Marietta
home of an Atlanta Falcons player and then decided to hit the party
circuit, gliding through the city in a 40-foot-long stretch
limousine. The car's gleaming black exterior was in striking
contrast with the full-length white fur coat that wrapped Lewis'
muscular body and the white cowboy hat that crowned his head. He
and his entourage arrived at the Cobalt between midnight and 1 a.m.
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a night to remember for Lewis, who now sits in
a jail cell dressed in a bright red jail uniform and charged with
the murders of Richard Lollar and Jacinth Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar's fiancee, Kellye Smith, remembers how excited he was
about the Super Bowl and the celebrations he and Baker had planned
for their Akron friends.
</P>
<P>
   Smith decided not to go out for the night because of her
condition. She lent Lollar and Baker her white Cutlass Supreme.
``Richard doesn't even like football. His game is boxing. That's
what he enjoys the most. But they wanted to go out that night.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly what time Lollar, Baker and their party
arrived at Cobalt. It was Urban Night at the club. The cover charge
was $100 a person; drinks went for $10.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar and Baker had the cash and they were dressed well enough
to get into the upscale bar, friends have said. Lollar wore black
pants and a full, baggy shirt. Baker had black pants, maybe
leather.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had the money,'' said James Wilkerson, owner of the Decatur
barbershop where Lollar worked. ``We deal cash money. In Atlanta,
cutting hair is an up and down business. It's possible if you come
to work every day, you can make $1,000 and it's possible the
following week to only make $300 or $400. ... I'm sure they had
money to be in there. They were in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Mitchell remembers getting a phone call from Lollar, who
was his brother, during the third quarter of the Super Bowl.
Mitchell and three friends were having dinner at his Stone Mountain
home and watching the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was supposed to come over with Baker, but he never made
it,'' Mitchell said. ``I thought I would hear (about) my brother's
big Super Bowl night at his barbershop the next day. Instead, a
friend called me last Monday morning and told me Richard was
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, meanwhile, had slipped into the VIP section at Cobalt
where the hip and the beautiful sipped champagne. Dom Perignon was
flowing and people swayed to hip-hop inside the star-studded room.
</P>
<P>
   But the VIP lounge wasn't exactly laid back. While club owner
Tom Cook denies there was any trouble, some witnesses have said a
fight broke out, bartenders ducked and bar stools flew. As a
result, the lounge was shut at 2:30 a.m. and celebrities were asked
to leave, forcing them to mingle with the not-so-famous in the
general area of the club.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the path of Lollar and Baker probably crossed that
of Lewis and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   The room was thumping and people were wall to wall. One witness
said someone in Lollar and Baker's group stepped on someone from
Lewis' party. Others say Baker may have ribbed Lewis about the
Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have told Lollar's grandmother, Joyce Lollar, that her
grandson tried to stop the argument brewing between Baker, others
from the Akron contingent and Lewis' friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to people who have called me, Richard was the
peacemaker,'' Joyce Lollar said from her Akron home this week.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson said Lollar would not have argued about football.
''Rich wasn't the type to argue over football,'' she said. ``He was
mainly a boxing fan. He'd sit down and argue with you about from
Joe Louis up until today. He wouldn't argue with you about
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobalt owner Cook said Lewis and his friends left about 3:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts differ as to what happened next, but, according to one
witness, Lewis was inside Cobalt when he called his limo driver,
Duane Fassett, on a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you at?'' Lewis asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett was parked on East Paces Ferry in front of the Habersham
Apartments, about two blocks from the nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' group walked to the limo. When they stopped to get in,
three men walked by and the two groups exchanged words. The groups
fought next to the limo and Lewis threw a punch. The fight was
over, and Lewis tried to get his friends into the limo.
</P>
<P>
   But two of his buddies _ who police now say are Reginald Oakley
of Baltimore and Joseph Sweeting of Miami _ followed the other
group down the street.
</P>
<P>
   The fight continued at East Paces Ferry and Grandview, about 40
to 50 feet in front of the limo. Lewis was next to the limo when
that fight erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, let's get out of here,'' Lewis yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' buddies returned to the limo and about 12 people piled
in. One witness said the two men who had continued the fight up the
street sat behind Fassett.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis sat in the back of the limo.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were fired at the front of the limo. One bullet flattened
the right front tire. Two other bullets hit an area near the
driver's compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The people in the back of the limo yelled for Fassett to drive.
He did. One of the men sitting behind the limo driver started
talking about a stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   He told the driver where to go, pointing the way to a nearby
Holiday Inn and a parking lot behind the hotel that is not visible
from the street.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men behind the driver had a scratch on his face.
</P>
<P>
   It was so loud in the passenger compartment that it is unlikely
Lewis could have heard the two men in front discussing the
stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the parking lot, Fassett stopped and got out to change
the tire. The 12 people in the back got out slowly. Some went into
the hotel to have breakfast. Others caught cabs to their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis did not seem concerned. He talked of his plans to fly to
Hawaii later in the day for the Pro-Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me when you get the tire changed,'' he told Fassett.
</P>
<P>
   The story they tell in Akron is a little different. There, the
story goes, Baker and Lollar never entered Cobalt, but were
supposed to meet some Akron friends outside. When they spotted the
friends, one of the pair, probably Lollar, yelled a familiar
greeting _ ''O-H-Ten,'' their slang for Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The friend said someone in Lewis' group thought Lollar and Baker
were taunting them and jumped from the car to confront them. The
man, who seemed drunk, charged Baker, who in self-defense cracked a
Moet champagne bottle on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Once the man was hit over the head, men and women began piling
out of the limo. Within seconds, according to the Akron friends,
Lollar and Baker were stabbed, while their friends watched nearby,
frozen in terror.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after 4 a.m., and Atlanta cops swarmed over the
crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrived at the Holiday Inn after someone called them and
told them about a blood-drenched man and the bullet-riddled
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Officers approached Fassett, and he was spirited to the police
homicide office where he spent the rest of the day talking to
police. His 80-page statement has not been released.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis sits in jail. While no one puts a knife in his hand,
police say he actively participated in the confrontation and
subsequently lied to and mislead them.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 11 p.m. Jan. 31, Lewis was arrested by Atlanta
homicide detectives at the Gwinnett County home of one of his
attorneys, Max Richardson. He has been held in jail since then.
Prosecutors will seek murder indictments against Lewis, Oakley and
Sweeting today.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar was buried Saturday; Baker on Monday.

2 CLINTON JUDICIAL CHOICES ARE APPROVED AFTER LOTT FORCES VOTE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Miss., Okla., Pa., N.J., N.H., Calif.)  (rk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, forced
through the confirmation of two federal judges Thursday, putting a
sudden end to an insurrection by members of his party who had vowed
to block consideration of any of President Clinton's choices for
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who controls the Senate's agenda, had been largely silent
over the last several weeks as 19 Republican senators had
campaigned to end consideration of all judicial nominees until
Clinton left office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should, or would, be able to go all year
without confirming any nominations,'' Lott, of Mississippi, said
Thursday in explaining his action. ``Some of these are good men and
women.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a great need for more judges in some states, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the group seeking a blockade, Sen. James Inhofe of
Oklahoma, said he was doing so in retaliation for what he said was
Clinton's deceptiveness in making appointments to several agencies
while the Senate was in recess last December. Inhofe said Clinton
had promised not to make some of those appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The White House countered that Inhofe misunderstood the
agreement, and Lott appeared to suggest that he thought the White
House explanation was correct. But until Thursday afternoon, Lott
did not challenge Inhofe or his 18 colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing up the two nominees on the floor for a vote, Lott
essentially challenged Inhofe to block the consideration with
prolonged debate, a filibuster, or fold. Inhofe first tried a
motion to suspend consideration of all the nominees, but he
received only the votes of his original 18 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   When the actual votes were taken, Thomas Ambro was confirmed by
a vote of 96-2 to be a judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Philadelphia. The Senate also voted 95-2 to confirm
Joel A. Pisano to be a federal trial judge in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe voted against both nominees and was joined by Sen. Robert
C. Smith, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The two nominees were largely without controversy and it remains
unclear how much Lott will yield when it comes to the nearly 40
nominees still pending.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of confirming judicial nominees becomes inevitably
linked to presidential politics in the last year of a presidential
term. Democrats, for example, have accused Republicans of trying to
slow the confirmation process to leave as many vacancies for the
next president in case the White House is occupied by a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Lott had already promised a floor vote on two of the nominees
who have waited the longest for consideration: Judge Richard Paez
of U.S. District Court and Marsha Berzon, a California lawyer, who
have both been nominated to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in San Francisco. Paez has been waiting more than three years for a
vote and Berzon for nearly two years.

LOS ANGELES POLICE CORRUPTION PROBE WIDENS; CONVICTIONS MAY BE
VOIDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A long-simmering corruption scandal has widened to
encompass a swath of the Los Angeles Police Department, with the
district attorney saying Thursday that his office has now found
more than 40 people who were wrongly prosecuted, and in several
cases shot, through police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, Gil Garcetti, also said in a news
conference that the investigation had now spread beyond the
inner-city station where it began.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said prosecutors would soon go to court to ask that
another 6 to 10 convictions be thrown out and that the victims be
released. Thirty-two cases have already been overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said in an interview late Thursday that he expected
more cases to be overturned and more prosecutors to be assigned to
the investigation. The police have disclosed that perhaps 100 cases
might have been tainted by planted evidence, false testimony or
other police abuses.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Garcetti said, the investigation has gone beyond
the Rampart Division, a station west of downtown in a gang-infested
neighborhood where the misconduct was first uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely can and will go beyond Rampart,'' he said. ``It
would be wrong to think this is just a Rampart investigation. We
are going where the case goes.''
</P>
<P>
   He disclosed that there had been a ``breakdown'' in the
cooperation between police and prosecutors. The police, he said,
have started to resist prosecutors' efforts to gather information,
a sign of the rising tensions as some in the police department seek
to limit the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors met with police officials Thursday morning, and
Garcetti said they were assured that they would get the cooperation
they needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel, rightly or wrongly, that we weren't getting all the
information we needed,'' Garcetti said. ``The air was cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Sharyn Buck, a police spokeswoman, said the department would
have no comment on Garcetti's remarks or any aspect of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has been disclosed that officers shot an unarmed man
in handcuffs, planted guns, drugs and other evidence on suspects,
lied in court testimony to frame innocent people and stole drugs
and money.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Thursday, the scandal was the most serious instance
of corruption in the history of the troubled Los Angeles Police
Department, but its growing breadth and the systematic nature of
the corruption, which apparently went unchecked for years, has
raised questions about the ability of the department to monitor its
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The structure was in place there that allowed this'' to go on
for so long, Garcetti said. ``There hasn't been a structural
change'' in the department to correct the problems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His remarks underscored the political tensions underlying the
investigation, which has pitted Garcetti's office and its
supporters against the police department and its backers.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard C. Parks, the chief of police, has publicly hinted that
Garcetti was moving too slowly on the investigation. Chief Parks
has tried to pre-empt critics by suggesting plans to improve
internal monitoring in the department. Several weeks ago he urged
Garcetti to overturn 99 tainted cases quickly and to file charges
against three officers.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti has suggested that the police, though they uncovered
the corruption, had allowed it go on for years and that the cases
have to be reviewed carefully and individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the Los Angeles Police Department would like to
move more quickly and get this behind them,'' Garcetti said. ``It's
just going to take longer than some people want it to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti, who is up for re-election this year, has also been
criticized by his campaign opponents as not moving aggressively
enough. He said he was in no hurry to end the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions escalated Thursday morning when The Los Angeles
Times carried two articles that quoted from the secret interviews
with investigators of Rafael Perez, a former officer who has
admitted to years of abuses and who revealed the incidents after
being arrested on charges that he had stolen cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The articles quoted Perez, who is cooperating with the police in
order to reduce his sentence, as saying that nearly the entire
anti-gang unit at the Rampart Division, including supervisors were
involved. He is also quoted as saying that officers at other police
stations were engaged in abuses. The newspaper provided details of
a case in which the police were reported to have shot an unarmed
gang member, then planted a gun near him as he bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   The articles were a major embarrassment to the police
department.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti would not go into detail, but said, ``I didn't read
anything in the articles that was inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of civil suits have already been filed by those wrongly
imprisoned, and more suits are expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles city attorney, who handles the civil litigation,
said that settling the civil complaints could cost $120 million,
with some outside experts saying the figure could top $200 million.

 &HT;    Retirement best bet for Marino
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Miami Dolphins are ready to retire
Dan Marino's jersey, but first the man with the epic arm and the
tragic end wants to run that famous No. 13 up the flagpole to see
if any other NFL teams salute.
</P>
<P>
   This is the shaky compromise on which South Florida's most
wrenching sports drama rests, but only for a moment. Marino's
decision to void his Dolphins contract is little more than a
time-out. Rather than handing the ball over to a new Miami coach
who's up against the salary-cap clock, he spiked it instead.
</P>
<P>
   Can't begrudge Marino a moment of meditation. He's earned that
and so much more, outlasting both Don Shula and Jimmy Johnson,
outdistancing the career statistics of any other Hall of Fame
passer, outclassing a franchise that's found its very identity in
him for 17 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Don't pray, however, for another last-minute comeback. That
might still be on Marino's mind, a return to mini-camp calisthenics
with the Dolphins as if none of this ever happened, but it's not in
his best interests. The organization doesn't want him anymore, as
demonstrated repeatedly in recent weeks by the strained efforts to
avoid the topic altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Not one encouraging comment from coach Dave Wannstedt, other
than to say that the retirement call was up to Dan. Not one public
plea from team owner Wayne Huizenga for Marino, his golf buddy, to
stay. This in contrast to Kansas City's free-agent courtship with
Joe Montana, when San Francisco offered to name their icon the
``designated starter'' over Steve Young if that's what it took to
keep him.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are moving on, a fresh two-year contract extension
in the hands of kid quarterback Damon Huard. Marino just needs a
little time getting used to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Jimmy, for leaving this mess for Wannstedt to clean up.
By way of comparison, those salary-cap problems you inherited from
Don Shula were simply solved.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Wayne, for allowing Marino to believe that his wishes
are paramount, all the while authorizing Wannstedt to build an
offensive staff better suited to a young, eager-to-be-trained
quarterback. Chan Gailey, Miami's new offensive coordinator, called
the plays in Dallas but never really clicked with Troy Aikman,
another superstar passer. Mike Shula, Marino's would-be
quarterbacks coach at Miami, is 34. For Dan, 39 in September,
there's nothing new under the training-camp sun. Dave Shula once
coached him, too, but never very comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tease, all right, the notion that Marino could still suit
up for the Dolphins in the 2000 season if he only says the word.
Likewise, the concept that the money-minded Dolphins have displayed
uncommon class in letting him plot his own future is less than
sincere.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this, the threatened benchings by Jimmy, the vanishing
of every running back but Stanley Pritchett for two crucial weeks
in December, the order against audibles at the line of scrimmage,
Dan is the one who truly took the high road.
</P>
<P>
   One brief postgame blowup at reporters revealed Marino's
frustration that the Dolphins Jimmy assembled aren't Super Bowl
material, but never was it aimed at anyone within the organization.
This is best, of course, because nobody planned for it to end this
way.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino, a free agent. The Miami Dolphins, feeling liberated
at the loss of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   A cherished autograph, voluntarily scrawled on a stack of
severance papers.

ATTACKS ON WEB SITES MAY HAVE BEEN WORK OF MORE THAN ONE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story has moved to the NYTimes business front page) 
(With WEB-ATTACK) 
(js) 
 By MATT RICHTEL and SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Law enforcement officials and computer security
experts said Thursday that evidence may now suggest that the four
days of attacks on major Web and e-commerce sites had been the work
of more than one person or group.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Internet community sifted aggressively through the
electronic rubble for leads, computer experts said that it would be
extremely difficult even to determine which computers initiated the
attacks, let alone find the responsible parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT, a federally
financed computer security organization, said Thursday that it was
no longer seeing an unusual number of reports of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But security experts said Web sites and the Internet in general
would remain vulnerable for the near future because so many
organizations were failing to take steps to prevent their computers
from being used by vandals to initiate the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, it was disclosed that more major Web sites than
had been previously known were hit on Wednesday, the last day of
the assaults. Those included Excite(AT)Home, a provider of
high-speed access over cable modems, which was attacked early
Wednesday evening despite having taken precautions to defend its
network.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other major e-commerce companies were hit with
attacks on Wednesday, according to IFsec, a computer security firm
in New York, though it declined to name the companies, noting that
one of them was a client.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more of these than have appeared in the popular
media,'' said David M. Remnitz, chief executive of IFsec.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, users of Internet Relay Chat, or IRC, said that the
forum has been under intense fire in the last two weeks by attacks
similar to those levied at the e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, network service providers and investigators continued
analyzing evidence, including the packets of data that had been
used to overwhelm and paralyze the victim sites.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security experts at Stanford University said the
preliminary evidence suggested that the attacks may be the work of
more than one person or group.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Brumley, assistant computer security officer for
Stanford, said the type of data included in the packets used to
attack Yahoo on Monday differed from the data used in the Tuesday
assault on eBay.com the online auction site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attacks were just completely different between those two
days,'' Brumley said. ``The people who did Yahoo are different than
the people who did eBay and CNN.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Network service providers said the recent assaults included two
types of attacks, further suggesting that more than one party may
have be involved. Both are what are known as denial of service
attacks because they prevent the targeted site from serving its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, known as a SYN flood, attackers hack into _ and
install software on _ a large number of computers, then use those
machines to bombard the victim site with requests to start an
e-commerce session. The large number of requests overwhelms the
victim's servers, preventing customers from gaining access to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent any tracing of these requests, the vandals employ a
practice called spoofing, which alters the initiating address.
</P>
<P>
   The second type, known as a smurf attack, again involves making
use of compromised machines, but it also employs a large
third-party network of computers to ``amplify'' the data used in
the attack and greatly increases the effectiveness of the assault.
It is believed that Stanford's network of computers may have been
used in this way in the attack on Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts say it was simple to configure networks so they
could not be used in a smurf attack, yet many sites do not know to
take these steps.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security experts noted that the large numbers of
computers used to initiate the attacks this week make tracing those
attack very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point there's been so much traffic thrown at these
people that it's pretty hard to do a trace,'' said Joel de la Garza
of the Kroll-O'Gara Information Security Group, a risk mitigation
company.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, companies whose computers are hijacked and used as
platforms for the assault often have no idea of the problem, even
as the assault is going on, computer security experts said. Vandals
can activate the assault from a remote location, and to a company
or individual whose computer is being used, the only impact may
appear to be a slowdown in network activity.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis that more than one group was at work called into
question the conclusion of some security experts who were initially
skeptical that following Monday's attack on Yahoo, multiple vandals
would have been able to muster large ``copy cat'' assaults on other
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Victim companies and security experts said Thursday that in some
cases the attacks seemed more complicated than originally thought _
reinforcing how difficult they are to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Excite(AT)Home, for example, said it sought to take
precautionary measures in light of the earlier attacks but was
unable to keep its Web site from being crippled for at least half
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of our knowledge, a site cannot take preventative
measures against the attacks without the help of others,'' said
Kelly Distefano, an Excite(AT)Home spokeswoman. She said the
company would have needed more cooperation from the companies that
provide Excite network services.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Neumann, principal scientist at SRI International in Menlo
Park, Calif., reiterated that the success of the attacks has shown
that Internet sites are not taking adequate precautions to prevent
themselves from being used for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time people woke up,'' he said. ``People are racing to do
electronic commerce on the Net without any understanding of the
risks _ and there are much greater risks than we've seen here.''

 &HT;    Desire for ring detrimental to Marino's legacy
 &HT;    with Dolphins
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If he does land in Tampa Bay _ or at any
other NFL address, for that matter _ as a free-agent quarterback in
search of a Super Bowl title he never won in Miami, it will stand
as Dan Marino's ultimate act of not-so-quiet desperation.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be more than a little sad.
</P>
<P>
   Because if Marino ever plays as anything other than a Dolphin,
he'll be chasing a dream that can only be properly fulfilled in
Miami. Marino, despite the Dolphins' failure to win the
championship during his 17 seasons with the team, remains a Miami
hero to anyone who applies even a glimmer of logical thinking to
the situation. Not winning a Super Bowl wouldn't, or shouldn't,
diminish Marino's greatness or reputation in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, though, could damage his Dolphin legacy by selling
himself off as a hired gun.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Marino were to get his ring with a team other than
the Dolphins, he wouldn't _ he couldn't _ be as joyous as he would
have been had the glory been earned in Miami. Would he, in such
circumstances, exact delicious revenge on the Dolphins? Absolutely,
but it would carry a bittersweet aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   The only pure fairy-tale ending to Marino's career comes with a
script that has him leading Miami to a Super Bowl triumph, and
that's never going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   But playing with another team, regardless of what success he
might realize, isn't going to change the fact that Marino is
forever a Dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   It's what makes this whole Marino/Miami waltz and supposed
Marino/Tampa Bay courtship so uncomfortable to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's misfortunes in his Super Bowl quest as a Dolphin are
backdropped by sympathy grown from all he has meant to Miami for so
many seasons. But taking up the chase in Tampa Bay would only bring
pitiful denouement to Marino's career.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in stunning decline with the Dolphins last season, Marino
exists as someone too stubborn to recognize when to quit. That's
why the Dolphins _ from retired coach Jimmy Johnson to new coach
Dave Wannstedt and, apparently, with silent complicity from owner
and Marino-man Wayne Huizenga _ have made it clear they don't want
the legendary quarterback anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, that's why Marino split with the Dolphins, at least
officially, by voiding the last two years of his contract Thursday
morning at team headquarters. What that means _ retirement, a
subsequent re-signing with Miami or a new life somewhere else _ is,
for now, guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   Money means nothing to Marino, whose ego has nothing to do with
what he earns. That's the whole point of Marino's willingness to
walk away from millions of dollars with the Dolphins, if need be.
His ego has to do with being The Quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he storms into Tampa Bay and is somehow reincarnated as
the sensational thrower of old, Marino would be little more than a
caretaker for a team that came very close to making it to the Super
Bowl without him this season. Otherwise, there's nothing heroic
about Marino winning a Super Bowl with Tampa Bay or any other team
that is already a contender.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing noble about an aging athlete whose bravado
won't allow him to admit he's no longer the best man in the fight.
There is something noble about an aging athlete who convinces
himself to walk away from a wonderful career, but without the
game's grand prize.
</P>
<P>
   Marino must feel he has something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't, of course, but he must feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   If in decertifying his contract with the Dolphins he is simply
giving the franchise a chance to bring him back at no economic risk
to itself or clearing the way for his own retirement, then Miami
should give in to either of Marino's wishes and do so graciously.
</P>
<P>
   But if the contract decertification was Marino's method of
clearing his own path toward Tampa Bay or Oakland or Seattle or
some other NFL post, then Miami should get on with it and
facilitate the departure.
</P>
<P>
   Until there is resolution, though, everything about this is
unseemly and cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody looks noble or heroic, and a proud man risks looking
desperate and pathetic.

PROSECUTOR LASHES OUT AT COMBS ON SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the rap impresario Sean (Puffy) Combs glared and
scowled, a Manhattan prosecutor Thursday accused him of sparking a
December shooting at a Times Square night club.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Matthew Bogdanos, an assistant district
attorney, referred to Combs as arrogant, brazen and a criminal as
he described the events leading to the Dec. 27 shooting at Club New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Bogdanos accused Combs, 31, of believing he was above the law,
lying in his testimony to a grand jury and trying to bribe
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Combs caused the shooting, the prosecutor said at Thursday's
hearing, by arguing with a man over which one of them made more
money. He said the argument escalated until the man threw a wad of
cash in Combs' face. When club security moved in and asked Combs to
leave, he replied ``it ain't over,'' Bogdanos said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Barrow, a protege of Combs' who was with him that night,
then pulled a gun and Combs did the same, Bogdanos said. Barrow
fired, the prosecutor said, wounding three bystanders while the man
arguing with Combs also fired a gun. He was never arrested and is
still being sought by  &QC; police.
</P>
<P>
   Bogdanos also said that the grand jury testimony of the singer
and actress Jennifer Lopez, Combs' companion on the night of the
shooting, did not free Combs of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``These defendants have a palpable contempt for the law,'' he
said, referring to Combs and his two codefendants, Anthony Jones
and Barrow, a rapper who performs under the name Shyne. ``A belief
that the law doesn't apply to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Combs' lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, dismissed Bogdanos' claims as
outrageous and baseless. He said that more than 30 witnesses would
testify that they did not see Combs with a gun that night and that
Combs and Lopez fled the club because they thought they had been
the victims of an assassination attempt. He accused the prosecutor
of distorting Lopez's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have interviewed Ms. Lopez, and she completely exonerated
Mr. Combs,'' Brafman said. ``I don't know what he's talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said in a statement that she was distressed by Bogdanos'
statements and, speaking of Combs, said that at no time did she see
him with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The charges and countercharges came during a hearing before
Acting Justice Charles H. Solomon of state Supreme Court, during
which Bogdanos argued for higher bail for Combs, Jones and Barrow.
All three have posted bail.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, whose bail is $10,000, and Jones, his bodyguard, whose
bail is $20,000, have been charged with two counts of illegal gun
possession. Barrow has been charged with attempted murder with bail
set at $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bogdanos also disclosed Thursday that Combs is under
investigation for crimes committed outside New York. He would not
specify the charges, but law enforcement officials speaking on the
condition of anonymity said that Combs was under investigation for
illegal weapons possession in Moline, Ill., a city of 43,000 near
the Iowa border. The charges date to when Combs performed a concert
there in 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In describing the Times Square incident, Bogdanos said that
Combs and Jones ran out of the club after the shooting and, along
with Lopez, got into a Lincoln Navigator and fled.
</P>
<P>
   Combs and his bodyguard ordered the driver to ``get out of
here,'' Bogdanos said, and then frantically tried to open two
secret compartments in the car. Unable to open the compartments,
Combs threw his gun out the right rear window and Jones placed his
gun at his feet before a police cruiser forced them to stop, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a police precinct only a few feet from an officer
later that night, Combs was heard offering to pay the driver,
Wardel Fenderson, $50,000 if he would take responsibility for the
gun, Bogdanos said. In a cell they shared later, Combs offered
Fenderson a ring Lopez had given him for his birthday as
``collateral'' for the bribe, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, defense lawyers attacked nearly every aspect
of the prosecutor's account.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said he would issue his decision on whether to raise the
bail at Combs' next court appearance, on Feb. 22. The judge agreed
to adjust the court schedule to allow Combs to attend the Grammy
Awards next week in Los Angeles and complete a European tour in
March.

 McCAIN ATTACKS UNIONS AND VOWS BETTER SCHOOLS 
 (See also McCAIN-NY) 
(rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ Repeatedly attacking teachers unions and
``self-serving union bosses,'' Sen. John McCain called Thursday for
an experimental program of school vouchers, for merit pay for
teachers and for judges who would allow voluntary prayer and the
posting of the Ten Commandments in schools.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's proposals were set out in an education speech in which
he said the nation must ``insist on high academic standards'' but
left it up to the states to devise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some believe that educational standards should be established
by the federal government,'' McCain said. ``I do not. Education
must remain under the control of state and local authority that is
closer and more responsive to the needs of parents and students.
States are better able to develop appropriate standards than a one
size fits all.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has been a maverick on issues like campaign finance or
tax-cutting, McCain stood squarely with the Republican Party on
education, calling for a sharp reduction in federal regulations, no
federal standards and for an experimental program of school
vouchers. While he spoke of local accountability, he gave no
indication of how he would measure or enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, McCain's chief rival for the Republican
presidential nomination, has proposed a loosening of federal
education regulations, but he would require in return that states
conduct annual testing of elementary and middle school students. He
would use a system of incentives and punishment for lack of
performance.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's education speech had once been scheduled to be
delivered before the New Hampshire primary and was then postponed.
Bush's supporters had pointed to McCain's failure to give a
full-scale education address as a sign that he was not serious
about a domestic issue at the top of voters' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday the Bush camp called McCain's proposals
insufficient to turn around poor student performance. The plan,
said Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman, ``has no accountability and
continues to allow federal dollars to follow failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush,'' McClellan said, ``has shown in Texas that
real education reform must include real accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Little in McCain's speech Thursday was new, and few details were
provided. McCain had already called for a three-year, $5.5 billion
test of school vouchers for one million students and for some kind
of merit pay for teachers. For the first time , he said he would
create a $500 million annual federal block grant program for
teacher testing and merit pay, leaving it to states to decide how
to use the money.
</P>
<P>
   McCain used his school voucher proposal to try to center himself
between Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush and I have a serious difference of opinion on
school choice,'' McCain said, saying his voucher program would not
use already existing public school money but money obtained by
closing corporate tax loopholes that help the sugar, oil and gas
and ethanol industries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed that economically disadvantaged students who
are supposed to be helped under the federal Title 1 program be
given a voucher option to switch schools if schools have failing
programs that they cannot reverse in three years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that Gore opposed vouchers, asserting that ``he
defends the status quo and reaps the money, the organization and
the votes of entrenched interests.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mistaking whom McCain was calling an entrenched
interest. Time and again he attacked teachers unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of this new century,'' he said, ``it's time
to break the grip of the education monopoly that serves the union
bosses at the expense of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also set himself apart from both Bush and Gore because he
would wrap most federal education money into a block grant to the
states, whereas, he said, ``they would continue to use federal
funds to require local communities to meet federally approved
standards and they would continue to allow bureaucrats to determine
how federal funds should be spent.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would ``insist that this money makes it to the
classroom and is not diverted to bureaucrats _ and that
accountability is measured not in federal paperwork, but by
improved performance.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCain was asked at a news conference afterward about what
guarantees there would be of performance, Lisa Graham Keegan,
Arizona's superintendent of public instruction, who was
accompanying him, tried to jump in to answer the question for him.
But McCain said, ``If the student performance goes down, all those
people will be thrown out of office by their voters.'' He was
apparently referring to state officials and school boards.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to nominate judges ``who don't divine from our
Constitution nonexistent prohibitions on basic rights'' including
posting the Ten Commandments and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.

SPORTS COLUMN: GOING HOME IS GOOD DEAL FOR JUNIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A collective sigh of relief was exhaled Thursday in the old
baseball town of Cincinnati _ and a good portion of Seattle, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wanted to see Ken Griffey Jr. suffer through the
incredible agony of another summer in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Junior wanted to jump teams from a mix of hometown pride,
boredom, National League nostalgia, hurt feelings and wanting to be
closer to his mansion in a golf enclave in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His escape has little to do with money. According to reports, he
will be playing for $116.5 million for the next nine years, which
is at least $30 million less than he could have bargained for from
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Junior cost himself a ton of money, but he is also
breaking the curve for Juan Gonzalez, Derek Jeter and his old pal
Alex Rodriguez. The union and the agents will not be amused, but
just call Junior the last romantic.
</P>
<P>
   He is returning not only to his hometown, but also to the site
of the first professional baseball team, the 1869 Red Stockings,
who still reverberate in that river town. Despite the changes the
owners inflict on baseball, the sport lives off its lush history;
going home is no small thing for Ken Griffey Jr. and his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   We all should be long past the feeling of cheap shock when we
discover that superstars move from team to team. Wayne Gretzky
played for four different teams, for goodness' sake. Roger Clemens
is on his third. Roberto Baggio has moved all over Italy, seeking a
coach who is not afraid of genius.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between Junior's bolt to freedom and other
runs to daylight by free agents is that Junior has a legitimate
agenda of playing in Cincinnati. He grew up there, his parents
still live there, and his father is a managerial candidate, now
more than ever, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   If Junior is truly energized by being in the same division with
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, this deal will also blot the memory of
a morose superstar swinging from his butt for more than a season.
</P>
<P>
   There are times, alas, when Junior does not enjoy simple
pleasures like whacking a ball over a fence, or skywalking to pull
back a home run. If he signs autographs for an hour and one
disappointed straggler calls him a chump, he feels the need to
explain. That is Junior.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it went wrong in Seattle. For a while, Junior felt the
team was not spending money to remain a contender. Then he worried
about the team not spending enough money on him. Then he brooded
about the long power alleys in the new ballpark that literally
brought light to Seattle baseball.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Junior was emotionally gone. The Mariners held a fan
fair last week and distributed Griffey shirts _ no, not with ``Free
Junior'' on them, but that was how he felt. One threatening letter
from a Seattle zip code to his home in Florida caused him to reason
that the town had closed against him.
</P>
<P>
   The general feeling in Seattle was a mystification over his
sadness, but there was also a great debt to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that Ken decides to go into the Hall of Fame as a
Mariner,'' the team's president, Chuck Armstrong, said Thursday.
``We might not have baseball here except for Ken, and we might not
have Safeco Field.''
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria of 1995 faded fast. Junior's wigginess in demanding
a trade with a year left on his contract may have stunned his own
agent, and Junior also cut into his value by saying he would never
play in New York. But avoiding the city of Steinbrenner and the
media hordes is surely worth tens of millions of dollars, no?
</P>
<P>
   Give Junior credit. He did not suffer one more year in Seattle
and then auction himself off to the highest bidder. With Atlanta
not interested right now, he committed to the town of Edd Roush,
Johnny Vander Meer, Ted Kluszewski, Pete Rose _ and Ken Griffey Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati is one of those small towns that cannot compete with
the big television markets, but there are other ways of making a
dollar. The Reds will have a new ballpark soon, and maybe Junior
will like this one better. Already, fans were buying Reds tickets
as well as jerseys where Griffey 24 could be imprinted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Seattle still has the Tan Duc Pho House up on Aurora,
the Northwest Crafts Center at the Seattle Center, the view of
Elliot Bay from Queen Anne Hill and bright summer evenings when the
Mariners will be in the gifted hands of Alex Rodriguez. Seattle
will also feel true communal joy knowing that Junior is finally
free, and, with any luck at all, maybe even happy.

BRADLEY ASSAILS GORE'S RECORD ON GUN CONTROL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bill Bradley attacked Vice President Al Gore's
record on gun control Thursday, citing his votes as early as 1976
and as recently as 1990, and saying that the National Rifle
Association once considered Gore a poster child for its cause.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to students at El Sereno Middle School and anti-gun
violence activists at University Synagogue, Bradley suggested that
Gore didn't take gun control seriously until 12 students and a
teacher were gunned down at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a real choice in this election,'' Bradley
said after listening to the stories of several parents whose
children were killed by gun violence in Los Angeles. ``I have
always supported common sense gun control throughout 18 years in
the United States Senate. This is not an issue that I came to after
seeing television pictures of Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore visited a county hospital in Los Angeles, his campaign
responded to Bradley's attacks on the vice president's gun control
record with a handout that claimed that Bradley, a former New
Jersey senator, was trying to ''manufacture a difference'' on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The handout stated that the two men essentially agree on gun
control but that Bradley has not proposed broader crime control
issues proposed by Gore, such as plans to help communities crack
down on gangs and continued funding for new police.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also said that Bradley had not joined the vice
president in endorsing the raising of the minimum age for handgun
possession from 18 to 21 and increasing penalties for selling guns
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Los Angeles promoting his health care proposal at a
hospital. In a striking counterpoint, his motorcade was held up
temporarily because of a shooting at a fast food restaurant nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley pointed out that in the current issue of Time magazine,
NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre is quoted as saying,
``We could have made Al Gore NRA Man of the Year _ every single
vote. It's the most spectacular conversion I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did vote against several gun-control bills while serving as
a congressman and senator from Tennessee, and in 1990 came out
against an amendment that would have prohibited the sale of
large-capacity ammunition magazines and banned several assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The language of that amendment became law under the Clinton-Gore
administration, and Gore credits Sarah Brady, the wife of President
Reagan's wounded press secretary, for changing his mind on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Lehane acknowledged that Gore's record in
Congress bears little resemblance to his gun-control stance of
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``His position changed to match the changing times,'' Lehane
said, noting the proliferation of gun violence in the past decade.
``The public looks for leaders who respond to the changing times.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bradley, Gore now supports licensing handguns, banning
``Saturday Night Specials,'' the cheap handguns often used in
crimes, establishing waiting periods for purchasing guns and
limiting gun purchases to one per month. Both also support
requiring child-safety locks on guns and both want to close
loopholes that allow looser restrictions on guns purchased at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore proposes beginning licensing with new handguns,
Bradley says a much bolder response is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should register and license all handguns in
America. Not some. All,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the candidates continued to squabble on where and
when to schedule debates, with each side blaming the other.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed debating twice a week in lieu of television
ads. Bradley has agreed to debate once a week leading up to the
March 7 primaries, but has so far refused to link the debates to
eliminating ads.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Bradley campaign will launch a new ad in key primary
states featuring former basketball great Michael Jordan endorsing
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Quinnipiac Poll had the vice president leading
Bradley 56 percent to 32 percent in New York state, where Bradley
played professional ball. Last November the same survey had Gore
ahead of Bradley 44 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Gore appeared on ``The Tonight Show'' with
Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Leno if Gore wanted to go one-on-one with Bradley in
basketball, Gore noted that he played college basketball and then
quipped: ``The difference between me and Bill Bradley is I didn't
make a big deal about my career.''

BRADLEY TRIES TO LINK GORE TO THE NRA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley sharply questioned Vice
President Al Gore's commitment to gun control Thursday, saying Gore
had a voting record in Congress that could make him a ``poster
child'' for the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   In emotional events at a synagogue and at a middle school in
East Los Angeles, where parents told of losing children to gun
violence, Bradley said the vice president was a recent convert to
gun control who, while in Congress, had repeatedly voted against
firearms restrictions, including a 1990 ban on certain assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real choice on this issue,'' Bradley told more than
100 students at El Sereno Middle School in East Los Angeles, a
community ravaged by gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue that I came to after seeing television
pictures of Columbine,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that I believed as a matter of fundamental
principle throughout my public life. Al Gore has not always done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign released documents showing that Gore, his
lone rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, received
high grades from the NRA in the early 1980s when he was a House
member from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The documents showed that Gore voted against a federal
registration system for gun owners, against a 14-day waiting period
for buying new handguns, for allowing the sale of guns across state
lines and for cutting the budget of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, which regulates gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since being elected to Congress in 1976, Al Gore has been
there each and every time sportsmen and gun owners have needed a
friend,'' an NRA scorecard from 1984 said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said the vice president's ``view
on gun control has changed'' since he represented a conservative
rural district in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane ascribed this change to rising gun violence across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun issue itself changed,'' Lehane said. ``Times change
and solutions change.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Gore in Los Angeles said he voted against a 1990
amendment to ban 12 types of assault weapons because the measure
might have killed an underlying bill to ban nine types of assault
weapons, a bill that Gore supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned the characteristic odor of losing campaigns,''
Attorney General William Lockyer of California, a supporter of
Gore, said of Bradley's attack. ``I'm sorry to see his campaign
fortunes have got him into a sour mood and into attack mode.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several similarities in the two men's gun control
proposals. Both would ban the cheap handguns known as ``Saturday
Night Specials,'' require trigger locks, limit handgun purchases to
one a month and make background checks mandatory for gun buyers at
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would require that all handguns be registered and that
all handgun owners take a safety course and get a license. But Gore
does not call for registering guns and would require photo licenses
only for new buyers of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposes banning gun dealers from operating in
residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Gore goes beyond Bradley in proposing tougher penalties for
people who use guns in crimes and for dealers who sell guns
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing Gore well ahead of Bradley among traditional
Democrats, Bradley has been trying to draw sharper contrasts with
the vice president by attacking him on a variety of issues of
importance to Democratic voters, including abortion rights,
education and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate two weeks ago Bradley said that National Right to
Life, an anti-abortion group, had given Gore an 84 percent positive
rating in his early years in Congress when he opposed Medicaid
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bradley ridiculed Gore as asserting that registering
all handguns and licensing all gun owners would be impractical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to you, What if that attitude was held by Franklin
Roosevelt in the 1930s when he looked out at the country and saw
the elderly destitute, in need of some pension?'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the essence of leadership is to take on that which is
considered too hard to do, and make it happen. That's what leaders
do, as opposed to politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's events Thursday were intended to evoke powerful
feelings of grief. At El Sereno Middle School, parents gripped
large pictures of children killed by gunfire while describing their
personal trauma.
</P>
<P>
   One mother held a miniature coffin, snapping the lid shut to
punctuate her point.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is clearly aware that gun control has been particularly
popular among California's Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   He unveiled his gun control agenda in Los Angeles last summer.
And Thursday, he repeatedly noted that gun violence was a leading
cause of death in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people killed in California by gun violence
than by automobile accidents,'' he said. ``And that's not just
because the freeways are great.''

UCLA BACK IN MOTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the UCLA Bruins finish fast, if they make the
NCAA Tournament, survive a round or two and depart with their heads
held high, they might look back on this week as the turning point.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's victory over USC, the Bruins (13-8, 4-6) executed
their offense with unprecedented efficiency. They were aggressive,
they moved the ball, they moved without the ball, and they shot 68
percent in the second half of an 83-78 win.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they eliminated the commotion by returning to the
motion _ the motion offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins ran their structured 1-4 offense, which they've used
all season, for about six possessions against the Trojans.
Otherwise, they used the motion, a freewheeling attack that
emphasizes athleticism and improvisation and creates the
pickup-game atmosphere the Bruins love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just let them play,'' said UCLA assistant Jim Saia, who
oversees the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a review of the recent developments:
</P>
<P>
   -On Feb. 3, after a stagnant first half against Stanford, the
Bruins switched to the motion offense. It was their first extensive
use of the motion all season.
</P>
<P>
   -The Bruins practiced for an hour on Feb. 4, but the emphasis
was on shooting, not the offense. As a result, they were motionless
against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   -Saia and coach Steve Lavin spent several hours refining the
motion offense Monday and Tuesday. They also inserted reserve point
guard Ryan Bailey into the starting lineup, which reduced Earl
Watson's ball-handling responsibilities and allowed him to attack
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   -Against USC, Watson scored 22 points and had seven assists and
no turnovers _ one of the finest games of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference (Wednesday night) was that we worked on the
motion a lot more,'' Watson said. ``This was the first week we've
done that. We put it in against Stanford, but we didn't do too much
with it (before the Cal game). It was a great adjustment. I'm glad
we've put it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediate impact: Junior Rico Hines returned Wednesday after
missing four games because of a sprained toe. In 13 savvy minutes,
Hines had two steals, one assist and no turnovers. He also was on
the floor during UCLA's rally late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does all the little things,'' Lavin said. ``He takes
charges, he sets screens, and he hits the open man. He understands
that less is more.''
</P>
<P>
   Help from their foes: It's been a good week for the Bruins _ in
part because of their victory over USC, in part because their
opponents recorded several impressive victories that should help
UCLA's power rating.
</P>
<P>
   DePaul beat UNC-Charlotte and South Florida to improve to 16-7.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue beat Iowa (which then beat Ohio State) and No.6 Michigan
State to improve to 16-7.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-game losing streak, North Carolina has won four of
its last five. The Tar Heels (15-9) beat Clemson and North Carolina
State earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Big Game: Jason Kapono's 27 points against USC were the most by
a UCLA freshman since J.R. Henderson scored 28 against Arizona in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono, who leads UCLA in scoring (16.2 ppg), is on pace for the
second-highest freshman scoring average in school history. Don
MacLean averaged 18.6 points in 1989. (Note: NCAA rules prohibited
Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton from playing as freshmen.)

 &HT;    Reds future lies in new stadium and superstar player
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Let it be known as The House That Junior Built _
this bright, shining, 45,000-seat, $297-million structure coming to
the riverfront.
</P>
<P>
   It's due to be erected in 2003, but may not arrive until 2004 or
2005. No matter. Cincinnati Reds fans will wait patiently for Ken
Griffey Jr.'s playground.
</P>
<P>
   With a short right-field porch for the power-hitting Griffey,
the possibilities for what this superstar can achieve are endless,
even staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Just think: Mark McGwire's single-season home run record of 70
will be within reach. So will Hank Aaron's all-time home run record
of 755.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Griffey will be chasing both marks. He reached
the 56-homer plateau twice _ in 1997 and 1998 _ during his 11-year
career with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   And with 398 career blasts, he's 357 away from Aaron. That means
he needs to average more than 39 per season during his nine-year,
$112.5 million deal. The club holds an option for a 10th season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I look forward to it?'' Griffey said when asked about an
assault on the record books. ``I don't set goals. I never set
goals. What I try to do is just keep adding on, and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you set a goal and then you reach it, and there are three
or four weeks left in the season, then you've got to try to set a
new goal. I just try to keep adding on, and adding on.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the fans, who can't wait to watch him flag
down fly balls in center field, swing the bat, race around the base
paths and cross home plate. What does he have to say to all the
fans who bleed Cincinnati red?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be home,'' he said. ``I've been in Seattle
for 11 years. Now I get to wear the uniform I first put on and
watched my dad play in.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey felt a little uncomfortable when asked about the new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people of Cincinnati's stadium. It's not my
stadium,'' he said, pointing out that Hamilton County taxpayers had
already voted in favor of a publicly funded facility before his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   But his contract speaks of high hopes for a successful marriage
between ball player and ball park. Reds Chief Operating Officer
John Allen said more than 50 percent of Griffey's deal is deferred
over 16 years beyond the ninth year of the contract. So the plan is
to fill the stadium with fans _ and victories _ and let the revenue
flow.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Bowden said he wouldn't have made the deal
``if we did not have the ability to sign Mr. Griffey to a long-term
contact, because we didn't want just a one-year rent-a-player. We
didn't want a Greg Vaughn, Ron Gant or Kevin Mitchell. We wanted a
permanent superstar in Cincinnati to open our new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds owner Carl H. Lindner presented Griffey with cuff links,
bearing the inscription: ``Only in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In these times, where big markets and big money seem to steal
the stars, it speaks so much of Ken's character that he has chosen
to come back home where he belongs,'' Lindner said. ``The future of
the Reds is Ken and our new stadium. It can't be more exciting.''

 Problems Could Derail Speeding Biotech Industry  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If high tech has been the engine driving California's booming
economy, biotech and its cousins, the medical device industry and
academic research, are gearing up to drive the state's next growth
spurt.
<P>
   Biomedical employers created 212,000 jobs in the state in 1998,
second only to the electronics equipment industry, according to two
new reports. Furthermore, the Bay Area remains the largest
biomedical center in the state and the nation, with 747 companies
and research facilities providing 85,000 jobs in the region.
</P>
<P>
   That optimistic message is dimmed somewhat by a third report
that cautions that transportation gridlock, high housing costs and
cheaper infrastructure costs elsewhere in the nation could check
growth here in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The strong role biotech plays in the state and local economies
is underscored in two reports released yesterday by the California
Healthcare Institute, a biomedical industry lobby group based in La
Jolla (San Diego County).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 2,500 companies in California with more than $4
billion in exports,'' CHI President David Gollaher said in an
interview. ``This is an enormously powerful industry in terms of
job creation, capital formation and exports.'' Gollaher yesterday
presented the report, which surveys seven biomedical clusters from
San Diego to Sacramento, at the South San Francisco headquarters of
Genentech Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to celebrate what California and the Bay Area
have contributed in creating the biotech industry and bringing it
to maturity,'' added Susan Hellmann, Genentech's chief medical
officer and a member of the CHI board.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst the celebration, however, a third recent report,
commissioned by two economic development groups, warns that the Bay
Area's biomedical industry could choke on its own success _ unless
the region's leaders find a cure for insane housing prices and
miserable commute patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to be optimistic given all we have going for
us,'' said John Martin, chief executive of Gilead Sciences in
Foster City and industry leader. ``But it's also hard from where I
sit to see the solution to these problems of congestion and housing
prices that come with success.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the three reports paint the clearest picture yet of
the biomedical research industry in California, and show how the
Bay Area stacks up against competing regions inside and outside the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key findings in the CHI reports:
</P>
<P>
   _Biomedical jobs pay even more than high tech, with CHI fixing
the industry's average salary at $64,300, compared with $58,000 for
high tech, the latter figure according to a 1998 report from the
American Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   _Salaries within the biomedical industry ranged from $71,212 at
biotech firms, which employ many scientists, to $36,346 for medical
laboratories, which employ many technicians.
</P>
<P>
   _The Bay Area has more biomedical employees than the next two
clusters in the state (Los Angeles and Orange County) combined.
</P>
<P>
   _Exports of surgical and medical equipment, lab instruments and
biopharmaceuticals totaled $4.2 billion in 1998. By contrast, about
$68 billion was generated by high-tech hardware and software
exports, according to the AEA.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith, an economist with the California Department of
Finance in Sacramento, put the CHI findings against the backdrop of
the state's large economy. ``A few billion dollars in exports and
thousands of high-paying jobs are certainly feathers in
California's cap,'' he said. ``But they have to be considered in
the context of a trillion dollar economy with $110 billion in
exports.''
</P>
<P>
   The CHI report dwells on the enormous role academic laboratories
have played in creating the industry. Stanford has spawned 64
biomedical firms that have been founded by university faculty,
alumni or technology. That total is one more than the University of
California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at San Francisco has helped create
56 firms by the same measures, the report notes.
</P>
<P>
   Because university research plays such an integral role in the
state's biomedical success _ and because it has boosted the
industry's employment rolls, CHI included academic researchers into
its employment totals. Academics made up 19 percent of California's
biomedical workforce and 15 percent of the Bay Area total.
</P>
<P>
   The report hints at some of the unique characteristics of
California's various biomedical centers. Orange County and Los
Angeles, for instance, are dominated by medical device firms that
make robotic surgery systems and other complex instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devices are engineering-based, and that makes sense given that
the previous industry in that region was aerospace engineering,''
Gollaher said. ``That's where the talent was.''
</P>
<P>
   Several complimentary factors are behind the growth of the
biomedical industry in the Bay Area. It began with the confluence
of research from Stanford, UC San Francisco and the University of
California at Berkeley, which gave rise to firms like Cetus, Chiron
and Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Proximity to venture capital centers in Menlo Park and Palo
Alto, combined with executive talent produced by the early
startups, helped create the next wave of companies. Today, Chiron
and Genentech alumni run dozens of Bay Area firms.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the region has benefited from the
cross-pollinization between Silicon Valley and the biological
world. Firms such as PE Biosystems in Foster City and Affymetrix in
Santa Clara have blended computing know-how and biological
techniques to create instruments that analyze DNA or automate
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Other local firms like Incyte Pharmaceuticals in Palo Alto and
Hyseq in Sunnyvale are using these new DNA analysis tools to
understand genes _ thus making the Bay Area a player in the new
field of genomics, the study of how genes influence human
development and disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bay Area can't rest on its biomedical laurels. That
warning came in the third report commissioned by the San Francisco
Partnership and the Bay Area Council. This report found that
Northern California compared unfavorably in some regards with
biotech clusters in North Carolina, Massachusetts or Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Former A.T. Kearney consultant Steve DeMello, who surveyed
biotech leaders nationwide to prepare the study, said that although
the Bay Area was still perceived as the national leader in
biomedical research, it was deemed too expensive for
bio-manufacturing, when compared with such areas as the Research
Triangle Park in North Carolina or Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bay Area startups may be forced to grow elsewhere
after they reach a certain size, the report suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Mara Brazer, managing director of the San Francisco Partnership,
said that finding may be more perception than reality, given that
Genentech was able to open a plant in Vacaville, where land is
cheaper and yet managers can still drive over from its headquarters
in South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Brazer said the Kearney survey, which rates Boston a better
place than the Bay Area to start a biomedical business, was also
done before San Francisco broke ground on UC San Francisco's new
Mission Bay campus. That development is designed to create a zone
where firms can locate research or manufacturing right next to the
university. Brazer said Mission Bay will give San Francisco the
sort of business ``incubator'' the Boston area has created around
MIT and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area Council President Sunne McPeak, who co-sponsored the
Kearney report with Brazer, said the comparative study drove home
the point that although the local biomedical industry doesn't need
special favors to thrive, it does need political leaders to do
something about the region's transportation gridlock and
high-housing prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not biotech specific issues,'' said Brian
Cunningham, chief operating officer at Rigel Pharmaceuticals in
South San Francisco. ``But the leadership has to address those two
issues or we'll have to give up on the Bay Area in the long run.''

SPOTLIGHT TURNS ON UGLY SIDE OF POLITICKING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ With the battle for the Republican
presidential nomination turning bitter, a distraught woman at one
of Sen. John McCain's campaign events Thursday said her teen-age
son had taken a call from a pollster who portrayed McCain as a
``cheat and a liar and a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Donna Duren, rose from the audience after McCain had
delivered a speech in Spartanburg and told him how she had had to
answer questions from her son Chris about the ``slime that was
going on'' last year during the Lewinsky scandal. So she was
gratified, Duren said, that he had found a hero in the senator.
</P>
<P>
   But she said her son was almost in tears on Wednesday night
after he got the call from the pollster. ``I am so mad,'' she said,
``I was so livid last night I couldn't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously emotional, McCain said ``the disillusionment of a
young boy'' was something that ``any of them _ even as crass and
base as some of the people who get into this business become _
would be ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, at a news conference, McCain demanded that Bush end
``push-polling,'' the campaign technique Duren was describing, as
well as negative television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this week that the McCain camp had
contended that Bush was using a pollster to do push-polling, a
practice in which questions are intended to spread negative
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling on my good friend George Bush to stop this now,''
McCain said. ``Stop this now. He comes from a better family. He
knows better than this. He should stop it. I'll pull down every
negative ad that I have. I want this thing stopped and get this
campaign back on the level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was also campaigning across South Carolina, said he
would fire anyone on his campaign who had conducted a poll
portraying McCain as a liar and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't accept that kind of phone calling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides released the script they said their callers were
following. It invokes Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and cites Bush's
victory in the Delaware primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's in South Carolina, working hard and stressing his
message of reform with results,'' the script says. ``Unfortunately,
the race has turned ugly. John McCain has TV ads comparing Governor
Bush to Bill Clinton. Senator Thurmond said, `There is no excuse
for the negative ads.' He called it `sad' and `the sort of message
that the people of this country have rejected.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be misled by McCain's negative campaign tactics,'' the
callers are to continue. ``Please support George W. Bush because he
has a strong message that unites our party, and he will restore
integrity to the White House.'' All of this leads to a question
about whether the person telephoned will support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's primary is crucial for both campaigns and has
turned into a heated battle on the stump and the airwaves. McCain
has to win the Feb. 19 contest to show that his huge victory in New
Hampshire was not a one-state phenomenon. Bush is under equal
pressure to rebound here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pressed his own line of attack Thursday, stepping up his
effort to sully the senator's image as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that McCain had transferred $2 million from his Senate
campaign account to his presidential fund. He then cited a speech
McCain had made in the Senate in 1990 charging that rolling over
money from one account to another was a practice used to intimidate
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say something, it's another thing to do it
in politics,'' Bush said. ``I want to make sure that people
understand that a campaign funding reformer must be held to high
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has tried to portray himself as a new kind of politician,
above the usual campaign practices. And he has accused the Bush
campaign and the Washington establishment of pulling out all the
stops to defeat him.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged Thursday that he had learned lessons from
Clinton's campaigns, particularly the need to answer charges fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to respond,'' he said. ``You've got to have people
ready with access to all the information as soon as the phone
rings, and if you don't get into that same news cycle, you've got a
problem.''

BRADLEY GAINS A SUPERSTAR FOR HIS ADS: MICHAEL JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley got a big lift from an
old friend Thursday, announcing that the former Chicago Bulls
superstar Michael Jordan would appear in a 30-second television
commercial for the Bradley campaign that will begin running in
several important primary states on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jordan and his wife each contributed $1,000 to Bradley
last year, Jordan has never publicly endorsed a political candidate
until now, aides to Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides say the endorsement will significantly help
Bradley's name recognition among blacks and younger voters, two
important target groups for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had a Hall of Fame career of his own with the New York
Knicks from 1967 until 1977, and has received many endorsements
from basketball greats of his era. But he is not well known among
younger sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides stressed Thursday that Jordan was a revered figure
for more than his basketball prowess. ``He brought an integrity to
his play that speaks to deeper values,'' said Eric Hauser,
Bradley's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The ad will feature Jordan speaking directly into a camera and
praising Bradley's positions on issues including health care and
gun control. It will run in at least four states that hold
primaries on March 7: California, New York, Ohio and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's endorsement was not entirely a surprise, because he has
been friendly with Bradley for years. Both are also very close to
Phil Jackson, the former Bulls coach who played with Bradley on the
Knicks. But there had been some doubts about whether Jordan would
be willing to endanger his lucrative promotion contracts by
publicly helping a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that may have made it easier for him to endorse
Bradley, Jordan recently was made president of the Washington
Wizards basketball team, whose owner, Abe Pollin, is a major
fund-raiser for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Bradley said Jordan filmed the commercial two
months ago, before he joined the Wizards.

 &HT;    Will Griffey Sr. manage Reds?
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Ken Griffey Jr. was only a few minutes into his
first press conference as a member of the Cincinnati Reds when he
suggested that his father would be the ideal candidate as the
team's next manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the game for 30-some years and I think he's
proved he deserves a chance to manage,'' Junior said shortly after
he was introduced at a packed media gathering. ``The decision (to
pursue the managerial job) will be up to him, but hopefully it will
happen and I can send (son) Trey into his office and get red pop
like I used to do when I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior was a clubhouse regular during the eight years (1974-81)
his father spent with the Reds as a player.
</P>
<P>
   Senior, who will be 50 in May, is starting his fourth season as
a coach with the Reds. He refused to talk about his managerial
plans, saying, ``No speaka de English'' when the subject was
broached.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Bowden said it was ridiculous to insinuate
that Junior had been given any assurances that his father was next
in line to manage the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was never even mentioned in our discussions,'' Bowden
said. ``Junior has too much class to even mention that. Jack McKeon
is our manager.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon took the Reds to within one victory of the playoffs last
season and was National League manager of the year, but Bowden
waited almost a month after the season ended before signing him to
a one-year contract extension with a modest raise of $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's press conference, it was clear that Junior was
sincere in his expressed desire to play for Cincinnati in part
because of his relationship with his father.
</P>
<P>
   When he slipped on a Reds' uniform shirt, he said, ``The last
time I put one of these on was in a father-son game. I think I was
eight years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior then offered one of several injections: ``And you beat
us, 12-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior: ``I hope I have the same luck as my father did in
winning some championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior: ``Luck?''
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, Senior discussed the pride he has in his
30-year-old son. ``He came here because this is the place that
makes him happiest. I'm just proud to have a son who makes
decisions based on what makes him and his family the happiest.''

 Digital Devices Generate a Buzz  &HT;     By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Take two humble household objects _ a picture frame and a radio.
<P>
   Add Internet connectivity, a simple interface and electronics.
And don't forget the hefty price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Voila _ you have created The Future, as envisioned by digital
chic thinkers: an Internet radio and a digital photo frame.
</P>
<P>
   That's the recipe two Bay Area firms have followed in whipping
up devices that are among the first wave of ``information
appliances'' _ digital gadgets that fulfill a single function but
aim to do it extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is the opposite of the soup-to-nuts, feature-laden
formula used by PC-makers. Simplicity, ease of use and freedom from
PCs' technical snafus will attract consumers, the rationale goes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains to be seen whether consumers will want to
shell out $300 _ the estimated cost for the radio and for the
frame. And there are other ``gotchas'' _ right now, the information
appliances require a fair amount of tech savvy and a tethered
Internet connection, and still have some kinks to work out.
</P>
<P>
   The Kerbango Internet Radio from Cupertino's Kerbango Inc. and
the StoryBox picture frame from Santa Clara's Weave Innovations
were served up to the public at Demo 2000, a trade show in Indian
Wells (Riverside County).
</P>
<P>
   Several other striking examples of information appliances also
premiered at the show: a wireless e-mail reader that understands
spoken commands and can take and send dictation; tablets and
terminals with full Web browsing and e-mail; and a kitchen fridge
computer for ordering groceries, checking recipes and viewing video
cooking lessons.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech mavens have been hyping these kinds of products for
years and showing ``concept demos'' of them. What's different now
is that some of the products are real _ both the radio and picture
frame are due out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And the computing landscape has changed enough to make info
appliances feasible. Miniaturization, falling costs, and more
widespread and faster Net access all make these devices feasible
for the mass market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people want Internet access and don't need the
complexity, additional functionality or cost of a PC,'' said Bryan
Ma, an analyst at IDC.
</P>
<P>
   The research firm expects the information appliance market to
explode to 89 million units, or $17.8 billion, by 2004. Last year,
consumers spent $2.4 billion to buy 11 million information
appliances, largely TV set-top boxes and gaming consoles, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
   Information appliances show ``how the Net can add value to other
types of products and create new categories of hybrid products,''
said Ross Rubin, vice president of research development at Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, tech companies seem to be aiming for their own form of
fusion cuisine, seeing what amalgamations will catch on. Among
those introduced this week:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Kerbango Internet Radio. &LR;  Benny Goodman would recognize it in a
New York minute, despite the chartreuse, royal blue and charcoal
color scheme. It's got tuner knobs, preset buttons and a retro,
stylized look, down to the typeface that says ``Kerbango.'' And
Goodman could easily operate the Kerbango Internet Radio: It picks
up regular AM/FM stations, and has standard clock and alarm
functions. But plug it in a phone line with an Internet connection
and it also picks up 4,000 Web radio stations from around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   A dial wouldn't work for tuning in to into  &LR; that many radio
stations. So the radio has an LCD pad that lists categories, such
as music, sports, news, and then subcategories such as classical,
folk, pop, jazz and rap.
</P>
<P>
   The radio is two-way. If you see an offer for a CD or concert
tickets that you are interested in, you can press a ``buy'' button
to order it. If you don't want your kids ordering unlimited CDs,
you can impose limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Internet radio is going to be really big is to bust
outside of the PC,'' said Kerbango chief executive Jim Gable.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerbango doesn't quite hasn't  &LR; ``bust outside'' all
limitations. It's not portable and it requires an Internet
connection. That means that folks from the Goodman generation might
not be geared up to adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _StoryBox Connected Frame. &LR;  It looks just like the wooden picture
frame sitting on your grandmother's dresser. But the family photo
inside is pixels, not paper. And as you watch, a snapshot from
July's vacation turns into a photo of the kids at Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet-connected, digital picture frame holds up to
thirty-six 6-by-5-inch shots and can cycle through them on any
schedule you like. It can intersperse the photos with news, sports,
weather and sports scores, pulled off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a digital camera, you can transfer photos by putting
the camera's memory card in the back of the frame. If you use a
film camera, any Kodak photofinisher can digitize your photos and
upload them to the StoryBox Web site. (Kodak owns a minority stake
in Weave Innovations.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that, at the push of a button, you can send your
latest snapshots to Grandma or anyone else on your ``buddy list.''
Of course, your buddies also have to have a StoryBox frame.
</P>
<P>
   Another button lets you output photos to your home printers.
</P>
<P>
   Weave Innovations plans to enlist partners to manufacture and
distribute the frame. It says it has one big manufacturer already
signed up, which will have the frame in stores this summer at $299,
and many more who will have versions out for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Besides buying the frame, users pay a monthly connection fee of
$5 to $7, which gives them access to the StoryBox site, where they
can store entire albums' worth of photos.
</P>
<P>
   The price is a big hurdle, observers said. At $100, the StoryBox
would sell well, said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information
Group. But at its current $300, only a handful of wealthy tech
lovers would go for it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _CyberGenie.  &LR; Speech recognition firm Lernout &AMP; Hauspie decked out
a suite at Demo 2000 with futuristic-looking brushed aluminum
furniture and a spiraling red orb mobile. But the most futuristic
innovation in it was the CyberGenie, a metal gizmo the size of a
hot dog bun.
</P>
<P>
   Technical demonstrator Gary Saxer turned it on and a synthesized
female voice, sounding a bit like a robotic Sinead O'Connor, said,
``Ready to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   He flipped out an LCD screen on the side and said ``Check e-mail
summaries.'' The wireless device connected to the Internet and
displayed a familiar-looking e-mail in-box on the screen.
``Sinead'' proceeded to recite aloud the e-mail senders and their
message subject lines. When Saxer wanted to hear the entire text,
he said ``Read message.'' When he wanted to respond, he said
``Reply,'' dictated a message _ which the device transcribed almost
accurately _ and said ``Send.''
</P>
<P>
   No wires, no keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGenie can also provide weather and stock updates, and
connect to e-commerce sites for shopping on the go.
</P>
<P>
   L&AMP;H came to Demo hoping to generate a splash that would lead to
a manufacturer stepping into to produce the device.
</P>
<P>
   Although the product generated phenomenal ``buzz'' among the
wirehead attendees, some analysts remained skeptical. ``It's an
interesting idea but I'm not convinced it will be successful,
primarily because dictating back messages has not tested well (in
accuracy),'' Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during a demo, CyberGenie did fine in responding to
commands such as ``What's the weather?'' but was a little shakier
in transcribing _ substituting ``into rested'' for ``interested.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Be terminals. &LR;  Cupertino's Be Inc., after failing to find a
foothold in the market for desktop operating systems, is
repositioning its software as a platform for ``media-rich
information appliances,'' according to founder and chief executive
Jean-Louis Gassee.
</P>
<P>
   At Demo, it showed off several prototypes developed by various
manufacturers running the BeIA software. The Compaq Clipper, a
small terminal with full Web and e-mail access, should go into
trials in Europe and North America next quarter. If it comes to
market, it's likely to cost under $200 _ and possibly less, if
Internet service providers or other online companies decide to
subsidize it as a lure for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Be also showed National Semiconductor's wireless ``WebPAD,'' a
3-pound device the size of a standard 8.5-inch-by-11-inch notebook
with a touchscreen that lets users surf the Internet, send e-mail
and shop online.
</P>
<P>
   Be also showed a VCR-size d &LR; box that could act as a jukebox for
storing and playing Internet and CD tunes, and a kitchen-fridge
computer tablet that a Web grocer could provide to customers to
streamline ordering and perform related tasks, such as look up
recipes and cooking tips.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst thought Be was reaching a bit. ``The idea of a
tablet that sits on your fridge just because it has a magnet on the
back is not that well - &LR; integrated,'' said Rubin. ``The core
functionality of the product needs to make sense.''

 Web Sites Beef Up Security _ Excite Attacked  &HT;     By Henry Norr and Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Web-site managers continued yesterday to bolster their defenses
against hacker attacks, but with no airtight solution in sight,
attention is shifting to measures network administrators elsewhere
on the Internet can take to nip cybervandalism in the bud.
<P>
   No major new assaults were reported yesterday, but Excite.com,
the fifth-busiest Web site, revealed that it was the target of an
attack on Wednesday evening similar to those that shut down half a
dozen high-profile sites earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Excite attack began at 7 p.m. Wednesday and lasted about one
hour, according to spokeswoman Kelly Distefano. The flood of data
clogged the Redwood City company's main site at www.excite.com,
cutting traffic to about 50 percent of normal, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Excite technicians managed to keep the site from going down
completely, she said, because they were on alert in the wake of the
attacks that shut down rival portal Yahoo and other sites earlier.
Distefano acknowledged, however, that the technicians were unable
to stop the attack until it ended by itself about an hour after it
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we could do to prevent it, but there was
just too much information'' streaming in from the Web, she said.
Yahoo said its technicians, too, have been busy adding new security
features to its site, such as filters designed to weed out false
Internet addresses, such as those used in the attack that shut the
popular portal down for three hours on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither portal would provide technical details about its
beefed-up security measures. ``We don't want to give information
away that would challenge whoever is doing this to try to do it
some more,'' said Yahoo spokeswoman Diane Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say that all Internet companies are on alert at
this point,'' said David Henke, chief information officer at Palo
Alto's AltaVista, another leading portal. In addition to technical
measures, he said, the company has been instructing its technicians
to keep a watchful eye for suspicious surges in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But both Web-site managers and Internet experts agreed that no
site, no matter how vigilant, can prevent vandals from sending
floods of bogus data to obstruct legitimate traffic; at best they
can limit the effectiveness and shorten the duration of such
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's virtually nothing that can be done on a standard Web
server to prevent these kinds of attacks,'' said Dennis Nugent,
vice president of security at AboveNet, a San Jose Internet
backbone company that hosts eBay, one of the targets of this week's
attacks, and other large Web servers, in addition to linking
smaller ISPs to the Internet's primary trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the data packets hackers are using
to clog target sites are also used for routine communications, such
as determining whether another computer is online and active, or
opening up communications with a Web server.
</P>
<P>
   When such packets are turned into an offensive weapon, the
responsibility for detecting the problem and blocking the assault
lies mainly with the companies that manage the backbone of the
Internet, the high-capacity data pipes that link local networks
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backbone providers that have large routers need to improve
their filtering so they can stop this kind of traffic before it
reaches the target site,'' AboveNet's Nugent said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Internet providers noted potential problems with that
approach. Jonathon cq  &LR; Plonka, vice president of IP &LR;  ( &LR; Internet
protocol) &LR;  engineering at Sunnyvale's GlobalCenter, another
Internet backbone provider and the company that hosts Yahoo's Web
server, agreed that ``the large ISP has a special responsibility
because our pipes are so big that they could flood anybody.'' But
he added that there's a delicate balance between preventing attacks
and keeping networks open for traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to stop every person who's going through a door,
the line's going to move a lot slower,'' Plonka said. ``Sometimes
you can break things by fixing them. We don't want to slow down the
Internet, and we don't want to break the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller Internet service providers in particular cautioned that
it is unfair to expect them to shoulder the main burden of
preventing attacks. ``To ask the ISPs to do all the work is
ridiculous,'' said Jason Zigmont, a board member of the Internet
Service Providers' Consortium, a trade group that has about 350
members. ``That's like asking ISPs to filter every piece of e-mail
for viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   ISPC President William Sommers, who is also president of a local
company that runs a small Internet service called San Francisco
Online, said many of the thousands of ISPs throughout the world
have taken steps to make sure they are not helping the hackers.
</P>
<P>
   But he said most, especially smaller ISPs, are busy enough
trying to make sure their operation is functioning smoothly and
don't have the resources to add more switches and processing power
that would filter more potential hacker data.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers, AboveNet's Nugent and other experts agreed on one
thing, though: Corporations, universities and even government
agencies whose computers have been or could be used to launch
attacks need to take more responsibility for preventing such abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Nugent said, all network managers should
scour their machines to make sure malicious software programs
haven't already been planted on them, waiting to act on a future
signal from a hacker. Yesterday both the FBI and the CERT
Coordination Center, a federally funded center that monitors
threats to the Internet, offered free software to search for the
surreptitious code.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Nugent again called on network administrators
everywhere to tighten security on their computers to prevent
hackers from penetrating them in the first place.

ADVERTISING: DOT-COMS AND VALENTINE'S DAY GIFTS AND SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deluge of advertising spending by dot-coms did not end with
the Christmas shopping season or the Super Bowl. Instead, scores of
e-commerce entrepreneurs have been making Valentine's Day the next
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the Internet start-ups are defying predictions of a
big shakeout that had been expected to substantially lower demand
for commercial time and ad space after the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether consumers go online, watch TV, listen to the radio, pass
by billboards or read magazines and newspapers, they are again
being flooded with holiday pitches, this time replete with hearts
and roses rather than holly and reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue is aggressively peddling scores of dot-coms that
sell gift merchandise, flowers, candy, apparel, greeting cards,
jewelry and gift certificates in campaigns that mimic the longtime
efforts in the offline world to exploit Cupid by attaching dollar
signs to his arrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't have a brick-and-mortar experience, it's more
difficult to engage the consumer,'' said Harry Cocciolo, creative
director at the San Francisco office of Leagas Delaney, an agency
that is producing Valentine's Day ads for dot-coms like
Bluenile.com, which sells jewelry, and RedEnvelope.com, for gifts.
``With an emotional holiday, you have a chance to start the
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected upsurge is another reminder of the transformative
power of the Internet in continuing to remake the advertising,
marketing and retailing environments. Just when you thought it was
safe to go back to the media, hoping that the sustained tattoo of
dot-com-this and dot-com-that would subside after the Christmas
trees came down, here comes another barrage of ads aimed at driving
traffic to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought there'd be a lull,'' said Patrick
Keane, senior analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York, a
consulting company, ``but the Internet is turning out to be a great
advertising medium for ephemeral events like the Super Bowl,
Valentine's Day, Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's excellent for event-driven efforts, when you can make
pushes tied to commerce,'' he added, ``because you can build a
message, get it up quickly, then tweak it after getting feedback
online.''
</P>
<P>
   Data released Thursday by Nielsen Net Ratings, a leading
Internet measurement service, showed that online ads seeking to
capitalize on Valentine's Day began running as early as Jan. 16.
And traffic patterns for the week ending Sunday indicated success
in stimulating visits to some sites selling gift certificates,
flowers and lingerie, which showed increases in audiences ranging
from 63.1 percent to 123.1 percent from the corresponding period a
week before.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce seems to work extraordinarily well when it's
wrapped around a specific time for buying gifts, as it does in the
real world,'' said Allen Weiner, vice president for analytical
services at Nielsen Net Ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are stepping up to the challenge, making use of the
things the Web can do to target customers,'' he added. ``So we're
going to see a continual stream of online advertising tied to
special events.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the dot-coms trying to exploit Valentine's Day to
encourage shopping online are Ashford.com, for jewelry;
Balducci.com, for food gifts; Dealtime.com, a price-comparison
site; FTD.com; Flooz.com, for an online gift currency;
GiftCertificates.com; Gifts.com; Giftworld.com; Jewelry.com; and
LuxuryFinder.com.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there are Macys.com, the World Wide Web site for the
Federated Department Stores Macy's chain; Marthasflowers.com, part
of the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia empire; Miadora.com, also
for jewelry; MySimon.com, a comparison shopping service;
1800flowers.com; Proflowers.com; Roxy.com, which sells consumer
electronics; Sephora.com, a site for fragrances and cosmetics;
Urbanfetch.com; and Wine.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our plan for Flooz.com is to own every gift
occasion,'' said Adam Hanft, managing partner and president at
Hanft Byrne Raboy &AMP; Partners in New York, the agency that creates
campaigns for that company featuring Whoopi Goldberg. ``And
Valentine's Day is the next one after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who spent intelligently in the fourth quarter are back,
to continue reinvesting in their brands,'' he added. ``The cynics
who thought this would end with the fourth quarter are going to
have to keep extending the time when the other shoe is supposed to
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Even not-coms are joining the dot-coms, taking to the Net with
Valentine's Day themes. For instance, Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is
promoting ``the world's largest simultaneous e-kiss'' for Scope
mouthwash at www.getclose.com/puckerup. ``As more and more
traditional advertisers become online advertisers, they create
relationships with consumers that can be converted into tremendous
opportunities for e-commerce,'' said Susan Bratton, vice president
for market development at Excite(at)Home in Redwood City, Calif.,
which sells advertising as well as merchandise on sites like
Bluemountain.com, for online greeting cards, and Excite.com.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said this would be a seasonal business,'' said
Bratton, who is also vice chairwoman of the Internet Advertising
Bureau, a trade association. ``For a lot of content sites that have
to show quarter-by-quarter growth, they'll parcel out their dough
in a seasonal way.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are differences between the current dot-com
barrage and the huckstering done before Christmas and Hanukkah. For
one, ad spending now is generally less because Valentine's Day
generates less revenue for most e-tailers than the fourth quarter.
For example, Flooz.com is spending 20 to 25 percent of what it
spent for Christmas, Hanft said.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is an increase in campaigns centered on
promotions and public relations rather than expensive mass media
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promotions are vital for an Internet company because we're
virtual,'' said David Friedensohn, chairman and chief executive at
Bigstar.com in New York, an online movie retailer. The company sent
bald men dressed as Cupids onto the streets of three cities to give
away Necco candy hearts and discount coupons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have physical store locations,'' he added, ``so it's
important to have a physical presence.'' Bigstar.com is also
running TV, radio and print ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you've got a gabillion dollars, partnerships and
promotions are key,'' said Rob Gensch, vice president for business
development at Floragraph LLC in New York, which runs
www.flower.com.
</P>
<P>
   Floragraph is teaming with the Gay Financial Network LLC in New
York for a promotion: for each floral order it receives it will
donate a dollar to an organization called AIDS Action. Floragraph
is also running a contest, giving away a bouquet a month for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone took a breath after the Christmas holidays to see
what worked and what didn't,'' said John Rizzi, president and chief
executive at E-Dialog in Lexington, Mass., which specializes in
digital direct marketing services. ``It was apparent that using a
holiday was a sensible way to help find customers.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Dialog, which has formed a strategic partnership with
Interpublic Group of Cos., is sending personalized _ and
commercialized _ e-mail notes with valentine themes to consumers
who have used the services of e-merchants like Send.com and
Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch, part of USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fish when the fish are,'' said Mike Lannon, chief
executive at Send.com in Waltham, Mass., a gift site. ``When people
are buying more gifts than at other times of the year _ Valentine's
Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Christmas _ those are the best
times to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That foreshadows more commercialized holiday celebrations in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-com barrage ``is probably going to go on unabated till
the summer,'' Keane of Jupiter Communications said. ``That's the
only lull you'll ever see.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast there, by Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the typically quiet summer period, we're trying to develop
a program,'' said Sarah Anderson, vice president for marketing at
Egreetings Network Inc. in San Francisco, which operates an online
card site at www.egreetings.com, ``some sort of holiday we create
to get people to come to our site.''

 BofA Cut 1,821 Jobs in Bay Area Since NationsBank's Takeover  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It's no secret that Bank of America has been slashing jobs in the
Bay Area. Yesterday, for the first time, the bank disclosed how
many.
<P>
   From September 1998, when North Carolina's NationsBank bought
San Francisco's BofA and took its name, through the end of 1999,
the bank's Bay Area head count shrank by 1,821 jobs, or 9.9
percent, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of December, BofA had 16,646 full-time equivalent
jobs locally compared with 18,467 jobs at the time of the takeover.
In percentage terms, that reduction was slightly less than the 10.8
percent decline in the bank's companywide job total, which fell
from 174,844 full-time equivalent jobs to 155,906 jobs during the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout California, BofA jobs fell 8 percent, to 38,300
during the period, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area job cuts ``are not as dramatic as I thought they
might have been,'' said Joseph Morford, a San Francisco analyst
with the brokerage Dain Rauscher Wessels. Job cuts ``are roughly
the same percentage here as they are companywide, showing that
cutbacks are not overly weighted'' to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   BofA has consistently declined to answer questions about job
cuts in specific localities or regions. But the bank has been under
pressure from San Francisco officials to make public its job record
locally.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for example, Treasurer Susan Leal, the official who
supervises San Francisco's banking relationships, sent a letter
asking the bank to supply head count data in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Leal and a request from The Chronicle, the bank
released figures yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Job cuts, of course, are a standard part of bank mergers and the
cities that serve as the headquarters of banks that get taken over
are often hit particularly hard.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank and BofA said from the beginning they expected to
slash their combined workforce to trim costs and eliminate
overlapping operations. A year ago, BofA estimated it would slash
about 23,000 jobs over several years through acquisition-related
cuts, normal turnover and the sale of business units.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials declined to provide specific breakdowns of local
job cuts, but headquarters functions of the former BofA got a
disproportionate share. ``The largest number (of cuts) came from
staff functions such as legal, personnel and finance,'' noted
Connie Beck, BofA's president of Northern California banking.
</P>
<P>
   Job reductions in traditional banking operations were partially
offset by growth at Banc of America Securities, the investment
banking unit formerly known as Montgomery Securities, which has
added several hundred jobs in San Francisco in the past 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The bank expects to cut more jobs, Beck said, though she
declined to say how many. So-called transition jobs, those
connected with the integration of the old BofA and old NationsBank,
are among those slated to be phased out.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who lose their jobs get priority for open positions
and are eligible for severance packages, Beck said. The bank is
currently  &LR; trying to fill about 500 positions in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Despite job cuts, the bank improved customer satisfaction
ratings and added deposits at a faster pace than planned last year.
``Our real objective is to grow our business,'' Beck said.

CARDINAL MEETS POPE FOR FAREWELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Cardinal John O'Connor had a private farewell audience
with Pope John Paul II Thursday shortly before the Vatican held a
special Mass for thousands of sick and terminally ill believers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who turned 80 last month and has been in ill health
since undergoing brain surgery in August, is preparing to step down
as archbishop of New York. His meeting at the Vatican with the
79-year-old pope, whose own health is precarious, could well be a
final one for the two frail, like-minded Roman Catholic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very personal trip, and he had a private and personal
meeting with his Holy Father,'' said Joseph Zwilling, the
cardinal's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The usually outspoken New York archbishop was reclusive in Rome
on Thursday, giving no interviews and attending no public events.
After arriving on Wednesday, he stayed at the home of Cardinal
William Wakefield Baum, an American official at the Vatican who
lives a block from St. Peter's. O'Connor, who, like the pope, walks
with difficulty, was driven to his Vatican appointments by car.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the cardinal said they did not know whether the two men
spoke about O'Connor's eventual successor, but a Vatican official
said it was likely that the topic would come up while the cardinal
was in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said the archbishop also traveled to Rome to see
colleagues at the Congregation of Bishops. ``It is a chance for him
to see people and thank them for the work they have done together
over the years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for archbishops who are planning to step down
to first pay a final visit to Rome. In 1996, when Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin, the archbishop of Chicago, was dying of cancer, he paid
a farewell visit to the pope. He died two months later.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has not yet stated when it will announce a successor
to O'Connor, who has led the archdiocese of New York, which now has
2.4 million members, for 15 years. The retirement age for bishops
is 75, but the pope has on occasion extended the tenure of church
leaders he trusts, and that was the case when 0'Connor turned 75.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is the oldest practicing bishop in the United States,
but not by much. Cardinal James Hickey of Washington is 79.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Connor turned 80 on Jan. 15, he lost his vote for a new
pope in a conclave, a milestone that many viewed as timely for
retirement. So did the cardinal. Before his birthday, he paved the
way for his departure by sending a farewell letter last November to
the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write because, although I have no word whatsoever from our
Holy Father, who, as we know, alone makes such decisions, it would
seem to me to be the height of presumptuousness, in view of my
becoming an octogenarian on the forthcoming 15th of January, to
anticipate continuing in office much longer,'' he wrote. The
archbishop thanked his fellow bishops and signed off: ``Thank you
all, once again. It's been a great ride.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor had planned to visit the pope earlier this month, at a
time that would have coincided with a meeting of the Vatican's
Congregation of Bishops, which, among other things, recommends new
bishops to the pope. But at the last moment, the cardinal postponed
his trip. Zwilling said it was ``merely coincidental'' that the
cardinal met with the pope on the first day of a special four-day
Holy Year event dedicated to the sick, which opened with a Mass at
one of the main basilicas of Rome, St. Paul Outside the Walls.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, at a Holy Year Mass in St. Peter's Square,
the pope is expected to administer personally a special sacrament
to gravely ill people hailing from five continents. (The rite,
which was once known as extreme unction, or last rites, can now be
given not only to the dying but also to anyone who is old or
seriously ill.)
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said O'Connor, who was planning to return to New York
on Friday, did not expect to attend the event.

GLITCHES SEEMINGLY SOLVED, ENDEAVOUR SET FOR BLASTOFF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ With months of equipment problems
seemingly overcome, NASA readied the space shuttle Endeavour for
launching Friday on a mission that promises to quickly offer its
six astronauts a host of new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour was scheduled to blast off for its 11-day mission at
12:30 a.m. EST from NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   As the countdown entered its final hours late Thursday, the
shuttle was free of the difficulties with electrical wiring,
electronic components and rocket engine turbine seals that combined
to push the liftoff from September into the new year. Forecasters
improved an already favorable weather outlook, though they
continued to warn that wind speeds could rise to near safety
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just say this is part of a very complex program,''
said Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program manager. Praising the
agency's work force for finding the potential safety threats, he
added, ``I expect this vehicle and the ones that follow to be in
tiptop shape.''
</P>
<P>
   During 11 days aloft, the shuttle crew will scan the Earth with
a massive radar system secured in Endeavour's cargo bay. Experts
will convert the radar signals collected into three-dimensional
maps of the planet's terrain. The new cartography should be
unprecedented in the scope and accuracy of its elevation
measurements, findings that will be of use to military strategists
as well as conservationists and urban planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have better three-dimensional maps of Venus and Mars than
we do of the Earth,'' Endeavour commander Kevin Kregel noted in a
pre-flight interview. Both planets have been scrutinized more
comprehensively by probes than Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Endeavour's $570 million venture, however, will
hinge on the extension of an untried 200-foot-long boom over the
left wing of Endeavour within the first six hours of the flight.
Fastened to the tip of the mast is the antenna gear that will
enable the recorded radar returns to be converted into maps.
</P>
<P>
   Fashioned from a lightweight combination of carbon fiber
reinforced plastic, titanium and stainless steel, the mast is
folded into a 9-foot-tall canister in the shuttle's cargo hold for
the launching.
</P>
<P>
   The mast was designed to be extended from the canister with a
push of a button by the astronauts. An electric motor will drive
the mast from the container accordion-style. The mast is equipped
with a backup motor if the first fails to operate. Astronauts Janet
Kavandi and Gerhardt Thiele have trained to extend the mast with a
hand-held power tool during a tedious spacewalk if both motors
falter.
</P>
<P>
   Once the boom is fully extended, Kregel and shuttle co-pilot
Dominic ``Dom'' Gorie will initiate a series of small maneuvers
with the shuttle's thrusters to determine whether the 1,900-pound
mast meets NASA's pre-flight strength predictions.
</P>
<P>
   The mapping requires that Endeavour circle the Earth at an
altitude of 145 miles over the 11 days, much lower than most
shuttle flights. The shuttle will lose one to two miles in altitude
each day, requiring the two pilots to steer Endeavour higher daily
to regain the loss. The mast will remain extended during the
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the acceleration forces from the maneuvers would flex
the tip of the long mast 31 inches, 4 inches less than the
calculated breaking point of the spindly boom. But the thrusts will
be timed to cut the deflections to 15 inches.

SPREADING THE FREE ENTERPRISE SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star Add to Kansas City's growing list of
exports its spirit of enterprise and entrepreneurialism.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The export vehicle is a concept called Exchange City, which The
Learning Exchange created in 1980 to teach grade-schoolers how free
markets and democracy combine to underpin the American way of life.
Much of the impetus came from business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Exchange City method of teaching
world-of-work lessons has gained notice in other U.S. cities and
has begun to take root across America. Under licensing partnerships
with Kansas City's Learning Exchange, Junior Achievement has
initiated the duplication of Exchange City ventures in such cities
as Indianapolis, Houston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Minneapolis and
Iowa's Quad Cities area.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lee, vice president for fund development, says The Learning
Exchange expects to have about 30 Exchange City licensing
agreements in place by the end of 2003. Under the terms of these
partnerships, Junior Achievement organizers get training, technical
guidance and instructional materials from Kansas City's staff but
are on their own when it comes to creating their Exchange City
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   And judging from The Learning Exchange's operation at the Penn
Valley Community College campus, building an Exchange City is a
significant undertaking. Like Kansas City, everything is up to date
in Exchange City.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the businesses conceived to simulate today's
marketplace, but from city hall to the bank to the newspaper
office, operations are computerized as well. A quick perusal of the
various operating guides for business and government activities
raises the question of whether all this might be a bit too advanced
for fifth- and sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that it well might be if not for the dedication of
the teachers and parents involved. Kids and adults alike undergo
extensive preparation before their Exchange City experience, which
allows for a smooth operation when the day of the Exchange City
field trip finally arrives.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 students took part in the Exchange City experience
last year, aided by upward of 4,000 parents and teachers. Lee says
the program is so popular at some schools that lotteries must be
set up to choose parental participants because there are more
volunteers than Exchange City can use.
</P>
<P>
   Since Exchange City opened, about 300,000 students have
participated, and the experience occasionally shows up on the
resumes of local job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Exchange, which was started in 1972 as a way to
expand the community's educational options, does a lot more than
run Exchange City. Its EarthWorks is an environmental learning
facility that The Learning Exchange characterizes as unique in
America. The exchange also has a School-to-Career Partnership with
area school districts and businesses and a Charter School
Partnership program. It is also involved with Union Station's
Science City and the Truman Library.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, this outfit hasn't been a community resource
that gets much media attention for what it's doing _ certainly not
as much as it deserves. If you're concerned about the future of the
free-enterprise system, however, it should be considered a
community treasure.

 &HT;    Reds make up for lack of major moves in NL Central by adding
Griffey
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The Cincinnati Reds have been the least active
movers and shakers in the National League Central Division during
the offseason, but Thursday's blockbuster addition of Ken Griffey
Jr. more than made up for the inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are expected to open the season with only two changes
in the everyday lineup. Griffey will replace Mike Cameron in
centerfield and Dante Bichette will take over in right field.
Bichette was brought in to replace Greg Vaughn, who played left
field in 1999. Dmitri Young moves from right to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Milwaukee and
Chicago all made a lot of moves to strengthen themselves,'' said
Reds general manager Jim Bowden, ``but they all have to be looking
at us today with concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds will keep Pokey Reese at second base, Barry Larkin at
shortstop, Sean Casey at first, Aaron Boone at third and Eddie
Taubensee behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he has only one concern heading into spring
training. ``This team has enough offense, we have enough defense
and we have a good bullpen. We'll go as far as our starting
pitching carries us and we're going to keep trying to improve
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The top four starters are Pete Harnisch, Denny Neagle, Steve
Parris and Ron Villone, a foursome that doesn't quite measure up to
the starting eight.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said Griffey, Larkin and Reese give him something he has
only dreamed of seeing. ``We'll be the best team in baseball up the
middle. The Big Red Machine had that (in the 1970s) with Davey
Concepcion (ss), Joe Morgan (2b) and Cesar Geronimo (cf), but these
guys are better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   At Griffey's inititial news conference as a Red, he was asked
about how he will feel about competing in the same division with
the Cubs' Sammy Sosa and the Cardinals' Mark McGwire, the other two
members of baseball's home run trio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not competing against those guys,'' Griffey said. ``I'll
be competing against the guys who are throwing the baseballs.''

   ATLANTA _ Prosecutors plan to ask an Atlanta grand jury to
indict the Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis and two
other men on Friday in the murders of two young men outside a
nightclub on the night of the Super Bowl, the authorities said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and two men described as old acquaintances fled
``literally dripping with blood'' after stabbing the two men in a
street brawl, Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, has been held without bond for 10 days since the
police named him as the chief suspect in the case. A stretch
limousine hired by Lewis was reported to have raced away from the
fight scene and was found hours later less than two miles away at a
hotel where Lewis was staying.
</P>
<P>
   The two other suspects were identified by the police as Reginald
Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, and Joseph Sweeting, 34, of Miami. They
have not been arrested and are being sought by local and federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Both Oakley and Sweeting have extensive criminal records, and
Oakley is considered ``armed and dangerous,'' Deputy Chief Carter
B. Jackson of the Atlanta police said at a late afternoon news
conference at which the decision to indict all three suspects was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The limousine driver, who has not been identified by the police,
is the principal witness to the crime, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Lewis and the two other suspects bought a
pair of knives at an Atlanta sporting goods store on Jan. 29, the
day before the Super Bowl. A knife found at the scene of the
stabbings in the prosperous Buckhead section on the north side of
Atlanta is believed to be one of the murder weapons, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Lewis had been uncooperative when they
questioned him at his lawyer's home on Jan. 31, the day after the
Super Bowl, and misled investigators when he was asked about his
role in the brawl and who had accompanied him in the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that Lewis was an active participant in the brawl
outside the Cobalt Club and that several people including Lewis
``punched and kicked'' the victims before they were stabbed,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Lewis, a 6-foot-1-inch, 245-pound former
University of Miami all-American, have called him a ``horrified
bystander'' who had attempted to break up a scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lawyers have said he was acting as a peacemaker during
the fight that led to the deaths of Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth
Baker, 21, both of Decatur in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garland, one of the lawyers representing Lewis, said at a
news conference Thursday that a witness had seen Lewis holding
people back in an attempt to break up a fight between his friends
and the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is not responsible for acts that he didn't know were
taking place while he was trying to break up a fight,'' Garland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis knew neither the criminal history nor the real names of
Sweeting and Oakley, Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been hangers-on with Ray, groupies, for years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a case against a celebrity and they're going to
try to make it stick no matter what the facts are,'' Garland said.
``We're going to bring them the facts, and those facts will
exonerate Ray Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the news conference of the police and prosecutor, which
was also attended by Campbell, a very different picture of Lewis
was presented. Jackson said Lewis had refused to answer basic
questions about the fight that led to the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Lewis has not cooperated at all, other than to provide
misleading statements and outright lies,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said, ``The perpetrators were literally dripping with
blood, and yet not a single occupant, not a single passenger has
contacted the police to provide any information about what
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Paul Howard, the Fulton County district attorney,
said witnesses had seen Lewis fighting with one of the victims just
before he was stabbed. Lewis can be charged with murder if he was
involved in the fight, even if someone else stabbed the men.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has refused to speak to investigators since his first
interview before his arrest. In that interview he misled
investigators, including saying that the former University of
Maryland football player A.J. Johnson was one of the men with him
the night of the killings, Jackson said. Johnson was not in Atlanta
during Super Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   Garland said Lewis was confused about the names of some of the
men in the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did know one of the men by the name A.J., and under the
pressure he was under of that moment, he got the last name wrong,''
Garland said. ``He was being grilled and being treated in a very
hostile fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses who could clear Lewis are afraid to come forward
until Oakley and Sweeting are arrested, Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is a three-time Pro Bowl player who led the NFL in tackles
last season. He could face life in prison or the death penalty if
convicted.

LAKERS STILL NEED ID CHECKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Lakers can win a lot of games. This much,
coach Phil Jackson knows.
</P>
<P>
   But with the season at its artificial midway point, the All-Star
break, Jackson is still searching for his team's identity.
</P>
<P>
   With a 37-11 record, the Lakers trail only the Portland Trail
Blazers in winning percentage among the league's elite teams. Yet
Jackson's one-word assessment of his team at the break is
``inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say (that) is the most glaring thing,'' he said.
``It's a team I'm not really capable of reading well yet saying,
they're really ready to play this game or they're not ready to play
this game. It's hard for me to judge which level I can really push
them to on a day-to-day basis sometimes. This team still doesn't
have a mood that I can really read.''
</P>
<P>
   What Jackson does know is the Lakers have made rapid progress
since he opened his first training camp with them in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more than meeting the expectations of what I've
expected for them to do,'' he said. ``Offensively, they've advanced
farther than I thought they would be. Defensively, they're playing
well enough. They still must get better, but they've improved
dramatically in the defensive area.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the season was characterized by a 16-game
winning streak, and a stretch of six losses in nine games that
followed, but the Lakers stabilized themselves by winning their
last three games before the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a very good first half,'' said Kobe Bryant. ``I
think we're ahead of the game, we're ahead of where Phil expected
us to be and I'm sure where a lot of you guys expected us to be at
this point too, so we can't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal was less generous in his grading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give us a 79.8,'' he said. ``It's a high C, but in this
society, in this locker room, it's not good enough. Of course, we
passed, but it's not good enough to get us where we want to go.
We're still up there in the top echelon of teams, we're going to be
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade talk: The Lakers could acquire Toni Kukoc from the Chicago
Bulls if they are willing to take on Hersey Hawkins and his hefty
contract, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Bulls have previously discussed swapping Glen
Rice for Kukoc, and according to the Chicago Tribune, the Bulls
could be swayed by the chance to dump Hawkins, who will make $4.68
million next season, the last year of his deal.
</P>
<P>
   There are two potential road blocks, however: The Lakers would
have to include another player to equal the combined salaries of
Kukoc and Hawkins, and the Bulls are not interested in Rice and
need to find a third team to take him.
</P>
<P>
   The teams play Tuesday in Chicago, as the Lakers begin a
six-game road trip.

BRAZIL BEER   MERGER PARTNERS CHARGE OBSTRUCTION BY COKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Two Brazilian breweries that agreed last
July to form Latin America's biggest beverage company accused
Coca-Cola Co. Thursday of trying to derail their $3.9 billion deal
in order to suppress a competitive threat in one of Coke's most
important overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola of Atlanta, the world's leading soft drink producer,
denied the accusations made by the merger partners in Companhia de
Bebidas das Americas, known as AmBev. But the accusations
represented another challenge to Coke's business operations
overseas, which have been hit with a variety of problems over the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Coke owns a 10 percent stake in Companhia Cervejarias Kaiser,
Brazil's No. 3 brewery. Together, they have 30 percent of the
overall beverage market in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies that agreed to combine into AmBev, Companhia
Cervejaria Brahma and Companhia Antarctica Paulista, together have
40 percent of the Brazilian market.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Kaiser has sought to prevent the formation
of AmBev, arguing that AmBev's breweries would have a stranglehold
on the beer market. The AmBev partners, which have been frustrated
over their inability so far to gain Brazilian regulatory approval
of their deal, have denied Kaiser's assertions. But Thursday was
the first time that the AmBev partners had brought Coke's name into
the debate, essentially trying to depict themselves as targets of a
powerful multinational corporation that sees its interests
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel de Telles, who has been designated as a co-president of
AmBev, said in a telephone interview that ``Kaiser is trying to
portray itself as David when it is in fact Goliath.'' Telles said
that although Coca-Cola did not have a majority stake in Kaiser, it
had effective control of the company because it distributes
Kaiser's products through its Brazilian bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Coca-Cola,'' he said, ``Kaiser would die.''
</P>
<P>
   The AmBev merger partners also said that efforts to limit them
would hinder their plans to sell Guarana Antarctica, a soft drink
made from a caffeinated Amazonian berry, in Brazil and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is one of Coca-Cola's largest overseas markets, second
only to Mexico in sales, but has been one of its most difficult
lately. In 1998, sales of Coke products began to stall, giving up
ground to cheaper, locally produced soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Coke announced last year that it planned to spend close to $1
billion or so over three years to help its Brazilian bottlers
expand their market share against the locally produced drinks,
mainly by discounting Coke prices to retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Coca-Cola officials dismissed AmBev's accusations as
groundless. ``We're in the ready-to-drink nonalcoholic beverage
market,'' said Marco Simoes, the director of communications at
Coke's Brazilian subsidiary. ``We're not beer sellers. We own a
small stake of about 10 percent in Kaiser, that is all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser also rebuffed the attempt by the AmBev partners as a
desperate move. ``This is an attempt to disrupt the process, an
emotional threat from someone who isn't used to losing,'' said
Humberto Pandolpho, Kaiser's president.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian antitrust regulators are analyzing the AmBev deal and
are expected to decide whether to approve it in the next few
months. Separate government authorities have suggested that the
combined company be forced to sell one of its leading beer brands.

ALASKA AIRLINES REPORT BRINGS FAA ORDER ON TAIL SECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ore., Wash.)   (bl)  
 By CARL H. LAVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alaska Airlines said Thursday that a check of the
mechanism that moves the horizontal stabilizer on jetliners of the
MD-80 series had turned up metal shavings on two of the carrier's
planes, and the Federal Aviation Administration promptly ordered
all domestic airlines to complete inspections of similar planes for
signs of damage.
</P>
<P>
   The order, to inspect the jackscrew that moves the stabilizer,
follows the crash last week of an Alaska Airlines MD-83 whose crew
had reported a stabilizer problem. The crash, some 40 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, killed all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered damage to jackscrews was found on one
Alaska Airlines plane in Portland, Ore., and another in Seattle.
The airline is keeping those two planes on the ground, awaiting the
arrival of federal investigators, but said it had found no problems
with 29 other jetliners of the MD-80 series in its fleet; its
remaining three MD-80's are out of service for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's order to all domestic carriers does not call for any
planes to be grounded, but the inspections must be completed within
three days.
</P>
<P>
   The order applies to 1,100 planes of the MD-80 series or similar
design, including MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s. Problems must be
reported to the FAA promptly, said Paul Takemoto, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although the order does not apply to 800 other such planes used
around the world, foreign airlines often follow the agency's
directives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what effect the order, issued late
Thursday, would have on airline schedules. Bob Baker, vice chairman
of American Airlines, said, ``We will have to read the directive
before we can determine what impact it might have.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it could not calculate the effect on schedules and
was putting the emphasis on safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that it's far more important that we get these
aircraft inspected,'' said Thomas E. McSweeny, the FAA's associate
administrator for regulation and certification. ``I think the
average member of the traveling public will understand the delay.''
</P>
<P>
   The order followed by a day a recommendation from Boeing that
carriers inspect the jackscrews. By Thursday, airlines had already
begun the checks, and, except for the two Alaska Airlines planes,
there were no immediate reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board
and Boeing were on their way to Portland and Seattle to examine
those two planes' jackscrews, which control the position of the
horizontal stabilizer, a movable surface on the tail that helps
keep the plane level.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer on the jetliner that crashed last week had begun
shifting gradually to a nose-down position and then went abruptly
to a position that caused the jet to dive more than a mile,
investigators have concluded. The pilots briefly regained control
and were able to execute some maneuvers. But they lost control
again, and the plane went into a final dive.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy recovered the jackscrew from that plane Tuesday, and
metal shavings were found curled around the two-foot-long
part. &UR;  &LR; Investigators have not yet determined whether the part was
damaged before the plane developed problems and corkscrewed into
the Pacific, or whether the crash itself caused the damage.

`INTERNET ACCELERATOR'TO PUSH FOR FAST GROWTH OF START-UPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star A new Kansas City company will provide
seed money and help proposed Internet businesses grow from concepts
and dreams to up-and-running companies in 90 days or less.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brad Cohen, a Kansas City entrepreneur who has launched five
companies in Denver and Kansas City since 1993, said the new
``Internet accelerator,'' called iEmerge, would give Net
entrepreneurs a jump-start. IEmerge is scheduled to be formally
launched today.
</P>
<P>
   OctoberCapital, a venture capital fund formed last month by
Lance LeMay and his father, Sprint President Ronald T. LeMay, is
providing financing for the company. Cohen's father, Cohen-Esrey
Real Estate Chief Executive Roger Cohen, is on the board of
directors of iEmerge.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerator concept has been highly successful on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was initiated in 1996 by Pasadena, Calif.-based
Idealab. Among that company's successes are eToys, which currently
has a market value of $1.8 billion, and GoTo.com, with a market cap
of $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``While many incubating companies (traditionally) take a year to
acquire funding and launch, we are accelerating that process to two
to three months for our start-up businesses _ a speed that is
essential in the dynamic Internet marketplace,'' Brad Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   IEmerge will invest $250,000 to $500,000 in new companies
``specifically for seed capital, replacing the usual `friends and
family' fund-raising approach,'' Cohen said. The investments are
intended to get the companies up and running and operating for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a capital standpoint, seed capital is the hardest to
get,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   But just as important, Cohen said, iEmerge will provide a range
of business resources, from legal counsel to public relations and
marketing. The program will allow entrepreneurs to focus on their
businesses without getting bogged down by issues that often swamp
new businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make this as painless as possible. Choosing a
lawyer can take a month of interviewing people. We eliminate
that,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting up an Internet company is a completely different
world. This will give us an opportunity to say, `Here's what works,
here's what hasn't worked.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, iEmerge gets a stake in the company and helps it
obtain further financing as it grows.
</P>
<P>
   IEmerge will work with five new companies a year, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who also has formed a start-up Internet company of his
own called SoloSearch, said he decided to form what he calls an
``e-Xcelerator'' after seeing a lot of entrepreneurial interest in
the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a strong need in Kansas City for early-stage seed
capital,'' Cohen said. ``It's amazing how rapidly the Internet
community is growing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he planned to build a model Internet accelerator in
Kansas City, then expand the concept into other cities in the
Midwest and West.
</P>
<P>
   IEmerge presents a second solid resource for area start-up
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise Center of Johnson County, Kan., is an incubator
that rents office space below market value to new businesses and
taps into management, marketing and financial accounting services.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Enterprise Center, however, iEmerge will work only
with Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accelerator is not just a word; it's a difference,'' Cohen
said. Unlike a traditional incubator that nurtures new companies,
iEmerge will push for rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a for-profit company,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has formed five companies in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   He is co-founder of Cohen Capital Technologies, a company that
invests in Internet technologies to create commercial enterprises
around those technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, in Denver, Cohen launched Real Information Systems,
one of the nation's first Web development companies focused on
resort markets. He managed that company's merger with another
start-up to create eCollege.com.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also acquired and built Colorado.net, the largest Internet
service provider on the western slope of Colorado, before returning
to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   IEmerge already is working with three companies in Kansas City,
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cohen's own project, SoloSearch, iEmerge is
working with IMWorth, which works with financial institutions to
deliver account transaction information to customers; and Framecast
Communications, which is working to develop enhanced Internet
services for colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   SoloSearch builds search engines for Web sites that cater to the
business-to-business market.

WHERE'S WOODS? SIX STROKES OFF PACE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ While Tiger Woods struggled with his swing
Thursday, Davis Love III gained confidence in his.
</P>
<P>
   Love shot a 7-under-par 65 to lead the first round of the Buick
Invitational by one stroke over Phil Mickelson and by two strokes
over J.P. Hayes, J.L. Lewis and Scott Verplank, who were tied at
67.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was six strokes off the lead after his opening-round 71,
starting slowly in his bid to win his seventh consecutive PGA Tour
start.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Woods has been in far worse positions, such as Monday
at Pebble Beach, when he somehow overcame a seven-stroke deficit
with seven holes to play, adding to the intimidating presence he
creates when his name appears on the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   However, Love is a player with enough success and experience to
handle what will be a pressure-packed weekend if Woods makes a run.
As the world's No. 4- ranked player, the 1997 winner of the PGA
Championship and the tour's all-time leading money winner, Love
expects to have several confrontations with Woods in his future.
And if one of those clashes transpires this weekend, Love would
welcome the opportunity to be the streak-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't avoid talking about it, it's an incredible streak,''
said Love, who won this tournament in 1996. ``We've said all along
that Tiger is super-talented, and if he plays well, he's the guy to
beat. But confidence is what wins, and if we can beat him a couple
of times, the confidence goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Love kept his confidence Thursday during an active round at
Torrey Pines' south course that included 10 birdies and three
bogeys. But Love's play got stronger as the day progressed. He made
his last bogey at No. 6, then made six birdies over his final 12
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top five players on the leader board, Love and
Verplank played at the south course, while Mickelson, Lewis and
Hayes played on the north course.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' day was a struggle from the start. He bogeyed two of his
first three holes and never looked comfortable with his driver, his
short irons or his putter. Scratching out a 71 was a moral victory,
particularly since the wind was gusting to 15 mph on some holes on
a cool day by the San Diego area's standards, with temperatures in
the high 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a decent score, for as bad as I felt out there,'' said
Woods, the defending tournament champion. ``If I knew what it was,
I would tell you, I really don't know. I couldn't shape my shots
the right way, and I didn't have the trajectory I wanted. To be
honest, I felt uncomfortable over every putt I hit. There wasn't
one putt that I got over and said, `Yeah, I'm going to make this
one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he felt that he may have been drained from his
emotional comeback victory at Pebble Beach. After winning Monday,
Woods traveled to the San Diego area and practiced on Tuesday and
Wednesday. But after his round Thursday, instead of practicing on
the range, Woods planned to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been grinding it pretty hard lately,'' Woods said. ``I
think I deserve a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Teeing off on the 10th hole of the north course, Woods made a
15-foot putt to save par on his first hole, but he followed with
two consecutive bogeys. Woods hit a terrible tee shot at No. 11,
pulling it into a cluster of bushes. The ball was unplayable,
forcing Woods to take a drop and a penalty stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was still in trouble after his drop, with the ball resting
on a patch of dirt, and his back pressed against the bushes. Woods
hit his next shot into a green-side bunker, then got up and down
for a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-3 No. 12, Woods pulled a tee shot well left of the
green, then left his chip shot 20 feet short of the cup, and still
short of the green. Woods' next chip went three feet past the hole,
but he made the putt coming back for another bogey.
</P>
<P>
   This is not what the huge gallery following Woods expected. But
Woods finally gave his fans a thrill on the 507-yard No. 15, when
he reached the green in two shots, then made a 30-foot putt for
eagle. The crowd roared, and it was the kind of rush that usually
sparks a Woods surge.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen Thursday. Woods missed the green with his
approach shot at the par-4 No. 15 and, after chipping eight feet
past the green, missed the putt for another bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Woods managed two more birdies on the day, and he showed his
power at No. 2, a 326-yard par 4, when he almost drove the green.
Swinging so hard that it looked as if his shoe strings might
snapped, Woods' drive carried about 320 yards in the air, stopping
just a few yards short of the green. But after hitting a nice chip
to three feet, Woods missed the three-foot putt and settled for
par.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day, but with 54 holes left, he saw no
reason to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make it up on the weekend, or maybe even tomorrow,''
said Woods, who overcame a seven-stroke deficit after two rounds to
win this tournament last year.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders _ most notably Love and Mickelson, who each have 13
tour victories _ hoped to keep Woods at bay. Neither Love nor
Mickelson won on tour last year, the first season without a victory
for Love since 1994, and the first season without a victory for
Mickelson since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A native of San Diego, Mickelson feels overdue, and beating
Woods would be a satisfying way for him to end his drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger's play is forcing everyone to play at another level,''
Mickelson. ``Guys like Fred Couples, Davis Love and myself are
trying to play to that level, and hopefully have a different winner
on tour.''

SCORES OF AFGHANS ON HIJACKED PLANE ASK BRITAIN FOR ASYLUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs 2nd graf for more precise numbers on asylum seekers)  
 (bl)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ No sooner had the government orchestrated a peaceful
end to a four-day hijacking of an Afghan airliner at Stansted
airport Thursday morning than it was faced with another crisis: how
to sort the hijackers from the hostages and deal with all those
suddenly clamoring for political asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the government said, police have arrested 21 people from
on board the plane in connection with the hijacking, and these
people may well be seeking refuge in Britain. And of the 150 or so
passengers, 60 adults and 14 children have already requested
asylum, apparently in an effort to flee the repressive Taliban
regime in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly why the hijackers seized the Ariana Airlines Boeing
727 on Sunday just after it took off from Kabul, the Afghan
capital, still remains unclear. The authorities said they did not
know whether political asylum was the goal all along, or even
whether the Afghans had meant to finish their trip in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did they know exactly which passengers were victims who
wanted to return home and which were hijackers who wanted to stay
here. And, of course, there were perhaps passengers who had come
along for the ride against their will but, once in Britain, decided
asylum was not such a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed reports Thursday suggested that at least 40 people
on the plane knew about the hijacking in advance and were in on the
scheme, but police said they did not think the episode represented
one vast asylum-seeking plan. Whatever led to the crisis over
asylum, British authorities were faced with one clear fact Thursday
morning: well over half of the passengers on board did not want to
go back to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult for us to have an understanding of why
they had taken the plane,'' David Stevens, chief constable of the
Essex police, told reporters at the airport. ``It only became clear
in the last hour that the people on board were expressing concern
about the political situation in Afghanistan. For the first 75
hours, they didn't talk about the political situation at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange hijacking, by many standards. The hijackers
apparently used little violence, except perhaps to tie up some of
the crew members. And Tuesday, they pushed a member of the crew
roughly down the stairs (he hit his head, but was otherwise
unhurt). By international hijacking standards, their weapons were
puny indeed: just four handguns, five knives, two detonators, a
knuckle-duster and two grenades with their fuses missing.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers issued few threats, made almost no demands, and
gave up peacefully without firing a single shot. There was no quid
pro quo, and many of the passengers smiled and waved through the
windows as police escorted them onto buses and drove them away from
the remote runway on which the plane had been parked.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The surrender from the plane was unequivocal,'' the home
secretary, Jack Straw, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps not surprising that so many Afghans from the
plane, which was making a domestic flight when it was seized and
diverted, are seeking to escape the Taliban regime. One resident of
Kabul told Reuters on Thursday that he was ``extremely sorry that I
was not on the plane myself, otherwise I would have asked the Brits
to let me stay in their homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Having made what may have been a daring escape from an
oppressive government, though, the Afghans are finding that they
are most unwelcome in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the House of Commons, a hard-talking Straw said that
he would take the extraordinary step of ruling personally on the
Afghans' asylum requests, with the goal of ejecting them as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 71,160 people applied for political asylum in
Britain. More than 102,000 refugees are waiting for decisions on
whether they can remain here, decisions that can take years. Prime
Minister Tony Blair recently pushed a tough new immigration law
through Parliament, a law that will force many asylum seekers to
live in special detention centers and face drastic cuts in public
benefits while their applications are being processed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Straw said the singular situation of these particular asylum
seekers had put them in a separate category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subject to compliance with all legal requirements, I would
wish to see removed from this country all those on the plane as
soon as reasonably practicable,'' Straw said. ``As a matter of
public policy, I believe that the clearest and unequivocal signals
must be sent out so as to discourage hijacking, whatever its
motive.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is vulnerable to the perception that Britain's
disorganized immigration service makes the country an attractive
prospect for asylum seekers. That puts Straw under enormous
political pressure to act quickly and make it clear that hijacking
planes is no way to seek permanent status in Britain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The opposition Conservative Party lost no time in seizing on
that very point. Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary,
challenged Straw to get tough on asylum seekers, who are
relentlessly portrayed in right-leaning newspapers here as
opportunistic economic refugees who come to Britain for a better
way of life, not because of political persecution at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the United Kingdom?'' she said, warning Straw that the
government must work quickly to debunk the myth that its asylum
procedures are ``noticeably softer'' than those of other European
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did it decide it would land here and take advantage of our
asylum procedures?'' she asked, referring to the plane. ``Is it
that those procedures are known to be more congenial than some
which appertain in other countries?''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Marsden, a specialist on Afghanistan at the British
Refugee Council, said in an interview that such rhetoric _ both
from the government and the opposition _ was decidedly unhelpful,
particularly because the motives of the hijackers and passengers
were still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that the hijackers, who conducted their
negotiations in English, are members of Afghanistan's educated
elite and thus not in favor with the Taliban, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfortunate to prejudge a situation that way,''
he said. ``If it is the case that an element in the plane were
involved in the hijacking in order to seek asylum, it could
indicate a high level of desperation. Unless they were totally
naive, the perpetrators would presumably expect lengthy prison
sentences. For people to sacrifice years of their lives in that way
so their families can gain asylum is pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to
the Status of Refugees, Britain is obligated to consider every
application for asylum and cannot deport refugees before they have
gone through the complicated immigration process. Asylum seekers
who are arrested, as the suspected hijackers have been, must first
go through the criminal justice system here, serve whatever prison
sentences they might receive, and then have their applications
considered. But Straw still vowed to move as swiftly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I must and will act in accordance with the law, I am
determined that nobody should consider that there can be any
benefit to be obtained by hijacking,'' he said.

DELL COMPUTERS POSTS PROFIT THAT MEETS LOWER FORECAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Dell Computer Corp. reported fiscal fourth-quarter
net income Thursday that matched the sharply lowered expectations
of investors.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer manufacturer, based in Round Rock, Texas,
said net income in the period, which ended Jan. 28, rose to $436
million, or 16 cents a diluted share, from $425 million, or 15
cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, which included a special gain of a cent per share,
matched Wall Street's recently revised consensus estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But the results were far short of the 21 cents per share that
Wall Street had been anticipating before the company said on Jan.
26 that earnings would be hurt by a component shortage and by what
the company called the failure of corporate customers to step up
purchases after worries about the Year 2000 computer problem had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said revenue for the quarter was $6.8 billion, a 31 percent
increase from $5.17 billion a year earlier and slightly higher than
what Dell officials had forecast last month. However, it, too, was
far lower than what Wall Street had expected before the company's
warning.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which pioneered direct selling of personal computers, said
sales through its Web site approached half of revenue, and, by the
end of the quarter, were averaging $40 million a day, up from $14
million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In regular Nasdaq trading Thursday, Dell shares rose $3.23, to
$38.80, but then slipped back to $37.88 in after-hours trading.
Dell announced its earnings after the 4 p.m. close of regular
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stock's 9.1 percent gain Thursday on another
record-setting day for the Nasdaq, Dell shares have fallen 4.8
percent in the last three months, compared with a gain of 51.2
percent for the Nasdaq index. Some analysts say investors are
beginning to recognize that Dell's days of 50-percent-or-better
growth are gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives have said they expect revenue to grow in the
low-30-percent range this fiscal year _ a huge number, for sure,
that would give Dell annual sales of more than $33 billion. But
that follows 38 percent year-over-year growth for the
just-completed fiscal year, and growth of 50 percent, or more, in
the prior years.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wolf, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read who lowered his
rating on Dell from buy to hold earlier this week, said he was
concerned that Dell had reached the point that it may be impossible
for it to ever enjoy the sort of growth it had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of levitating growth rates we've seen in the past
just aren't possible any more,'' Wolf said, in part because the
company has grown so large. But he also said Dell's rivals were
becoming more competitive on direct sales.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Compaq Computer Corp., the big Houston PC maker
that stumbled badly last year and lost its lead in domestic sales
to Dell, announced plans last month to increase its direct sales.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Michael S. Dell, the company's founder and
chief executive, said it was not feasible to believe the company
could consistently post the sort of growth of past years, now that
it has annual revenue of more than $25 billion. ``Let's say $25
billion grows 40 percent a year. After 5 to 10 years, it has become
bigger than the whole economy,'' Dell said. ``Certainly as we
approach a higher share of the market, our growth rate will look
more and more like the market's growth rate.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We're still growing at two to three times the
market's growth rate, and there are new markets for us to expand
into.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that results for the first fiscal quarter this year
would not be much better than what the company released Thursday.
``We don't expect that the first-quarter bottom line will be
considerably different than the fourth quarter,'' he said.

AT NATIONALS, INNOVATION AND TRADITION COMPETE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ There is a conflicting sense of desperation and
possibility at the national figure skating championships, of
uncertain champions and resourceful challengers, of rapid,
inevitable change that is being faced with unsettling anticipation
and eager innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The pairs short program was so feeble on Wednesday that the
winners, Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, were the only couple to
achieve every score above 5.0. The male half of one lowly pair
competed in a khaki military uniform. The judges, however, had no
time for sergeants and scored the routine with 2s, skating's
equivalent of a court martial.
</P>
<P>
   A certain buzz was generated Thursday night, as Michael Weiss
and Timothy Goebel met in the men's short program. The
two-and-a-half-minute routines counted for one-third of the scoring
and served as the preliminary for Saturday's long program, which
will count for two-thirds of the total score and will pit the
forces of art and sport, of gradual evolution and immediate
upheaval, of clear direction and inventive unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss is the reigning national champion and a bronze medalist at
the 1999 world championships. He is slightly wooden in his skating,
but he chooses music smartly and can be engagingly interpretive and
athletic. Goebel, the 1999 national bronze medalist, is
artistically callow, but he has brought a pleasurable anarchy to
skating this season, becoming the first person to perform three
jumps of four revolutions in the same long program. He also had a
quadruple jump planned Thursday night for his short program.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Weiss was the provocateur, challenging Todd
Eldredge by attempting to become the first American to perform a
quadruple jump. Goebel, however, beat him to it. Now, he can land
not one quad, but three. And Weiss, whose season has been
compromised by mediocrity and a stress fracture in his left foot,
has undergone a sort of role reversal. At 23, he now represents the
old guard, calling for moderate adaptation instead of chaotic
mutation. He plans to have one quad, the quadruple toe loop, in his
long program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of sound like a broken record, but none of these people
who are trying all these elements is the world champion,'' said
Weiss, who is from Fairfax, Va., and has landed the quad only once
in a major competition. ``The world champion is still doing a
quadruple toe loop and a well-rounded program.''
</P>
<P>
   While he said he appreciated innovative skating, Weiss added,
``Trying a five-rotation jump or three, four or five quads right
now, I don't know if that's going to be the world champion. And the
ultimate goal in figure skating is to be the world champion. Quads
are obviously emphasized by the public and the media, but the
people who are important are the judges.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Weiss is correct, said Goebel, who is 19 and
lives in Lakewood, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, which may give him a
home-rink advantage at the national championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to have well-rounded programs,'' Goebel said.
``But this is still a sport, and the quad is very important.'' He
pointed out that Aleksei Yagudin of Russia essentially won the 1999
world championship over his countryman Yevgeny Plushenko because
Plushenko missed his quadruple jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, first, a sport,'' Goebel said. ``Jumps determine a
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on jumping has been decried by some skating
purists who worry that line and edge quality and the position of
the back and shoulders, the artistic side, is becoming less
relevant. But the quads represent perhaps the most successful
attempt yet at objectifying a subjective sport. Even if the general
public cannot distinguish a lutz from an axel, any spectator can
appreciate a feat that requires an athlete to elevate, complete
four rotations in less than a second and land balanced on a thin
blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people might not appreciate a skater's style or
understand the choice of music, but it's obvious when someone is
doing a quad,'' said Goebel, who is a freshman at Case Western
Reserve University here and would eventually like to attend medical
school. ``They know the triple axel and the quad, and they are so
enthusiastic when people land them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, at Skate America, Goebel did the unprecedented in his
long program, landing a quadruple salchow-triple-toe combination,
followed individually by a quadruple toe loop and a quadruple
salchow. Performing three quads has been liberating, he said. If he
misses one, he knows he has two more chances. And, being ahead of
the game technically, he can afford to spend more time improving
artistically. His jumps need much more refined connection, which
was reflected in his 12th-place finish at the 1999 world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his teen-age sensibility spurs him to attack, not defend.
Caution is anathema. For now, the sport may be hindered most by its
equipment. The leather boots and steel blades have remained
essentially the same for a half century or more. Some people,
though, have begun experimenting with springier blades. And as the
equipment improves, the boundaries are certain to expand again.
Goebel would next like to push the envelope with a jump of five
revolutions, the quintuple salchow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to try it would be amazing,'' he said. ``It's something
that's so far beyond what people have tried before. It would be my
experiment. I probably wouldn't be able to land one, but why not
try.''

 &HT;    Griffey `finally home' with Reds
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Ken Griffey Jr. stared lovingly for a long,
dramatic moment at a red cap with a black bill in his hands, then
tugged the Cincinnati Reds hat on his head.
</P>
<P>
   It was 7:45 Thursday night in a steamy sauna called the Crosley
Room on the executive level of Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm finally home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the bargain price of one problem-child pitcher, one
.256-hitting outfielder and two low-level minor leaguers, the
Cincinnati Reds wedged Griffey, arguably baseball's best player,
away from the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   You can go home again . . . which is all the 30-year-old Griffey
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he tossed aside at least $35.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 years in Seattle, Griffey wanted to be close to his
father, Reds' coach Ken Griffey, and his family. He said no when
the Mariners offered him $148 million to stay in Seattle for eight
more years.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to play where he grew up, running through the Reds
clubhouse in a miniature Reds uniform, swiping red pop and bubble
gum from the players' lounge, while his father, an outfielder for
The Big Red Machine, shared a lineup card with Johnny Bench, Joe
Morgan, Tony Perez, Pete Rose, Dave Concepcion and George Foster.
</P>
<P>
   So he told the Mariners to trade him to the Reds and it was done
Thursday _ right-handed pitcher Brett Tomko, outfielder Mike
Cameron, minor-league infielder Antonio Perez and minor-league
pitcher Jake Meyer to Seattle for Junior.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the Reds had to sign him to a multiyear contract,
and that was done quickly. Griffey, risking the ire of the players
union for selling himself short, took a nine-year $112.5 million
deal, with a club option for a 10th year.
</P>
<P>
   He also made it possible for the cash-strapped Reds by taking
the money over a 25-year period _ $8 million a year for eight years
of his playing contract and $16.5 million the final year, then
yearly payments through 2025, when he is 55. More than 50 percent
is deferred over 16 years, after the nine-year contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey tugged on a Reds jersey _ no name or number on the back.
He ran his fingers over the black wishbone `C' on the left side of
his chest and said, ``The last time I put on this uniform I was
8.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you beat us, 12-0, in the Father-Sons game,'' Griffey Sr.
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those years with the Mariners, the first thing I checked
was to see how the Reds did, what Barry Larkin did,'' Junior said.
``It's my hometown, I grew up here. It's not about how much money
you make, it is where you are happy. I hope to have the same luck
my father did here and win some championships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Luck?'' Senior said, faking anger. ``I'm just proud to have a
son who makes a decision based on being happy and being with his
family, things more important than money.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what is special about playing for the Reds, Griffey
pointed to his father and said, ``Him . . . and my family. We can
bring my son (Trey) to the ballpark. My grandmother, who lives in
Cincinnati and has seen me play about three times, can come to
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey was voted to the American League All-Star team the last
10 years and was AL MVP in 1997. He has won 10 straight Gold
Gloves, emblematic of defensive excellence. He has averaged 52 home
runs and 142 RBIs the last three seasons while averaging .299 over
his 11 seasons with Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   He has 398 career home runs and needs to average only 40 home
runs during the nine years of his Cincinnati contract to pass
all-time leader Hank Aaron (755).
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Cincinnati Moeller High School graduate is a
potent piece to plop into the No. 3 spot in the batting order in
front of new clean-up hitter Dante Bichette. Barry Larkin remains
No. 2, while first baseman Sean Casey drops from No. 3 to No. 5,
giving the Reds a gauntlet of proficient hitters for National
League pitchers to traverse.
</P>
<P>
   Junior realizes the Reds won 96 games last season and came
within one game of winning the National League Central
championship. He is pleased the club didn't have to wreck its
nucleus to get him.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys did it without me last year,'' he said. ``I just
want to help out any way I can, when I can. I want to do the same
things I have been doing. The World Series? Soon. I want to get
there and wear a ring just like my dad does.''
</P>
<P>
   The smallish Crosley Room was stuffed with humanity for
Griffey's coming-out party, including every Hamilton County
commissioner and every member of Cincinnati City Council lined up
behind the podium for the photo-op.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Jim Bowden, the man who worked out the trade and
made bringing Junior home to Cincinnati a personal mission, opened
the news conference by saying, ``February 10, 2000. February 10,
2000. This day will go down in Reds history and will go down in
major league history as the day one of the biggest trades in our
sport took place _ when the Michael Jordan of baseball came home to
Cincinnati. He is the player of the decade, an All-Century player.
A player who was born in Cincinnati, has become one of the best
players in our sport, has come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lindner, the 80-year-old Cincinnati business scion who
became chief operating officer last year, signed off on the
financial aspects of the deal. And he had something else for
Griffey, pulling it out of his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have for you a pair of cuff links,'' said the man whose
personal fortune is $800 million. ``I wear them every day. They
have inscribed on them, ``Only in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, only in America.

IN NEW YORK'S SENATE RACE, UPSTATE EMERGES AS KEY BATTLEGROUND 
</HEADLINE>

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y. _ By the usual rules of statewide political
campaigns, upstate New York is for Republicans. The green and
gritty expanse of small towns and cities, farmland and mountains
that roll north and west from Westchester County to Canada has for
50 years been the part of New York where Republicans could turn to
counterbalance the lopsided Democratic vote that inevitably emerges
from New York City. For Democrats, upstate was a place to just hold
down the losses.
</P>
<P>
   But as New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani arrived in this
suburb of Buffalo for a quick visit Thursday evening _ following
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who campaigned here Monday _ it was clear
that the geographic forces that once governed politics in New York
have been turned on their head. For reasons having to do with the
peculiarities of this U.S. Senate race and its candidates, upstate
New York is in play as it rarely has been before; if aides to
Clinton and Giuliani agree on anything now, it is that the outcome
of their race is likely to be determined beyond New York City and
its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks the suburbs are key,'' Sen. Charles E.
Schumer, D-N.Y., who toppled the Republican incumbent Sen. Alfonse
M. D'Amato in 1998, said in an interview, noting what once had been
common wisdom about the geopolitics of New York. ``But to me,
upstate is the key battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, this is, to a large extent, the politics of
necessity. Giuliani's popularity in New York City, and his proven
success at drawing the enthusiastic support of Democratic voters in
both of his mayoral victories, threaten to cut Clinton off from
what should be an easy source of votes, forcing her to turn here to
make up the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, and against most Republicans, such a gambit by a
Democratic candidate might prove futile, given the region's decided
Republican registration advantage and generally conservative edge.
In this contest, though, many politicians, pollsters and academics
have concluded the advantage of Giuliani's Republican party
affiliation is offset by what he is most famously known as: the
hard-fighting mayor of New York City, a place that has long been
viewed by voters here as both culturally alien and as a drain on
the state treasury.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't vote for a New York City mayor to run the state,''
said Clarence Scholes, 62, a state prison guard who was eating a
cheeseburger Tuesday at a restaurant in Albion, where Clinton had
stopped by to shake hands and have breakfast. ``New York City is a
whole lot different than New York state. What might be all right
for New York wouldn't be all right for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Josefson, an assistant professor of political science at
Syracuse University, noted, ``Democrats have historically gotten
killed upstate,'' but added, ``Giuliani is so associated with New
York City that it is really possible to me that that could be
dampened this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that the battleground is shifting was clear even
before Giuliani arrived in Williamsville on Thursday night, in
preparation for a news conference Friday morning in which he will
join a lineup of elected officials celebrating the inauguration of
cut-rate airline service from New York to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after announcing her candidacy in Westchester County on
Sunday, headed straight upstate; she has not spent a day in New
York City or its suburbs since. Giuliani's aides Thursday traveled
from Albany to Syracuse to Buffalo, unveiling ``the mayor's newest
upstate ad,'' as the press announcement put it, this one on
domestic violence, the latest in an unusually early stream of
advertisements that Giuliani's campaign started placing in upstate
markets in October. The tag line on the mayor's advertisements is,
``Rudy Giuliani: For All New York.''
</P>
<P>
   By the count of Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, the
first lady has made 30 trips upstate since last summer. Her first
major policy speech, on Monday in Buffalo, was aimed directly at
the issues that have proved central in upstate contests:
deregulating utilities, lowering in-state airfares and creating
jobs by investing in broadband Internet lines. And Giuliani, after
being pressed by some upstate supporters worried that he was
conducting a long-distance campaign here (with television
advertisements and radio interviews by telephone), plans to
campaign upstate for several days next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fight like the dickens up there to get our
message out,'' said Adam Goodman, Giuliani's media adviser. Over at
the Clinton campaign headquarters, de Blasio said: ``We're going to
be pounding away upstate. No Democrat running for statewide office
has ever done what we are doing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not expected to win in this part of the state, which
accounted for 46 percent of the electorate in 1998. It remains
decidedly Republican: in a survey of voters leaving the polls after
the 1998 race for Senate, 40 percent identified themselves as
Republicans, compared with the 31 percent who said they were
Democrats. Statewide, Democrats hold a 41 to 32 percent
registration edge over Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And even in losing to Schumer by nearly 10 points in 1998,
D'Amato still captured 50 percent of the upstate vote. In 1992,
when he was re-elected in a contest against Robert Abrams, the
former state attorney general, D'Amato won 53 percent of the vote.
Polls now show Giuliani with about 50 percent of the vote upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's supporters say they doubt that Clinton can cut into
that edge, repeatedly arguing that the simple fact that until a
month ago she had not lived in New York, and what they describe as
her cultural differences with the state, will counteract any
disadvantage Giuliani may have because of his identification with
New York City. ``That would be the case for anybody but Hillary,''
said Rep. John Sweeney, a Republican from Troy. ``Hillary Clinton
is going to have a hard time, frankly, connecting with upstate
voters. I believe their strategy is try to play the gender card and
try to connect with working women.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But a few early signs have given the mayor's supporters pause
and they account for what Giuliani's aides said will be his
stepped-up attention to the region.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Giuliani's investment in television time in an
effort to lock down upstate has not yet appeared to have taken
hold, pollsters say. Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist
College Institute for Public Opinion poll in Poughkeepsie, said he
had detected no gains for Giuliani since he began advertising in
October, and that he was struck by the high number of undecided
voters, 17 percent, which he attributed to uneasiness about
Giuliani's association with New York City. ``Upstate is being
offered, in a sense, dual carpetbaggers,'' Miringoff asserted.
Similarly, Josefson, the political scientist from Syracuse, said,
``The constant worry you hear here is that the state is sending
huge amounts of money to New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Those observations were reflected in conversations throughout
upstate New York this week. ``I don't buy this carpetbagger stuff
at all,'' said Ed Bujanowski, 24, a Republican from Buffalo,
referring to one of Giuliani's criticisms of Clinton. ``Giuliani is
from the state of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Kieran P. Mahoney, the Republican consultant who worked as a
chief strategist for Pataki and D'Amato, said that he routinely
invokes the specter of New York City in running legislative
campaigns upstate. ``I've run campaigns in upstate New York against
guys by simply saying the other guy voted for `x' for New York
City,'' Mahoney said. ``Just flat out.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's position as a Republican candidate may be further
complicated by ideology. The positions that have helped him in New
York City _ his support of abortion rights, gay rights, gun control
and rent regulations _ are problematic upstate, as is his
endorsement of Mario M. Cuomo in 1994 over Gov. George Pataki, a
position that continues to rankle some Republican leaders here. The
likelihood that Giuliani will not capture the Conservative Party
endorsement also threatens to underline any upstate ideological
uneasiness with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton so far has also been helped by what one senior adviser
described as the ``celebrity factor'': her visits here tend to be
huge news, particularly in small communities, where voters have
never seen a governor, much less a first lady. Her trip to Buffalo
on Monday took up most of the front page of the Buffalo News, which
presented three photographs of the first lady from an interview she
did with the newspaper's political reporter, Robert J. McCarthy, as
well as two separate articles.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani would not be the first New York City mayor who found it
tough going in New York state: Ed Koch's failed campaign for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1982 foundered famously
north of the Westchester County line. But Goodman, here Thursday
night to join Giuliani in unveiling a new advertisement, argued
that Giuliani's record in New York City would overcome any baggage
that comes with that association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling I have, and I think what we're hearing on the
trail, is if he can do here what he did there, hallelujah,''
Goodman said. ``I think that goes beyond the traditional
upstate-down, big-city-mayor-running precedent. I think he breaks
through that.''

FATIGUE HITS TROJANS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's starting five players have tried to keep a
stiff upper lip regarding fatigue, but forward Brian Scalabrine
finally admitted Wednesday night that he has become physically worn
down after averaging 38.8 minutes in Pacific-10 Conference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get my feet and legs back,'' Scalabrine said. ``I
just don't have second and third gear. I'm in first all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine said the loss of strength in his legs has caused him
to change his game recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty reluctant to drive to the hoop,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine has been ordered by USC coach Henry Bibby to stay off
his legs as the Trojans take three days off before returning to
practice Sunday. USC does not play again until Thursday at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all I look at is an eight-day break,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Forward David Bluthenthal, who is averaging 37.3 minutes in
Pac-10 games, was also eyeing the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to do anything,'' Bluthenthal said. ``I think
it's more physical than mental. It will be a good rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Major minutes: USC guard Jeff Trepagnier is averaging 36.8
minutes per game, the highest total since Derrick Dowell averaged
36.8 in 1987. The current school record for minutes per game is
38.2, by Wayne Carlander in 1985. USC has had four players average
on a single team average more than 30 minutes three times since
1983, when records started being kept.
</P>
<P>
   If injured forward Sam Clancy is included, this will be the
first Trojan team to have five players average more than 30 minutes
per game.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Scalabrine was asked what changed between USC's
victory over UCLA last month at the Sports Arena, and Wednesday's
Bruin victory at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Clancy, he was the big difference,'' Scalabrine said.
``His rebounding and shotblocking makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic number: The Trojans (13-9, 6-4) realize that after losing
to UCLA,they probably need to win five of their final eight games
to reach the NCAATournament.
</P>
<P>
   That means winning all four home games, and finding a road
victory, with the best hope being at either Arizona State or Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can get two wins on the road, then we don't have
to have the pressure tow in all our home games,'' Granville said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get one of these two road games in Arizona and
then get a win at home,'' Bluthenthal added.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby continues to refuse to look down the line and ponder how
many games the Trojans must win to make the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I'm just concerned that we're playing hard,''
Bibby said. ``I can't look at where we're going to be. That's all I
can say.''

(With WEB-ATTACK) 
(js) 
 By MATT RICHTEL and SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Computer security experts said Thursday that
evidence may now suggest that the three days of attacks on major
Web sites had been the work of more than one person or group.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Internet community sifted aggressively through the
electronic rubble for leads, computer experts said that it would be
extremely difficult even to determine which computers initiated the
attacks, let alone find the responsible parties.
</P>
<P>
   CERT, a federally financed computer security organization
formerly known as the Computer Emergency Response Team, said
Thursday that it was no longer seeing an unusual number of reports
of attacks. From Monday through Wednesday, service on several
leading Web sites, including those of the Yahoo portal, the ETrade
Group brokerage firm, the eBay auction company and Time
Warner's &UR;  &LR; CNN.com news site, were disrupted and in some cases
halted by assaults involving dozens or more computers flooding them
with data feeds.
</P>
<P>
   But security experts said Web sites and the Internet in general
would remain vulnerable for the near future because so many
organizations were failing to take steps to prevent their computers
from being used by vandals to initiate the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One government official said Thursday that tougher laws might be
necessary to combat such attacks. ``We don't consider this a
prank,'' Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said. ``These are very
serious matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, it was disclosed that more major Web sites than
had been previously known were hit on Wednesday, the last day of
the assaults. Those included Excite(AT)Home, a provider of
high-speed access over cable modems, which was attacked early
Wednesday evening despite having taken precautions to defend its
network.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other major e-commerce companies were hit with
attacks on Wednesday, according to IFsec, a computer security firm
in New York, though it declined to name the companies, noting that
one of them was a client.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more of these than have appeared in the popular
media,'' said David M. Remnitz, chief executive of IFsec.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, users of Internet Relay Chat, or IRC, said that the
forum has been under intense fire in the last two weeks by attacks
similar to those levied at the e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, network service providers and investigators continued
analyzing evidence, including the packets of data that had been
used to overwhelm and paralyze the victim sites.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security experts at Stanford University said the
preliminary evidence suggested that the attacks may be the work of
more than one person or group.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Brumley, assistant computer security officer for
Stanford, said the type of data included in the packets used to
attack Yahoo on Monday differed from the data used in the Tuesday
assault on eBay.com the online auction site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attacks were just completely different between those two
days,'' Brumley said. ``The people who did Yahoo are different than
the people who did eBay and CNN.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Network service providers said the recent assaults included two
types of attacks, further suggesting that more than one party may
have be involved. Both are what are known as denial of service
attacks because they prevent the targeted site from serving its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, known as a SYN flood, attackers hack into _ and
install software on _ a large number of computers, then use those
machines to bombard the victim site with requests to start an
e-commerce session. The large number of requests overwhelms the
victim's servers, preventing customers from gaining access to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent any tracing of these requests, the vandals employ a
practice called spoofing, which alters the initiating address.
</P>
<P>
   The second type, known as a smurf attack, again involves making
use of compromised machines, but it also employs a large
third-party network of computers to ``amplify'' the data used in
the attack and greatly increases the effectiveness of the assault.
It is believed that Stanford's network of computers may have been
used in this way in the attack on Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts say it was simple to configure networks so they
could not be used in a smurf attack, yet many sites do not know to
take these steps.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security experts noted that the large numbers of
computers used to initiate the attacks this week make tracing those
attack very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point there's been so much traffic thrown at these
people that it's pretty hard to do a trace,'' said Joel de la Garza
of the Kroll-O'Gara Information Security Group, a risk mitigation
company.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, companies whose computers are hijacked and used as
platforms for the assault often have no idea of the problem, even
as the assault is going on, computer security experts said. Vandals
can activate the assault from a remote location, and to a company
or individual whose computer is being used, the only impact may
appear to be a slowdown in network activity.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis that more than one group was at work called into
question the conclusion of some security experts who were initially
skeptical that following Monday's attack on Yahoo, multiple vandals
would have been able to muster large ``copy cat'' assaults on other
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Victim companies and security experts said Thursday that in some
cases the attacks seemed more complicated than originally thought _
reinforcing how difficult they are to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Excite(AT)Home, for example, said it sought to take
precautionary measures in light of the earlier attacks but was
unable to keep its Web site from being crippled for at least half
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of our knowledge, a site cannot take preventative
measures against the attacks without the help of others,'' said
Kelly Distefano, an Excite(AT)Home spokeswoman. She said the
company would have needed more cooperation from the companies that
provide Excite network services.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Neumann, principal scientist at SRI International in Menlo
Park, Calif., reiterated that the success of the attacks has shown
that Internet sites are not taking adequate precautions to prevent
themselves from being used for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time people woke up,'' he said. ``People are racing to do
electronic commerce on the Net without any understanding of the
risks _ and there are much greater risks than we've seen here.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rocker's words earning him a 73-day suspension
appeared in a national magazine for all to read. His words
concerning his remarks and his subsequent suspension were recited
in private, aimed only at the arbitrator who will decide Rocker's
immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, the Atlanta Braves' closer, testified Thursday at the
hearing that resulted from the players association's challenge of
the suspension that Commissioner Bud Selig levied against Rocker on
Jan. 31 _ all of spring training, which for pitchers lasts 45 days,
and the first 28 days of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Shyam Das, the arbitrator, will decide if Selig's disciplinary
action was appropriate or if it should be overturned or lightened.
His ruling is expected to come near the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who in his comments published in Sports Illustrated in
December denigrated foreigners and many other segments of society,
was one of three witnesses on the second and last day of the
hearing at the Major League Baseball offices on Park Avenue in New
York. Kevin Hallinan, baseball's chief security executive, was
management's final witness, testifying about the increased burden
Rocker's presence would present for the Braves if his suspension
were reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was the union's first witness, and Scott Sanderson, a
former major-league pitcher, was the union's only other witness.
Sanderson testified about the ill effects an abbreviated spring
training can have on a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Under the suspension, Rocker, a 25-year-old left-hander, can
begin working out in the Braves' extended spring training on April
3, the day the major-league season begins, and then work with their
minor-league teams and join the Braves on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration panel consists of three members, but Das will
decide the appeal because he is the only impartial member. The
other two members are Donald Fehr, head of the players association,
and Robert Manfred, the owners' chief labor executive.
</P>
<P>
   Fehr declined to comment on the proceedings. ``We're in the
middle of an arbitration,'' he said. Asked about the feelings of
the others present at the hearing, he said: ``I wouldn't comment on
what anyone else felt or thought. I can only tell you that the case
has been submitted. There has to be the process by which a decision
is reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Manfred, when asked, declined to discuss Rocker's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the entire grievance process has been handled in the
way that you'd hope that the grievance process would be handled,''
he said. ``We had a disagreement; it's been handled in a
businesslike way.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the hearing, Stan Kasten, the Braves'
president, testified about the negative impact the club says
Rocker's remarks have had and will have on the Braves' economics.
Asked Thursday about those problems, real or anticipated, Kasten
declined to talk about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of discussing it at all,'' he said by
telephone, meaning any aspect of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere surrounding the second day of the hearing was
less circuslike than that of the first day. Fewer police officers
were on hand outside 245 Park Ave., and fewer office workers and
passers-by lingered on the sidewalk protesting Rocker's presence or
waiting for something to happen or for someone to emerge from the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, in fact, entered the building almost unnoticed, going
through a construction area entrance. About an hour earlier, he
arrived at the players association offices on E. 49th St. Before
entering that building, he put his arm around a stunned news
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you doing, buddy?'' he said. ``Want me to do anything for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The photographer was Robert Mecea, who came to this country from
Romania. ``I didn't tell him I'm an immigrant,'' Mecea said.''

TRUMP'S PRESIDENTIAL BID SEEMS TO HINGE ON REFORM PARTY'S
SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star ST. LOUIS _ Holding court at a high-dollar
reception high above the Kiel Center arena floor, the possible
presidential candidate asks for questions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You can just shoot,'' he says. ``You can ask vicious
questions, sexually oriented questions. Whatever you want to ask
me.''
</P>
<P>
   There's laughter, and then a hand pops up. ``Do you like East
Coast or West Coast girls?''
</P>
<P>
   A question, it seems, that could be posed to only one White
House contender _ the seemingly indomitable Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire developer, the legendary playboy, the man with
the piercing gaze and the orange-fizz hair and an ego as big as all
New York, pauses not a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like 'em all,'' he proclaims, then remembers where he is.
``Even the ones in the middle, too. I like 'em all.''
</P>
<P>
   More laughter, then another question: Are you serious about
running for president?
</P>
<P>
   Now /{there's/} a question. And Trump answers it with the polish
of a seasoned pol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like I am,'' he says. ``No, I am serious. I'll
be announcing next week something, and we'll see what happens. I
hope I have your vote if I run.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no, yes, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   And so went the tycoon's public flirtation with a run for the
nation's highest office Tuesday during his one-day visit to
Missouri. One minute, it seemed clear that he was running to lead
the ticket of the Reform Party, the Ross Perot-founded alternative
to the Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The next, he was signaling that he may not, that his
presidential bid is like another of his fancy toys: something to
play with for a while, then discard when he gets bored.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed messages began shortly after Trump's Boeing 727, the
one with his name emblazoned in gold on the fuselage and with the
framed Renoir inside, touched down. Inside the terminal, Trump
unveiled his plan for universal health coverage, a move that seemed
to indicate interest in running. But he made his announcement not
in New York or Washington where he would have received scads of
media attention, but at a private aviation office in Missouri
before a crowd of mostly local reporters.
</P>
<P>
   And Trump seemed to have it all backward. Usually candidates
announce for president and /{then/} release a detailed issues
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be different, I guess,'' Trump explained.
</P>
<P>
   He showed that he could be earnest, as when he spelled out his
plan for eliminating the national debt. At other times, he was
blatantly unpresidential, uttering swear words with no apparent
hesitation before a crowd of thousands attending a motivational
seminar.
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear is that Trump is waiting to see what happens
this weekend at a Reform Party meeting in Nashville, Tenn. Perot
hard-liners want to remove national party chairman Jack Gargan, who
was installed with the blessing of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura,
the party's top office-holder.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has called a news conference for Friday in which he may
announce he's quitting the party. An aide to Trump, who is an ally
of Ventura's, suggested Thursday that Trump may run under the
banner of a new party the governor may form.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time Trump bolted parties. A one-time
Republican, Trump left the GOP last October saying it was ``too
crazy right.''
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the Reform Party's problems is an ongoing
struggle between Ventura and Perot over control of the party and
the $13 million in federal money that will flow to the party's
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a bit of disunity as we've all noted within the
party itself,'' Trump said. ``We're looking to see what happens
over the next short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, probably the party is the biggest factor''
affecting his decision, Trump said.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect, the critics say, that's only one factor.
There's also the question of his highly publicized divorces _
remember Marla Maples and Ivana Trump? _ and his ongoing soap-opera
of a love life that seems to revolve around what Trump himself
describes as ``very beautiful'' women.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Trump made headlines when his on-again,
off-again latest girlfriend, Slovenian model Malania Knauss,
conducted a telephone interview with radio jock Howard Stern
reportedly while wearing very little. During the interview, she
bragged about her sex life with Trump, and Trump himself joked
about the small swimsuit Knauss wore at resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the obvious concern of whether a casino owner, such
as Trump, should be running the country. And why would voters back
a man who's never held public office, whose credibility rests
solely on the mega deals he's pulled off and whose claim to fame is
his billion-dollar ego and blunt-talking persona?
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, Trump has answers. Lots of them. He
dismisses his marital status.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said often, I think this is a different day and age
than even 20 years ago,'' Trump said. ``And I don't think that
would be of any concern to anybody at this point. I have four great
children, and I have great relationships with my children.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether a casino owner should be in politics, Trump points
out in his new book, ``Trump: The America We Deserve,'' that the
gambling business is tightly regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you can say about Trump, as the holder of a
casino-gaming license, is that I'm 100 percent clean _ something
you can't say with certainty about our current group of
presidential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   His status as a political outsider is only a plus, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am definitely a different look,'' he writes in his book.
``I'm not prepackaged. I'm not plastic. I'm not scripted. And I'm
not `handled.' I tell you what I think. It's quite a departure from
the usual office-seeking pols. Maybe the voters would find it
refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   He is notoriously blunt, but says he's unconcerned that past
quotes will haunt him. He once called former Connecticut Gov.
Lowell Weicker a ``fat slob.'' (``At least I'm accurate,'' Trump
said later.) He bashes Pat Buchanan, his possible Reform Party
presidential rival, as a Nazi lover. He rips Democrat Bill Bradley
as ``almost Marxist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd make a lousy president,'' Trump said.
</P>
<P>
   Trump has big plans for Washington that only begin with his
universal health plan. At most stops, he stresses his call for a 14
percent tax for people with a net worth greater than $10 million, a
move that would quickly pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   He backs school vouchers, is an abortion rights advocate and
calls the NAFTA trade agreement a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   He promises a more forceful foreign policy, saying he would
arrest Fidel Castro on murder charges if he ever left Cuba and
would bomb North Korea's nuclear reactor to undermine that nation's
ability to produce dangerous weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At a Tony Robbins motivational seminar Tuesday night, an
appearance that stuck $100,000 in his pocket, Trump offered 10
rules for success. ``Be paranoid,'' was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that sounds terrible,'' Trump explained. ``But you have to
realize that people, sadly, sadly, are very vicious. You think
we're so different from the lions in the jungle? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   As Trump speaks, a reporter asks Robbins about Trump's potential
presidential bid. Robbins, too, is unsure whether the tycoon is
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running the greatest ad campaign in history,'' Robbins
says. ``I think he's having the time of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Trump's chief aim is to promote his chief causes, not to
actually get in the race, Robbins says. He points out that Trump is
woefully short in the likability department. A December CBS News
poll put Trump's favorable-unfavorable ratio at 7 to 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I'd say about Donald is he is what he is,''
Robbins said. ``He doesn't try to pull the wool over your eyes.
It's refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: Is he in the race or not? In the
middle of his 30-minute address to the Robbins crowd, Trump asks,
``By the way, has anybody heard I'm running for president? Has
anybody heard?''
</P>
<P>
   The questions hangs in midair. Trump does not elaborate. A few
audience members laugh. Reporters wonder whether Trump is making a
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, an aide says his boss was joking. Wait until next
week, he says. Wait until next week.

   The coordinator of Sen. John McCain's Maryland campaign, Anthony
P. Caligiuri, says the surge of interest in the candidate might
require doubling the organization's phone lines _ to two. But
Caligiuri said he had no plans to move the headquarters from his
living room.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ford, McCain's Ohio chairman, said he had also been swamped
with calls and e-mails but had no plans to move the headquarters
from his house in Heath, about 40 miles east of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a prisoner of war in the same North Vietnamese camp as
McCain, says he oversees an all-volunteer effort and has no plans
to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a political neophyte,'' Ford said. ``I'm doing this
because I know John.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the same in pretty much all the Super Tuesday states. Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas has the support and resources of the
Republican establishment. McCain has eager volunteers. Even in the
plum of that day's contests, California, McCain has no organization
to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   He has his share of support from powerful party members, but
state by state, Bush has a larger share.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Bush has the backing of six of the states' eight
Republican House members and of its Republican senator, Paul
Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Neither campaign has yet spent much effort or money in any of
these states, but the Bush campaign is clearly in a better position
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, its campaign received about $750,000 in 1999. The
McCain campaign got a fraction of that.

 &HT;    Griffey a boost for fans, team finances
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ An exuberant caller to a local radio station here
said the Cincinnati Reds acquisition of Ken Griffey Jr. felt like
``every Christmas rolled into one.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Reds feel _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Though the team's Chief Operating Officer, John Allen, declined
to say how much of a financial boost he expected the young
superstar to give the small-market franchise, he anticipates it
will be ``significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Reds had officially announced the Griffey Jr. trade
Thursday evening, the team's offices were flooded with phone calls
from fans and businesses alike. The fans wanted to buy tickets. The
businesses wanted to buy advertising space or participate in
promotions or sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the phone lines got so clogged at times, employees
had to use cell phones to dial out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calls were extremely brisk today in the ticket office,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say how many tickets were sold or what games,
besides Opening Day, were sold out. Allen said the $112.5 million
Griffey deal wasn't contingent on every game being sold out, but
when crunching the numbers ``we predicted a bump in attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchandising sales are expect to rise as well. Allen said
department stores such as JC Penney's and Sears have been calling
for weeks to find out if they should stock up on Reds' uniforms
with Griffey's name on the back. (The slugger hasn't yet decided on
a number. He said he'd like Tony Perez's No. 24 if the former Reds
great agreed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the merchandising is going to be huge,'' Allen said,
calling Griffey the Michael Jordan of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Allen wouldn't predict whether the Reds would break an
attendance record this year but he said his expectations are high.
If ticket sales meet his expectations, what kind of revenue does he
anticipate?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know that answer until we get the response of the
fans,'' he said ``But we have passionate fans.''
</P>
<P>
   New Reds team owner and multimillionaire Carl H. Lindner called
the Griffey trade a ``business deal'' as well as ``a gift to the
city.'' However, he noted, ``This isn't the way I make my living.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the franchise didn't expect ``a tremendous windfall''
from the move but it comes at a good time. The Reds have a strong
nucleus of young players and are building a new stadium, which is
scheduled to be completed in 2003. There, they'll have seat
licenses to sell and perhaps a stadium naming rights deal to make.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the conservative Allen said the team's financial goals
remain modest: ``Not to lose money,'' he said. ``We're going to act
fiscally responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds radio contract with WLW ends after this season and its
TV deal with FoxSports Ohio in 2004. Allen said the team has an
option to extend the radio contract one year.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's presence should certainly give the club more leverage
when time comes to negotiate those contracts.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the ballplayer who grew up running around the Reds
clubhouse when his father, Ken Sr., was a part of the Big Red
Machine, said his desire to play in his childhood hometown was not
driven by money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never about the money,'' Griffey Jr. said. ``It doesn't
matter how much money you make. It's where you feel happy.''

TWO TOP RESEARCHERS JOIN THE DISNEY EXODUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two of Walt Disney Co.'s top research scientists
said Thursday that they were leaving to form their own technology
company, becoming the latest in a series of defections from the big
entertainment company.
</P>
<P>
   Bran Ferren, head of research and development, and Danny Hillis,
vice president for research and development, are starting a company
called Applied Minds that will develop technology and consult for
others. They declined to say more about what the company would do,
only that they intended to ``change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney has experienced a run of executive departures, including
the recent one of Joe Roth, the head of its movie studio. Analysts
have said this is partly because of cost pressures or difficulty
working for its chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, but also
because Disney executives are highly sought after by other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Imagineering, the unit that designs theme park rides
to which Ferren was attached, has lost Ken Wong, its president;
Eddie Sotto, a top designer; and Mitch C. Hill, the chief financial
officer, among others, in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Ferren and Hillis said their parting was amicable. ``It's not a
comment on Disney,'' Ferren said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Disney will be a client of Applied Minds, and the new
company will be on the Imagineering campus in Glendale, Calif. And
while neither Disney nor Applied Minds would comment, there is a
fair probability that Disney is also an investor in the new
company. Ferren will continue to run Disney's research and
development as a consultant until a replacement is found.
</P>
<P>
   Hillis discounted talk that people were leaving Imagineering
because the focus was now more on the bottom line than on creating
new attractions. ``I would say Imagineering is still a happening
place,'' he said. But, he added, there are just too many
opportunities for technical people in small Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ferren, 47, had run his own research and development company,
which was bought by Disney in 1993. He helped develop the
DisneyQuest virtual reality attractions, and worked on advanced
television and Internet services and numerous rides. He created the
Disney Fellow positions to attract noted computer scientists like
Marvin Minsky, a professor at MIT, and Hillis.
</P>
<P>
   Hillis, 44, who joined Disney in 1996, had founded Thinking
Machines Corp., which developed an innovative supercomputer but
which ultimately failed.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said in a statement about Ferren: ``As a result of his
efforts, we are positioned to take advantage of the latest
technologies in our entertainment offerings. Bran and Danny will
continue to work with us on a variety of projects and we look
forward to a continued strong relationship.''

MARINO VOIDS HIS CONTRACT, AND BILLS DROP THOMAS AND REED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a day when Dan Marino, the NFL's leading career passer,
voided the final two years of his contract, the Buffalo Bills broke
their last ties with their American Football Conference
championship teams of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Buffalo cut defensive end Bruce Smith, running back
Thurman Thomas and wide receiver Andre Reed, all Pro Bowl players.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills felt pressured by the salary cap, needing to trim more
than $10 million by Friday. The three players hoped to finish their
careers with Buffalo, but all said they plan to continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   With Marino, the situation is not as clear. Dave Wannstedt, the
new Dolphins head coach, has said privately that it would be best
if the 17-year veteran retires since the team is putting in a new
offense, but nobody has been overtly influencing Marino to end his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to speculate about what Dan is going to do,''
the Dolphins' president, Eddie Jones, said. ``He's a great athlete,
and he's done everything possible he can do in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's going through the thought process of, `Do I
still want to do this?' He had the injury last year, and his knees
are not getting any better. I'm sure that's what he's thinking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's agent, Marvin Demoff, was seen at last week's Pro Bowl
talking with Tampa Bay Coach Tony Dungy, and there has been
speculation that the Bucs would like Marino to join a quarterback
corps that includes Shaun King, who was a rookie last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs issued a statement in the afternoon saying they have
not talked with Marino. Of course it would be illegal if they had,
with Friday the first day to sign free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 38, threw 12 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions last
season, missing five games and part of a sixth because of a neck
injury. Wannstedt has said privately that he likes the
third-stringer Jim Druckenmiller as Marino's ultimate successor,
though Damon Huard, 4-1 last season when he started for Marino,
might get the initial nod.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's teammates seem to favor him returning to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope and pray he doesn't leave us,'' cornerback Sam
Madison said. ``I could see him retiring over going somewhere else.
If he went somewhere else, it would hurt my heart because he's done
so much for this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Kevin Donnalley said, ``He certainly has the
prerogative to do what he wants because of all he's done here, but
if he does come back, we want him out on the field playing for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's voiding of the last two years of his contract saved the
Dolphins almost $6 million to spend during the free agent signing
period. Presently, he will count $1.696 million toward the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did us a favor,'' Jones said. ``He helped us keep some
unrestricted free agents and be able to go after others.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is aware there may well be a significant backlash to the
Dolphins for appearing not to care about Marino returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would expect it to be,'' he said. ``Dan has a tremendous
following. But we'll continue to do everything we can to make this
a team the community is proud of, whether Dan is the quarterback or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable for Marino to make a decision, but he may
act before March 20, when the team begins its off-season workout
program. But Wannstedt said Marino, who holds the bulk of career
passing records in the NFL but remains chagrined that he has never
won a Super Bowl, would be expected to participate should he
re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Marino, the Dolphins released their starting tight end
Thursday, Troy Drayton, in another move that had salary cap
implications. Drayton said that if Marino feels anything like he
does, he does not want to have his career end on the 62-7 drubbing
by Jacksonville that Miami endured in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody wants to end a career on the kind of
game that we played in Jacksonville,'' Drayton said. ``He deserves
to go out on a white horse and with lots of fanfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Buffalo, the 15-year pro Smith lamented the end of
an era in that city. The team was without a victory in its four
Super Bowl appearances, but just making it to the championship game
so often made folk heroes of Smith, Thomas and several other
players in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day, a very sad day,'' Smith said. ``I thought I
would have finished my career in Buffalo and had an opportunity to
go back and win a championship in Buffalo. I wanted to end my
career in Buffalo more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 33, rushed for more than 1,000 yards in eight straight
seasons, but found himself as a backup last season.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 35, wanted to leave. ``Today was the big day I've been
waiting for,'' he said. ``I wanted this so bad. My wife even said,
`We're free agents now. I'm so happy for you.' It's a big sigh that
it's over with.''

CLINTON PICKS CAMPAIGN FINANCE CRITIC FOR FEDERAL ELECTION
COMMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has nominated Bradley A. Smith, a
critic of campaign finance laws who has supported ending limits on
the amount of money candidates can raise and spend, as a
commissioner of the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced the appointment on the White House Web site on
Wednesday from McAllen, Texas, where he was attending three
fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   The election commission enforces federal campaign funding laws,
ensuring that candidates disclose information regarding
contributions and comply with contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is chairman of the Senate
Committee on Rules and Administration, which oversees the
commission, supported Smith's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said Smith, a professor at Capital University Law
School in Columbus, Ohio, was ``one of the most respected and
prolific authorities on federal election laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Professor Smith is clearly one of the most qualified FEC
nominees in the history of the commission,'' McConnell said, ``and
would faithfully enforce federal election law consistent with the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But groups that have emphasized the need for more oversight on
campaign funding disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ultimate act of hypocrisy on the part of President
Clinton, who has demonstrated one more time that he simply does not
care about the corruption caused by huge unlimited, unregulated
campaign contributions,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of
Democracy 21, a nonpartisan political group in Washington that
advocates revisions in campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way you can be for campaign finance laws that work
and be for the appointment of Bradley Smith for the Federal
Election Commission,'' Wertheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, Smith would take one of three
Republican seats on the six-member board, replacing Lee Ann Elliot,
who plans to retire.
</P>
<P>
   The president also renamed Danny Lee McDonald, a Democrat, to
another six-year term. Lee was first appointed in 1981.

SUSPECTS EVERYWHERE IN ATTACKS ON BIG WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With WEB-ATTACK, WEB-ATTACK-INVESTIGATE) 
(js) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lacking information about who has been attacking some of the
biggest sites on the Internet, cyberkibitzers have been busy
nominating suspects in chat rooms, electronic bulletin boards and
mass e-mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age hackers, the government, foreign terrorists and the
owners of the Web sites themselves are mentioned repeatedly as
having ideological or economic motives for overwhelming various
sites with traffic, thus denying service to millions trying to use
them. And while hackers were the main suspects in most published
reports, it was the federal government that raised eyebrows in the
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it will turn out to be a couple of 12-year-olds in a
basement somewhere and maybe it won't,'' said Michael Sims, one of
many at www.slashdot.org, suggesting that the media investigate
possible government involvement. ``The national security apparatus
of the United States has the means, motive, and opportunity to have
done this.''
</P>
<P>
   That motive, several said, would be to bolster the Clinton
administration's request for more money to counter illegal Internet
activity.
</P>
<P>
   But some fancied that powerful private-sector forces might also
be at work. Wall Street analysts, always ready to see everything
through the lens of trading, passed around rumors that those
jamming the sites had shorted the stock of the companies first.
Short-sellers borrow and sell stock when they anticipate bad news,
expecting to buy the shares back after prices decline.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, some posters could not resist anonymously
blaming Bill Gates, the man whose power and wealth as chairman of
Microsoft inspires as much envy as admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe little Billy Gates has a NEW product under wraps that
will protect all those poor e-businesses,'' said one such
submission to the Time Bomb 2000 discussion group on Lusenet at
www.greenspun.com.
</P>
<P>
   A posting signed Mad Monk offered a rebuttal that was not
exactly a defense: ``I doubt that Microsoft has sufficiently good
security products to halt the denial of service.''
</P>
<P>
   Mad Monk continued, ``My personal suspicions are foreign
nationals, possibly with some covert foreign government support.''
He was rebuked by ``kritter,'' who said, ``Just don't forget, there
really ARE roving bands of idiot kids who live to do stuff just
like this.'' Kritter's conclusion: ``This is the work of bored
teen-agers, moronic Hacks, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Postings that dismissed the likelihood of hackers said the
interference did not actually require serious enough hacking skills
to make it attractive to those who break into computer systems for
thrills. ``Hackers to Blame? Doubtful'' read the headline on an
editorial at www.2600.com, the site for a company that publishes a
magazine for hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial speculates that the attack could have come from
``someone who lost their life savings to electronic commerce,''
communists and the government. Then there is ``corporate America
itself,'' the editorial says. ``After all, who would be better
served by a further denigration of the hacker image with more
restrictions on individual liberties?''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the cynicism, one optimist in an America Online discussion
suggested that if the reports that hackers were at work turned out
to be true, ``Those who `control' the Internet'' could, among other
things, ``set up a series of Web sites specifically for the
hackers, with challenging twists, turns, keys, and codes, well
fortified and harmless, for their enjoyment and as a kind of
contest between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sites, the posting suggested, could be monitored and used
to ``recruit the most talented hackers and mainstream them into the
system with lucrative rewards and great jobs.''

LOVE'S FIRST-ROUND 65 LEADS BUICK FIELD SET ON TAMING TIGER
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-LEDE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ The exchange lasted less than a minute but
spoke volumes about the current state of affairs on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   J.L. Lewis, an Austin resident who positioned himself among the
front-runners during Thursday's opening round at the Buick
Invitational, grabbed a seat and squinted at a small scoreboard on
the opposite end of the interview room. He inquired about the
status of Tiger Woods, winner of his past six starts at tour
events. Woods' streak matches the longest on the PGA Tour since Ben
Hogan won six consecutive tournaments in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a 1-under or a 7-under for Tiger?,'' Lewis asked. Told
that Woods was 1-under par, six strokes behind leader Davis Love
III, Lewis smiled and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a seven,'' Lewis said of the red number next
to Woods' name. ``Good assumption, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the percentage play these days is to assume the best for
Woods. But the 24-year-old struggled with his driver and putter on
the North Course on Thursday at Torrey Pines Golf Course. He did
not find a fairway or hit a green in regulation until his fifth
hole. Woods needed 10 holes before recording his first birdie
during a round of 71 and stands in a tie for 43rd place.
</P>
<P>
   Love, meanwhile, carved up the South Course, which has
historically been the more difficult of the two layouts for the
touring pros. He bagged 10 birdies, most of any player in the
field, and sprinted to a 65. Love is a stroke ahead of Phil
Mickelson, two better than a three-player group that includes
Lewis, J.P. Hayes and Dallas native Scott Verplank.
</P>
<P>
   But Love, the top career money winner in tour history
($12,588,647), conceded that even he finds it difficult not to
think about Woods' presence during the course of his daily rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are trying to win, but you can't avoid talking about it,''
Love said. ``It is just an incredible streak, and it's amazing how
things have fallen into place for him. You start wondering, coming
down the stretch, what he is going to do and lose track of what you
are doing ... Guys have not played well down the stretch against
him, myself included. Some times, guys believe more in other
people's games than they do their own.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avoid falling into that trap, Mickelson said he
and Love spoke before Thursday's round about the need to take more
chances this week in hopes of knocking Woods out of the winner's
circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just adopt a different mindset, where there are no
limits,'' said Mickelson, who finished with six birdies and no
bogeys. ``You take off the governor and let it go low.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished, at least for one day. But Woods said he is
not disappointed because he did not score better in his only round
on the North Course, which historically has played one to two
strokes easier than the South layout.
</P>
<P>
   Swirling winds, an errant driver and a balky putter left Woods
walking off the course satisfied with ``anything under par.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt uncomfortable with every putt I looked at. Even the
ones I made,'' said Woods, who drained a 30-footer for eagle at No.
14 but missed a 2-foot birdie attempt at No. 2 after coming within
5 yards of driving the green at the 326-yard par 4. Woods finished
the day by splitting only seven of 14 fairways and finding 12 of 18
greens in regulation. He logged more bogeys (four) than birdies
(three), with one bogey coming after taking a stroke for an
unplayable lie and the rest the result of missing greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't know what's wrong. Maybe I'm just tired and
need a little rest,'' said Woods, who skipped his normal post-round
trip to the driving range. ``As bad as I played, I'm only six
(strokes) back. There are a lot of holes left. With one good round,
you can leapfrog a lot of guys.'' nn

   CLEVELAND _ There is a conflicting sense of desperation and
possibility at the national figure skating championships, of
uncertain champions and resourceful challengers, of rapid,
inevitable change that is being faced with unsettling anticipation
and eager innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's short program Thursday night, Michael Weiss
finished ahead of Timothy Goebel with a performance that was
mediocre and phlegmatic. He skated too close to the boards and
reduced an intended quadruple toe loop to a triple toe. On his
combination jump, Weiss nearly touched his hand to the ice on a
triple axel and followed with a double toe loop when he had planned
a triple toe.
</P>
<P>
   One judge scored him as low as 5.0 for technical merit, the
lowest mark for a defending national champion in recent memory.
However, Weiss is a better spinner and has more precise and
intricate footwork than Goebel. As the reigning champion, Weiss
appeared to be propped up by the judges with technical marks as
high as 5.7. He also received two 5.8s and a 5.9 for presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Goebel skated the more daring program, but he approached his
quadruple salchow tentatively and stepped out of the landing. He
spun at an awkward angle on his triple axel, but rescued the jump,
kept his balance and completed the triple toe combination jump. A
raft of 5.8s and 5.7s for presentation secured his second-place
finish. Matt Savoie took third.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's short program served as the preliminary for
Saturday's more engaging long program, which will count for
two-thirds of the total score and will pit the forces of art and
sport, of gradual evolution and immediate upheaval, of clear
direction and inventive unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss won a bronze medal at the 1999 world championships. He is
slightly wooden in his skating, but he chooses music smartly and
can be engagingly dramatic. Goebel, the 1999 national bronze
medalist, is artistically callow, but he has brought a pleasurable
anarchy to skating this season, becoming the first person to
perform three jumps of four revolutions in the same long program.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Weiss was the provocateur, challenging Todd
Eldredge by attempting to become the first American to perform a
quadruple jump. Goebel, however, beat him to it. And Weiss, whose
season has been compromised by a stress fracture in his left foot,
has undergone a sort of role reversal.
</P>
<P>
   At 23, he now represents the sport's old guard, calling for
moderate adaptation instead of chaotic mutation. He plans one quad,
the quadruple toe loop, in his long program. He has landed the quad
only once in a major competition and succeeds on the completeness
of his routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the judges are looking for is balance, a well-rounded
program,'' he said before skating Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Weiss is correct, said Goebel, who is 19 and
trains in Lakewood, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, which may give him a
home-rink advantage at the national championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to have well-rounded programs,'' Goebel said.
``But this is still a sport and the quad is very important.'' He
pointed out that Aleksei Yagudin of Russia essentially won the 1999
world championship over his countryman Yevgeny Plushenko because
Plushenko missed his quadruple jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jumps determine a champion,'' Goebel said.
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on jumping has been decried by some skating
purists who worry that line, edge quality, spins and the position
of the back and shoulders, the artistic side, is becoming less and
less relevant. But the quads represent perhaps the most successful
attempt yet at objectifying a subjective sport.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the general public cannot distinguish a lutz from an
axel, any spectator can appreciate a feat that requires an athlete
to elevate, complete four rotations in less than a second and land
balanced on a thin blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people might not appreciate a skater's style or
understand the choice of music, but it's obvious when someone is
doing a quad,'' said Goebel, who is a freshman here at Case Western
Reserve University and wants to attend medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, at Skate America, Goebel did the unprecedented in his
long program, landing a quadruple salchow-triple-toe combination,
followed individually by a quadruple toe loop and a quadruple
salchow.
</P>
<P>
   Performing three quads has been liberating, he said. If he
misses one, he knows he has two more chances. And, being ahead of
the game technically, he can afford to spend more time improving
artistically. His jumps need much more refined connection, which
was reflected in his 12th-place finish at the 1999 world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his teen-age sensibility tells him that the best approach
is to attack, not defend. Caution is anathema.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the sport may be hindered most by its equipment. The
leather boots and steel blades have remained essentially the same
for a half century or more. Some people, though, have begun
experimenting with springier, lighter blades. And as the equipment
improves, the boundaries are certain to expand again. Goebel would
next like to push the envelope with a jump of five revolutions, the
quintuple salchow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to try it would be amazing,'' he said. ``It's something
that's so far beyond what people have tried before. It would be my
experiment. I probably wouldn't be able to land one, but why not
try.''

NASA IS FACING MORE WORK SAFETY ISSUES AS SHUTTLE FLIGHTS
INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The space agency has managed to launch space
shuttles safely with a reduced work force, but critical shortages
of skilled engineers and little past efforts to replace them could
pose increased safety problems as the flight rate increases in
coming years, an advisory panel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has
experienced a steady erosion of critical skills and valuable
experience at its flight centers in recent years; older employees
retired or took buy-outs to cut agency costs and were not replaced
because of hiring freezes, the NASA Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel
said Thursday in releasing its annual report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety consciousness of the NASA and contractor work
forces, from hands-on labor to top management, continues high,''
said the nine-member committee and its consultants. ``Nevertheless,
work-force issues remain among the most serious safety concerns of
the panel. Cutbacks and reorganizations over the past several years
have resulted in problems related to work-force size, critical
skills and the extent of on-the-job experience.''
</P>
<P>
   There were only three shuttle flights last year because the
four-orbiter fleet was grounded while technicians inspected and
repaired damaged electrical wiring, and because of delays in
getting critical parts ready to attach to the International Space
Station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Endeavour and a crew of six is scheduled to lift off
on Friday at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time for the first flight of the
year, an 11-day mission to map Earth in detail with radar. The
launching, delayed from last week to replace a malfunctioning
computer, is to be one of up to eight that the space agency hopes
to fly this year as construction of the space station accelerates.
</P>
<P>
   The safety panel said the unusually low shuttle flight rate last
year allowed the reduced work forces of the space agency and its
contractors to keep up with processing and maintenance of the
spacecraft, including the added work on the wiring. But with flight
rates rising to eight annually, and occasionally going as high as
12, ``this may no longer be the case,'' the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to increasing stress and workload levels, the panel
said, hiring practices that have reduced the space agency's work
force to 17,500 from 25,000 in the last half-dozen years have
eroded expertise in critical areas, particularly at agency centers
that deal with piloted space flights, like the Kennedy Space Center
in Florida and the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The report said there was a lack of younger people at
entry-level positions, particularly as scientists and engineers,
who would become future leaders and managers, as well as
insufficient training to fill the gaps in skill caused by the
reduction of employees and a lessened capacity to handle the higher
rates of flight for a sustained period.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing the Clinton administration's budget proposals for
the next fiscal year, Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA administrator,
said the agency was requesting more money for both shuttle safety
improvements and hiring a substantial number of new employees.
Goldin said the agency, with congressional approval, planned to
hire about 1,850 people over the next two years. This would result
in a net gain of almost 550 employees, after expected attrition
from retirements and other personnel losses, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``To reduce stress levels, improve our skill mix and address the
higher number of imminent retirements, we are investing $600
million over five years for personnel and facilities,'' Goldin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA chief said in an interview that hiring new safety
engineers and others did not mean that the agency had been
neglecting some safety issues because it did not have the people to
address them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety has never been compromised, and there were not concerns
we didn't address,'' Goldin said. ``But it was apparent some of our
people were stretched too thin and expected to do too much. This
will help relieve that pressure and improve working conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget proposal also calls for expanding NASA's program of
upgrading safety for the shuttle fleet, and increasing spending for
incorporating safety measures, to $2.1 billion from $600 million
over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   These improvements include developing safer main engines and
upgraded electronics for the space planes.

IT'LL BE A STAR TECH SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Neal, the coordinating producer for NBC's
coverage of the NBA All-Star Game, can't afford to sit back and let
technology pass his network by.
</P>
<P>
   So the fact he's arranged to attach tiny microphones to
Shaquille O'Neal, Vince Carter, Reggie Miller, Jason Kidd, Kevin
Garnett and coaches Phil Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy, plus referee
Jerry Crawford for Sunday's shooting festival is another way to
show everyone the Peacock has game. Like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business is obviously full of pressure for each of us,
within our networks or competing networks, to want to push
technology forward,'' Neal said before heading to the upper region
of the Silicon Valley for Sunday's exhibition in Oakland. ``When it
gets to a high-profile event, if we find some tools from technology
that helps us be a better storyteller, then it's a showcase we want
to take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, basketball so far has been about enhanced audio.
Wireless mikes will take us to a higher level this Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Fox has done with baseball, NBC will only use the audio
bites on tape _ never live. NBC analyst Doug Collins, a former
All-Star player and coach, goes along with the thinking that this
is forward progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk (within the network) all the time regarding
sensitivity issues'' with the wireless mikes, he said. ``It's
important to give fans a feel they're a part of the game. But there
are certain things we can't do to embarrass someone, make them look
incompetent or upstage someone. We only do things that enhance the
telecast, but still a player-coach confidentiality can't be
breached. If we do that, we wipe out any trust. We have to show
them it's good and they'll appreciate how it's being used.''
</P>
<P>
   More techo stuff: The game will be the next big thing carried on
High Definition TV, with separate cameras and broadcast feed set up
to coincide with NBC's coverage Sunday starting at 3 p.m. The HDTV
crew includes Mike Breen on play-by-play with Bill Walton and Steve
Jones as the analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think basketball will lend itself well to the format,'' said
Neal. ``The left-to-right play in a relatively confined space is
what we've seen done at Madison Square Garden, and it shows up
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton, included with Neal on a conference call with reporters,
came up with his own question.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said it goes left-to-right ... is that only one way?''
Walton asked facetiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Neal responded, ``it also goes right-to-left,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, I was confused,'' added Walton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you get for going to UCLA,'' said Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom of Walton: Asked his opinion of the fact the Lakers'
Kobe Bryant was talked out of competing in the Saturday slam-dunk
contest by Lakers coach Phil Jackson, but then took himself out of
the 2-ball competition because he had to sing a song with Tyra
Banks on the Saturday morning NBA kids' TV presentation, Walton
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could see him do it all _ I'd love to see him do the
slam dunk, the 3-point shooting contest, the 2-ball, then sing the
national anthem before playing in the game Sunday. It's a shame he
won't be (in the slam-dunk contest). The amount of concentration to
succeed in any of these events is extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Jackson is looking out for the best interest of the
Lakers. That's his job. He was smart to convince Kobe not to do it.
But I also think Kobe made a mistake by listening to the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   More kid news on Kobe: An excerpt from the next installment of
HBO's ''Real Sports,'' (Monday, 10 p.m.), from a conversation James
Brown had with Bryant:
</P>
<P>
   Brown: ``When did you know in your mind that you could be one of
a few in the history of the game who could make the league
successfully jumping from highs school to the pros?''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe: ``When I was 13.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Miller meets Bud Greenspan: The difference may seem
subtle, but it won't be if you watch NBC's coverage of the Winter
Gravity Games this weekend. Producer David Michaels shot the entire
shows from Mammoth Mountain last month with 35mm film, documentary
style, instead of the standard video.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels believes it's the first time a sports show, maybe any
kind of TV show, has been shot this way in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've skied since I was 9 and grew up at Mammoth,'' said
Michaels. ''I've watched these sports shows about skiing over the
years and they've missed the whole spirit and reason why people ski
and loved mountains. I was trying to figure out how to cover it,
and I thought, you know, we should make a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   So rigging up film cameramen _ many are experienced climbers
anyway _ Michaels feels he's captured it. One of his seven
cameramen was 6-foot-4 Scott Duncan, whose brother Tim is better
known as a participant in Sunday's All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With freezing weather and blizzards, the flexibility of film
allowed us to cover it in the way we did,'' said Michaels. ``When
you're (doing video) from a TV truck, everyone tethers into that
single truck like a studio. Film is a very liberating experience,
having the freedom to get any shots we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was turning it around in the editing room in 2
weeks,integrating the audio (which is separate from film) and
deciding to allow the athletes to do the narration. Michaels
figures there are only 12 lines of non-athlete voiceover total in
this weekend's shows. &QL;

   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   _The Daily News Best and Worst of the Los Angeles Media rankings
will run as a four-part series beginning Tuesday, Feb. 22. Got
anything you've been wanting to vent about a particular
sportscaster, play-by-play man, colorman or sports-talk host? We're
open for suggestions, via phone or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _During his acceptance speech for his induction Monday into the
Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame,
Keith Jackson announced he was writing a check to cover the entire
cost of scholarships given this year by the organization to local
student-athletes moving on to grad school.
</P>
<P>
   _In the same sort of spirit (we hope) of ``Mystery Science
Theater,'' the weekly sports movie series ``Reel Classics'' shown
on ESPN Classic will branch off to include a live chat at ESPN.com
with the show's host, the acerbic cherubic Nick Bakay, during the
airing of the flicks. Sunday's installment (6 p.m.) is ``A Man
Named Mays,'' followed by ``The Joe Louis Story'' (Feb. 20) and
``The Jackie Robinson Story'' (Feb. 27).
</P>
<P>
   _Overwhelming positive reaction to its first NHL RULES! coverage
last month has ESPN2 bringing it back for the March 5 telecast of
Detroit and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   _Fox Sports News has filled its executive producer role with
Scott Ackerson, who had been producing Fox's high-profile NFL
Sunday morning pregame show. Ackerson worked with Keith Olbermann
and Chris Myers at ESPN on ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   _Unnecessary cuteness. The March issue of Sport magazine has a
short but somewhat disturbing piece that reads like a sick diary
passage entitled ``How This Woman Has Enhanced My Life.'' The
author,whom we'd rather not identify until authorities are called
in, waxes on about his distant infatuation with ESPN's Suzy Kolber,
accompanied by a quarter-page picture of the sports anchor.
Harmless? Who knows these days.
</P>
<P>
   _Fox's tough love. The network contends it'll never stoop to
showing pro wrestling events (like rival Ted Turner), plus it has
already dismissed rumored involvement in the new XFL. Why? Hey, it
already has this Toughman World Championship competition going for
it on FX, which stumbles to a climax tonight with a pay-per-view
offering (5 p.m.) that pits winners from the FX Championship Series
against other toughies to determine the (begin ital)real(end ital)
manly men of their weight class. Can't afford the $19.95 price to
watch? Tough.
</P>
<P>
   _Vague information given by CBS for its bonus coverage Monday of
the Pebble Beach Pro-Am's final round caused plenty of frustration
as news of Tiger Woods' miracle finish became known through other
media sources. During its Saturday and Sunday live broadcasts, CBS
advertised a live 4 p.m. EST coverage Monday _ the implication that
it would be available live on the West Coast at 1 p.m. KCBS didn't
pick it up until tape-delay at 4 p.m. _ CBS knew all along that
would be the window here _ and it ran past the 5:30 p.m stopping
point to end at 6 p.m. Adding to the irate calls CBS got nationally
was the fact that only a third of the network's affiliates carried
the final round live where it was available, and 12 percent didn't
even show it at all. Maybe next time, offer it to a real sports
channel, like ESPN, or send it live to your own cable channel
like... oh, wait, you don't have one.

   the mind plays tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Shane that we had to start talking to each other, about
anything,'' Williamson said. ``So we started doing movie quotes.
That kept us going.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the climb, the men ran up against a steep-faced
boulder, about 25 feet from top to bottom. Williamson and
Volkerding are avid rock climbers; they strapped their boards onto
their backs and scampered up, clinging to tiny trees that jutted
from cracks in the rock.
</P>
<P>
   The men crested the ridge above the creek, and their eyes shot
off to the right, toward Heavenly. Heavenly wasn't there. They
began going down again, this time finding a line of descent that
went off to the right.
</P>
<P>
   They had been walking for three hours by the time they got to
the bottom of the second creek bed and most of the way up the other
side. They stopped beneath a large rock that stuck five feet out
from the mountain. It was now almost pitch dark. Williamson said
that if they couldn't see the lights of Heavenly when they reached
the top of the ridge, they should spend the night under the
outcrop. Volkerding volunteered to look. He came back a few minutes
later _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Using their boards as pickaxes, the two began hacking off huge
chunks of snow and piling them on either side of the rock.
Forty-five minutes later, they climbed inside, packed snow around
the opening, filled the last patch of air with their boards,
leaving just a small hole, and got ready for the long night ahead.
The men started off the night wet and cold. At first, they hugged
each other tight, but the cold just got worse. They slipped their
arms under their clothes and hugged themselves, hands snug in their
armpits. It worked for their upper bodies, but their legs and feet
quickly went from cold to numb. They had to come up with another
plan.
</P>
<P>
   About once an hour, when they felt their feet going numb, one of
the men would take his boots and socks off and shove his feet under
the coat of the other, who would rub them swiftly against his bare
chest. They would do this for about 15 minutes at a time. Then the
other would go.
</P>
<P>
   After the rubbing treatment, their feet had to go back into
boots that had been open to the air for 15 minutes. But the
procedure kept the feeling in their feet at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Their routine prevented frostbite, but about midnight, the men
started shaking from the cold, so violently that they worried they
would knock each other out with involuntary kicks to the head. It
continued off and on all night. They consoled themselves with the
thought that as long as they were shaking, their bodies were
working, generating energy. When the shaking stopped, they got
worried.
</P>
<P>
   On top of their physical ordeals, both were going through what
Williamson called ``an emotional drama that was a whole other story
in itself.'' They faithfully repeated their mantra _ they would be
all right _ but the hypothermia they were wrestling with would
overwhelm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any regrets that we had seemed to come back tenfold,''
Williamson said. ``I kept thinking about what we could've done, or
if I had told the people in my life how much I loved them.
Everything's going about 100 miles an hour in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, Williamson asked himself over and over, had he left his
two-way radio on by accident the day before, running down the
battery? He had given a pair of the radios to his dad, Tim, for
Christmas; Tim Williamson, who was also on the trip, started
calling on his about 7 that night. All he got was a busy signal:
Williamson and Volkerding had decided to save what little juice was
left in the radio for the next day. There was no way, they thought,
that a search team would find them at night in a blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson obsessed over how much better off they'd be if they
had packed a cigarette lighter. When they had climbed the rock face
earlier, dozens of dry twigs had snapped off in their hands. It
would have been easy to build a fire in their shelter. And why
didn't they have any food? One Powerbar would have provided enough
energy for ``several hours of shaking,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Volkerding became delusional. He saw an animal run by, inches
from his face. Williamson didn't hear or see anything. He tried to
talk Volkerding back to his senses.
</P>
<P>
   Punctuating the men's thoughts were the sounds of dynamite
blasts, which set off mini-avalanches designed to prevent real
ones. Williamson heard about a dozen; he wondered how close they
were.
</P>
<P>
   Volkerding, whose optimism had kept Williamson going, hoped
Williamson couldn't hear him crying.
</P>
<P>
   The night wore on. The men managed to keep panic at bay and hope
alive. Every hour, they went through their feet-rubbing routine.
When the psychological darkness closed in, they told each other
they were going to be OK, even if it was only in the telling that
they believed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to hear it, from each other,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, dawn peeked through the shelter's single hole. Thinking
that in daylight a search team would have a better chance of
finding them, Williamson turned on his two-way radio. Five minutes
later, they heard a voice on the other end calling their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't describe the feeling to you,'' Williamson said. ``I
ran out, without my boots on, freezing, because I was worried the
rock would interfere with the radio's reception.''
</P>
<P>
   A search-and-rescue team had been out since the middle of the
night, after Williamson's father reported that the men never came
back to their hotel. After team members reached them on Tim
Williamson's radio, they called back every few minutes, asking the
men to describe where they were. An hour later, the stranded men
heard shouting. Then they saw five skiers in the distance, coming
toward them.
</P>
<P>
   The snowboard ride back to Heavenly, three-quarters of a mile
away, was slow: Search and rescue members had to blaze a trail for
the men's snowboards, tamping down the snow with their skis. After
an hour, Williamson and Volkerding were reunited with Tim
Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   First aid workers looked them over, amazed that neither had
frostbite. None of the workers had ever heard of their feet-warming
method; neither had Williamson and Volkerding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a lot of smart choices,'' said Heavenly's director
of emergency services, Jimmy Lawrence. ``They showed great common
sense. Many of these kinds of stories don't turn out nearly as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   By that night, they were back in Johnson County, where a few
last scraps of snow, left over from the week before, clung to shady
ground.

AS A MAYOR, JERRY BROWN IS DOWN TO EARTH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Lunchtime on a bright day, Jerry Brown, the
star mayor, is strolling past the cafes near City Hall, prompting
gasps and stares and vigorous arm waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're doing a great job,'' says a young man in painter's
pants, smiling like someone who has just met his movie idol.
``Don't listen to what anybody says. Just keep doing what you're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Brown, the former two-term governor and three-time
candidate for president, stands a bit taller in his rumpled khaki
suit and open-necked shirt. ``See?'' he says. ``I didn't tell him
to say that. I didn't plant him there.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after beating 10 opponents to become mayor of this
dynamic, struggling city of almost 400,000 residents, the once and
maybe future major political player sounds a little defensive
trying to prove he is not a power-mad carpetbagger just passing
through on the way back to the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   He throws out some accomplishments over the last year: 22 new
companies in town, bringing 5,000 jobs; 18 developments in the
works with 3,800 housing units; $1 million added to the city's arts
department and commission; a 16 percent drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a good time here,'' he said, dismissing the notion
that he is already looking beyond Oakland's horizons, to a Senate
or presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Many Oaklanders clearly relish having an icon and media magnet _
someone ``60 Minutes'' deemed worthy of a profile _ running City
Hall. And even detractors acknowledge that Brown could have chosen
an easier path to return to national politics than managing this
long-troubled city east of San Francisco. But more and more, those
who watch City Hall closely are saying Brown's grand vision to
attract new residents and remake the school system needs a reality
check.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say a ballot measure Brown wrote that would allow him to
appoint three new members to the seven-member elected school board
is a power grab. They complain that that he did an about-face on
development after taking office, from promoting development that
respects the environment and the residents to courting big,
market-rate development that is driving up rents and forcing out
longtime tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brown, once known as Governor Moonbeam, sounds downright
conservative these days, what with his talking tough on crime and
promoting a public military academy for young people. At the same
time, they add, all too often, Mayor Brown, now 62, sounds like the
Governor Brown of 25 years ago _ arrogant about his ideas and
unwilling to listen to others. (He has even inspired a Web site,
JerryWatch.org, which renames Brown's ``We the People'' political
organization ``Me the People.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some sense of correctness with him, and an ethical
nature,'' said Gus Newport, a former Berkeley mayor who has known
Brown for decades, ``but also some controlling gene somewhere that
says: `I have to do it and I have to do it my way.'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nadel, a City Council member who supported Brown for mayor
but is now one of his staunchest critics, said he had disappointed
her hopes that he would discuss his ideas and entertain others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presents his ideas as fully formed, and there is no attempt
at consensus-building,'' Nadel said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, artists whose loft rents have begun to climb
have started calling Brown's aggressive downtown development plans
the ``Jerryfication of Oakland,'' a complaint he dismisses as
uninformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great fear of change,'' the mayor said, on his walk
around the city the other day. ``The potential for growth that will
benefit all of Oakland is there, but as long as people refuse to
relinquish the status quo, growth can't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brown won an early victory his first year by forcing the school
superintendent to resign. But he lost one of his biggest battles
last week when the school board bypassed his choice of an outsider
for superintendent and selected a veteran Oakland school
administrator. The mayor had tried convincing the board to hold off
on an appointment until after the March elections (when, if his
ballot initiative passes, Brown could appoint three new board
members who could help his choice for superintendent).
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading Oakland's school system, which serves 54,000 students,
is one of Brown's priorities and biggest challenges. A scathing
state audit released last week recommended 1,000 changes in the
system, which was deemed such a failure that a state takeover might
be necessary. Brown used the six-pound report as ammunition to push
for his candidate for superintendent. The move backfired; school
board members were said to be tired of his public displays of
outrage and went forward with their own appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things aren't going to change unless an outsider comes in,''
Brown said quietly, while eating a bowl of chili at Veronica's, a
newly opened mom-and-pop luncheonette near City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He rode into office promising to end the tyranny of Oakland's
entrenched machine politics. But some critics say he is merely
replacing it with his own cronies. (Most often, they mention
Jacques Barzaghi, a longtime friend and adviser who lives in an
apartment in Brown's quasi-communal live-work building downtown.
Brown appointed Barzaghi ``senior policy adviser'' at a salary of
$75,000 a year, then promoted him to interim director of the
Cultural Arts Department, at a salary of $114,192 _ more than the
mayor's pay of about $110,000.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Allen, a former aide to Don Perata, a former Oakland city
councilman who is now a state senator and a political ally of
Brown, said that much of the opposition amounted to harrumphing
from members of the old machine who see their power slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not credible opposition,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say Brown must negotiate a minefield of racial
politics in a city that is predominantly black. Not only must he be
sensitive to the fact that he may be replacing blacks in important
positions with whites, but he must also be aware of how his
downtown development schemes affect black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parkman, site manager for a West Oakland development
project of live-work lofts, said that as development in the
neighborhood proceeded, attention and respect must be given to the
people, mostly black, who live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Oakland is viewed as the historic seat of black
Oakland,'' Parkman said.
</P>
<P>
   But after a freeway dividing West Oakland from the rest of the
city was destroyed in the 1989 earthquake, development was left to
market forces, and because of the Silicon Valley-fueled housing
boom throughout the Bay Area, the population began to change
radically.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be some preservation of the housing stock owned
by blacks and an amelioration of the problem of restoring housing
stock'' for blacks, Parkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he was hoping to build more affordable housing, even
while Oakland still has the most affordable housing in the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long-term plans for Oakland,'' he said, as he stood
from a lunch table to give the waitresses his autograph.

SNOWBOARD RUN LEADS TO FRIGHTENING NIGHT FOR KANSAS CITY AREA MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANDY NELSON  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star There's a story only if someone lives to
tell it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday, Jan. 30, Kevin Williamson and Shane Volkerding _ best
friends and co-workers at the Hereford House restaurant in Leawood,
Kan. _ were on the last run on the last day of a snowboarding trip
to Heavenly, a resort at Lake Tahoe, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   The season had been a brown one at Heavenly, but with the new
year came snow _ lots of it. In the week of their trip alone, 5
feet of snow had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   It was coming down hard that afternoon. Williamson, 24, a
biology major at the University of Kansas, and Volkerding, 26, a
student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, were sick of the
wind and snow in their faces. They decided to have one last, long
run and call it a day.
</P>
<P>
   As the lift took them up, Williamson made plans to call his
mother back home in Overland Park, Kan., as soon as they got to the
bottom _ it was her birthday. He also thought about eating; eager
to squeeze as much boarding as possible into their last day, the
two had skipped lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson and Volkerding got off the lift about 2 p.m. They
started down a wide, long run called Ridge. The wind was fierce,
about 40 mph, and the snow was blinding.
</P>
<P>
   The men knew that visibility would be better in the trees along
the run's left side. Besides, Heavenly is known as a good place for
boarding and skiing through trees. The two veered off into the
woods. They hadn't been there long when Volkerding saw a windbreak,
about 12 feet tall, off to the left. Because the wind was coming
from their right, they thought conditions might be better on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   As they slid their boards through a gap in the break, Williamson
saw a red rope flash over their heads _ Heavenly's boundary line.
They weren't worried. As long as they kept in view of the rope,
they would know where they were.
</P>
<P>
   The men started down. For a while they could see the red line
that tethered them to Heavenly. Then they couldn't; the visibility
was just as bad on this side of the break, maybe worse.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that as long as they kept going in a straight line,
they would stay near Ridge and eventually find another gap in the
windbreak. Under different conditions, they might have taken off
their boards and walked back uphill, following the path their
boards had made.
</P>
<P>
   But it was freezing. A blizzard swirled around them. And they
knew the snow they were boarding over was several feet deep _ if
they tried to walk in it, they'd sink up to their waists, or
higher. And though they couldn't see the sun, they knew it was
edging toward the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   They kept going down. And, as they found out later, they were
going in a straight line. But Ridge wasn't. The run, and the red
rope, had veered sharply to the right. With each turn of their
boards, Heavenly was pulling farther away.
</P>
<P>
   The space the men were boarding through widened and then dipped.
Their boards came to rest in a creek bed. The ground, deep in snow,
rose on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Williamson had been worried for a while, ever
since the blizzard had erased the red boundary rope. As the men
snapped off their boards and prepared to climb, he couldn't keep it
in any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Shane I had been having some anxiety attacks,''
Williamson said. ``He told me to calm down, that everything was
going to be all right. He said that he and his brothers had gotten
lost lots of times hiking, and it always turned out all right. I
asked him if they ever got lost during a blizzard, and he said,
`No, it was always pretty nice.' We laughed about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the last laugh they'd have for a long time. Climbing out
of the creek bed, they found out just how deep the snow was. With
each step, they sank past their waists. To move with as little
wasted energy as possible, they raised their boards over their
heads with two hands, jammed them into the snow and pulled
themselves forward. They took turns in the role of trailblazer,
switching every few minutes like the members of a cycling team.
</P>
<P>
   The men had made several mistakes to put themselves in the
situation they were in; taking turns was the first of several
smart, crucial decisions the men would make. Williamson chalked up
their level-headedness to Volkerding's cool demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time they got a good way up the creek valley, the
elements were starting to wear them down. The hiking was exhausting
work, and the men were sopping wet _ Williamson from sweating,
Volkerding from sweating and because he wasn't wearing good
snowboarding gear. The first stages of hypothermia were setting in,
registering in the men's minds as well as in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Dark thoughts swamped Williamson. He told Volkerding he couldn't
bear his mother having to deal with a tragedy on her birthday.
Volkerding told him, more forcefully this time, that they were
going to be all right. They trudged on in silence. Williamson felt
another wave of hypothermia _ he felt woozy, lightheaded. This
time, he made up his mind that Volkerding was right, that he had to
be right: They were going to make it out.
</P>
<P>
   In extreme conditions, the link between mind and body is
critical. Think positively, and the hormones and the adrenaline
kick into high gear. Lose hope, and the thyroid knows it _ body
temperature plummets, the mind plays tricks.

SEQUENCE OF WOUNDS IS DISPUTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Two experts called by the defense in the Amadou
Diallo trial testified Thursday that the bullet that tore through
Diallo's aorta and spinal cord was among the last of the 19 that
struck him, contradicting the prosecution's expert, who had said it
was among the first.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing the timing of that bullet is a major issue in the
trial of the four New York City police officers charged with
Diallo's murder in the Bronx a year ago. The wound was so
devastating that it would have immediately paralyzed Diallo and
caused his blood pressure to plummet. The prosecution is trying to
establish that the police officers continued firing after Diallo
had fallen to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the police officers had planned to recall to the
stand Schrrie Elliott, whose testimony on Wednesday had surprised
them and damaged their case even though she had been their witness.
Judge Joseph C. Teresi has agreed to allow the lawyers to
cross-examine her as a hostile witness. But because of technical
problems with a videotaped interview the lawyers want to show, the
judge put off her testimony before the jury until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the jury's presence, Elliott was shown parts of two
interviews she did with WNBC-TV, one about a year ago and one last
week. The lawyers were trying to establish a legal foundation for
showing the tapes to the jury. Elliott acknowledged that the
videotapes were accurate. On them, she said that Diallo remained
standing for a substantial time after the shooting began; on
Wednesday she testified in court that he had fallen to the ground
immediately and the officers continued firing. She also said in the
videotapes that one of the officers shouted ``Gun!''; on Wednesday
she testified that she did not know who said ``Gun!'' and that it
could have been Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   After Elliott's testimony Thursday, the judge approved the use
of the videotape and granted a defense request that Elliott's
police record be turned over to them.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 32, has a criminal history dating to 1991. It includes
arrests for turnstile jumping, drug sales and assault. Defense
lawyers said Thursday that they were not sure whether they would
mention Elliott's criminal history when they cross-examined her on
Monday. The case was moved to Albany because of publicity about the
shooting in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the sequence of the bullets that hit Diallo, Dr.
Martin Fackler, a wound ballistics expert who treated military
victims in Vietnam, flatly contradicted the testimony of Dr. Joseph
Cohen, the pathologist from the New York City medical examiner's
office who performed the autopsy on Diallo's body. Cohen, a
prosecution witness who is now the chief pathologist in Riverside
County, Calif., had said that the bullet through the aorta and the
spinal cord was among the earliest of the 19 shots that hit Diallo.
He based that conclusion on the lack of bleeding from nearly all
the other wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Fackler said that he believed that the shot came near the
end and that no conclusion could be drawn from the lack of
bleeding. Because the shots were fired within seconds, he said,
there was not time for significant bleeding to begin. He
acknowledged, however, that at least one bullet probably hit Diallo
after he had fallen to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the officers also used Fackler to bolster their
contention that the full metal jacket bullets used by the officers
could have left Diallo standing even after he was hit many times.
The bullets cause less damage than hollow point bullets, which
expand when they enter a body, he said. Full metal jacket bullets,
he said, are more likely to go through a person and, possibly, hit
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Police Department began a switch to hollow
point bullets last March, about a month after the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Mason, a forensic pathologist from California, also
testified Thursday that the bullet that hit the aorta and the
spinal cord came near the end. It was likely, he said, that the 15
or 16 bullets that hit Diallo's left side struck him first. And
none of the bullets hit Diallo while he was on the floor, Mason
said. Instead, he said, the upward path of at least one bullet was
caused by its changing direction when it entered Diallo's lower
leg.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen had said that one bullet, and possibly two more, hit
Diallo after he had fallen to the floor.

HILLARY CLINTON VIDEO SETS TONE FOR UPCOMING CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the eternal domestic question _ Can she cook? _
Hillary Clinton offers an unequivocal response in her new campaign
video, ``Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a mean tossed salad and a great omelet,'' she says,
beaming on the 18-minute promotional tape, unveiled last Sunday at
the ceremony announcing her Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The claim is about as innocuous as they come: what is there,
really, to tearing lettuce? Yet attitudes about household chores
have always played an oddly complicated role in the public image of
Clinton _ remember her denigration of at-home cookie baking during
the 1992 presidential campaign? So some eyes were rolling this week
at the visage of this policy-oriented candidate, in a shell-pink
cashmere sweater, listing her kitchen skills.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those eyes belonged to Gail Sheehy, author of a new
biography of Clinton, ``Hillary's Choice.'' ``Nuts!'' she said,
shaking her head as she watched the tape in her Midtown office the
other morning. ``She doesn't cook! She's never cooked! You don't
hire a senator to cook omelets. That's one thing she does not do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary,'' which was produced by Clinton's close friend, Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason, is the television curtain-raiser for her
campaign, an electronic blueprint that attempts to provide the
rationale, both emotional and political, for the first lady's
candidacy. In addition to the viewing at her rally on Sunday in
Purchase, N.Y., copies were distributed that day to 600 smaller
gatherings of her supporters throughout the state. And though the
campaign declined to discuss the tape's future use, portions of it
are likely to turn up in forthcoming Clinton commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Like its forerunner, ``The Man From Hope,'' created by Thomason
and her husband, Harry, for President Clinton in 1992, ``Hillary,''
which tracks the candidate from childhood to the present, is a
sentimental portrait. By turns wistful, boastful and inspirational,
the video is at all times worshipful. ``She's just a beautiful
woman!'' a man from upstate New York exclaims as he sits around a
table with other voters.
</P>
<P>
   And like most partisan documents, it makes a passel of claims
about its subject, some easily supported, others a little
exaggerated, that seem intended for at least two purposes: to
improve Clinton's standing with women voters _ a group, polls
indicate, she is having trouble with _ and to counter the
impression that, unlike her opponent, she has no record of her own
to run on.
</P>
<P>
   The assertions range from gushy observations _ ``And gorgeous
blue eyes!'' that same unidentified upstater cries _ to more
substantive testimonials to her contributions as first lady, both
in Little Rock and Washington. One of the more fully documented
segments of the video concerns Clinton's involvement in children's
issues, a longtime interest that is elucidated in the tape's
interviews with education and health officials in Arkansas and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also attempts to beef up her resume. ``She writes
books, she sponsors legislation, she makes her voice heard,'' Penn
Rhodeen, a lawyer and children's advocate from New Haven who knew
Clinton at Yale Law School, says on the video. Of course, to have
sponsored legislation, one has to have been a legislator; the last
office Clinton was elected to was in student government at
Wellesley.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one goal of the video is to give the impression that
Clinton already performs legislative tasks. ``This is what I would
call a quasi-record,'' Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez of the Bronx
said in an interview (he is quoted on the video describing Clinton
as a figure of hope for Bronxites). ``It may not have been a record
where she was a legislator and you pull a lever for a particular
bill, but she has an extraordinary record nevertheless, because of
her life in public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are also some omissions that make ``Hillary'' as
interesting to some people for what it does not say as for what it
does. (A minor one: the video fails to identify one member of the
round table of ``people who met Hillary in her travels around New
York'' as a Democratic state assemblywoman. Karen Dunn, a
spokeswoman for the campaign, confirmed that the lawmaker is RoAnn
Destito of Utica.)
</P>
<P>
   The video celebrates Clinton's legal career, for example, but
makes no mention of the Rose Law Firm, the Little Rock practice for
which she worked. Even more glaring is the Prince Philip treatment
accorded the president: he is interviewed for a total of eight
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Hillary's theme!'' Sheehy said as she leaned forward
for a closer hearing of the little girl's song that starts the
video. ``No one can stop me/From being me,'' the child, Kelly
McDonald, sings.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy says that one of the curiosities of ``Hillary'' is, as in
the cooking comments, the strange ways she tries to ``be like a
regular girl.'' She is in many ways, Sheehy added, ``but not in the
ways she tries to package herself.''

2 CANADIAN PAPER COMPANIES SAID TO BE DISCUSSING MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trading in the stock of two major Canadian paper companies was
halted Thursday as one of the companies, Abitibi-Consolidated Inc.,
announced that it was in ``advanced'' merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   While Abitibi, the leading producer of newsprint in the world,
did not identify the other party in the negotiations, trading in
shares of Donohue Inc. were halted amid widespread speculation that
it would be part of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the potential pairing of the No. 1 and No. 4
suppliers comes as the industry continues to try to pull itself out
of the doldrums. Prices of newsprint, the commodity that represents
the biggest nonlabor expense of newspaper companies, have
languished for a year in the wake of Abitibi's settlement of a
strike and weak Asian demand.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively low newsprint prices that prevailed in 1999
helped contribute to the generally solid recent earnings of
newspaper companies, according to newspaper industry analysts. But
it is unclear if any major consolidation would have a near-term
impact on newspaper company profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the merger news is true, I would be surprised to see
immediate impact,'' said Stuart Garner, the president and chief
executive of Thomson Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian banker not directly involved in the talks said
Thursday that Donohue was in talks and an announcement could come
as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Abitibi's stock was trading at 17.95 Canadian dollars on the
Toronto exchange before trading was halted. Quebecor Inc. holds a
controlling interest in Donohue, which analysts regard as one of
the industry's most efficient and profitable members.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last year there has been a tug of war between
newsprint producers like Abitibi, which announced two price
increases _ a $50 a ton increase effective last October with
another $50 increase due April 1 _ and U.S. publishers, which have
in many cases successfully resisted paying the new prices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the publishers had the benefit of weak demand from
Asian customers, a situation that left the newsprint makers with
little leverage. In recent months, however, Asian demand has been
more robust. Newsprint prices, analysts say, are now in the $500 to
$515 range.
</P>
<P>
   The paper and forest product industry _ which also includes pulp

LOVE HAS EXTRA INCENTIVES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ Davis Love III, the first-round leader at the
Buick Invitational, said Thursday he has extra incentive this week
to keep Tiger Woods in his rearview mirror throughout four rounds
at Torrey Pines Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   By winning his past six starts on the PGA Tour, Woods has
climbed to No. 2 on the tour's career money list ($12,557,128). The
only player ahead of him is Love ($12,588,647), who senses his
position is tenuous. Woods, he said, has begun referring to him as
``All-Time'' _ short for all-time money winner _ and the two
discussed their relative positions on the list before Tuesday's
practice round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You've got all the other No. 1s. You probably want
that one, too,' '' Love said. ``And he said, `Yes.' So I do want to
keep it. I want it for a long time. I know I'm going to have to
play hard to stay ahead of him.'' \Nsubheds:CADDIE CHANGE Steve
Williams, Tiger Woods' full-time caddie, is skipping the Buick
Invitational to compete in a car race in New Zealand. In his place,
Woods has handed the bag to Bryon Bell, a high school friend who
caddied for Woods during his victory here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who works as an engineer in Southern California, said his
goal for the week is to ``try not to get in anybody's way.'' Woods
said Bell seemed a natural choice to fill in for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the right to defend his title, too,'' Woods said. ``I'd
feel uncomfortable with anyone else on the bag.'' LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Based on Woods' projected playing schedule, a continuation of
his six-event winning streak would put him in position to tie Byron
Nelson's record of 11 consecutive PGA victories at The Players
Championship (March 23-26). The opportunity for No. 12 would come
at the Masters Tournament (April 6-9).
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he tries not to focus on the future but admitted that
the tournament he considers his biggest obstacle in matching
Nelson's mark is the World Golf Championships-Match Play
Championship, scheduled for Feb. 23-27 in Carlsbad, Calif. Woods
fell to eventual champion Jeff Maggert, 2 and 1, in the
quarterfinals of the 1999 event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always more difficult to win a match-play event,'' Woods
said. ``You can go over there and shoot a great round and somebody
just out-boatraces you, and that's just the way it is. In medal
play, you have three other days to make it up.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting sidelight could be forming for the match-play
event. Woods, the world's No. 1 player, is scheduled to be paired
in the opening round against the No. 64 seed. That could be Michael
Campbell, a New Zealander who ranks No. 67 in the world golf
rankings. Campbell is the last person to defeat Woods in a
full-field event, the 1999 Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand in
November. The tournament did not count against Woods in his streak
because it is not a sanctioned PGA Tour event. NO STREAK TALK
</P>
<P>
   Woods has answered countless questions this week about his
pursuit of Byron Nelson's 11 consecutive victories. But the two
men, despite a longstanding relationship, have never discussed
their respective streaks, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really talked with him about that,'' said Woods,
who won the 1997 GTE Byron Nelson Classic. ``When we get together,
we talk about grips and swings, swing planes, and all different
things about the golf swing. But we've never really talked about
what he did.'' nn

RELEASE THE LETTERS, MRS. CLINTON DEMANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FALLS, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton demanded Thursday
that New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani release all the
fund-raising letters he has mailed out for his U.S. Senate race,
and said that he was running a campaign based on insults.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded that he would release the letters as soon as
Clinton's campaign wrote taxpayers a check for $300,000, the amount
he says she owes to the federal government for her Senate campaign
travel on White House jets.
</P>
<P>
   The election is still nine months away, but both candidates are
acting as if it were more like nine days.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference outside the Ann Street Restaurant and Deli
in this Mohawk Valley town, Clinton said that she wanted New
Yorkers to see the letters so that they could judge for themselves
what kind of campaign the mayor was running against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intended to run a campaign based on issues and ideas, not on
insults,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the mayor, Clinton also said she did not support allowing
teachers to post the Ten Commandments in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she said, ``I have grown up with a very strong
religious faith, and respect not only for my own Judeo-Christian
tradition but the traditions of the great religions. And I try to
live by my tradition. But I also have a great deal of respect for
the United States Constitution. And the Supreme Court has said that
that is not constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion erupted as an issue in the Senate race on Wednesday,
when Clinton denounced Giuliani for attacking her in a fund-raising
letter for what the mailing called her ``hostility toward America's
religious traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, signed by Giuliani, also complained about ``liberal
judges'' who ``have banned the posting of even the Ten Commandments
in our public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani not only defended the letter, but also said that all
New Yorkers should read it. Thursday, he jokingly put up a slide
projection of the Ten Commandments at the end of a City Hall
presentation on the Mayor's Management Report, a twice-yearly
review of the performance of city agencies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Michael Long, the chairman of the state Conservative
Party, sent a letter Thursday to Richard Viguerie, the conservative
direct-mail marketer who has produced many of the mayor's campaign
mailings, saying that Viguerie should drop the mayor as a client
because the mayor is, in Long's opinion, not conservative enough.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign advisers have refused to say who wrote the
letter about Clinton's supposed hostility toward religion. Long,
who is angry with the mayor, has said that his party cannot endorse
Giuliani because he opposes a ban on a form of late-term abortion.

GIULIANI RELEASES GLOWING REPORT ON CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With one eye on his campaign for the U.S. Senate,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani released a report Thursday that charts the
performance of his administration across a broad spectrum of
services, almost all of them showing steady improvement since he
took office in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said his Mayor's Management Report, a three-volume
document that includes more than 100 charts and graphs, was
intended to point to areas where the performance of city agencies
could be improved. But he found few problems to be fixed, and
instead described the city as ``a better place to live, work and
visit than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   Allusions to Giuliani's Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham
Clinton could not have escaped the notice of many in the crowded
City Hall chamber where he spoke for more than an hour,
particularly when he showed a chart comparing crime rates in 74
large cities. New York had the lowest rate, and Giuliani seemed to
delight in pointing to Little Rock, Ark., which ranked 35th on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' he said with a chuckle. ``It's Little Rock. I
thought that was in upstate New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor got a big laugh by ending his presentation with a
slide showing the scrolls of the Ten Commandments. Not known as a
treatise on city management, the commandments had everything to do
with his political scuffle with Clinton this week over religious
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, while campaigning upstate Thursday, again criticized
Giuliani for injecting religion into the race.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's report Thursday was in some ways an exercise in
marketing, offering an accomplished speaker and politician the
opportunity to cull a complex, and highly complimentary,
statistical portrait.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is required by the City Charter to give the report
twice a year. This year it touched on an array of city services,
ranging from crime prevention to the extermination of rats. While
emphasizing the performance of the police and a steady decline in
felony crimes across the city, Giuliani said that ``the most
important change we've brought about'' was a 46 percent reduction
since 1995 in the number of people on public assistance, to 621,902
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the selective nature of the Republican mayor's report
that was challenged by some of his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most troubling is not what you see, but what you don't
see,'' said Peter Vallone, a Democrat and the speaker of the City
Council. ``The report lacks many significant indicators that would
truly show how agencies and the city are performing.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not, for example, give a detailed breakdown of how
city services are provided in different neighborhoods, or data on
the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases or the treatment of
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Some other accomplishments cited by the mayor were a sharp
decline from 1998 to 1999 in traffic accidents related to drunken
driving, which he attributed to a police crackdown in which the
cars of drunken drivers are confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   One agency that stood out in the mayor's report with a less than
stellar performance was his biggest nemesis in the city
bureaucracy, the Board of Education. Giuliani provided graphs
showing that the percentage of public school students performing at
or above their grade level in math had dropped, and that the high
school dropout rate had jumped.

U.S. RELEASES MONEY TO HELP THE POOR PAY RISING HEATING BILLS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reacting to the combination of higher oil prices
and a winter cold snap, the federal government Thursday released
$130 million to offset the heating bills of low-income families
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   New York state will get by far the biggest share, about $34.3
million. New Jersey will get about $7.5 million, and Connecticut
just over $3 million. The funds were freed under a program that
helps families pay for heating and insulating in the winter and
cooling in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 million families receive such assistance each year,
according to the Energy Department, which works with the Department
of Health and Human Services. The amount given to each state is
determined by formulas involving current energy prices, the number
of low-income families in a state and how cold a particular region
has been.
</P>
<P>
   A large portion of the money released Thursday will go to the
Northeast, where many people heat their homes with oil and where,
consequently, the recent sharp increases in crude oil prices have
been felt most keenly.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines for eligibility vary from state to state. Generally,
a family's income must be no more than 150 percent of the official
poverty level for the family to be eligible. If the poverty level
for a family of four in a particular state is $15,000, for example,
a family has to have an annual income no higher than $22,500 to be
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices have more than doubled since last winter _ they
were about $27 a barrel at the beginning of this month _ because
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut production
last March. Now, stockpiles are dwindling, and the effect is being
felt in the marketplace. Home heating oil has recently cost as much
as $2 a gallon in parts of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The federal aid goes to state governments, which distribute it
to families. People who think they are eligible should check with
social service agencies, officials said.

NEW AIRLINE TO EMPHASIZE MORE FLIGHTS FOR UPSTATE NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's newest discount airline, JetBlue Airlines, is to
begin operations Friday out of its new home base at Kennedy
International Airport with flights that, among other things, seek
to ease air travel to an underserved upstate New York market.
</P>
<P>
   With its first flight taking off from Buffalo and flying to
Kennedy and then on to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., JetBlue is to
inaugurate a service that its president, David Barger, said would
eventually send 100 flights a day to more than 30 cities in the
eastern two-thirds of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In its first month of service, the startup airline will charge
$25 one way between Buffalo and Kennedy, and thereafter as little
as $98 round trip depending on travel time. Other scheduled
airlines charge as much as $600 for a round-trip ticket between
Buffalo and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said the airline hoped that travelers would be lured by a
number of features not normally associated with the cattle-car
image of discount flying.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is emphasizing the greater leg room on its
162-passenger Airbus A-320 planes, which include all-leather seats
and television monitors at each seat back with 24 channels to
choose from, as well as the less-crowded traffic at JFK compared
with Newark and La Guardia Airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take longer to get down the Van Wyck Expressway to get
to us,'' Barger said, ``but once you get here you are not going to
be No. 18 in line on the tarmac to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   The start-up of the airline, which with $130 million is said by
analysts to be among the best capitalized new airline ventures
since the 1950s, comes as the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno,
proposed a $650 million plan to improve airports around the state
to increase air service to Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and other
upstate cities.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno and others have long criticized the high fares and lack of
service to upstate cities, calling them factors in the region's
stunted economy.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue expects to be serving Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse
within 18 months, Barger said. Its entry into that market was made
possible by a waiver that federal transportation officials granted
to Kennedy late last year, lifting restrictions on the number of
takeoffs from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. Kennedy, along with La Guardia,
O'Hare in Chicago and Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington,
are the only airports in the country where the Federal Aviation
Administration restricts the number of flights to limit congestion
in the airways.
</P>
<P>
   William R. DeCota, director of aviation for the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy and La Guardia,
said that the waivers were granted after pressure from Sen. Charles
E. Schumer, Gov. George Pataki and members of New York's
congressional delegation.
