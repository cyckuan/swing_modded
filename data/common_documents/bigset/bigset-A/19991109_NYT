PRI EMERGES FROM DEMOCRATIC ELECTION WITH A POLISHED IMAGE 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In the end, a democratic election proved a
cakewalk for the bosses of Mexico's long-ruling party, which had
gained a reputation through the decades as conniving and corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, seen as the candidate of the leaders of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won a landslide victory
in Sunday's four-way primary for the party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's main opponent, who many feared would contest the
results and split the party, accepted defeat Monday and said he
will stay with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party's leadership, disparaged by many as vote-fixing
relics, emerged with a freely elected candidate and a polished
image of electoral righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thought it was going to come out this
well,'' said Francisco Abundis, a pollster for the PRI. ``There's a
clear victor, a big turnout and a humble loser. Does the world get
any better than this?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the party took power in 1929 to quell infighting among the
victors of the Mexican Revolution, the PRI's presidential
candidates were handpicked by Mexico's outgoing president and were
then duly voted into office in stage-managed national elections.
President Ernesto Zedillo announced in March that he was scrapping
that backroom system in favor of an open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 million people voted Sunday, far more than PRI
officials had hoped. As many as a fifth of the votes were cast by
people who did not belong to the PRI. And Labastida's image as a
man of the system, and his message of economic and social
moderation, easily won the day.
</P>
<P>
   A former interior minister and career PRI bureaucrat, Labastida
won 272 of 300 electoral districts, according to official party
results. He out-polled his closest rival, former Tabasco state Gov.
Roberto Madrazo, by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electorate in general prefers a stable course in economic
and social policy,'' said Federico Estevez, a political scientist
with Mexico City's Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.
``The PRI politicians have changed, and the rules have changed.
It's the electorate that is conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want radical change,'' Estevez said. ``That's the
dynamics of this primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, a longtime PRI politician who tried to run as an
outsider, gained in the polls last summer by attacking the
market-oriented economic policies carried out by PRI national
governments since 1985 and by painting Labastida as the party
elite's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's challenge rested on a bet that millions of PRI
rank-and-file members were so angry with their party leadership's
free-market reforms _ which have slashed incomes of the workers and
peasants who are the ruling party's bedrock _ that they would be
ready to revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Similar discontent led Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and other PRI leaders
to defect from the party in 1987, taking millions of voters with
them. Many Mexicans believe Cardenas was cheated of victory in the
1988 presidential elections officially won by Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   But Madrazo's wager on discontent was a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not 1988,'' said Estevez, who as late as September
was predicting a Madrazo victory. ``There was no revolt waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo and the two other primary candidates had complained in
the weeks before the election of unfair campaign practices in favor
of Labastida. Madrazo had made indirect threats that he would leave
the party if Sunday's vote appeared fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida's lopsided win, and the perception that the
election was clean, if not exactly fair, has all but erased the
possibility of a split in the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sweet defeats and bitter victories,'' Madrazo said
in a concession speech early Monday. ``I recognize the tendencies
weren't favorable for me, but you know the process was never
equitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought against the machine and demonstrated it could be
done,'' he said. ``We're going to continue working within the party
in order to create change.''
</P>
<P>
   His victory gives Labastida a strong mandate within the PRI.
Analysts say that over the next week the PRI's opposing factions
will quickly mend fences to get behind their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is considered the front-runner in what will
essentially be a three-man race in the July 2 presidential
elections. Although a handful of splinter parties will field
candidates, Labastida's main opponents are Vicente Fox of the
center-right National Action Party and Cardenas, who leads a
center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Talks aimed at forming an alliance between Fox and Cardenas to
support a single presidential candidate collapsed in September,
guaranteeing the PRI a splintered opposition in next July's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The more democratic image provided the PRI by the primary had
driven up the party's standing in opinion polls by 10 percent even
before Sunday's vote. The outcome will further bolster the ruling
party's fortunes, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is enjoying the equivalent of a convention bounce,''
said Carlos Elizondo, director of CIDE, a Mexico City think tank.
``It has emerged from the primary in a much stronger position than
when it began.''
</P>
<P>
   Its improved fortunes come at a crucial time for the PRI, which
has faced ever stiffer political opposition since 1983. The party
lost control of the lower house of Congress in 1997's elections.
Opposition parties now govern about a third of Mexico's 31 states
and most of its largest urban centers, including Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The big loser may well be Fox, a charismatic former Coca-Cola
executive who resigned the governorship of Guanajuato state to run
for the presidency. Labastida polled strongest Sunday in the
northern Mexico states that have traditionally supported Fox's
National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox has fared well in recent polls against Labastida,
some analysts say there's not enough difference between the two
men's economic and social policies to entice voters to throw the
PRI out of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Fox,'' Estevez said. ``The truth is there are no burning
issues. There is nothing he can grab on to. It will be very hard to
beat back (Labastida's) lead at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's surest winner may have been Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1994 after the PRI's original presidential candidate
was assassinated, Zedillo oversaw the collapse of the peso in
December of that year, which sparked the worse economic crisis in
modern Mexican history. A Yale-trained economist and bureaucrat,
Zedillo gained points for economic management but was seen by many
analysts as politically inept.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot who doubted him after the 1997 election and
the loss of Congress. But now he's going to be much stronger.``
said Sergio Sarmiento, a newspaper columnist and political analyst.
``Zedillo now will be known as the president who democratized the
country.''

KNICKS DEFEAT BUCKS, 111-101 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ernie Grunfeld was a member of a contingent that flew
to Milwaukee nearly a year ago with one purpose in mind: to gauge
whether Latrell Sprewell could resuscitate an aging New York Knicks
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   On yet another wild night at Madison Square Garden, Sprewell and
Marcus Camby made Grunfeld look golden again for acquiring them _
even if it was at the expense of the former Knicks president's new
team.
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling and desperate, the Knicks pulled out a 111-101
victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in overtime. Sprewell rebounded
from an atrocious night from the field by delivering a clutch shot
_ a step-back 3-pointer with eight seconds remaining in regulation
that tied the score and forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 11 points in 5 minutes 42 seconds, continually putting
the dagger in a Milwaukee team that seemed to have the game
clinched in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about myself, I'm never afraid to take another
shot,'' Sprewell said. ``It's like a defensive back in football.
You get burned on one play, you just keep coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell finished with 21 points on 7-of-19 shooting. Allan
Houston led everyone with 30 points and Camby was a force inside,
going for 23 points, 13 rebounds and 6 blocked shots _ including a
rejection of a Ray Allen shot with 1:17 left in overtime as the
Bucks were trying to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Robinson scored 23 to lead Milwaukee. Allen added 18 and
Sam Cassell contributed 14 points and 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Grunfeld's former team beat his new one as the
Knicks moved to &QC; 4-1 and saddled the Bucks (3-1) with their first
loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what he envisioned, Latrell and I playing well and
going up and down the court,'' Camby said of Grunfeld, who traded
for Camby and Sprewell before last season when he was the Knicks'
president. Now he is the Bucks' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Before his pulse-racing 3-pointer, Sprewell had missed 14 shots,
had not scored in the fourth quarter and resembled all that was out
of sync about the Knicks on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had help. Ervin Johnson made the most critical
mistake. After Houston missed a straightaway 3-pointer to tie the
score, a scramble under the basket for the ball ended with Johnson,
the Milwaukee center, corralling the ball on the right baseline.
Falling out of bounds, he threw it right to Charlie Ward, who
kicked it to Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Taking one dribble backward to give himself enough space and
make sure he was behind the arc on the right wing, Sprewell put his
miserable night behind him with a bomb that tied the score at
97-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just calling out to Charlie, `Hey, hey, hey, I'm here!'''
Sprewell said. ``At that point you're not thinking about all the
shots you've missed, you're thinking about the ball going in the
hole. It felt great.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee nearly won in regulation, but Cassell's 19-footer was
off target. Robinson could not put back a rebound less than two
feet away from the rim, forcing the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In the final five minutes, the Knicks went from nearly being
blown out to turning the Garden into a noisy din again.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs helped bring them back with a timely 3-pointer, a
shot that came with 4:26 remaining and cut the lead to 91-88. Camby
added two free throws with 3:51 left to trim the lead to 1.
</P>
<P>
   He showed as much resilience as anyone. Coming down awkwardly on
Danny Manning's foot after a play under the basket, Camby sprained
his right ankle and left the game. The trainer Mike Saunders taped
the ankle, and moments later Camby returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks had the Knicks in trouble earlier in the half. Every
time the Knicks seemed on the verge of getting back in the game,
Milwaukee answered. The most notable retort came midway through the
fourth quarter when Camby dunked to cut the lead to 83-77. With the
crowd chanting for a defensive stop, Allen hit a rainbow jump shot
along the right baseline to quiet the fans _ a shot that may as
well have paid homage to Michael Jordan, who attended the game.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson scored 11 points in the third quarter. Whether he was
following missed shots or using his two-inch height advantage over
the 6-foot-5-inch Sprewell to shoot turnaround jumpers, Robinson
had found a rhythm that was contagious.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Cassell was dropping in 15-footers _ laughing and enjoying
himself as the Knicks came unglued. He had 10 points in the period
after a slow start, and Milwaukee led by 81-72 entering the fourth
quarter. The Bucks turned the game around by using Coach George
Karl's trapping, scrambling defensive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more high-quality halves this season, the Knicks
led by 50-49 at intermission. Early on they built double-digit
leads and moved the ball as well as they have through five games.
</P>
<P>
   During one sequence, Ward used a behind-the-back pass to find
Childs on the perimeter. Childs then whipped a bounce pass 18 feet
inside to Kurt Thomas for a dunk. The Knicks were rolling, sharing
the basketball and finding the open man with ease and precision.
</P>
<P>
   But the more pressure Milwaukee applied on defense, the more the
Knicks wilted.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld was making his first trip to the Garden since he was
reassigned by the Knicks last April. He had a chance to watch his
Bucks, who have every intention of contending for the Eastern
Conference title.

DALY'S FIRST MOVE AN INSPIRED PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers were desperate for a
left-handed bat, a home-grown talent, a clean-cut face. They needed
somebody to connect with the fans and command the spotlight. They
had to find a marquee name for their next production, which opens
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately they had the right guy heading up the search. Newly
named Chairman and CEO Bob Daly learned a thing or two hundred
about securing top talent in his years making movies for Warner
Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Daly rolled up his sleeves, the better to rub elbows with all
the pertinent players in this game-within-the-game. It didn't take
him long to land his first baseball star.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Dodgers announced they had acquired Shawn Green
from Toronto. Central Casting couldn't have conjured up a more
inspired choice.
</P>
<P>
   He is the perfect antidote for a city that had grown tired of
Raul Mondesi, the five-tool, 16-personality player who was shipped
to Toronto in the deal along with left-handed reliever Pedro
Borbon.
</P>
<P>
   Where Mondesi was known as much for his mood swings as his
mighty swings of the bat, Green is a 30-30-100 man: You can pencil
him in for 30 home runs, 30 stolen bases and 100 percent
equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   In extolling Green, general manager Kevin Malone pretty much
excoriated Mondesi, whether he meant to or not. ``Shawn Green,''
Malone said, ``brings that character and integrity so essential to
having a championship franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   So there. Three months after Mondesi threw a tantrum, Malone let
the screen door serve as his de facto paddle and finally let the
petulant player have it. Hey, better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   With Green, who turns 27 on Wednesday, replacing Mondesi as the
subject, discipline will take on a whole different meaning. It'll
no longer be a verb but, rather, a noun that aptly describes how
Green turned himself into a dependable fielder and a batter
consistent enough to cobble together a 28-game hitting streak this
past season.
</P>
<P>
   The devotion Green shows for the game comes paired with a sense
of duty, a rare coupling in today's budding sports superstar. Gord
Ash, the president of the Blue Jays, earlier this year described
Green as ``a very mature young man, a very smart young man, a
credit to the organization, one of the fan favorites,'' which begs
the question: Then why get rid of him?
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays breaking up with Green in order to snuggle with
Mondesi is mind-boggling, like the Spurs dumping David Robinson for
Shaquille O'Neal. Mondesi and O'Neal are red-flagged flings;
team-oriented players like Green and Robinson are keepers, to be
hugged and held onto when it's time to get serious.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decision undoubtedly dictated by money, not love. Ash
knew in his heart Green would bolt after his current contract
expired next year. So he ended the relationship now rather than get
burned later.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi might yet realize his staggering potential. Maybe he'll
even do it as a Blue Jay. If that's to happen, he'll have to
declare a whole lot of maturity at the border. Time will tell and
we wish Mondesi well.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we think it's swell the Dodgers got two players
for their $14 million a year investment: a left-handed hitter and a
leader in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were in dire need of both.
</P>
<P>
   After watching a roomful of guys playing for themselves last
year, it thrilled us to hear Green say he intends to make an impact
with his own play and also ``elevate some of the other performances
of some of the other players on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   No question, the Tustin High graduate is the answer to Dodgers
fans' prayers. Green is not just the Dodgers' future, he is a
composite of the club's storied, starry past:
</P>
<P>
   He played high school ball in Southern California, like Darryl
Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   He's a fiery competitor, like Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   He has left-handed power, like Kirk Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   He is Jewish, like Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   His words, like Vin Scully's, are music to Dodgers fans' ears.
</P>
<P>
   To those who care, his arrival is as welcome as spring
training.

FRESH PRINCE OF MALIBU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Tommie Prince sees them all the time, every
time he goes home. They are the legends of Compton basketball, the
guys who had the dream of playing in the NBA but are now resigned,
sadly, to three-on-three pick-up games in the park or in the gyms
at Crenshaw and Dominguez high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Now these faded stars play against the younger generation, the
15- and 16-year-olds who still have a future.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Prince was coming close to being one of those
has-beens. He hadn't done anything in 1{ years of college
basketball to merit a spot in the NBA and he wasn't on track to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking 12 units a semester and trying to be laid-back,''
Prince said. ``(But) when you're a junior and a senior, reality
starts setting in.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince, who dropped off the college basketball radar screen
after being one of the nation's top 50 recruits at Dominguez in
1995, is back for his senior year at Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Prince earned this season by passing 40 units in 1998, and his
quest to join the players in the NBA, among whom he was once known,
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed Tommie a paper with the `super-sophomores' in high
school in 1994,'' said former Waves head coach Lorenzo Romar.
``There was Ron Mercer, Kevin Garnett, Stephon Marbury, Jelani
McCoy . . . and there was Tommie Prince, right in there with all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he feels like he could be moving on like the rest of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   With first-year head coach Jan van Breda Kolff's new offense,
Prince thinks that can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things we're doing now are the things I was doing
under Russell Otis at Dominguez,'' said Prince, a guard who
averaged 19.4 points and 10 assists his senior year in 1994-95.
``All the pressing, the type of motion offense . . . it gives a lot
of freedom and leisure for everybody on the court. That's kind of
the way I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Prince) can be a great finisher in the open court,'' he said.
``His game will flourish in this style.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also rising to the occasion in other ways. Prince wants to
become a leader, a player the younger Waves can rally behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've matured a lot since I got here,'' Prince said, ``but one
area I need to mature in is leadership. Most of the time, the
coaches tell me I'm a leader by example. But I need to be more of a
vocal leader. The players here follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince, 22, can probably give his teammates sage advice; in the
past four years he's been through his share of trials, both on and
off the court.
</P>
<P>
   In '95, after leading Dominguez to the Division II state title
game, Prince's qualifying SAT score was invalidated by the
Educational Testing Service. UCLA revoked its scholarship offer and
he enrolled at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Prince was arrested along with teammates Gee
Gervin and Rico Harris (Harris played last season at Cal State
Northridge before quitting the team before the Big Sky Conference
tournament) for an alleged sexual and physical assault of a female
student and another woman in a dormitory. Charges were eventually
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out his freshman season at ASU because of his
Prop. 48 status, Prince transferred to Pepperdine. At the time,
Prince, apparently beaten down by the scandal in Arizona, announced
the move through his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Prince was not prepared physically in his sophomore season at
Pepperdine. He shot 39.9 percent and averaged 9.5 points as the
Waves went 6-21 under Romar in '96-'97. Then, a curious trend
developed. Prince's scoring averages dropped the next two seasons,
from 7.8 to 6.3.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the 6-foot-5, 210-pound Prince was no longer a
scorer. But he became the Waves' top defender, and last season was
rewarded by being named the first Defender of the Year in the West
Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we watched him in high school,'' Romar said, ``(Prince)
could flat-out defend. He knows he's a great defender. He takes
pride in it. I know there were times he was disappointed (in not
scoring), but he's such a `team guy' he never balked at it once.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best team guys I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   He still expects to play in the NBA. In last season's media
guide, under post-school plans, he listed ``play professional
basketball . . . anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returns to the Dominguez gym, where the Dons'
championship banners hang as reminders of what he was in high
school, Prince strives to prove himself _ especially to his friends
in the neighborhood who see him as their connection to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people come into the gym and they are like, `That's
Tommie Prince right there,' '' Prince said. ``I've got to live up
to standards. I can't be just playing around . . . they would be
like, `He's not as good as I thought he was.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he'll be an NBA draft pick next spring isn't know, but
one thing is sure: Prince will attend Pepperdine's commencement
ceremonies to receive two degrees _ physical education, with an
emphasis in business, and liberal arts, with an emphasis in
education.
</P>

KINGS NEED DEAL TO MAINTAIN PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes Neice clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings Kings are saying they will
weather the loss of injured stars Luc Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel,
promote some kids to the first line and continue to move forward in
a season that has had such remarkable promise.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, they are checking to see who is
available through trades or on the lists of restricted and
unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor said early last month that he was
mildly interested in unrestricted free agent Joe Murphy, who had
his best years with tonight's opponent, the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor says he is no longer interested, but that doesn't mean he
isn't still looking. Stumpel underwent surgery Monday to repair a
hernia and is expected to miss at least two months.
</P>
<P>
   New coach Andy Murray says the team can flourish with the talent
it has. The second line of Bryan Smolinski, Glen Murray and Donald
Audette has averaged three points a game over the last 10.
Smolinski joined Robitaille, who is out at least three weeks with a
broken bone in his left foot, as NHL players of the week during the
first month.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the Kings' early success has been the production of
the first and second units. Many teams don't have more than one
scoring line and the Kings 9-4-3 start is testament to their
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum generated in the season's first month has been
impressive. Now it is time to keep it going.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Carolina Hurricanes say they are willing to let top
center Keith Primeau sit out the season waiting for a contract that
will never come, it might be time for the Kings to take a look.
Because Primeau is a restricted free agent, the Hurricanes can
match any offer. But they have said he is not worth more $3
million, about $1 million less than what he is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to spend other people's money, but the Kings might
want to take a look at the cash cow growing at the Staples Center
and see what a winner can mean in a city that has yawned as the
Kings missed the playoffs five of the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau not only has scored more than 25 goals five times in
seven full seasons, he adds the kind of grit that was so lacking in
Saturday night's 5-3 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Three times
he has had more than 160 penalty minutes, which is a lot for a
center on a finesse line. Some might think that is a lot of time in
the box.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings have lofty goals this year and they might not
reach them if they get pushed around the way they did by Philly.
Plus, Primeau played for Murray and with captain Rob Blake on the
Canadian National team.
</P>
<P>
   Down in North Carolina the impasse with Primeau often has been
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   He has a house in Raleigh that he wants to sell. When the
Hurricanes were in his native Toronto recently, Primeau was there
but did not visit them. The team is second in the Southeast
Conference, but Primeau has alienated some of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   A similar holdout with Detroit in 1996 forced a Primeau trade to
the then Hartford Whalers. Canes owner Peter Karmanos has said the
dispute will end soon, but there is a lot of tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll settle this thing if Keith Primeau fires his agents,''
Karmanos said. ``Keith should fire his agents for giving him an
exaggerated sense of his own value. Keith Primeau needs to decide
how much he wants to play in the National Hockey League. The team
is doing very well without him. They're probably doing better than
they would be with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Primeau is represented by Don Reynolds and his son, Todd
Reynolds. They aren't going anywhere. There is a strong push by the
NHL Players Association to get players to hold out in an effort to
increase the salary structure.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have the money and they have a big hole at center on
the first line. Stumpel is a gifted stick handler and an excellent
assist man. But since leading the team in scoring two years ago, he
has missed big chunks of playing time with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Or injury prone? When he was around, Stumpel was
impressive. But he won't be there for at least the next two months
and too much is riding on this season to stay the course.
</P>
<P>
   __ Everyone in the gene pool: Calgary right winger Valeri Bure
hasn't made Flames fans forget popular Theo Fleury, but with 10
goals in the first 14 games, he is on a pace for 60 and far ahead
of his more famous brother Pavel of the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Valeri Bure has learned to live up to his name. He's married to
Candace Cameron, former star of the TV sitcom ``Full House.'' His
father, Vladimir, won a silver medal in swimming at the 1972 Summer
Olympics for the Soviet Union, the year Mark Spitz took home all
the gold.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a lot of brother acts in the NHL over the years
_ Esposito, Richard, Turgeon. Usually, one sibling tends to
overshadow the others.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bure house that might be about to change. &QL; 
BLUE LINES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
COMING AND GOING
</P>
<P>
   There is a good chance Edmonton's re-signing of Bill Guerin will
cost the Oilers their top center Doug Weight next season. The
Oilers, who are in town tonight to play the Kings, gave Guerin $3.1
million, a contract to which GM Glenn Sather said he would never
agree to. Weight is a free agent after this season and it is
unlikely Edmonton will want to give him the $4.3 million he is
making this year. If the Oilers drop out of the playoff race, they
could deal Weight. New Jersey is a good bet, but the Devils would
have to pay him more than goaltender Martin Brodeur and defenseman
Scott Stevens. &QL; 
SO FAR, NOT GOOD
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Dallas Stars let go free agents Dave Reid, Pat
Verbeek, Tony Hrkac and Craig Ludwig after winning the Stanley Cup
to make way for top prospects Juha Lind and Pavel Patera. On
Thursday, the Stars placed Lind (one goal, two assists, plus-1 in
10 games) on injured reserve with a bad back and sent Patera (one
goal, four assists, minus-1 in five games) to the minors. &QL; 
BACK HOME
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux returned to the New Jersey Devils, where he was
playoff MVP when the team won the Stanley Cup in 1995. Lemieux's
age, $2.47 million salary and impending free agency were the
critical factors in the deal, a transaction the 15-year NHL veteran
reluctantly requested when it became clear that Avalanche general
manager Pierre Lacroix was not going to re-sign him. Colorado will
get New Jersey's third-round pick if the Devils trade or re-sign
Lemieux, who becomes an unrestricted free agent at the end of this
season and turns 35 in July. &QL; 
TROUBLE IN BUFFALO
</P>
<P>
   As if the loss of Dominek Hasek wasn't bad enough, the Buffalo
Sabres are shopping Dixon Ward after a falling out with coach Lindy
Ruff. Sabres GM Darcy Regier says the story isn't true, but this is
the same Regier who said last December he wasn't talking to the
Kings about Donald Audette just days before the trade was
completed. Dallas and Chicago are interested in Ward, who played
briefly for the Kings during the 1993-94 season and is considered
valuable for the playoffs. &QL; 
BACK IN THE DAY
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, goalie Rick Tabaracci made $1.2 million playing for
the Washington Capitals. He held out after the season trying to get
a better deal, but none was forthcoming. He first refused a
two-year contract offer by the expansion Atlanta Thrashers. A week
later he agreed. The deal says $500,000 if he is in the NHL and
$75,000 if he is playing in the minors. Tabaracci is not expected
to make the big club this year even though it is 3-7-2. &QL;

LIBERTY MEMORIAL PARTY WILL CELEBRATE $65 MILLION REVITALIZATION
EFFORT

 BC- LIBERTY-RESTORATION-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA and STEVE PENN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo.--Liberty Memorial
towers over a nearly perfect silence these days.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of bustling crowds, the only sounds are leaves rustling
on the cracked steps and the faint hum of traffic down Pershing
Road.
</P>
<P>
   Doran Cart, the museum's curator, says it was just as silent on
the battlefields of Europe at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918, when the
armistice took effect, ending World War I. The guns instantly fell
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   There followed one whale of a party.
</P>
<P>
   After being dormant for five years, the Liberty Memorial will
throw a party of its own on Thursday. City officials, veterans and
others will celebrate a $65 million revitalization of the World War
I memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Work could start in earnest after the first of the year. The
monument was closed in 1994 after inspectors discovered structural
defects and signs of deterioration that had accumulated over nearly
eight decades.
</P>
<P>
   Although the re-opening of Union Station just down the street
might be getting more attention, the memorial also means a lot,
supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you look at something so vibrant and see it closed, of
course it's sad,'' Cart said. ``This truly is an important
milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   The first phase is expected to be finished in November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But it's too early for memorial supporters to declare total
victory.
</P>
<P>
   A citywide sales tax, passed last year, will raise $45 million
for repairs and creation of a $15 million endowment for ongoing
maintenance. So far, officials have raised $62 million in public,
private, state and federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, however, still need to raise $18 million in private
donations for an expanded museum at the monument's base. The
fund-raising's progress will determine the speed of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have started several initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   A Kids for Liberty Campaign in Kansas City that began in August
has raised $11,000 for the project. Children are collecting coins
in miniature cardboard banks shaped like the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just kids collecting,'' said Christie Green,
marketing director for the Save Liberty Memorial Monument campaign.
``We have kids and folks up to 87 years old who've been
participating.''
</P>
<P>
   Local residents also are participating in a fund-raising effort
called the Liberty Memorial Walk of Honor. People can buy a
personalized, engraved granite brick for $100, $250 or $1,000 _
depending on the size.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of residents have purchased bricks, raising thousands
of dollars in funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a time to pat ourselves on the back,'' said John
Owen, president of the Liberty Memorial Association. ``We can
celebrate Thursday, but we still have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to duplicate the community passion evident in
1919, when more than 83,000 residents raised more than $2 million
in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, 1921, close to 200,000 people jammed the streets and
Penn Valley Park to celebrate the project's start. Allied leaders
from Italy, France, Belgium and Great Britain were special guests.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony, Gen. John J. Pershing said that ``this memorial
also symbolizes the obligation that rests upon present and future
generations to preserve that for which those men and women offered
their all.''
</P>
<P>
   President Calvin Coolidge helped open the monument in 1926.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial hoopla, the city largely ignored the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, city officials noticed some deterioration. In
1964, the monument was closed for restoration. Attendance slumped
in the 1970s and 1980s but grew in the 1990s to about 145,000
visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   Then, days before Veterans Day 1994, inspectors found a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Cycles of freezing and thawing had damaged the concrete deck,
allowing water to seep onto reinforcing steel rods, corroding them.
The cycles also had damaged the courtyard and steps.
</P>
<P>
   Water had also seeped under the deck, causing a concrete
substructure to crumble, too. And under the deck, engineers
discovered a leaking fuel tank that had to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial has been closed to visitors since.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City voters helped save the memorial last year when they
approved a half-cent sales tax for renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration will fortify the structural support system under
the courtyard, replace the elevated decks and stairways and restore
or replace the fountains, urns and sphinxes.
</P>
<P>
   The city also will restore Memory Hall, the administration
building, the tower and the grounds adjacent to the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Cart works on the memorial grounds in an office crammed
with boxes of documents, photos and artifacts. A painting from the
1920s shows the memorial's base bathed in darkness with rays of
sunlight emerging from the east.
</P>
<P>
   Cart keeps busy. He says interest in World War I has grown, even
while the memorial has been closed.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's collections have appeared at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington and in television specials. A new Web
site, www.libertymemorialmuseum.org, has drawn interest from all
over the world. Cart also dresses in a World War I uniform for
``living history'' presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who fought, we have their uniforms, we have their
letters. That's really cool. I hate to keep using that word, but it
is,'' Cart said. ``You can tell I like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we just need to let people learn about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope the expanded museum will help.
</P>
<P>
   Initial plans include a simulated battlefield, interactive
exhibits, classrooms and space to display artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   And with Science City celebrating its opening this week,
memorial supporters see the new museum as a boost, not a threat.
Cart noted that World War I soldiers went off to war from Union
Station. The memorial also will operate an exhibit in the new
Science City museum.
</P>
<P>
   An economic feasibility study conducted by Midwest Research
Institute concludes that 240,000 people a year are likely to visit
a restored Liberty Memorial, an increase from 140,000 in 1993. The
expected increase is largely tied to crossover traffic from Science
City.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Kemper Dietrich is a member of the Liberty Memorial's
executive committee and is a former park board commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich said Kansas Citians should feel proud of what's
happening with the memorial and Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two historic structures that are getting a new
life,'' Dietrich said. ``It's not just going to be local citizens
enjoying those places. You'll have people coming from all over to
see them both. The area is going to be a huge draw.''

FEDERAL REGULATORS EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT THE PROPOSED MCI WORLDCOM
PURCHASE OF SPRINT CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo.--Federal regulators
said Monday that Congress should be concerned about how mergers
like the proposed MCI WorldCom purchase of Sprint Corp. will affect
consumers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard and
Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky told a Senate
committee that laws Congress wrote to spur competition could have
the opposite effect in the booming telecommunications field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want to see is for that engine of
competition somehow squelched by monopolistic power and
competition,'' Kennard testified to the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation. ``You have to be very
watchful.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard reiterated his misgivings about the merger of MCI
WorldCom and Sprint, the second- and third-largest long-distance
carriers. It requires FCC approval and is subject to extensive
review and public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time, more than ever before, to make sure any
merger will serve the public interest,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing was about the general subject of
telecommunications mergers, but the Sprint and MCI WorldCom deal
surfaced repeatedly. The FTC and the Justice Department review
anti-trust implications of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky told the committee that the number of
telecommunications merger requests has increased 50 percent since
1994 and the value of the combined companies has increased
eightfold. One merger is seen as justifying the next one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must ask where it's going to end,'' Pitofsky said.
``Congress should be very concerned about that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kennard nor Pitofsky proposed any changes in federal law
to alter the merger landscape. Kennard said Congress should
continue to ``make sure there is a strong counterforce in
government'' against harmful consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who is chairman of the
committee, said companies are merging to expand services and to
compete more effectively. But he said small firms could be squeezed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more industry becomes consolidated, the harder it is for
new companies to enter the market or for small companies already in
the market to survive,'' McCain said. ``And if small businesses
cannot compete in the telecom market in the information age, what
stake will small businesses have in our economy as a whole?''
</P>
<P>
   John Sidgemore, vice chairman of MCI WorldCom, defended the
merger to the committee, saying it will combine the best of both
companies to create a more competitive business. AT&AMP;T controls 43
percent of the long-distance market, compared to a combined 36
percent for the other two firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember that all mergers are not the
same,'' Sidgemore said. ``This is not a merger of monopolies. This
(merger) is so we can become large enough in scope to compete with
a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard similar
testimony from Bernard Ebbers, president and chief executive
officer of MCI WorldCom, and from William T. Esrey, Sprint chairman
and chief executive. No one from Sprint testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican
who is on the committee, Sidgemore said he didn't expect any major
shift in jobs because of the merger. Sprint, based in Westwood,
employs about 18,000 people in Missouri and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly likely the concentration of people around the
country will remain the same,'' Sidgemore said. ``We've made 60
acquisitions in the last four years and it's just about universal
that we largely keep operations in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some jobs may be consolidated, Sidgemore said the total
number of employees in the combined companies will probably
increase in about a year. That has been the history after other
acquisitions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said he has not yet taken a position on the merger.
Sens. John Ashcroft of Missouri and Pat Roberts of Kansas, both
Republicans, said last week they lean in favor of the deal. Sen.
Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican, was noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback asked Sidgemore about concern that the merger would
give the new company too much dominance in the Internet backbone
services, the network infrastructure that connects service
providers to the Internet. Sprint is the largest backbone provider
and MCI WorldCom is the second largest. Together, they control
roughly 45 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a robustly competitive market,'' Sidgemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, MCI was required to sell off its Internet backbone
service before its merger with WorldCom won government approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``MCI WorldCom's acquisition of Sprint would constitute the same
serious threat to competition in the Internet backbone as MCI's
merger with WorldCom just one year ago,'' testified Mike McTighe,
chief executive officer of global operations for Cable &AMP; Wireless,
which acquired the backbone service from MCI.

FERRELLGAS WILL BUY THERMOGAS; WILL BECOME LARGEST PROPANE RETAILER
IN THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   Kansas City, Mo.--Ferrellgas Partners LP
in Liberty said Monday that it had agreed to buy Thermogas Co. _ a
purchase that will make it the largest propane retailer in the
United States.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The purchase, expected to be completed by year-end, will boost
the amount of propane sold by Ferrellgas by 42 percent, to 1
billion gallons a year. And, the company said it was not ready to
put away its wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a goal on big, we'll continue to look for
acquisitions,'' said Dan Sheldon, president and chief executive
officer of Ferrellgas.
</P>
<P>
   Thermogas will be the 50th propane business bought by Ferrellgas
since 1994. It is also the largest acquisition in Ferrellgas'
history, which dates to 1939, when the business was founded as the
A.C. Ferrell Butane Co. in Atchison, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrellgas agreed to pay $432.5 million for Thermogas, which is
a holding of the Williams Cos. in Tulsa, Okla. The deal calls for
$257.5 million in cash and the balance in ``units,'' which are used
instead of shares in the Ferrellgas partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrellgas in 1997 accused Thermogas in a lawsuit of trying to
steal some of its trade secrets. The suit was settled in September
for a seven-figure amount. Sheldon said the suit was simply a
business dispute and was in no way related to the purchase of
Thermogas.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Monday the decision to sell Thermogas, which is
the country's fifth-largest propane retailer, was part of its
strategy to concentrate on wholesale businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Propane is a popular fuel used for heating homes and businesses
in small towns and rural areas. Ten billion to 11 billion gallons
are used a year in the United States. But growth is sluggish, and
propane companies looking to grow have been snapping up
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrellgas does business in 45 states. That number won't grow
with Thermogas, but the deal will strengthen the Liberty company in
some states, especially Michigan, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Illinois,
Minnesota, Indiana and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Thermogas has 300,000 customers in 18 states. The purchase will
give Ferrellgas about 10 percent of the propane market, meaning it
will surpass AmeriGas Inc., based in Valley Forge, Pa. AmeriGas had
been the largest propane company. Ferrellgas currently has 800,000
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was celebrated at Ferrellgas headquarters with
Ferrellgas and Thermogas trucks parked outside. The Liberty offices
have 265 employees and, Sheldon said, that is expected to grow by
40 to 50 employees with the Thermogas purchase.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 1,400 Thermogas employees, which would bring
Ferrellgas to a total of 6,000, he said they would be offered jobs.
Those who decide to stay will become owners of the company. About
58 percent of Ferrellgas is owned by the employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Ferrellgas partnership units are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange. The units closed Monday at 15 apiece, up , after
hitting a 52-week low of 14.

   And yet just about every big movie exhibition company in the
United States, including Kansas City-based {AMC Entertainment
Inc.}, is bleeding as much red as a John Carpenter horror movie.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the curse of the Grand 24, the unseen monster of a
moviehouse AMC built in 1995 in Dallas, the first of its kind.
Before Stan Durwood, the recently deceased head of AMC, dreamed up
the 24-movie-screen Grand 24, the industry had never seen such a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But after Durwood built it, moviegoers came _ in droves. So AMC
built more.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, just about every major player in the exhibition business
felt compelled to jump on the Hollywood wagon.
</P>
<P>
   In a rather ignoble ``tribute'' to Durwood after his death, one
of his competitor's allegedly called him a ``pioneer of
overbuilding''.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-year period ending in 1998, the industry added more
than 6,400 movie screens _ almost a 24 percent jump. Thousands more
have been added this year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the spending on these new palaces coupled with
money-losing older complexes, every large publicly owned chain has
seen profits erode.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bill Kartozian, the outgoing president of the
National Association of Theatre Owners, sounded a warning to the
industry at the annual ShowEast trade fair: ``I would urge caution
and prudence in (further) expansion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry now finds itself facing its ultimate screen test _
the overscreening of America.
</P>
<P>
   Americans love going to the movies, especially with holiday
season blockbusters about to be released.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they spent about $7 billion, an industry record. That
equates to almost 1.5 billion movie-watching experiences, up 6.7
percent from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   And this year is expected to be even better. In 1999, Americans
are expected to pony up an estimated $7.5 billion for their doses
of escapism.
</P>
<P>
   It all shows up in the top line for exhibition companies.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last month AMC reported record-breaking second
quarter sales of $334 million. Yet the bottom line showed a loss of
$202,000.
</P>
<P>
   The loss is attributed to a $12 million charge the company took
in the quarter to reflect a restructuring that eliminated 100 jobs.
The move should take $20 million a year out of operating expenses,
a move Wall Street applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Without the restructuring costs, AMC would have earned 30 cents
a share, down from the 33 cents for the same period the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to AMC's first quarter, revenues were again
record-breaking. Still, the bottom line losses swelled to $17
million compared with $3 million for the same period the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario is much the same for the other publicly owned
exhibition firms. They are being hurt by the massive costs of
building megaplexes. These complexes, which typically have at least
18 screens, cost upwards of $20 million each to construct.
</P>
<P>
   And those companies that can't or won't build megaplexes
continue to lose business.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the stock of every publicly owned exhibition
company has posted negative one-year returns ranging from 24.90
percent for AMC to 46.75 percent for Carmike Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   AMC last year lost just over $16 million, while Lowe's Cineplex,
viewed by many on Wall Street as the best exhibitor, lost almost $6
million. For General Cinema Companies, the loss was more than $41
million. And Carmike Cinemas lost more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   As confidence has eroded, so have bond ratings. In late summer,
Moody's Investor Services downgraded both Regal Cinemas Inc. and
United Artists Theatre Co. Just recently, United Artists breached
its covenants on a $450 million loan.
</P>
<P>
   For chains like AMC and Lowe's, the bottom line losses are
relatively easy to explain. Part of the equation is the massive
investment costs to build megaplexes.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of it is what Brown calls ``blended returns''.
</P>
<P>
   ``The returns on the multiplexes are declining and at the same
time you have the new megaplexes that are coming on line which are
producing excellent returns,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line _ the old, outdated, undesirable multiplexes _
usually 14 screens or fewer _ are dragging down entire chains.
</P>
<P>
   To address this paradox, AMC is easing off the accelerator on
megaplexes. So are others.
</P>
<P>
   Still, AMC is fully committed to having 100 percent of its
screens in megaplexes within the next three to five years. It's
just going a little slower in getting there. Already, more than 60
percent of its almost 2,800 screens are in megaplexes.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lowe's Cineplex, with its strong balance sheet AMC's most
formidable competitor, is backing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We applaud those moves,'' said Spencer Wang of Salomon Smith
Barney. ``We see them being more rational about where they're
building, about where they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he understands AMC investors are frustrated by the
company's weak stock price, which closed Monday at 12, down . But,
he said, all his team can do is build a fundamentally strong
business and let Wall Street price the stock.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with analysts, Brown said they don't seem to
have AMC-specific concerns. Rather, their concerns are with the
industry's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel O'Neill, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said
there's a phrase Wall Street analysts use in those scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trapped in their own cage,'' O'Neill said of the movie
companies. ``They're saying `We're doing everything right and
everyone else is doing it wrong.' ''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill remains bullish on AMC, rating it a strong buy. He's
looking for a 12-month target price of $26. Wang is a little more
reticent on his outlook for AMC. ``But we like a lot of the things
we see them doing,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1998, the movie industry had nearly 24 percent
more movie screens than existed at the end of 1995. At the same
time, the number of locations declined slightly.
</P>
<P>
   With such trends, it's expected that within three to five years
the major-markets landscape will be dotted primarily with
megaplexes. Gone for the most part will be the money-draining
twins, quads and multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the abundance of screens is giving Hollywood ample
supply for its products.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives the studios an advantage when negotiating which
theaters will get to show their next hoped-for movie blockbuster.
This also hurts the bottom line for exhibitors since they must pay
higher film-rental costs.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition industry operates in zones. When studio
executives are getting set to release a new movie, they'll look at
all the theaters within a zone. If there are two strong performers
close to each other, they can use that as a negotiating tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the studios' perspective, more screens is better, but
better screens is even better,'' said Wang. ``The theory is
(moviegoers) will have a better theatrical experience, which should
build more traffic. That makes it easier to negotiate film rental
costs because the studios have more options.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang said the number of titles that Hollywood is producing each
year peaked in the mid-1990s, and has declined slightly each year,
partly because of astronomical production costs.
</P>
<P>
   So the realignment of the exhibition industry seems to be coming
at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brown says the business is still a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still the first window for the distribution of film
product,'' Brown said. ``It's the launch pad that really
establishes the value of the movie for all the windows that follow,
the video-rental window, the pay-per-view window, the DVD-window,
and maybe someday, the Internet window.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really just a reconfiguration process,'' Brown said.
``Everybody is going through it _ it's just a little more painful
for some than it is for others.''

LANDFILL OPPONENTS OUST COUNTY COMMISSIONER, GO AFTER ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   EUREKA, Kan. _ You wouldn't guess it
from a quick visit to this town, a peaceful and workaday sort of
place where folks just passed a school bond issue and like to talk
proudly about the local hospital.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But around here, people can play awfully rough with their
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   For months a trash disposal controversy has raged. Opponents of
the project wrote complaint letters and held meetings, but they
didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   They began an effort to oust members of the three-person
Greenwood County Commission, which had entertained the idea of
constructing a regional landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, after gathering enough signatures on recall petitions
against Commission Chairman Chris Lance, removed him from office at
a special election in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't government,'' said Lance. ``This is rule by mob.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commissioner faces a special election in December, and
predictions are that voters will banish him, too.
</P>
<P>
   The last embattled commissioner fears they're coming for him
next.
</P>
<P>
   All three say they did nothing wrong. The possible landfill,
they say, was a way to ease longstanding county budget problems.
Now, they say, the county has descended into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The ruckus involves Wichita trash. An outdated landfill there
will close in 2001. As a replacement, Browning-Ferris Industries, a
trash company, proposed a regional landfill several miles east of
Eureka. The County Commission was receptive to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But citizens arose in anger. More than 1,000 signed petitions
against the landfill. Nevertheless, county leaders refused to back
off.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders at the Kansas Association of Counties have never heard
of a situation where voters attempted to recall an entire county
commission. Veterans of trash disposal battles are amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty unusual,'' said Randall L. Allen,
executive director of the association, although recalls
occasionally occur.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said county commissions and other local governing bodies
face increased pressures today, as well as a more contentious
political environment than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Landfills often cause disputes in Kansas, but never like in
Greenwood County, said Bill Bider, waste management director for
the Kansas Health and Environment Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The political guillotine surprised Harv Ebers, special projects
manager for Browning-Ferris, who has witnessed landfill battles in
many parts of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever seen a group get so nasty
that they would recall their own neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Browning-Ferris, he said, has begun looking for a landfill site
outside the county.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the protest group make no apologies for their action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recall was the only way we could have a say,'' said one of
them, Pam Collinge, a fourth-grade teacher in Eureka. ``That was
the only way we could get the commission's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently a new member joined the commission, appointed to
replace the ousted member. If other commissioners are ousted,
replacements will be appointed for them. Local leaders of the
ousted commissioner's party recommend a replacement, who is
appointed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The fight concerns not just a landfill, but also money, and the
way elected officials treat constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood County, not a wealthy place, struggles to pay for such
things as bridge improvements. Worse yet, the outdated county
landfill must shut down, a move that may cost as much as $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Browning-Ferris and the county never reached a final deal. But
in return for inviting in the landfill, the county could have
realized annual payments of at least $125,000, significant money
for a county with a $4 million annual budget. Plus, Browning-Ferris
may have been willing to take care of the old landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, trash trucks from Wichita would have been roaring
through Greenwood County.
</P>
<P>
   The County Commission wasn't very open about discussing these
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Two commissioners visited a landfill in western Kansas, without
giving adequate notice they might be conducting what amounts to a
public meeting. There was a similar visit to the site of the
proposed landfill east of Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Corbin of Towanda, whose district includes
Greenwood County, said politicians must keep constituents
well-informed when touchy issues such as landfills arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they communicated with the public very well,''
he said of the commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining original commissioners aren't contrite and aren't
saying anything nice about landfill opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've set justice and democracy back to the 1800s,'' said
Stan Kurtz, whose ouster election comes next month.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Fankhauser, who may face recall later, acknowledged that
the commission should have been more aggressive with public
announcements about the possible landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was trying to keep it a secret,'' he said. ``Everybody
got the idea we were sneaking around.''
</P>
<P>
   Fankhauser still sees merit in a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are we going to go with the trash?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenwood County Solid Waste Committee, a planning group, is
considering the question. It has tentatively agreed to recommend
that trash be hauled to established landfills outside the county,
and may recommend a temporary property tax increase to pay for
closing the local landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Cole Conard, the committee chairman and a leading opponent of
the proposed landfill, said the dispute boils down to one thing:
government leaders refusing to heed their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to do it,'' he said of the recall. ``We told
them over and over. They were just not listening to the people.''

HOWARD CHOOSES USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Banning High running back Chris Howard used the
television to help him make an important decision this past
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at a couple of games (on tv) this weekend to see
where I fit in best,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer turned out to be the place that speculation had
Howard headed to for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought USC would be the best place for me,'' said Howard,
who has yet to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 190-pound Howard, who is one of the most coveted
running backs in the nation, said he intended to inform the USC
coaches, as well as the coaching staffs of finalists Texas A&AMP;M,
Tennessee, Oregon and Oregon State, of his decision on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go to a dominating school,'' said Howard,
``but one that was building toward the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard rushed for 2,495 and 33 touchdowns as a junior, but ankle
and knee injuries have slowed him down this season.
</P>
<P>
   He began the year by rushing for 241 yards on 22 carries with
four touchdowns, including an 85-yard kickoff return. However,
injuries limited him against St. Paul and kept him out against
Mater Dei. In seven games, Howard has 1,147 yards and 12
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, who was recruited to USC by offensive coordinator Hue
Jackson and didn't take any official trips, was one of the Trojans
primary targets. The Trojans are still seeking tailbacks Maurice
Morris of Fresno City College and Manuel White of Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (USC) is getting the best running back in the state,''
Banning coach Ed Lalau said.
</P>
<P>
   The tailback position will be wide open for USC going into next
season. Senior Chad Morton, who has three games to gain the 203
yards needed to become the school's first 1,000-yard rusher since
Delon Washington in 1995 and only the third in the 90's, will be
gone and redshirt freshman Sultan McCullough appears next in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he could be a difference maker right off the bat for
them,'' Lalau said. ``He has his best games in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard knows that there could be a lot expected from him
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is a game of expecations,'' Howard said. ``I can
handle that.''

LOSS OF EMMITT, AIKMAN TURNED LEADERS TO LOSERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Cowboys have lost games this season for a
variety of reasons. Lack of offensive production ... lack of
defensive talent ... couldn't hold a late lead ... and to hear the
street-corner choir sing it, no imagination by the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, however, applied here Monday night, even if some
of the same circumstances existed.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line will show a loss to the Minnesota Vikings, a
rag-tag outfit that was very beatable, but also very fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   This was a case, however, of the Cowboys simply being depleted
of their most valuable bodies.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was Emmitt Smith. Gone in the second quarter with a
fractured hand. Next it was Troy Aikman. Gone in the third quarter
with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Almost logically, the next to go was the Cowboys' lead, which
had been 17-zip in the first half. And finally, this was a contest
that got away from the Cowboys, despite the fact they were as game
as they've been all season against any team not named the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the coulda-woulda-shoulda factor is nothing more than
a song and dance for whiners. But the Cowboys actually earned the
right Monday night to lament loudly about what might have been,
despite a 27-17 loss.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Emmitt might have run all night and scored all
night against a Vikings' defense that appeared to have the heart of
a mosquito. Smith had busted up Minnesota for 140 yards by midway
through the second quarter, over half that mileage coming on
quick-strike touchdown runs of 63 and 24 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On his last TD, however, Emmitt bounced off numerous would-be
tacklers on his way to the end zone. The only problem was the
broken hand that had come on the first touchdown run, although he
kept playing. But finally, the doctors said ``no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Going in, the key to winning this game was Emmitt being a mighty
force on the ground. Run-stoppage is and was a problem for the
Vikings. With a 17-point lead, the Cowboys were in a clock-grinding
mode against what appeared to be a hopeless and helpless defense.
</P>
<P>
   The entire game changed with the Smith injury. And when Aikman
took yet another blow to the noggin in the third quarter ... well,
Jason Garrett became an easy mark, and the Dallas offense was going
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   No Emmitt. No Aikman. The worst kind of nightmare for the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And for what it's worth, there might as well have been no Deion.
For the second consecutive week, Nine-Toed had his image stripped
naked by Minnesota's collection of all-world receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Deion took his longest fall late in the third quarter, with the
Cowboys' defense playing it's best overall game of the season,
while also doing a good job of protecting what was a 17-13 lead. As
usual, Vikings' quarterback Jeff George self-destructed on an
end-zone throw that was picked off at the goal line by safety
George Teague. His nice return got the ball out to the 30-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   But a yellow hankie hit the turf. Deion had been observed
holding receiver Randy Moss. Wipe out the interception. And
whatever chance the Cowboys had of holding on, it ended right
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, with new Prime Time life, went in for the go-ahead
touchdown. Moss got the wrapper in the fourth quarter when he beat
cornerback Charlie Williams on a long bomb. Williams was in because
Kevin Smith had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, it was an evening of so much going wrong for the
Cowboys, even before Emmitt and Aikman had to exit.
</P>
<P>
   The offense was sharp early, but also mainly scoreless. On the
first possession, tight end David LaFleur continued his unreliable
ways by dropping a pass inside the Minnesota 5-yard line. And then
Richie Cunningham had toe problems again _ he missed a 42-yard
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham choked once more, shanking a 37-yard try on the next
Dallas possession.
</P>
<P>
   On the third possession, more disaster. The Cowboys reached the
Vikings' 13, but the drive died when guard Everett McIver _ another
bust this season _ was flagged for holding. Cunningham finally got
it right on a 39-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The list of mistakes goes on and on, but as big as anything was
a wayward snap by center Mark Stepnoski that set up a Minnesota
touchdown late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Down 17-0 at the time, it allowed the Vikings to salvage
something out of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest gifts of all for Minnesota were the injuries to
Emmitt and Aikman. That's the only reason the Vikings won. nn

MONDESI GONE, GREEN HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Dodgers, who shook up
baseball last winter by signing right-hander Kevin Brown for a
record $105 million, were at it again Monday, trading the
disgruntled Raul Mondesi to Toronto for Shawn Green after the
former Blue Jays outfielder agreed to a six-year deal for $84
million.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the four-player trade was Dodgers reliever Pedro
Borbon and Blue Jays minor-league infielder Jorge Nunez, but it was
the swap of the five-tool outfielders in their prime, and the Green
signing, that rocked baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Green was about to enter the final year of his contract before
becoming a free agent. After having been turned down by Greenon a
four-year extension for $44.5 million from Toronto, Blue Jays
general manager Gord Ash felt he had to make the trade or risk
getting nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was orchestrated by Jeff Moorad, the agent for both
Mondesi and Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we just experienced a very unique form of advanced
free agency, or I should say accelerated free agency,'' Moorad
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both outfielders are regarded as five-tool players, but Green
had two things going for him that Mondesi did not: He bats left and
wanted to play for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' most glaring weakness continued to be the need for
a powerful left-handed bat. Green, who went to Tustin High School
in Orange County and turns 27 on Wednesday, had an outstanding
season last year, batting .309 with 42 home runs and 123 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Daly, the Dodgers' new chairman, said he met with Moorad
first to make sure Mondesi did not want to return to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was positive after that meeting that Mondesi did not want to
be with the Dodgers,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical for us to have players on the team who want to
be here and will create a winning atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition did not come cheaply. Green received a $4 million
signing bonus, a salary of $8.75 million next season, $11.5 million
in 2001, $12.75 million in 2002, $15 million in 2003 and $16
million in each of his final two years.
</P>
<P>
   In Brown and Green, the Dodgers now have the two
highest-salaried players per yearly average in baseball. The club
had talked of trying to bring a payroll expected to be around $90
million next season under control, but it now has two players who
will combine to average $29 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it scares me,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   But Daly said Mondesi would have received $13 million in the
final year of his contract, so the Dodgers were actually adding
only ``a couple million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we looked at Brown and our power right fielder, we had in
our long-term plan to spend somewhere in the area of $26-$28
million,'' Daly said. ``I wish it were less, but the impact is a
lot less than you think from our planning purposes. We couldn't
have traded a player earning $1 million. We were trading dollars to
a certain extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Mondesi would go along with the deal, the Blue Jays
agreed to pick up the final two option years in his original
four-year contract, paying him $11 million in 2002 ad $13 million
the next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' Mondesi said from his home in the Dominican
Republic. ``I feel great they wanted me. All I want is to be given
an opportunity. Just let me play and relax. That's all I want.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of different things went on last year. Too much
problems, and I don't need that anymore. I told them if you guys
don't want me here, trade me. That's what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   After a fast start last year, Mondesi struggled. He first
demanded a trade during a profanity-filled explosion in Montreal
last August, blasting both Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone and
manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who will be 29 next season, hit a career-low .253 but
ended up with 33 home runs, 99 RBI and 36 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   But in Green the Dodgers get a disciplined, hard-working
outfielder just entering the prime of his career, and who happens
to bat left. Johnson said he will swap Green and Gary Sheffield in
the third and fourth spots in the lineup, depending on the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it was no reflection on Mondesi, the Dodgers consistently
spoke of Green's ``character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about the challenges ahead,'' Green said.
``If I was going to leave Toronto, I wanted to go to a situation
where I thought the team was committed to winning, and I wanted to
go there and be a building block for that. I thought the Dodgers
are the perfect team to fit the mold, not to mention the place I
wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's contract includes a no-trade clause for all six years,
and bonuses of $100,000 for being named an All-Star, earning a Gold
Glove, capturing a Silver Slugger, a LCS MVP; $150,000 for a World
Series MVP; and $250,000 for a league MVP.

CONFLICTED GRIFFEY SAYS HE'S NOT READY TO `QUIT ON MARINERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mariners fans have begun untying their heartstrings.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Griffey Jr. hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   As far as he's concerned, he's still a Mariner, and he doesn't
like some of the national and local portrayals of him as a bad guy
who last week demanded a trade from his team of 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners can't do anything, and I can't do anything unless
both parties agree (on a trade),'' he said. ``If we don't agree,
I'm coming to spring training like always.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never quit on anything. Why would I quit on the Mariners
after all these years?''
</P>
<P>
   In a long phone conversation from his home in Orlando, Griffey
elaborated on his position for the first time after others had been
speaking for him. Griffey seemed dismayed about some fan and media
opinions that held his decision was primarily about money.
</P>
<P>
   He also was bothered that M's executives Howard Lincoln, Chuck
Armstrong and Pat Gillick, who met with Griffey and his agent,
Brian Goldberg, in Florida, called a press conference in Seattle to
say they were honoring his trade request.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who in a balloting among his peers was voted player of
the decade last week, said he never flat-out requested a trade. He
did confirm that, at the meeting, he wouldn't sign the Mariners'
offer of a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by Gillick if the Mariners could do anything to get
him to sign beyond the 2000 season, when his current contract
expires, the Mariners reported Griffey as saying no, a point not
disputed by Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said Monday he was more equivocal, saying he didn't
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't close the door,'' he said Monday. ``I still can go
to spring training like always.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's interpretation of the meeting caught the Mariners
unawares, according to Gillick, who was reached at the general
managers meetings in Laguna Niguel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised,'' he said, declining to elaborate on the
meeting because he promised confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, when pressed on whether he believes his position has
been misrepresented, demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no hard feelings about it,'' he said. ``That part's
over with. This is a new week.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey did not characterize his feelings this week as a change
of heart, but maintained that he hasn't fully considered everything
involved in being a ``a commuter dad'' between Orlando and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his family-first priority, saying the baseball
travel from Seattle is a huge problem that will cost him time with
his young family. The issue became acute with the charter-plane
death of golfer Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Although Griffey earlier acknowledged the tragedy that claimed a
friend and neighbor hit him hard, he elaborated about why.
</P>
<P>
   ``My phone rang maybe 40 times that morning,'' he said. ``The
first news reports about the plane going off course said a
prominent athlete from the Orlando area was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of any new contract he signs with a team, Griffey will
propose and expects to get numerous charter-plane flights for his
family to join him on the road. But the frequency of flights leaves
him feeling vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the emotion of the tragedy was overwhelming his
judgment about a career course, Griffey said, ``You weren't here
that day.''
</P>
<P>
   On his baseball options, Griffey said the 10-and-5 rights that
give him veto power over a trade is something he will not dismiss
lightly, which somewhat contrasts with the impression that the
Mariners would have a relatively easy time on that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone,'' he said, ``wants to go to a team that
would give up everything they have to get you.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has changed since the trade-request announcement
is the Alex Rodriguez situation. In a meeting with the same
Mariners execs in Las Vegas that followed the Florida discussion,
Rodriguez came out and said he did not want to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a new position _ Rodriguez and his agent, Scott
Boras, have maintained all along that they want to see Rodriguez
play with an improved Mariner team in 2000, then let the Mariners
bid for the free agent _ but in context with the Griffey trade
request, Griffey might be seen as the guy letting down Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey didn't want to talk about the Rodriguez dealings, saying
only their negotiating situations were entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the conversation, Griffey was his usual
light-hearted self. But he did seem genuinely conflicted over a
potential departure from the Mariners, and is in a position to
delay it for as long as he sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't sold my (Seattle-area) house, I haven't changed my
colors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reading between the lines, it was almost as if he hoped the
Mariners wouldn't make a tremendous deal, but instead build the
championship in Seattle that he has so long sought.
</P>
<P>
   Departer's remorse? Perhaps. Wanting to have it both ways?
Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has no one gotten rich predicting the course of one of
the century's greatest baseball players, no one has made a dime off
it.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the door remains open a crack, Griffey apparently
enjoys the freedom to go in or out.

BROKEN UP: NO EMMITT, AIKMAN LEADS TO COLLAPSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The collapsible Dallas Cowboys blew another
fourth-quarter lead and lost to the Minnesota Vikings, 27-17,
Monday night at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   What's new? Nothing when it comes to these Cowboys at the midway
point of the season. They're 4-4, and find themselves a full game
behind Washington and the New York Giants, both 5-3, in the NFC
East.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been outscored in the fourth quarters of their
losses, 50-7, including 14-0 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game was doubly costly for the Cowboys as they lost two of
their biggest playmakers, Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman, in the
second and third quarters, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will be lost ``two to three weeks,'' and Aikman possibly
could miss Sunday's game against Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately for us, they had a few guys who got injured,''
Vikings coach Dennis Green understated.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who rushed for 140 yards on 13 carries, scored two
first-half touchdowns but didn't play over the last 2 1/2 quarters
because of a broken bone in his right hand. The injury occurred
when Smith planted a stiff arm to the face mask of Vikings
defensive back Kenny Wright on the first of his two touchdown runs.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman left late in the third quarter with a ``mild concussion''
when sacked hard by Minnesota nose tackle Jerry Ball. Last week,
Aikman experienced headaches and concussion-like symptoms after
being caught by an unimpeded corner blitz at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Indianapolis game, Aikman didn't return to finish
this game against the Vikings. And with Aikman joining Smith on the
bench, a 17-10 Dallas lead quickly turned into a 27-17 Dallas
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's fracture is to the fourth metacarpal (the bone just
behind the big knuckle on his right ring finger). Smith didn't
return to the game after his second touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our concentration and our execution in the second
half,'' said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey. ``In the end, that was our
downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith _ not Randy Moss, not Deion Sanders _ was the story of the
first half as the Cowboys silenced a raucous Metrodome crowd by
making big plays. And two plays were bigger than Smith's touchdown
runs _ 18 seconds apart _ of 63 yards and 24 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But Cris Carter caught a four-yard touchdown pass and Randy Moss
pulled down a 47-yard TD pass in the final 13 1/2 minutes of the
game as the Vikings overcame the Cowboys' lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are now 1-4 on the road. The Cowboys haven't won a
road game against a non-NFC East team since a 1997 season-opening
victory at Pittsburgh. That's a string of nine consecutive losses
away from Texas Stadium to non-divisional opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have had double-digits leads in seven of their eight
games and have trailed going into the fourth quarter only once (and
actually ended up winning that game, Sept. 12 at Washington, in
overtime).
</P>
<P>
   After a not-ready-for-prime-time start (too many missed scoring
opportunities) by both teams, the Dallas defense seemed inspired by
the Cowboys finally taking a 3-0 lead early in the second quarter
with an emotional stop of the Vikings dangerously close to the
Vikings' own goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom-used Michael Myers, who went to training camp as the
front-runner to replace the suspended Leon Lett but couldn't win
the job, threw Leroy Hoard for a loss. Greg Ellis then sacked
Viking quarterback Jeff George at the Vikings 1. Minnesota punted.
</P>
<P>
   On the next Minnesota possession, Kavika Pittman sacked George,
and again the Vikings punted.
</P>
<P>
   This time, on the first play of the series, Smith ripped off a
63-yard touchdown behind right guard Everett McIver. Smith broke a
tackle, made a move, and stiff-armed the defensive back inside the
Minnesota 10. No penalty was called.
</P>
<P>
   But a bigger price had been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   After a Vikings fumble on the ensuing kickoff return _ forced by
Dat Nguyen and recovered by Charlie Williams _ the Cowboys handed
the ball again to Smith, who broken hand and all, went 24 yards on
with a cutback and some nifty moves, then carrying four Vikings
with him into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The hand was examined. Smith was done for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The game began with a triple dose of place-kicker attrition
before Richie Cunningham returned a little dignity to his
profession by finally nailing a 39-yard field goal to break a
scoreless tie with 11: 21 left in the second quarter _ or nearly 19
minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, impressive first-quarter drives by both teams
resulted in missed field-goal attempts _ two by Cunningham (42 and
37) and one by Vikings' Gary Anderson (50).
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer walk back to the sideline than the two walks
that Cunningham took early in this game. Cunningham, an 87.5
percent kicker coming the season, came up empty with his sixth and
seventh misses of his first dozen field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys were moving the ball early against this 27th
ranked NFL defense of the Vikings. Especially effective for the
Dallas offense early were runs between the tackles and passes that
features short catches and long runs.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay saved the Cowboys early. On his first pass of the
second possession, Aikman was nearly intercepted. Actually, it was
ruled on the field an interception by Vikings cornerback Jimmy
Hitchcock. Gailey challenged. And the call was overturned. nn

SONICS MISFIRE IN FOURTH, 76ERS ROLL TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ For a team that feeds off being disregarded, the
Sonics have the respect of at least one NBA officiating crew.
</P>
<P>
   They attempted 16 more free throws than the Philadelphia 76ers,
but missed nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Sonics flat out misfired throughout their 117-98
loss Monday night at First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   They lacked rebounding power. They failed to muster energy. The
Sonics forgot how to play defense, and in the fourth quarter,
became scoring impaired.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unexpected, sluggish performance in the first game of
a five-game East Coast road trip for the Sonics. The Sixers (1-3),
meanwhile, finally won after losing their first three on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was by far the worst outing we've had and that's counting
practice, the preseason, the first three games,'' said Sonics coach
Paul Westphal, whose team is 3-1. ``We just couldn't get anything
going. They outworked us and deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With a festive home opener serving as the backdrop, Philadelphia
desperately sought a win. The Sonics were hard-pressed to
understand the reason for their lackluster play, considering hustle
and resilience figured into their fast start.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that the Sonics missed 16 of 31 free throws. The
Sixers made 13 of 17 at the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the quicker, more athletic Sonics were beaten by a
faster and smaller team.
</P>
<P>
   How could a team that at one stretch played 6-foot-9 Billy Owens
at center outrebound the bigger Sonics, 56-40?
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were left dumbfounded, too.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of attacking the boards, the Sonics watched the Sixers
dominate the offensive glass. The Sonics were particularly
flat-footed in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the Sixers reversed a 79-78 deficit by outscoring
the Sonics 39-19 to end the game. Sixers star guard Allen Iverson
scored 17 of his game-high 37 points in that decisive period.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, the Sonics allowed Iverson and backcourt mate Larry
Hughes second and third attempts at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team wants it more than you do, they win in every
aspect of the game,'' said Sonics forward Horace Grant, who
collected just five rebounds. ``And rebounding was a big part of
it. It wasn't (our) overconfidence. They were very aggressive from
point A to point Z.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Westphal: ``If we did a better job on the boards, we could
have overcome these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics ran into an extremely determined Iverson. He entered
the game shooting just 19 of 57. Iverson's damage Monday night came
at the expense of Gary Payton, Vernon Maxwell and just about
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect him to break out of his shooting slump. You just
hope it wasn't against us,'' Westphal said of Iverson, who made 14
of 29 shots. ``There's not a whole lot you can do against him. He's
either going to make it or miss it and he was making it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Payton and Ruben Patterson, the Sonics
struggled offensively. Patterson continued to play above the rim
and hustle to turn loose balls into putbacks.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to keep the Sonics afloat in the first half,
which ended with the Sonics ahead, 51-48. Payton had just 11 points
at that point.
</P>
<P>
   But he scored 16 in the third. Payton missed just one of his
seven shots, which included 4 of 4 3-pointers. During one stretch,
Payton scored 10 of 12 points for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   His buzzer-beating 3-pointer put the Sonics in front by a point
heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to keep it close,'' Payton said. ``We were trying
different combinations, and somebody had to make up for the lack of
scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the Sonics' scoring punch were two heavy hitters:
Vin Baker and Vernon Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   Baker (11 points and 7 rebounds) was taken out of the flow after
he picked up his third foul with 9:44 left in the second quarter.
When Baker returned there was little he could do to slow
Philadelphia center Todd MacCulloch, whose 12 points and 10
rebounds off the bench helped ignite the Sixers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you get three fouls that are ridiculous,''
Baker said. ``It was just a bad game all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was Maxwell's worst. His shot was just plain off after
three games of being on fire from the outside. Maxwell, though,
missed 11 of 15 shots off the bench. He even hoisted a couple of
airballs from behind the three-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   It was an example of how the Sonics were mostly sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses,'' Patterson said. ``We didn't execute. We didn't
play hard and that really beat us.''

SMITH'S HAND INJURY LEADS TO BREAKDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It took only 18 seconds for Emmitt Smith to change
the outcome of Monday night's game against the Minnesota Vikings.
But when Smith charged into the end zone with his second touchdown
to give the Dallas Cowboys a 17-0 lead, the Vikings weren't the
only ones hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith came out of the game for good after that play, the result
of an injured right hand suffered on his 63-yard touchdown run in
the second quarter. But after his 24-yard scoring run with 6:11 to
go in the second quarter, Smith was examined in the locker room,
and X-rays showed a fracture that will keep the Cowboys running
back on the bench for the next two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith on the bench, and with quarterback Troy Aikman
following him there with a concussion, the Cowboys saw a 17-0 lead
turn into a 27-17 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was having his best game of the season, with 13 carries
for 140 yards. On his first touchdown, he broke linebacker Ed
McDaniel's tackle, faked out safety Orlando Thomas, then
stiff-armed rookie cornerback Kenny Wright at the end of a 63-yard
run, his longest since a 68-yard run against the Giants on Nov. 26,
1992. which Smith said he injured his hand.] Smith said he injured
his hand on the 63-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Down 10-0, the Vikings fumbled away the ensuing kickoff. And on
the next play from scrimmage, Smith burst through the left side of
the line and bowled over a few Vikings near the goal line for his
second touchdown and a 17-0 Cowboys lead.
</P>
<P>
   And then the night for Smith and the Cowboys went downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Warren came in for Smith and had 23 yards rushing on his
first three carries. The Cowboys ended the night with more than 200
yards rushing, but clearly, the Cowboys offense wasn't the same.
Things got worse in the third quarter when Aikman left the game
with a mild concussion.
</P>
<P>
   After Smith left the game, the Cowboys were outscored 27-0 in
dropping their fourth game in five contests. In each of their four
losses, they have had a lead evaporate in the second half like
boiling water. And with no Smith, or Aikman, Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey and company will be challenged to get another lead. nn

MAKEOVER DID LITTLE FOR OAK TREE

<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Racing at Oak Tree fizzled to close Monday as
the traditional fall meet posted losses in both total attendance
and total handle for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, total attendance was down 7.7 percent from last
year. Total handle was off 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The totals include figures from both the track and satellite
wagering facilities around the state and throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the hottest October on record was partly to blame
for the declining numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was certainly a factor,'' said Sherwood
Chillingworth, executive vice president of Oak Tree.
</P>
<P>
   The just-concluded meet was the first Oak Tree at Santa Anita
since the track was purchased last year by Canadian industrialist
Frank Stronach.
</P>
<P>
   As for the numbers:
</P>
<P>
   __ Total attendance in 1999 was 742,532 for the 31-day meet.
That compares to the 784,817 who visited the track during the 1998
meet.
</P>
<P>
   __ Total handle, or the amount of money wagered on Oak Tree
races, was $294,529,946 _ down from $308,909,274 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The only positive figures could be found in the on-track daily
average handle. That figure was $2,380,685, up from last year's
figure of $2,310,656. On the down side, a good portion was bet on
out-of-state races brought to the track via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a big fan of full-card simulcasting,''
Chillingworth said. ``There was as much betting on out-of-state
product as on ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing continued as Stronach introduced a new managementteam at
the track and while construction crews labored to renovate the
grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some of what you're seeing right now is the
psychological effect of the on-going construction,'' Chillingworth
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, crews completed the early phases of Santa Anita's
multi-million dollar facelift in time for opening day Sept. 29.
Chillingworth complimented the crews by staying out of the way
during Oak Tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would happen,'' Chillingworth said. ``But
they got the job done so it was operational for opening day.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the highlights on the track, the first meet saw jockey
David Flores win his first riding title with 27 wins. Trainer Bob
Baffert, with 21 wins, won his third consecutive training title.
</P>
<P>
   The meet also marked the return of jockey Patrick Valenzuela
after a two-year hiatus. Valenzuela had nine wins in 120 mounts. He
was greeted with a standing ovation when he made his way to the
track with his first mount of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   On the meet's closing day, patrons agreed they liked the big
screen; other changes seemed to be inconsequential _ at least when
it came to enjoying a day at the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a lot nicer around here,'' said Antonio
Rodriguez of Pasadena. Rodriguez, who makes three or four trips to
the track each year, said he is especially impressed by the
five-story big screen television.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best idea they have about changing Santa Anita,''
he said. ``It's even better on hot days when you can sit up in the
shade and really see it.''
</P>
<P>
   More changes are in store for the track before it re-opens in
December, officials said. The restaurant, as yet unnamed, is
scheduled to open Dec. 26.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Rudy Tomjanovich began walking, assuming the game was over. There
was nothing he could do by then anyway, so with three-tenths of a
second left he headed for the exit. How he resisted the urge to
walk much sooner was but one of the Rockets' mysteries.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets could explain losses to the Jazz and Spurs, even the
opening-night defeat to the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Orlando Magic shot horribly and still left Compaq
Center with a 102-97 win Monday, in a game fittingly clinched with
a pair of last-minute airballs, the Rockets were sent searching for
answers that could not be dismissed as the result of a rebuilt
roster.
</P>
<P>
   As if being punished for losing a ``must-win'' game, the Rockets
now face consecutive games against the Lakers, last-season's
playoff tormentors, in what has become a reminder of better times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was our game,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We found a
way to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   They had to search.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a team more rebuilt than they, and with considerably less
name-brand talent, the Rockets were beaten at home by a Magic team
ostensibly compiled as a stopgap until the franchise can clear
salary-cap space next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets blew a 13-point first-half lead and a three-point
lead in the last three minutes to the foreign legion of the NBA's
only French (Tariq Abdul-Wahad) and British (John Amaechi) players,
and one of its most passed-around journeymen, Chris Gatling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is not supposed to be winning,'' Amaechi said. ``Our
role is to be the loser, and a lot of people are confused.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is more perplexed than the Rockets, who have dropped to
the last dregs of the winless with Golden State and Detroit. And
the hope that the problems might be temporary growing pains is
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm concerned,'' Rockets forward Charles Barkley
said. ``If you're not concerned, you're a fool.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our job. We'll wake up tomorrow 0-4 and have Shaq
(O'Neal and the Lakers) coming in. That's reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The second and third losses might have come against more
talented rivals, but the latest _ creating the Rockets' longest
winless streak to begin a season since an 0-10 start in 1982 _ hurt
more. This time, the Rockets seemed to have gotten their game
together.
</P>
<P>
   They led early, clicking on offense as they had not in the first
three games. Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon and Tony Massenburg scored
consistently inside, and Cuttino Mobley, who led the Rockets with
25 points on 10-of-15 shooting, helped build the lead to the
Rockets' largest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets were outworked in the second half. Gatling
dislocated a finger, shoved it back in place and then led the
charge back into the game. He finished with 22 points and 16
rebounds in 29 minutes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Amaechi, who had to play his way onto the team in the preseason,
scored 18. The Magic grabbed 21 offensive rebounds and scored 31
points off turnovers, almost all on determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won because we outworked Houston,'' Gatling said. ``They
got tired, and we had more energy at the end, and that paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   After letting the lead slip away to a six-point deficit, the
Rockets did rally in the fourth quarter, putting together a 10-0
run in less than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Williams hit a jumper, his only field goal of the game.
Mobley made a pair of free throws and a 3-pointer. Barkley hit a
pair of free throws with Williams adding a free throw after a
technical for a 93-89 lead with 4:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as they have done repeatedly down the stretch, the Rockets
collapsed again, making just one of five shots as the Magic sped
by.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was good, it was real good,'' Massenburg said. ``When
it was bad, it was real bad. I don't know. I never expected this.
We haven't found a win yet. We have some things in place. We're
making strides in the right direction. Then it fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The game began to slip away when Shandon Anderson had a
wide-open 15-footer rattle around and come out. Darrell Armstrong,
who had made just two of his previous 10 shots, beat the Rockets
downcourt and floated a shot over Olajuwon and off the backboard
for a 95-94 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We swung the ball around to a wide-open shot and missed
that,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Then Armstrong makes the runner over
Dream. We shoot the better-percentage shot and miss, and they hit a
runner over a 7-footer.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley threw the ball away, his eighth turnover (the Rockets
committed 27), and Amaechi went right at Olajuwon, drove home his
layup and drew a foul for a three-point play and a 98-94 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rockets had a chance. Steve Francis drove the lane,
drew the defense and dished to Olajuwon for a dunk, pulling the
Rockets within two. Amaechi then lost the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley found Olajuwon, who was fouled, giving the Rockets a
pair of free throws with 16 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But after making the first, Olajuwon missed the second free
throw. Francis slipped down the lane but the ball sailed just out
of his reach. And Armstrong, who was fouled immediately, nailed two
free throws with 13 second left, reducing the Rockets' last chance
to desperate 3s by Barkley and Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   As a final slap, both were airballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was a game we should win,'' Olajuwon said. ``I've
never been 0-4. We thought tonight was a must-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a must-win game, Rockets found a way to lose.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MINNEAPOLIS _ If this were an automobile race, they'd be the Indy
499. If it were the Minute Waltz, they'd be about 55 seconds. If
the Cowboys were supposed to be a centerfold, they'd probably stop
at the staple.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman didn't finish Monday night's game
inside the echo chamber that was the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   At least both had legitimate excuses. Smith suffered a fractured
bone in his right hand, and Aikman left with a minor concussion.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the Cowboys, it was an ugly case of broken
spirit that was ringing in their ears after yet another
come-from-ahead loss to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   This time the final score was 27-17. But what's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   Glen plaid is a pattern. Paisley print is a pattern. The huge
circles that are supposedly carved into cornfields by alien
spaceships are patterns.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to the Cowboys this year is more of a bad
habit and a considerable disgrace for a team trying to pass itself
off as a real Super Bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, Giants, Colts and now the Vikings have all caught
the Cowboys and kept right on going in the second half this season,
which is beginning to make you wonder if Chan Gailey and the
coaching staff spend any time during the week informing the boys of
these things called the third and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago in Indianapolis, the Cowboys were criticized for
walking off the field at halftime content to be ahead only 17-6.
This time they took a 17-7 lead into the locker room and never
really knew what hit them after the break.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they had no reason to expect that their entire world would
be turned upside down so suddenly. After all, they thoroughly
dominated the first half and appeared to be in complete control,
though the Cowboys could have _ and should have _ held a larger
margin.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of foreboding when the first two Dallas drives
of the night took the Cowboys deep into Minnesota territory but
ended with Richie Cunningham pushing field-goal tries wide to the
left.
</P>
<P>
   Those were opportunities lost, but the way the Cowboys were
controlling the line of scrimmage and pushing the Vikings around,
they likely did not sense the urgency in either situation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who had been bottled up in the running game for the
previous four games _ carrying the ball 88 times and getting
stopped for no gain or a loss on 21 of those rushes _ was finally
having a breakout effort.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sliced through the holes that his large offensive line
opened up in the Minnesota defense. He juked pursuers and broke
tackles to run into the secondary again and again.
</P>
<P>
   This was the old Emmitt come to call on the Vikings. The
unstoppable Emmitt, the untiring Emmitt. And after Cunningham
finally nailed a 39-yard field goal (proving he hadn't forgotten
entirely how to kick) for a 3-0 lead, it became Smith's show.
</P>
<P>
   On first-and-10 from the Dallas 37, Smith took a handoff from
Aikman and darted through an opening on the right side. He faked
Vikings safety Orlando Thomas practically out of his shoes and
raced 63 yards for a touchdown, going the last 15 yards while
pulling Minnesota cornerback Kenny Wright by the facemask.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 18 seconds later, after David Palmer fumbled the kickoff
and Dallas recovered, Smith took the ball from Aikman again,
started right and cut back left, again freezing Thomas in his
tracks and this time going 24 yards for a TD.
</P>
<P>
   It almost looked unfair for the Vikings to have to stop him. But
it turned out Smith suffered his fractured hand on the stiff-arm
against Wright on the first TD run, and his night would be over
with 13 carries for 140 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman lost a fumble that gave the Vikings a chance to stay in
the game with a score before halftime, but this was still a game
the Cowboys had in a headlock.
</P>
<P>
   Until Aikman took one too many blows to the head under pressure
from the Minnesota defense and left late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the ground was shifting and collapsing under the
Cowboys as if they'd been caught in an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota quarterback Jeff George was able to find Cris Carter
on slant patterns deep and over the middle, and the Cowboys tucked
their tails between their legs and hid.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings came on as suddenly and dangerously as a twister.
They moved for two field goals, then drove 61 yards for a TD that
came when Carter caught another slant from George.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had cratered. Jason Garrett replaced Aikman and went
0-for-7 passing. The offense was dead, and the defense was gasping.
</P>
<P>
   When Randy Moss caught a deep ball from George for a 47-yard TD,
the game was officially out of the Cowboys' reach. But it had, for
all intents and purposes, been over for a while. Since halftime.
Again.
</P>
<P>
   Which, with Dallas 4-4, is not a pattern any longer but a big,
big problem.

VIKINGS' OFFENSE WORE DOWN COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The plight of the Dallas Cowboys' defense in
Monday night's 27-17 loss to Minnesota Vikings was not unlike a
person trying to hold off a flood with their finger in the dike.
</P>
<P>
   You can do it for a little while but there was a point when the
waters were going to rush in.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the first half, the Cowboys held back the explosive
Vikings offense. Vikings quarterback Jeff George didn't complete
his first pass until the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But common sense said that was it more anomaly than skill _
considering the extensive big-play arsenal of the Vikings. With
receivers Randy Moss, Jake Reed and Cris Carter at his disposal,
there was no doubt the Vikings could score in hurry and would
eventually score to get back in the game after spotting the Cowboys
a 17-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The hope for the Cowboys was that the offense would continue to
take care of its business and make it impossible for the Vikings to
rally.
</P>
<P>
   However, all the offensive promise the Cowboys showed in the
first half was dashed in the second quarter when running back
Emmitt Smith left the game with a fractured right hand. This was
after he had rushed 13 times for 140 yards, including touchdown
jaunts of 63 and 24 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was running well and a strong running game would be the
key to keeping the Vikings off the field and limiting their
comeback chances. With Smith gone, the Cowboys' ability to run left
as well. It didn't help that quarterback Troy Aikman left the game
in the third quarter with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, the Cowboys' defense was left helpless against the
rushing wave of offense by the Vikings. Consider that the Cowboys
gained only 2 yards on six plays during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the Cowboys' defense was on the field longer. It also
meant that the Vikings had more chances to strike. The Vikings
scored on four of their first five drives of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' use of alternating secondary coverages on Vikings
receivers seemingly worked in the first half. Cornerback Deion
Sanders alternated between locking in single coverage against Moss,
Reed and Carter. When Sanders was locked on Carter or Moss, the
Cowboys double covered the other player.
</P>
<P>
   More important was that the Cowboys got a good pass rush on
George. Defensive end Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman led the way as
the Cowboys sacked George three times in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys didn't get to George as much in the second half. Not
coincidentally, Moss and Carter got loose in the secondary. Moss
caught two touchdown passes, including a 47-yarder in the fourth
quarter against reserve cornerback Charlie Williams, who was
playing in place of an injured Kevin Smith. Moss finished with six
catches for 91 yards. Carter did the most damage, catching nine
passes for 116 yards and a touchdown.
MARQUEE MATCHUP FIZZLES Action: Monday night's showdown between
Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders, the league's best coverman, and
Vikings receiver Randy Moss, the league's most explosive pass
catcher, came down to two pass plays and two penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: We've been waiting a year for that?
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that nothing rarely lives up to expectations,
especially an over-hyped one-on-one battle in a team sport played
by 22 men at a time.
</P>
<P>
   That the Cowboys' defense called for several different
coverages, meaning that Sanders was not locked on Moss the entire
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys threw a lot of double coverages at Moss when Sanders
wasn't on him, as they hoped to stop Moss from duplicating the
three-catch, three-touchdown performance he had against the Cowboys
last year when Sanders was sidelined with a toe injury.
</P>
<P>
   Moss still got his touchdowns _ though not against Sanders. Moss
scored on a 4-yard touchdown pass against double coverage from
Kevin Mathis and George Teague. Moss burned reserve cornerback
CharlieWilliams, who was in for an injured Kevin Smith, for a
47-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders locked up Moss 15 times in the game. However, the
Vikings threw the ball in his direction only twice when Sanders was
on him. The first was a deep pass in the second quarter on
third-and-25 from the Minnesota 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders jumped high to break up the pass.
</P>
<P>
   The other one came on a hitch route in the third quarter when
Moss ran by Sanders for an 8-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders got the worst of two penalties called during their
confrontation. Moss was flagged for a false start in the first half
with Sanders locked up on him. Sanders, however, was whistled for
illegal contact after bumping Moss in the third quarter. The play
was crucial because it nullified a pass interception by Cowboys
safety George Teague. The Vikings turned the non-turnover into the
go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The game also featured Moss doing ``a Deion'' of sorts by being
the Vikings' punt returner in place of the injured David Palmer.
Moss had returned only one punt in the previous eight games before
doing it against the Cowboys.
INSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM
</P>
<P>
   _Newly signed safety Chris Akins, who was brought in to help the
special teams, was deactivated before the game Monday night because
the Cowboys activated defensive lineman Peppi Zellner. Zellner
hasn't been active three of the past four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys decided that getting pressure on Vikings quarterback
Jeff George was more important Monday night. And considering that
they have had a tough time rushing the passer the past few weeks,
it wouldn't hurt to have more pass rushers available.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that neither Zellner nor rookie top pick
Ebenezer Ekuban has so far lived up to the sensation they created
in training camp. Veteran ends Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman picked
up the slack Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Receiver Jeff Ogden was the Cowboys' primary punt returner for
much of the game Monday night instead of Deion Sanders, who was
nursing a hamstring injury. Because covering the explosive Vikings
receivers was paramount, Sanders rode a bike on the sideline when
he wasn't on defense to keep his hamstring loose, and didn't return
punts. Of course, the philosophy was altered late in the first
half. With the Vikings forced to punt from near their goal line,
Sanders, sensing a chance for a big play, inserted himself in place
of Ogden. It was to no avail. Vikings punter Mitch Berger got a
59-yard effort, which Sanders returned 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Much has been said about the right side of the Cowboys'
offensive line, specifically tackle Erik Williams and guard Everett
McIver. Some people have suggested that the Cowboys should run left
behind guard Larry Allen and tackle Flozell Adams for their
important yards. Well, the right side didn't look too bad on Emmitt
Smith's 63-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ What looked to be the beginning of a big game by running back
Emmitt Smith and the saving grace for the Cowboys' offense turned
into the Cowboys' worst nightmare Monday night at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Smith scored two touchdowns in 18 seconds in the second quarter.
The first was a 63-yard jaunt. The second was a 24-yard scamper,
which gave the Cowboys a 17-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith, who had 13 carries for 140 yards, fractured his
right hand on the 63-yard run and didn't return to the game. The
Cowboys' offense was not the same.: It gained only 2 yards on six
plays in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UP NEXT VS. GREEN BAY Sunday, 3:15 p.m. The Cowboys renew their
rivalry with the Green Bay Packers on Sunday at Texas Stadium.
Though they lost their last meeting against the Packers, 45-17 at
Lambeau Field in 1997, the Cowboys have won eight of the past nine
against Green Bay, including seven consecutive at Texas Stadium.

VIKINGS BEAT COWBOYS, 27-17

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It took less than a minute for Emmitt Smith to
show a national television audience that he is not ready to ease
into retirement. Two dazzling touchdown runs, back to back, gave
the Dallas Cowboys a seemingly sturdy 17-0 second-quarter lead over
Minnesota. Then, a tiny bone in the running back's hand did
something that the Vikings' defense could not: stop Smith.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Smith left the game late in the first half with
a broken right hand, the one he uses to grasp the football, that
the Vikings started a comeback. As Dallas tried to hold its lead,
it lost another star, quarterback Troy Aikman, to a concussion.
Without Smith and Aikman, the Dallas offense ground to a halt and
the Vikings stormed back with a 27-17 victory before 64,111 at the
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will most likely lose Smith for an extended period,
and Aikman probably for at least one week. Minnesota raised its
record to 5-4. Dallas dropped to 4-4, one game behind the Giants
and the Redskins, who are tied for the National Football Conference
East lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had the two most exciting plays of an otherwise deadly
dull and poorly played first half. His first gallop went for 63
yards after Minnesota linebacker Ed McDaniel missed a tackle at the
line of scrimmage. Smith, showing speed few thought he still had,
darted between defensive backs Orlando Thomas and Robert Griffith.
That gave Dallas a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the following kickoff, the ever-present Dat Nguyen stripped
the Minnesota return man David Palmer. The ball was recovered at
the Vikings' 24-yard line. Smith again went up the middle on the
following play, once more showing good speed. This time he was
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings looked out of it, until a Randy Moss touchdown catch
and two Gary Anderson field goals of 31 and 40 yards made the score
17-13 early in the fourth quarter. Then Minnesota unleashed Cris
Carter, who has been unstoppable this season, to finish a
nine-play, 61-yard drive. Carter caught a 4-yard pass in the end
zone and, unbelievably, as bad as Minnesota played for most of the
contest, the team had a 20-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith out and Aikman throwing just one pass in the third
quarter, Dallas had only 2 yards of offense that period, to
Minnesota's 152. Smith left the game with 140 yards on 13 carries
and 2 touchdowns. Jason Garrett, the backup for Aikman, produced no
points.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota went ahead for good with a long Jeff George pass to
Moss for a 47-yard touchdown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most eagerly awaited part of this game was not the running
of Smith but the potential matchup between Moss and Deion Sanders _
the young pass catcher against the likely Hall of Fame cornerback.
On paper, it is intriguing. No defensive coordinator in football
thinks Moss can be covered one on one, and under normal
circumstances, Sanders is rarely beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather the old Sanders. The current version is showing wear.
Sanders is still hurting from a hamstring injury, and this
off-season he had toe surgery. Last week against Indianapolis, the
Colts challenged Sanders with their young receivers, and coming
into this game, the Vikings' plan was to do the same. In past
years, attacking Sanders was suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders began guarding Jake Reed, while Moss lined up on the
opposite side of the field. Later, Sanders and Moss spent more time
tangled up while Moss attempted to block Sanders on running plays.
Minnesota threw sparingly because backs Leroy Hoard and Moe
Williams blew away Dallas on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sanders and Moss did face each other on a pass play. Moss
sprinted deep and beat Sanders to the end zone by a foot or so, but
George was forced to scramble and never had time to set and throw.
A similar situation happened later in the game when Moss ran a
double move on Sanders but George looked the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The intrigue of the matchup was sexier than what actually
happened on the field, and that was fine with Dallas. If Moss was
catching a lot of passes, that meant the Cowboys were in a
shootout, something the team dreaded. So Dallas slowed the game
down, handing off often to Smith. The strategy worked as Dallas was
able to penetrate deep into Minnesota territory twice in the first
quarter, only to watch kicker Richie Cunningham miss two field
goals from 42 and 37 yards. In the second quarter, Cunningham
almost missed his third attempt, barely connecting from 39 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Smith's two dazzling runs, the highlight of what was
largely an ugly game. This was probably the worst Minnesota has
played all season. In the first half, the Vikings had 9 penalties
for 67 yards. They were lucky to trail by only 17-7 at halftime as
Moss's 4-yard touchdown reception with less than two minutes left
in the first half kept Minnesota in the game.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Moss's catch was against George Teague, not
Sanders. &QL;

   GERMANY-WALL (Berlin) _ Virtally nobody predicted the fall of
the Berlin Wall _ and apparently nobody planned it. As a result,
two German states with divergent ideologies and cultures found
themselves propelled toward union on the panicky reaction of a
border guard who opened the gate at Berlin's Bornholmerstrasse
crossing without an explicit order to do so. Some of the effects of
that precipitation are still evident today. Most fundamentally, a
united Germany is not quite sure of its identity. By Roger Cohen.

loping through the mountains, stopping only to praise Allah or to

   BUSH-ENVIRON (Austin, Texas) _ Early this summer, with political
pressure mounting on him to address his state's abysmal air
pollution problems, Gov. George W. Bush signed a law he regards as
the gold star of his green resume: a program targeting outdated
industrial plants that are among the heaviest polluters in Texas.
For Bush, the program meant confronting the state's oil, gas and
chemical industries that are among his most generous campaign
contributors. Bush now boasts that he is the first Texas governor
``to ever have brought industry together and said, `Get into
compliance.''' But what he actually did was a little different. By

   WEB-ENTERTAINMENT (Los Angeles) _ Until now, Hollywood has used

television shows or by creating programs specifically for online

   MICROSOFT-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Break-up of Microsoft Corp.
appeared somewhat more plausible Monday, following the release

   SCI-EARLIEST-AMERICANS (Santa Fe, N.M.) _ A growing body of
intriguing evidence is telling a much new story of the peopling of
the Americas. From Alaska to Brazil and southern Chile, artifacts
and skeletons are forcing archaeologists to abandon Bering Straits
migration theory and come to terms with a more complex picture of
earliest American settlement. People may have arrived thousands to
tens of thousands of years sooner, in many waves of migration and
by a number of routes. Their ancestry may not have been only Asian.
Some of the migrations may have originated in Australia or Europe.

DODGERS FINALLY MAKE GOOD MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the first major move consummated during the new
regime of Robert Daly is any indication, the Los Angeles Dodgers,
finally, are moving in a positive direction after two years of
spinning haplessly out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring the formidable outfielder, Shawn Green, Monday from
the Toronto Blue Jays might not guarantee the Dodgers an appearance
in the 2000 World Series, but it certainly figures to make them a
more formidable presence next season.
</P>
<P>
   And, for sure, it heralds an end to an ignoble string of
misguided decisions perpetrated by the Dodger organization under
the aegis of Fox, from unceremoniously dumping the best hitter in
the team's history in Mike Piazza, to trading for a catcher who
couldn't catch in Todd Hundley, to giving a multi-year,
multi-million dollar contract to a left handed pitcher who couldn't
pitch in Carlos Perez, to hiring a well-traveled manager who's in
an on-the-job-retirement mode in Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah!
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers actually did something right!
</P>
<P>
   You knew it had to happen one of these decades---err---years.
</P>
<P>
   In Shawn Green, they got themselves a 27-year-old Southern
Californian---he is a graduate of Tustin High---who is in his prime
and who gives the Dodgers a desperately-needed left handed hitter
in a lineup that long has been dominated by people who bat from the
right side.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Green didn't come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had to part with their talented but troubled right
fielder, Raul Mondesi, and a couple of nonentities named Pedro
Borbon and Jorge Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   They also had to give Green a six-year contract worth $84
million, not exactly chump change for a team that put itself on the
hook for $105 million across seven years to Kevin Brown during the
last off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers now employ the two highest paid players in baseball
in Brown, whose average annual income is $15 million and Green,
whose financial bonanza tabulates to $14 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else under Fox and now Daly, the Dodgers have shown a
willingness to spend vast amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   But, until Daly brought Green to gaffe, the team has spent it
foolishly with one lousy move after another.
</P>
<P>
   But they now have in Shawn Green a special performer who can
hit, run, field and throw and whose best seasons appear to be in
front of him. He is coming off a breakout season in which he batted
.309, hit 42 home runs and drove in 123 runs.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-4, 210-pound Green reminds some people of the Colorado
Rockies' extraordinary batsman, Larry Walker. If he performs
anywhere near the lofty level of Walker in Los Angeles, the Dodgers
got themselves a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dodgers themselves well know, it isn't easy to find left
handed sluggers, especially left handed sluggers who are at the
peak of their powers without a history of injuries and personal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   They paid a steep price for Green, but it's not as though
Mondesi was earning modest wages in Los Angeles. He was guaranteed
of making $9.5 million and $11 million his next two seasons with
the Dodgers, and the Blue Jays exercised the option on Mondesi's
contract for two more years at a cool $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers felt they had to move the right handed hitting
Mondesi ever since he erupted in an obcenity-laced tirade against
Davey Johnson and general manager Kevin Malone last August 11,
demanding to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi got his wish Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And Jeff Moorad, the Newport Beach-based agent, did a masterful
job for his client, getting Green top market money because he
realized the Dodgers needed an established player with glittering
statistics who could silence the Dodger fans' grousing about the
departure of Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative for the Dodgers is that they now have
officially eliminated themselves from the Ken Griffey Jr.-Alex
Rodriguez sweepstakes that figure to turn into a sweltering bidding
contest among the two New York teams and the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way the Dodgers, now so heavily committed to Brown
and Green, would shower up to perhaps $200 million on a Griffey or
Rodriguez, unless the team doesn't care at all about its financial
stability.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers still need help in center field, second base and
behind home plate, but they've alleviated one serious shortcoming
with the acquisition of Green.
</P>
<P>
   He is quite capable of providing the Dodgers with home runs and
game-winning RBI against those tough right handed pitchers who have
given the team so much trouble in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He's being well-indemnified, with a $4 million signing bonus and
with salaries that grow in sizable increments with each passing
season---$8.75 million next year, $11. 4 million the year after and
then $12.75 million, $15 million and $16 million for each of the
final two years.
</P>
<P>
   It's another staggering investment for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But, at least at this early date, it appears to be a wise one by
a man, Robert Daly, who's off to a bright beginning at his new
station in Chavez Ravine.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ The only thing that differed from the Eagles, Giants
and Colts games was that the Cowboys lost to Minnesota not in the
fourth quarter but in the third.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technically, the Cowboys still had a four-point lifeline as the
third-quarter clock ticked down. But after only six plays in the
third, it had gone from a rope to a fraying thread. And it took
only three plays in the fourth period before it snapped as the
Vikings overcame a 17-point deficit for a 27-17 victory before a
crowd of 64,111 at the Metrodome and a Monday Night Football
television audience.
</P>
<P>
   A cannon sounded as the go-ahead pass left Jeff George's hands,
the ball still in the air on its way to Cris Carter from four yards
out. Perhaps whoever was responsible had watched some of the
Cowboys' recent collapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a game of pivotal plays,'' Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey said. ``We lost concentration and execution in the
second half offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   This week there were reasons, or at least excuses. The Cowboys
(4-4) lost running back Emmitt Smith in the second quarter to a
broken fourth metacarpal in his right hand, but not before he had
rushed for back-to-back touchdowns in an 18-second span.
</P>
<P>
   They lost quarterback Troy Aikman in the third period. Aikman
was the victim of a minor concussion just a week after a blow to
the head left him dazed and plagued by headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who next host the Packers, could be without Aikman
on Sunday. Smith, who will undergo surgery today to have a pin
inserted, will miss two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a short week, so that's not good for us,'' said
Gailey, whose team has lost four of its last five games and is 1-4
on the road this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle of Randy Moss and the big-play Vikings vs. Deion
Sanders and the Cowboys, the winner became painfully obvious. The
second-year receiver scored two of Minnesota's three touchdowns, a
four-yarder in the second quarter to narrow the gap to 17-7, then a
47-yard bomb with 5:10 to play to ice the victory. It was his
second multiple-touchdown game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We busted some coverages when he made some plays,'' Gailey
said. ``But you've got to give him credit. He caught a couple of
high balls and made the catches. That's something he can do, and he
did it well, and we let him get that long one at the end. That was
really disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas defense was spectacular _ for one half. George,
credited with turning around a floundering team in recent weeks,
didn't complete a pass for the Vikings (5-4) until only 1:53
remained in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   After one quarter, Aikman had thrown for 77 yards; George still
had zero. The Cowboys had racked up 129 yards of total offense; the
Vikings had managed only 48.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Aikman had thrown for 124 yards; George had 13. The
Cowboys had 287 yards of total offense; the Vikings had 63.
</P>
<P>
   Yet thanks to two missed field goals and a sputtering red-zone
offense, the Cowboys had managed only 17 points in the first half.
Both touchdowns were courtesy of Smith, who carried 13 times for
140 yards and two touchdowns in less than one half of action.
</P>
<P>
   Both touchdowns were one-play possessions. Smith went off right
guard to sprint 63 yards for his first score. He was caught at the
Minnesota 15 but dragged cornerback Kenny Wright into the end zone
for a 10-0 Cowboys lead with 6:21 to go in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dat Nguyen then forced a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and
Charlie Williams recovered for the Cowboys at the Vikings' 24.
Smith, still winded from his first run, then darted up the middle
for another touchdown and a 17-0 lead with 6:03 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   In a night of milestones for Smith, the 63-yarder was the
third-longest run of his career, surpassed only by a 75-yard TD run
against Washington in 1991 and a 68-yard scoring run against the
Giants in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On his first touchdown run, Smith passed Eric Dickerson for
third place on the NFL's career rushing list. Trailing only Walter
Payton and Barry Sanders, Smith has 13,314 career rushing yards.
Dickerson had 13,259.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also tied Marcus Allen for second on the all-time
touchdown list with 145. Only Jerry Rice, with 177, has more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was magical,'' Smith said. ``It was a great night. I
thought something good was going to come out of tonight, and we
were on our way. I felt like it was just going to be a great night.
It started out a great night. It just didn't end up a great
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith left the game after that second score. But he actually
suffered the broken bone while stiff-arming Wright on the first
touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith gone, the Cowboys could do no more, finishing the
game only 1-for-13 in third-down conversions. The Vikings, on the
other hand, put together three consecutive scoring possessions in
the third quarter and first few moments of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense held them to field goals on the first two
after drives of 57 and 48 yards. George connected with Carter on
passes of 39, 23 and 17 yards to spark those possessions. Moss
grabbed a 21-yarder en route to Carter's go-ahead touchdown.

CLIPPES GO COLD, MALONE GETS HOT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the NBA still refuses to grade on the curve,
the Los Angeles Clippers seem in no hurry to turn in an `A' game.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's incomplete assignment became a 94-79 victory by the
Utah Jazz, who old-schooled the home team in front of 9,686 at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Clips power forward Maurice Taylor handled the defeat with a
lesson in advanced spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all right,'' he said. ``You gotta look at our schedule;
we're playing some of the best teams in the league. The way we've
been playing will probably be good enough to beat a lot of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But?
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   After convincing losses to Seattle and Portland, followed by a
29-turnover mess in last Friday's victory over Philadelphia, the
Clippers again struggled with new math. Their offense continued
looking sloppier and more disoriented than a frat house on Sunday
morning. The field-goal percentage was a frightening 34 percent.
But they came by these struggles honestly, managing just 11
assists; the Jazz had 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sign of a young team,'' Taylor noted.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, it should be noted, hasn't exactly been mesmerizing the
opposition. A loss to the Clips (1-3) would have given the Jazz
(2-2) their first 1-3 start since waaaay back ... in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That season ended with Michael Jordan's last NBA Finals ride at
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, whose starting lineup had stockpiled a collective
six NBA seasons, anticipated using their youthful energy to exploit
Utah's high mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Including rookie forward Scott Padgett, the Jazz's starting
lineup has 54 seasons of NBA service. With so many NBA-wise guys,
their polished interpretation of help defense goosed the Clippers
into an evening of rim shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't contest their shots a lot,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan
said, ``they just missed them.''
</P>
<P>
   And missing from the starring role was rookie Lamar Odom, who
looks like the most dangerous weapon we've seen since Visa gold.
Against Utah, he looked desperate to take his first pro mulligan.
Odom was 2 of 10 from the field for 10 points, 13 below his
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a good player,'' Utah forward Bryon Russell
(13 points off the bench) said, ``but I think they give him a
little too much leeway.''
</P>
<P>
   Clippers coach Chris Ford, who's attempting to ease Odom into
the NBA through a minefield of hype, took a more pragmatic
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a learning experience every night for Lamar,'' Ford
said. ``He'll respond in a positive manner versus San Antonio
(Wednesday). Let's give him the chance to grow as a basketball
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, still attempting to make an opening argument in his
contract-extension trial, led the Clippers with 23 points, but was
only 8 of 20 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone (24 points) and Jeff Hornacek (16) did the damage
for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   With Hornacek scoring a dozen points, Utah led 25-16 after the
first quarter. The Jazz lifted it to 45-35 at intermission, and
70-54 after three periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers never really surrendered; they just seemed a bit
unfamiliar with the lesson plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time, they (Jazz) will be playing a better team,'' said
Taylor, referring to his own side. ``I guarantee we'll beat Utah at
least once. We play 'em three more times.''
</P>
<P>
   It is good to hear that Taylor can do the math.
</P>
<P>
   CLIPPERS NOTE: Eric Piatkowski (bruised ribs) and Eric Murdock
(knee) did not suit up for the Clippers. Piatkowski now has missed
the last three games.

 A COUPLE BELEAGUERED MINORITIES  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's no fun to be Mr. Politically Correct, but
somebody in this town has to go to bat for drunken sailors and
kooks ...
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Al Gore, who has apparently retired from
his VP duties at full pay to pursue his hobby of running for
president, hired feminist author Naomi Wolf to teach him how to
relate to people other than foreign campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans see the hiring of Wolf as an indication of how
bad a president Gore would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seeks out kooks and he spends money like a drunken sailor
in port,'' said a Republican National Committee blatherperson.
</P>
<P>
   Like those are bad things.
</P>
<P>
   Drunken sailors have been a bedrock of the Bay Area economy
since Gold Rush days, although we encourage them not to combine
their drinking and sailing, especially if they sail submarines and
oil tankers.
</P>
<P>
   The generosity and conviviality of drunken sailors in local
ports help fund our civic projects and define this region's
spirited approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   As for kooks, without 'em we wouldn't have any politics or
landmarks. No Willie vs. Tom or Terence vs. Bill, no cable cars or
Coit Tower or California cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   We have debunked the old saying that too many kooks spoil the
broth.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT, ANOTHER cop-grip-soul-Chinese restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of North Beach, next to the police station, is a
new eating establishment called Co. A, which is cop-talk for
Central Station. It's run by Carl Payne, a cop who in his former
life was a cable car gripman and bell-ringing champ.
</P>
<P>
   The joint serves soul food and the menu is also in Chinese.
What, no smorgasbord?
</P>
<P>
   And: Soon to open, also in North Beach, the joint venture of
Warriors' coach P.J. Carlesimo and local restaurant guy Bobby
Mulhearn. The two are former college buddies, and the place will be
called _ trumpet fanfare, please _ P.J. Mulhearn's.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly from North Beach: Fuzio's, a dreaded chain restaurant,
bit the dust after a very short run and will be reincarnated as a
real Italian restaurant headed by Mark Valiani, formerly the chef
at Moose's.
</P>
<P>
   OK, ONE MORE restaurant item: Caffe 817 in Oakland turned into
the Buena Vista Social Club on Saturday. Ry Cooder, Ibrahim Ferrer
and vocalist Portundo, in the Bay Area for a successful BVSC gig,
spent the day doing a TV interview at the Caffe.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Sandro Rossi regularly pipes in for his patrons the music
he grew up with in Florence, Italy _ Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, it's another Cubano-Italiano joint.
</P>
<P>
   A DAY WITHOUT GOSSIP is a day without any news at all, at least
in this column.
</P>
<P>
   So here's today's tidbit: Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf,
sweethearts for a few months now, are expecting a baby.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you love to get a heads-up on the IPO on that kid's
tennis-future stock?
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS GUYS say funny things. After a team doctor
anti-pain-injected the sore ribs of a 49ers player and apparently
punctured the poor guy's lung, team general manager Bill Walsh
said, ``We were certainly well-intentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Bishop wonders if Walsh's comment wasn't an attempt to
``dispel the suspicion that management tried to get under the
salary cap by killing the tight end.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm just glad that doctor isn't working on Steve Young's sore
head.
</P>
<P>
   WALLFLOWER WILLIE: Hillary Clinton was in town Saturday for
(what else?) a fund-raiser at the Fairmont, where about 1,000 good
Dems each paid $125 for a cuppa tea and $125 for a crumpet.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Pelosi was emcee of the event, and she announced that she
was sorry the mayor couldn't be on hand, he was out campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But wait! Wasn't that Da Mayor who came into the ballroom just
before the start of the event, stood against the back wall, then
ducked out through the kitchen door? Mr. Low Profile.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Willie Brown who used to get invited for White
House sleepovers. Did Willie's less-than-overwhelming showing at
the polls render him persona not-a-lotta grata as a Clinton
political ally?
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Willie was wearing a bomber jacket. Is he trying
to show simpatico with the leather crowd, or is he hoping to court
the hip young conservative vote by coming out of the closet as a
Banana Republican?
</P>
<P>
   And Judi Bosolo, one of the tea-and-crumpetees, wonders what
Hillary will do with the quarter-mil she Brinks-trucked out of the
Fairmont if she decides not to run.
</P>
<P>
   She'd better come back to S.F. and spend that money like a
drunken sailor.

REMOVAL OF 5 DAMS HAILED AS OPENING NEW ERA IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Government officials, conservation groups and
private landowners announced an ambitious plan to revive
California's beleaguered salmon fisheries Monday, claiming it
points to a new era of environmental restoration.
<P>
   Under the pact, five Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
power-generating dams will be removed on Battle Creek, a tributary
of the Sacramento River east of Red Bluff that supports endangered
salmon and steelhead trout.
</P>
<P>
   Three other dams will be retrofitted with fish ladders, and the
volume of downriver flows will be increased tenfold. The project
will open up 42 miles of new salmon spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a pristine watercourse fed year-round by cold,
subterranean springs, Battle Creek is one of the finest salmon
streams in California.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is considered a centerpiece project for CalFed, a
federal and state venture designed to guarantee stable water
supplies for farms and cities while improving water quality and
wildlife habitat in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, their
delta and San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the dams is expected to begin next year, and
should be completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday on the Delta King, a restored river
boat docked on the Sacramento River, U.S. Secretary of the Interior
Bruce Babbitt hailed the accord as a template for cooperative
environmental efforts that can join government with the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salmon that is driving this happy event is leading us to a
new era in our relationship with the environment,'' Babbitt said.
``The salmon has no fixed address. (It) teaches us we must see the
entire landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the salmon's uncanny ability to sense its arrival
at its natal stream after several years in the ocean, Babbitt
added: ``Its instincts are so finely honed it can taste one drop of
vermouth in 500,000 barrels of gin. That's a fish worth listening
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's ebullience was echoed by representatives of the David
and Lucile Packard Foundation, which donated $3 million to
implement the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in projects that involve the private sector,
projects that sustain a vision of a restored California,'' said
Jeanne Sedgwick, director of conservation programs for the Los
Altos-based foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Oscamou, a spokesman for PG&AMP;E, said the removal of the dams
will cut electricity generation on Battle Creek by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creek currently supplies enough power to supply about
40,000 homes, so that's not insignificant,'' said Oscamou. ``But
this plan allows us to both restore fish and maintain a reasonable
level of power production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been tough to resolve this if we had gotten into
an adversarial relationship (with environmental groups and
government agencies),'' he said. ``A joint partnership is much more
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   But some concerns about the project were also aired.
</P>
<P>
   Battle Creek already supports the largest salmon hatchery in the
state, a facility run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. About
80,000 mature fall-run chinook salmon now return annually to the
creek's narrow gorge, a number some scientists feel is too high for
the good of other salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kier, a Sausalito fisheries consultant who didn't attend
Monday's event, said the sheer mass of fall-run salmon on Battle
Creek could impede the migration of endangered winter-run and
threaten spring-run chinook salmon, which spawn higher up the
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists from the University of California have also expressed
concerns about the genetics of the Coleman hatchery fish, noting
that some may be inbred and that undesirable cross-breeding has
probably occurred between fish from different runs.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he has very real concerns about the Coleman
hatchery and its impact on wild fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time for a comprehensive and fundamental look at
the hatchery,'' he said. ``For a long time, fish hatcheries have
been viewed as parts of mitigation packages, as equivalents to
livestock feed yards. That's not how we want to do it here. We want
to do this right, and the time to do it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hamelberg, who supervises north state fish projects for
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said agency biologists are
addressing Coleman's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fish and Wildlife moved winter-run chinook hatching
operations from Coleman to a facility near Shasta Dam to prevent
hybridization with fall-run fish, Hamelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Local landowners have also expressed apprehension about the
Battle Creek project _ but at Monday's announcement, they appeared
to give it a qualified endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out scared,'' said Bob Lee, secretary of the Battle
Creek Watershed Conservancy, an organization representing people
living in the creek's watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were worried that the agencies would come in here and smash
the local economy,'' Lee said. ``Anyone who ranches or works in
timber or agriculture has trouble with endangered species in their
backyard. But people have gradually calmed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Lee, the supervising agencies ``have to make sure
they address the surrounding lands, not just dams and water flows.
The riparian areas and watershed have to be protected as a whole,
and the ranches are the biggest key.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranchers have been taking care of this land for 100 years,
and they've done a pretty good job of caring for the creek,'' he
said. ``We have to make sure they have a future.''

PRESIDENT HOLDS `WIRED- 
 SIDE' CHAT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  In what could be called the nation's first ``wired-side chat,''
President Clinton held a town hall meeting Monday on the Internet,
saying that the new technology which put him in reach of millions
by computer keyboard would make future presidents ``more
accountable to the American people.''
<P>
   Just as in a traditional town hall forum, the cyber-audience who
signed onto the president's 100-minute Internet session _ many
using e-monikers like ``Ohio Willy'' and ``Tlove 939'' _ had the
opportunity to ask questions on issues like education and health
care. But they also pressed him on whether he really wanted to run
for a third term, his plans after the 2000 elections and if, as an
average American, he would save up food for the Y2K changeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like FDR's fireside chats and President Kennedy's live press
conferences, this first presidential town hall meeting on the
Internet taps the most modern technology for old-fashioned
communication between the American people and their president,''
Clinton said during the online exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, broadcasting live from George Washington University in
the nation's capital, was seen by the international computer-savvy
audience via a small, somewhat choppy video image on most computer
screens. Instead of a roaring fire, the president and Democratic
Leadership Council head Al From were seated onstage in front of a
couple of flat-screen monitors, watching images of political
leaders around the country _ including San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   The event, sponsored by the Democratic Leadership Council and
Redwood City, Calif.-based ExciteAtHome, was expected to include as
many as 50,000 computer users. But unlike the online chats commonly
scheduled for subscribers on services like America Online,
Clinton's chat was available to anyone via Excite.com _ and the
president's image and answers were ``Webcast,'' so viewers both saw
and heard him on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Questions from computer users were screened, and Clinton did not
have to field tough queries about Monica Lewinsky. Still, one
online questioner named Mick lauded Clinton on the innovative
approach, saying that the forum was ``truly a shining example of
freedom,'' because it made the president more accessible to
Americans. Clinton said he enjoyed the questions so much that he
stayed 20 minutes past the time originally allowed for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the electronic town hall, the president showed his
own tech savvy, noting that under his administration, the Internet
has boomed as a force in the nation's economy and politics. He
noted that since 1993, the number of computers connected to the
Internet has exploded from 1.3 million to 56 million, and the
number of Web sites, once at 130, has grown to 3.6 million and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   But at one point, Clinton was asked by one computer user how
``non-techies'' would be accommodated with the growing digital
divide between computers users and nonusers.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he has been encouraged in his visits to
Silicon Valley to see how jobs in the ``new economy'' have grown to
provide employment for those who might not have been
computer-literate in the past.
</P>
<P>
   He said on his most recent trip, ``I learned that, in addition
to the employees of eBay,'' the online auction house, ``some 20,000
people now make a living on eBay (by trading),'' he said. ``That's
the way they make a living ... and a lot of them used to be on
welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued he has ``worked hard to unleash the power of
information technology and to bridge the digital divide,'' noting
that more than half of the nation's classrooms now are connected to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he'll do after he leaves office, Clinton said, ``I
want to build my library and my public policy center in Arkansas
... and I want to be a useful citizen.'' He said he will ``advance
a lot of those issues I'm interested in,'' such as the use of
technology in education and to clean up the environment. But
Clinton said he intends to do that ``in a way that doesn't get in
the way of the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the sometimes ironic technical glitches of the forum,
the remarks of Gonzales were delayed at first. (Gonzales would
eventually tout himself as the mayor of Silicon Valley.) ``He's
sort of making his way across the country,'' said From, as the
delayed &LR;  continued.
</P>
<P>
   And the remarks of Web wunderkind and Netscape founder Marc
Andreessen, one of the nation's high-tech stars, were also held up.
</P>
<P>
   Some computer users logging into the site (after being required
to download a software program that allowed them to take part) also
found the virtual ``auditorium'' full well in advance of the
program's start.
</P>
<P>
   And although the plan was to make only President Clinton and
political leaders available by the ``voice chat'' technology, there
were some unintended conversations accessible as well.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour before the broadcast began, those signed on to the
special chat room heard voices _ presumably those involved with the
technical side of the event _ discussing whether it would be
necessary to ``spin'' reporters because they might be
``disappointed'' in the experience.

SWEDES THREATEN WINE BOYCOTT UNLESS CALIFORNIA SENDS CONVICT HOME
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By PAMELA J. PODGER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  A private group in Sweden wants Swedes to boycott California
wine and possibly other California products until a Swedish woman
serving time in a California prison is transferred to a
penitentiary in her native land.
<P>
   The 1981 case of the convicted Swedish murderer, Annika Oestberg
Deasy, has captured the attention of millions of people in Sweden.
Deasy has been the subject of a Swedish-made television
documentary, a radio drama and a biography, ``Bird of Sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a private Swedish group called the Women's Forum wants to
take an economic punch at California's wine industry on Deasy's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Deasy is at the California Institution for Women
in Frontera, east of Los Angeles. In a plea bargain for her role in
the killing of a Stockton restaurant owner and a Lake County
sheriff's sergeant when she was 27 years old, she was sentenced to
two concurrent terms of 25 years to life. Her companion at the
time, William Eugene Cox, fired the gun that killed both people. He
hanged himself in the Lake County jail.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Britt Grunewald, a member of the Women's Forum, said in a
telephone interview Monday from Sweden that her country buys 12
million bottles of California wine each year. The boycott, she
says, is designed to put public pressure on Governor Gray Davis to
send Deasy to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will start with wine, but we will consider other products
such as rice, grain, fruit,'' Grunewald said.
</P>
<P>
   Her group wants Davis to honor the Strasbourg Treaty signed in
1983, which provides for prison transfers between the United States
and many European nations, including Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Described as a cooperative prisoner with no disciplinary record,
Deasy reads novels to create tapes for deaf people, said prison
spokesman Lieutenant Bob Sebald. She was refused a prison transfer
to Sweden three times under former Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Deasy agrees that she was guilty as charged under California
law. By phone from Frontera, she said in an interview with The
Chronicle last week, ``I'm not a victim. I am in no way seeking
mercy or clemency. But I am serving time for murder, and I never
killed anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In Frontera, she says, she doesn't ``expect to stay sane very
much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor takes
murder convictions very seriously, especially those resulting in
the death of a law enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is unlikely to look favorably on such a prison
transfer; the individual would possibly serve less time in a
foreign prison than they would serving out their term here,''
McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   The California Wine Institute and other industry leaders see
little connection between wine and foreign prison transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In matters of extradition, we will let the invested power of
the government handle it,'' Wine Institute spokeswoman Gladys
Horiuchi said. ``We see no linkage between our industry and this
issue. This has nothing to do with wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Deasy, a former prostitute who admits having been a heroin
addict, hooked up with Cox about 20 years ago in Stockton. In 1981,
Deasy helped arrange a deal to sell black-market meat to Stockton
restaurant owner Joseph Torre, 58. Instead, the duo robbed and
killed Torre in the late afternoon of April 30 in a parking lot in
Stockton. Torre died on his son's 16th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Lake County Sheriff's Sgt. Richard Helbush saw
the couple stranded by the side of the road with a flat tire.
Suddenly, Cox shot the 13-year veteran to death and Deasy and Cox
fled in Helbush's patrol car, but were soon caught.
</P>
<P>
   Lake County Chief Deputy Jeffrey Markham recalled Helbush Monday
as a family man who was struck down while doing a good deed. The
gunplay was started, Markham speculated, by the couple who needed a
car and assumed Helbush knew they were wanted in the Stockton
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She assisted and contributed to the murdering of an officer.
She needs to do her time here,'' Markham said. ``I don't want her
getting house arrest because she is a hero'' in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Torre, who found his brother dead, said Monday that he
has had no contact for years with his brother's two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they let her out, I don't think it really would make any
difference to me. I've been the type of guy who never would hold
hard feelings. It is over,'' Torre said.

 GROUP FORMED TO CURB THEFT OF BODY PARTS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alarmed by apparent human-rights abuses, university researchers
in Berkeley and New York launched an ambitious ``Organs Watch''
program Monday to keep tabs on the shadowy international traffic in
human organs.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate need for functioning kidneys, livers and other organs
for transplant has led to a worldwide industry in which people are
paid _ or pressured _ to give up spare body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cited reports of loan officers demanding kidneys as
collateral, livers harvested from the bodies of executed prisoners,
and women in Brazil robbed of kidneys while under anesthesia for
gynecological surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Not all such reports turn out to be true, said Nancy
Scheper-Hughes, an associate professor of anthropology at the
University of California at Berkeley, noting that fanciful reports
of organ-stealing have stirred panic in some impoverished
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The need to separate fact from fiction was one of the main
rationales behind forming the new Organs Watch group,
Scheper-Hughes said at a UC Berkeley seminar Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined by other Organ Watch organizers, including
anthropologist Lawrence Cohen of UC Berkeley; David Rothman,
director of the a  &LR; Center for the Study of Society and Medicine at
Columbia University; and Sheila Rothman, a professor of public
health at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars said they intend to follow through on their
documentation efforts with a push for reform around the world. Some
changes may be sought in richer countries, including the United
States, although most victims of unethical practices are in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Scheper-Hughes noted that the Internet has brought the issue
close to home: A Hollywood-based Web site reportedly has been used
to recruit potential donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was once described as a gift is now considered a
commodity,'' Scheper-Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   David Rothman said ``odd'' reports of abuse became too frequent
to ignore starting about 10 years ago. Subsequent checking around
the world found evidence of ``a social problem that for the most
part had gone unrecognized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new group was financed by a two-year grant of $230,000 from
the Soros Foundation's Open Society Institute and $160,000 from the
UC Berkeley campus, where a transplant-organ documentation center
will be housed.

MCCAIN WELCOMES SUPPORT OF GAYS IN GOP
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Setting himself apart from more socially
conservative candidates, Arizona Sen. John McCain assured gay
Republicans Monday that he welcomes their support and would work to
eliminate discrimination if elected president.
<P>
   In a 30-minute meeting with the Log Cabin Republicans, McCain
said he has a nondiscrimination policy in his own  &LR; office and made
clear his desire to appeal to gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am unashamed, unembarrassed and proud to work with you,''
McCain told the group, according to participants in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidates have not always welcomed support from the Log
Cabin Club, the nation's largest gay Republican organization. In
the 1996 campaign, GOP nominee Bob Dole returned a contribution
from the group before reversing himself and apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has disagreements with gays on a variety of issues,
including gay marriage and how to handle workplace discrimination.
Yet participants sounded pleased that he had spoken against
prejudice based on sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of common ground on our mission inside the
party,'' said Log Cabin spokesman Kevin Ivers. ``He said, `All my
life I've had a visceral dislike for discrimination. ... My goal is
to eliminate discrimination.'''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of gay rights has long divided Republicans. While
social conservatives have decried homosexuality as tearing at the
fabric of the nation's values, civil libertarians have stood up
against discrimination and government intervention in private
lives.
</P>
<P>
   This year, social conservatives such as Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer
and Alan Keyes are running far behind in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   GOP front-runner George W. Bush has hardly addressed gay issues.
However, gay advocates were alarmed last month when the Dallas
Morning News reported that Bush told religious conservatives that
he would not appoint openly gay people to his administration.
</P>
<P>
   That story was at odds with comments made to the New York Times
last spring, when Bush said he would not discriminate in
appointments on the basis of sexual orientation. ``As a general
statement, if someone can do a job, and a job that he's qualified
for, that person ought to be allowed to do his job,'' he told the
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Club said Bush has accepted its invitation for a
meeting, but has not offered a time or place.
</P>
<P>
   Though gays tend to vote Democratic, Ivers estimated that a
million gay Republican votes were cast in the 1998 election, enough
to alter the outcome in many key states.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps more important than the gay vote itself, Ivers said
that a candidate's position on gay issues may provide important
clues to swing voters turned off by social conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may ask themselves: ``Is this candidate a scary
Republican, or is this a candidate who is breaking ranks with the
things that really scare me about Republicans?'' Ivers said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that supporting gay rights is comforting to many
swing voters the way President Clinton's support of welfare reform
and the death penalty was reassuring to moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates have been far more open in their quest for
gay votes. Bill Bradley advocates opening up the 1964 Civil Rights
Act to include discrimination based on sexual orientation. Gore has
opposed that move, but has spoken repeatedly on the need for
strengthened gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Club, which endorsed Bob Dole in 1996, expects to
issue an endorsement for president but has not yet decided whether
to endorse someone in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ivers said he did not expect the club to extend invitations to
any of the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In a candidates forum in New Hampshire two weeks ago, Republican
candidates were asked their attitudes about gays. McCain said there
is ``no room for discrimination in the party of Lincoln.'' The
other candidates were less supportive of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he would be willing to appoint someone who is openly
gay to his administration, but added, ``If a person wants a job to
make a statement, they won't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Reagan administration official Gary Bauer said,
``Marriage is between a man and a woman, not between two men, two
women or any other combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a blunt radio talk-show host and a former State
Department official, said, ``Homosexuality is an abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch: ``Gays are human beings, too.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: From voice mail hell
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So here's the terminal logic of voice mail: Call me. Your call
means a lot to me. Except. I won't hear it, return it, or care.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself the other day in voice mail hell. I had made a
call, and was told by a machine that ``for further personal
assistance'' I should press 3. I pressed 3. I got another
unattended machine. It suggested 3. The next machine was a
cul-de-sac, an abyss, voice mail hell. It had no suggestions. I
muttered something about wanting only to talk to a human being. But
this machine was minimalist and didn't take messages.
</P>
<P>
   I talked to my friend the phone guy. He said, ``It's not the
machine's fault. The problem is people. Anybody with any brains can
figure out how to fix his phone so he never has to talk with anyone
again.''
</P>
<P>
   If you take him at his word, the triumph of the information age
has been to produce phone machines that could be morally superior
to people if we let them.

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinnin

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take

<P>
   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.

<P>
   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made wing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

 &HT;    Grandparents' role in today's family multi-faceted
 &HT;    By Nancy McGillicuddy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ It has been 16 months since 7-year-old
Tianna Corbett last saw her mother. No birthday cards. No Christmas
gifts. Not even a voice on the phone has found a way to the
second-grader. Her father, who lives a short four miles away from
where Tianna lives with her grandparents in Rocky Mount, stops by
less often than once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Tianna's parents were 18 when she was born. At the time they
were young, immature and not ready for children, said Tianna's
grandmother, Vickie Corbett. But after seven years, Vickie and Joe
Corbett have yet to see Tianna's parents take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Corbetts became second-time-around parents in March 1992.
Approaching their 50s, the couple took on the roles of mom and dad
when no one else would.
</P>
<P>
   When Tianna's mother dropped her child off at a baby sitter one
day four years ago and never picked her up, they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, their son has given up parental rights, and they are
in the process of preparing to adopt Tianna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a son that's very responsible with his job, but yet
in not responsible with his child,'' Vickie Corbett said.
``Michael's my son and I love him, but he kind of dropped the ball
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, now married with two children, declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, this is a very touchy subject for me to talk
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents providing primary care for grandchildren is no
longer the exception. It is a profound change in the family
structure that is swiftly becoming an epidemic. The new role brings
a plunge into the unfamiliar waters of complicated custody laws,
adoption procedures and unexpectedly raising a child on a fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need public awareness,'' Corbett said. ``It's not one
color, it's not one economic class _ it's this generation of young
children not taking responsibility for their children. No one
really realizes the epidemic this is. Everywhere you go there's a
grandparent raising a grandchild.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough questions
</P>
<P>
   The Corbetts' second-grader abounds with questions about her
parents. But sometimes the answers are no clearer to Vickie than
they are to Tianna.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asks, 'If my mom and dad didn't take care of me, do they
really love me?''' Corbett said.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Corbett keeps a journal for her granddaughter.
Everyday she adds to its growing pages. Small details about the
days and descriptions of holidays _ gifts received, friends at
birthday parties, Tianna's dream dancer Halloween costume _ are
written in the journal.
</P>
<P>
   She also notes when the phone doesn't ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a special holiday, I put it in there _ no call from
mom today to say happy Halloween,'' Corbett said. ``I want her to
know that we didn't keep her from her mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbett also writes down Tianna's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Bound in this journal of truth are entries on Tianna's life as
she grows up with her grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her the truth _ that mom and dad don't always do what
they are supposed to do,'' Corbett said.
</P>
<P>
   A growing problem
</P>
<P>
   More and more mothers and fathers throughout the country are not
doing what they are supposed to be doing _ often leaving the
responsibility to grandparents. An estimated 5.5 million children,
or 7.7 percent, live in the custody of a grandparent, according to
the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   It's a structure even more common than the statistics show, and
it's growing, according to Amy Goyer, a program specialist with the
Grandparent Information Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next census is going to ask specific questions about about
raising grandchildren,'' Goyer said. ``We think that we will get
more accurate numbers once the census comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   Death, divorce, teen-age pregnancy, incarceration and child
abuse all contribute to the need for grandparents as parents, Goyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the main reasons are substance abuse and
incarceration,'' Goyer said. ``The causes are growing and so will
the numbers (be).''
</P>
<P>
   Corbett's frustration and realization that she is not the only
one raising a grandchild led to a grandparents support group. Now
10 strong, the group meets every month at the Down East Partnership
for Children in Rocky Mount.
</P>
<P>
   The group provides an emotional outlet as well as information on
laws and financing the upbringing of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Similar groups are sprouting up all over the state and are
supported in avenues such as hospitals and social services
departments. The state's department of health and human services
currently lists 12 such organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Uphill battle
</P>
<P>
   For grandparents who have never dealt with the legal world other
than to write a will or to defend a traffic ticket, the twists and
turns of parental custody can be vague and frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking the adoption of her granddaughter, Corbett faces an
uphill battle. In order to adopt Tianna, her mother must give up
parental rights or have them taken away.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years Corbett has become an amateur lobbyist.
She's written letter after letter to senators, members of Congress,
judges and anyone else Corbett thought might be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   Her letters have been answered, but their impact has been as
thin as the envelopes in which they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice letters don't help,'' Corbett said.
</P>
<P>
   Letters from politicians acknowledge the importance of
grandparents taking on the role of a parent and at the same time
acknowledge the failure of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Corbett is drafting a piece of legislation that she will present
to U.S. Rep. Bob Etheridge in December.
</P>
<P>
   Her homemade bill will present several concerns the support
group would like to see remedied.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Corbett's frustrations stem from her lack of rights as a
grandparent with legal custody.
</P>
<P>
   The way the social services system is set up, foster parents
have more rights than grandparents and other relatives with legal
custody who care for children.
</P>
<P>
   Corbett wants a time limit on how many Christmases, birthdays,
weeks and months have to go by without contact from Tianna's mother
before the mother's parental rights are terminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some legal assistance, and we need time limits _ to
give them a permanent home,'' Corbett said. ``We're in limbo.
Tianna's in limbo. T (Tianna's nickname) deserves permanency.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with legal custody of Tianna, the Corbetts cannot name a
guardian for her, should something happen. Tianna's father has
already terminated his parental rights and without a legal
guardian, the child would be assigned to a foster parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I could not name a legal guardian for Tianna,''
Vickie said. ``I think about that every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal and financial assistance are also of concern.
</P>
<P>
   The court costs and attorney fees of adoption can be
significant. The Corbetts expect to pay more than $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed foster care providers are eligible for financial
support such as day care allowance, clothing allowance and legal
assistance to foster parents, but in North Carolina, financial
assistance is not available to relatives taking care of children.
</P>
<P>
   As grandparents, the Corbetts pay for all of Tianna's
necessities _ clothing, tuition, food. Tianna's mother is required
by the state to pay $2 a day in child support _ an amount Vickie
says barely pays for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Goyer said some grandparents can choose to go through foster
care training in order to receive all the benefits of becoming a
licensed foster care provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are advocating that grandparents don't have to go through
foster care training,'' she said. ``We really strongly advocate
that it should be easier for grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   Goyer said adoption is not always the best option for relatives
taking care of children. After adoption, parental guardians do not
qualify for the funds foster parents receive.
</P>
<P>
   Health issues are a high concern as well.
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents are often busy taking care of the health of a
grandchild and do not take care of their own health, Goyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting coverage for the children is also an issue. Some of
the grandparents can get them on their own insurance if they are
still working,'' Goyer said. But in many cases grandparents have
long since retired and must deal with a web of red tape with
Medicare or Medicaid in order to obtain coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional stress
</P>
<P>
   Corbett's ``legislation'' does not touch on the emotional issues
faced by grandparents, although she knows them well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still anger _ toward the parents, and the system,''
she said. ``They shouldn't have any rights if they can't do the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Children and grandchildren may be profoundly affected by the
changed living arrangement, Goyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the hardest things are the psychological and emotional
issues,'' she said. ``They both may be going through some grief
issues. The grandparent may be feeling hurt or angry, and the
children may be feeling hurt or angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Such emotional stress will often be expressed in behavioral
problems, Goyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read in the statistics that probably your children will be
a slow learner _ but with the grandchildren I've seen, that's just
not true,'' Corbett said.
</P>
<P>
   Tianna is making straight A's at Our Lady of Perpetual Help
Catholic School in Rocky Mount.
</P>
<P>
   It's the questions to grandma and grandpa that are getting
tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more and more 'Why don't my daddy want anything to
do with me?,''' Corbett said.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Corbett feels like one of the lucky ones _ a young
grandparent. But even at 49, Corbett said, ``It's like putting your
life on hold when you are raising a grandchild.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative help
</P>
<P>
   N.C. Rep. Joe Tolson met with the grandparents support group
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to some of the common frustrations of the group and
some of the laws they want to change, Tolson guaranteed his
support. But he also warned the group that his vote was one of
many.
</P>
<P>
   To get laws changed, Tolson said, they would have to spread
their message wide, meeting with as many representatives as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've taken on the responsibility of taking care of a
child, then you need help in providing the services for a child,''
Tolson said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some programs in place, but the majority of
grandparents are not qualified to share some of the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   One program offers financial support to grandparents who are
full-time guardians of their children. But in order to receive
funds from the state, such a child must have suffered mental or
physical abuse. Cases in which a parent just disappears do not
qualify, and grandparents are left to take care of the child on
what often is a fixed income.
</P>
<P>
   Tolson said he will share the group's concern with the N.C.
General Assembly's committee on health and human services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you, I'd start identifying people across the state _
it's a process of education,'' he said. ``I guarantee that those in
the legislature will be compassionate _ they just need to better
understand. You've got to make sure people understand your story.''

 &HT;    Backstreet Boys soothe grieving mother's pain
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ She came to me mid-morning on a
Wednesday. She was polite and nervous and sad. So very, very sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' said Sylvia Fuente, in her halting English. ``I
am so sorry to bother you.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at the woman with the long wavy hair, soft and brown
and graying slightly, and told her she was no bother. I patted her
hand and smiled and fetched her a tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you get out of bed in the morning,'' I told
her.
</P>
<P>
   What else do you say to a woman who cannot wipe sorrow from her
face, not even with a smile?
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Fuente has lost a daughter. She mourned yesterday. And
today. She will mourn again tomorrow. Her youngest, Jennifer, is
dead. And now, this sadness, this aching will never entirely go
away. The tiny woman with the quiet voice and the good manners
knows this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would do anything like this,'' she said as
she posed for a newspaper photograph. ``Only for Jenny.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Fuente was 19 years old when she died April 1. She was
in the back seat of a car when her sister, who was driving, stopped
for a train at some tracks near Palm Beach Zoo. But from behind
came a car that did not stop. It slammed into the Fuentes' car,
spinning the girls onto the tracks. Michelle, Jenny's sister, and a
girlfriend got out and tried to pull Jenny from the back seat of
the car. But they couldn't. Sylvia Fuente believes that death came
in an instant. That, she must believe.
</P>
<P>
   For days after her Jenny's death, Sylvia Fuente would go into
her youngest daughter's room just to sit and look and cry. It was
weeks before she could actually start going through her things,
piece by piece, memory by memory. The photographs. The CDs. The
sheets of white note paper, filled with the rosy ramblings of a
naive young woman. Jenny had loved fun clothes and anything Disney.
She'd adored Lucille Ball and the Backstreet Boys. Especially the
Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day _ who knows how, who knows why? _ this grieving
mother hit the play button on her daughter's tape deck. How good
that music sounded! She began to get to know the voices and the
lyrics and the Backstreet Boys' song titles that her Jenny had
loved so much. When that music was playing, it was almost as though
there was some joy back in her life. The music brought comfort,
just a little, but Sylvia Fuente was a woman desperate for any she
could get. She bought the group's ``Millennium'' CD. She learned
the young men's names: A.J. and Kevin and Brian and Howie D. and
Nick. She bought tickets for their September show, a quick sellout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am probably their oldest fan now,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Fuente will turn 49 on Dec. 5, and she's got special
plans for that night. She's going to a concert. The Backstreet Boys
concert at the National Car Rental Center in Sunrise, Fla. The
September show was canceled because of Hurricane Floyd, then
rescheduled on her birthday. Coincidence? She didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   And in those months, those long, hot Florida months of September
and October, she decided something. She decided that _ yes _ weird
or not, she was going to write and call radio stations and
promoters and anyone else who would listen. Like me. And you.
</P>
<P>
   She wants one song, just one song, dedicated to her dear sweet
girl. Her baby daughter. The beautiful young woman who died in the
darkness that April night, her screams silenced by the roar of that
train.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thinking crazy here,'' Sylvia Fuente said to me Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   And I told her it's a miracle she could think at all.

 &HT;    Killer similarity brings 'unwanted' attention
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're going to be mistaken for a
suspected murderess, it might as well be a glamorous, curvy,
tastefully turned-out suspected murderess.
</P>
<P>
   So for that, Linda Strunk of Las Vegas and Singer Island was
thankful _ in a harrowing, dry-mouthed sort of way. On July 15, she
was pulled out of the checkout line of a Las Vegas Home Depot and
asked to prove that she was not suspected murderess Margaret Rudin.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the same Margaret Rudin featured on three episodes
of Fox Television's ``America's Most Wanted'' and indicted on
charges of shooting her millionaire husband, Ron Rudin, to death in
1995 and burning his corpse.
</P>
<P>
   No, Strunk told the plainclothes cop, who was cunningly
disguised in a Home Depot orange smock, he was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Linda Strunk and I want to pay for my 8-foot ladder and go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, to prove she was who she said she was, she whipped out her
gun permit. Probably a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was the first thing I found that had my picture on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the circle of employees and spectators fell back a respectful
distance, the officer sternly asked: ``Are you carrying a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I have a .38 and I left it at home,'' Strunk said,
indicating the address on her gun permit.
</P>
<P>
   To the detaining officer, however, the picture was more
incriminating than the printed information was exculpatory. He
instructed her and husband, Allen, to stay put while Detective Phil
Ramos of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department was summoned.
Ramos had interviewed Rudin many times after her real estate
developer husband disappeared in 1995 and before she skipped Las
Vegas just prior to her indictment in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It would be for Ramos to decide whether Linda Strunk was in fact
Margaret Rudin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officer kept saying, `Lady, I'm sorry, but you look just
like Margaret Rudin and I can't let you go until Detective Ramos
gets here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you really prove that you are who you say you are?''
Strunk asks. ``After all, any identification you produce can be
faked. Even though I knew it would be straightened out, it was
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Strunk then produced her intact and seemingly uncharred husband,
Allen, a retired Nebraska newspaper publisher. Not good enough, the
cop said. Rudin was married five times. Allen could be her sixth
husband on the way to seven.
</P>
<P>
   When the cop showed Strunk a picture of Rudin, she was
impressed. ``There really is a strong resemblance. I can see why
they stopped me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the detaining officer explained, Strunk had been spotted in
Home Depot twice before during the summer, and each time the police
had been called, only to arrive too late. On the suspicion that
Rudin had gone to ground in a fixer-upper hideout, Las Vegas police
had staked out the store in hopes that the elusive Rudin would
return to buy a caulking gun or some hanging plants. Home Depot
junkies, they reasoned, would return to the scene of a buying
spree.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. But, of course, we know that they had the
wrong gal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other times I was in Home Depot, I was with a friend and
hadn't purchased anything, so they couldn't trace me. So they kept
a plainclothes cop in the store and circulated Margaret Rudin's
picture and told every employee in the store to watch out for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Alerted employees dropped the dime on her almost from the second
the Strunks ambled in to buy a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Linda reports that she and her husband were treated with utmost
courtesy while they were waiting for Detective Ramos. She used the
time to assure the plainclothesman that she couldn't be Rudin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet she doesn't have a Southern accent,'' Strunk said.
``I grew up picking tobacco on my daddy's farm in Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret Rudin grew up in Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking for a woman of 50. I'm well over 50.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That picture is five years old. She's 56 now and you carry
yourself like Rudin and you wear your hair the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I change my hair all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So does she.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend some of the winter months in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been seen in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Allen Strunk stood by, to all appearances
enjoying himself hugely. ``I don't think Allen had had that much
excitement since leaving the newspaper business,'' Linda Strunk
recalls dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Within the hour, a beige sedan sped up to the pickup zone,
slammed to a stop and rocked on its springs as Detective Ramos
hopped out and trotted up to the encircled duo. He took one look at
Linda and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you're not Margaret Rudin, but you could be her sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos then presented Linda his card and wrote on the back of it,
``Not Margaret Rudin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll probably be stopped again,'' he shrugged. ``The
resemblance is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later Linda asks: ``How do you prove you are who
you say you are? Would fingerprints on your driver license do? DNA
testing takes weeks. I was telling Allen that I could tattoo my
name on my backside, but that wouldn't prove anything either.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it did, I'm not sure that a Home Depot strip search is
the way we'd want to go.

 &HT;    Search continues for victim's wife
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Las Vegas police Detective Phil Ramos
wants very badly to renew his acquaintance with Margaret Rudin, 56.
He hasn't seen her since her 1997 indictment in the 1993 slaying of
her husband, Ron Rudin, a Las Vegas developer.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't call, she doesn't write. Even three episodes on Fox
television's America's Most Wanted haven't flushed her from cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret has been in the wind since April of 1997,'' Ramos
said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator described the fugitive as soft-spoken and
mild-mannered, with a slight Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tries to pass herself off as a Southern belle. She's
probably in Mexico mooching off somebody, borrowing a hundred here,
a hundred there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos says Rudin did not collect insurance money and it is
doubtful she blew town with any money. ``The last time we had a
definite lead on her, Phoenix police said she was staying in a YWCA
room the size of a closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a time line of the case as reported by the Las Vegas
Review-Journal:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1987: Margaret and Ron are married. Instructions to Ron's
trustees provide that, in the event of his violent death,
``extraordinary steps'' are to be taken to ensure no complicity on
the part of beneficiaries, including Margaret, who was to be
allowed 60 percent of his $10 million fortune.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1990: Margaret begins bugging Ron's office, according to
testimony in probate court.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1993: Ron begins a relationship with Su Lyles, his former
employee.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1993: On Dec. 18, Ron disappears. His 1993 Cadillac is found a
few days later behind a topless dance club.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1995: On Jan. 21, Ron Rudin's charred body is found in a
ravine near Lake Mead. Investigators determine that he had been
shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1996: A probate trial in January launched by Ron's heirs fails
to connect Margaret to the death of her husband. The case is
settled confidentially. In July, a diver at Lake Mead finds a
.22-caliber pistol later established to have belonged to Ron.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1997: In April, Margaret Rudin is indicted on charges that she
murdered Ron Rudin. She is not to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department describes Margaret
Rubin as 5-feet-7, 130 pounds with blond hair. For more
information, search for Margaret Rudin, 10/26/97 at the
Review-Journal's Web site: www.lvrj.com

 &HT;    I bonds worth look
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Uncle Sam wants to sell you some bonds. He wants it so
much that last week:
</P>
<P>
   _ He raised the interest rate currently paid on
inflation-protected bonds to 6.98 percent. That's better than you
could get on certificates of deposit, Treasury bills and regular
bank savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   _ He opened an Internet site where you can buy the bonds on a
credit card, any time of the day or night.
   ``This is very good news for the consumer,'' said Den Pederson,
author of a book on the subject. ``The rate is incredible,'' he
added, higher than certificates of deposit, money markets, savings
accounts or other Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation-protected bonds, or I bonds, have sold well in their
first year on the market, despite the fact that an awful lot of
people have yet to hear about them.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are buying about $40 million worth of I bonds each
month, or about 11 percent of the total. The long-established E
bonds account for the rest, said Pete Hollenbach of the federal
Bureau of Public Debt.
</P>
<P>
   The main innovation in I bonds is the way your interest rate is
figured. The rate includes two parts _ a variable,
inflation-adjusted portion and a fixed rate that ensures your
investment will grow faster than inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The return on I bonds bought through April includes 3.58 percent
on the variable side and a fixed return of 3.4 percent for as long
as you keep the bond.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with a rate on E bonds of 5.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I bonds are not for everyone and usually would not be the only
investment you want.
</P>
<P>
   But they have a number of positive features. To start with, they
are easy to buy and sell. They cost as little as $50, which is one
reason why many grandparents buy them frequently as gifts for
children.
</P>
<P>
   Since they are backed by the federal government, an I bond is
about as safe an investment as you can get. Even if the stock
market collapses or other investments go bad, your bond interest
will continue to flow. You can be sure you will get your principal
back, all of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are tax advantages, too. Earnings are exempt from state
and local income taxes, and federal taxes don't come due until you
cash in the bond. There is an additional tax break, in some
circumstances, if you cash in and use the money for college
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   All those positives mean that I bonds are worth considering for
the conservative end of a diversified portfolio. ``You have an
easy, safe and competitive alternative to Treasury bills and money
market funds,'' says Terry Savage, a widely respected investment
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   There are disadvantages, of course. The first is that those
steady returns will never get any better. Low-risk investments keep
you whole, but they won't make you rich.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential drawback is the limits on cashing in I bonds.
You have to hold a bond for six months before you can sell. If you
sell before five years, you forfeit three months' worth of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalty was specifically designed to discourage short-term
investment,'' Pederson pointed out. ``If you hold a bond for only
one year, you will forfeit 25 percent of the earnings by losing
three months of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, you can use a credit card to buy bonds on the
Internet. That's a definite drawback, unless you pay off your
credit card bills promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think of I bonds as a suitable midterm investment _
something you will hold onto for more than five years, but not much
more than 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not for a person who is going to buy a house a year
from now and wants to park the money,'' Pederson said. ``You can
get it out of a money market a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   If you expect to keep that money invested for longer than 10
years, it's reasonable to think about growing your capital rather
than simply preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   You might scoot some of that money over toward corporate bonds
or other conservative investments, for example, or even to real
estate or the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the interest rate provided by I bonds is attractive.
Here's a comparison: Over the last 73 years, the return on
long-term and midterm U.S. government bonds has averaged 5.33
percent, according to Ibbotson Associates. But in the same period,
inflation has averaged 3.08 percent. After-tax earnings thus
dropped _ on average _ to 2.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I bonds now pay 3.4 percent above the Consumer Price Index for
urban residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spread is always greater than inflation,'' Pederson
pointed out. ``A guarantee of 3.4 percent over inflation, on a
conservative investment, is a pretty attractive number.''

 &HT;    Get in line, Mom: Pokemon kid meals are here
 &HT;    (EDS: CHECK YOUR LOCAL BURGER KING TO CQ ARRIVAL OF POKEMON
TOYS.)
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you're the parent of a
Pokemon-addicted child, we have a few words of advice for the next
two months:
</P>
<P>
   Unplug the TV. Adopt an Amish lifestyle. Leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Do what you must, because your life will not be the same after
Burger King starts putting collectible Pokemon cards and toys in
its Kid's Meals on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 56 days, Burger King will offer 57 different toys,
one included at random in each meal. The toys are packed in a Poke
Ball and are accompanied by one of 151 trading cards. Also
available beginning Nov. 15: six collectible, 23 karat, gold-plated
trading ingots for $1.99 with the purchase of any value meal. If
your kids fail to collect the ones they want, some Burger King
restaurants will host ``trading nights'' for four consecutive
Tuesdays beginning Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The 57 toys have seven specialties: Some squirt. Some light up.
Some talk. Others are bean bags or key chains or rev-tops. Kids can
check off which toys they have at www.burgerking.com.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo characters like Jigglypuff, Mewtwo and Pikachu will be
printed on the front and back of the trading cards, which will also
feature one of 10 scenes from the other multimedia parental hazard
of the season: Pokemon: The First Movie, which opens nationally
Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   How big is this Pokepalooza?
</P>
<P>
   Citing competitive secrecy, Burger King spokeswoman Kim Miller
would say only that it's the biggest promotion in company history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always kind of scary to predict something will be a huge
hit,'' Miller said, ``but that's what we're expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, meanwhile, can expect endless waits in line: ``You may
want to gas up for the drive-thru lane,'' one Pokemon Web site
joked.

 &HT;    Can't tell Machop from Machamp? Better learn the lingo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Spencer Harding, 10, is talking about Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   Talking and talking, a virtual encyclopedia of Pokemon facts and
ephemera: of Kadabra, Professor Oak and Ash, psychic and grass
cards, basic and booster packs, bubble beams and breeders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little mystified by all this,'' says his mom, Elaine
Harding, as her blond, blue-eyed boy flips through his prized album
of Pokemon trading cards in a Dairy Queen, educating his elders on
the latest kid-focused marketing blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of us are mystified, too, Mrs. Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, hit the Internet and you can find adults dealing in
Pokemon collectibles, even sharing unauthorized patterns for
Pikachu needlepoint designs. But you can also find some guy named
Aaron posting this query in an alternative games newsgroup:
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I ask a really stupid question? What the hell is
`Pokemon'? Is it some kind of debugger?''
</P>
<P>
   No, but consider the world of Pokemon (short for pocket
monsters) debugged.
</P>
<P>
   Just drop a few of these tidbits into conversation, and your
pocket monster fan will consider you instantly evolved. And if you
really want to know more about the card game, try this Web site:
www.wizards.com/pokemon/parents.asp
</P>
<P>
   _ Machop becomes Machoke who becomes Machamp. Most characters,
and their powers, evolve.
</P>
<P>
   _ The most coveted cards are the holographic foil cards, and the
rarest of the rare is Charizard, which is selling for $45 to $120.
</P>
<P>
   _ To release a pocket monster, you say, ``I choose you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The latest card set: fossil cards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coming out (surprise!) in time for Christmas: Gym Leader and
Team Rocket theme deck cards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scrye magazine has card values, but local game shops always
run out of the latest issues when they come out during the first
week of each month.

 &HT;    Pokemon: We know you hate them, but don't do anything drastic
 &HT;    By Julie Bonnin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You are out there, we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be stranglers of Squirtle.
</P>
<P>
   Pummelers of Pikachu.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezers of Scyther.
</P>
<P>
   And when you are not dreaming of visiting violence upon your
Pokemon-obsessed son's or daughter's trading cards, you are looking
ahead to the holiday season with fear and loathing. Already,
there's the animated TV show, music videos, the cards, the fevered
demands for one more Game Boy cartridge. Red! Blue! Yellow! Green
is rumored to be coming, you know, in spring. And the old Game Boy?
Well it's going to have to be replaced, because now there's one
decorated with Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news.
</P>
<P>
   A fresh marketing assault starts this week, sure to send your
little Charmeleon into convulsions (oops, bad joke: remember, 700
Japanese kids had seizures while focusing intently on the flashing
lights in a TV Pokemon episode last December).
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow is the debut date for ``Pokemon: The First Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Followed by action figures.
</P>
<P>
   Backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Bean-filled creatures.
</P>
<P>
   New cards!
</P>
<P>
   Arcade games.
</P>
<P>
   Comic books.
</P>
<P>
   New cards!
</P>
<P>
   All of this requires drastic action, a quick cure. It won't be
easy, but you can be the master of Pokemon, breaking your child of
his or her addiction to the pocket monsters in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: Little Johnny has to recognize and admit he has a
problem, says Jay Erwin-Grotsky, a clinical social worker. Could an
intervention be in order? Time now for family and friends to
encircle the boy as he's sitting down to watch ``Pokemon,''
lovingly but firmly explaining how his addiction is interfering
with his responsibilities and relationships: fallen grades, messy
room, failed friendships with Pokemon outsiders. Suggested
affirmation: ``I have been Asleep, Confused, Paralyzed and
Poisoned, but I am now powerless under Charmeleon.''
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Suggest a new activity to take the place of the Pokemon
obsession, recognizing that even the most twisted behavior fulfills
some kind of need, Erwin-Grotsky says. Does your would-be Pokemon
trainer crave power? Find ways to make him feel in control.
Consider asking him to create his own pocket monster game, in which
a young boy dreams of taming all the merchandise mongers in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Take a hard look at yourself and how you're contributing
to your child's problem. Are you a parent who pays for everything
your child demands? Do you tacitly encourage her to spend hours
watching TV, playing hand-held video games or other Pokemon
pursuits because, as Erwin-Grotsky observes, ``here's an instant
way to keep this person out of my hair?'' Stop enabling. Just say
no to the next new Game Boy cartridge. Hang up the phone and spend
some time with your little Pokemon. Hint: Stay away from toy
stores, game sellers and other purveyors of Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4: Resist the urge for a widespread pocket monster purge.
``Certainly we can all understand the desire for a large
Pokemon-fueled bonfire,'' says Erwin-Grotsky. ``The problem is
sometimes you can do . . . damage forcing somebody to give all that
up.''
</P>
<P>
   (Flashback: More than three decades ago, Erwin-Grotsky's dad
decided he was spending too much time with comic book superheroes
and destroyed his son's collection. ``At 44, I'm still resentful,''
Erwin-Grotsky says.)
</P>
<P>
   So, come to a joint decision. And remember: Don't do anything
too rash. Think climate control and appreciation. These things are
going to be valuable someday.
</P>
<P>
   Step 5: Act now, and understand the likelihood of relapse,
especially at the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holidays are a time when people turn to their addictive
behaviors as a way of surviving their families,'' Erwin-Grotsky
says.
</P>
<P>
   Step 6: If all else fails, evolve into an adult Pokemon expert.
Replace phrases like, ``Are you playing that again?'' with ``Is
that a Charizard?''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot of kids, when mom and dad show an interest,
suddenly it becomes passe,'' Erwin-Grotsky advises.

 &HT;    NUTS &AMP; BOLTS: Worn-out anode rod in water heater can raise a
stink
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Smelly water coming from your faucet? Curious
about Tyvek? Sludge in your toilet tank?
</P>
<P>
   You've come to the right place. You've got questions; we try to
find answers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Water problem: M.L. of Harrison Twp. said that when she turns
on the water in two sinks in her house, she sometimes smells
something like rotten eggs or sewage for a minute or two. She
notices it most when the sinks haven't been used for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: The most likely source of the problem is a worn-out
anode rod in M.L.'s water heater, said Howard Rambo, president of
Rambo-Westendorf Plumbing Inc. Rambo's company did most of the
plumbing for the recent Rehabarama event in historic Dayton View,
and he said the problem is one he has dealt with regularly in his
years as a plumber.
</P>
<P>
   The anode rod is a bar of magnesium that sticks down into the
water in your water heater to help protect the tank from rust. The
inner wall of a water-heater tank is coated with porcelain, but the
porcelain cover is never perfect, and some metal always is exposed
to water. Left unprotected, the metal would quickly rust,
destroying the water heater. The magnesium anode rod is a
sacrificial lamb; elements in the water that would attack the tank
wall are drawn to the anode instead, so the anode deteriorates
instead of the tank wall.
</P>
<P>
   Once the anode has deteriorated significantly, Rambo said it can
contribute to bacterial activity that produces the sulfurous smell.
Replacing the anode rod should correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   To find the anode, look on the top of the water heater for a
large, hexagonal nut that isn't connected to any pipes. Turn off
the water and loosen the nut to pull out the anode.
</P>
<P>
   Rambo said a replacement anode costs about $50, and a plumber
probably will charge for about an hour's labor to replace one. A
homeowner who knows how to shut off the water to the water heater
probably can buy an anode from a plumbing-supply store and do the
replacement without paying a plumber.
</P>
<P>
   Some plumbers who answer homeowner questions online suggest
simply removing the anode rod, especially if smells come back after
an old anode has been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But technical support advisers for Rheem, a water-heater
manufacturer, say that's bad advice. Removing an anode will cause
the water heater to rust out well before normal.
</P>
<P>
   If anode replacement doesn't work, you may need to look at your
water supply. If you use well water, sanitizing the well should
help. Contact your local health department for tips on that.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  House wrap: L.G., who contacted us by e-mail, noted that he
sees a lot of Tyvek used to wrap new houses as part of the
insulation package. He wanted to know the advantages and
disadvantages of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Tyvek is a tough, lightweight, synthetic fabric that
is used to make houses more weathertight. It has become common to
see houses under construction or houses undergoing major renovation
wrapped in bright, white sheets with ``Tyvek'' in big blue letters.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Scholz, president of the Vandalia-based modular-home
builder Unibilt, said his company uses Tyvek on all its houses. He
said vinyl siding has gaps and seams through which air and water
can pass. Wrapping a layer of Tyvek or similar synthetic house wrap
around the sheathing of a house during construction protects the
interior from water and cuts down on wind. The sheathing is the
layer of plywood, particle board or similar material fastened to
the outside surface of the studs forming the house's outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kenney, director of laboratory services for the National
Association of Home Builders Research Center, said that in addition
to Tyvek, which comes from the Dupont Corp., builders use several
other wraps such as Amowrap, Typar and Owens Corning wrap. They're
also used in renovation jobs where new siding is going over old
boards or panels that leak water or allow wind penetration. All of
them do basically the same thing, Kenney said: They keep water from
reaching the sheathing. Most of them work well if applied properly.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Kenney said, the popular material for that job was
asphalt impregnated felt or tar paper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Black residue: Mrs. H of Washington Twp. said the water at the
bottom of the tank on the back of her toilet is dark. If the water
is disturbed, the blackness contaminates the water that flows into
the bowl during a flush. She said she touched the stopper at the
bottom of the tank, and a black residue came off on her fingers.
She wants to know what causes it and how to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Howard Rambo, president of Rambo-Westendorf Plumbing,
said he's gotten hundreds of blackened fingertips during his career
from toilet stoppers that have begun to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   The rubber stopper is the piece that lifts out of the drain hole
when you pull the lever to flush a toilet. It's made of rubber,
and, over time, it starts to break down.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the problem, simply turn off the water to the toilet,
unfasten the stopper, rinse it off and take it to a hardware store
to find a replacement. Stoppers typically cost only a few dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the stopper should get rid of the residue and the
sediment in the toilet tank. If the inside of the tank is stained,
don't worry about it. Not many people look in there anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Have an idea, question or concern? Contact James Cummings at
225-2395, or by e-mail: jamescummings(at)coxohio.com, or write to
the Features Department, Dayton Daily News, 45 S. Ludlow St.,

 &HT;    Students, up late studying? Help available on the Web
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A deadline looms, and a great work of literature
remains unread. The Internet, the all-hours superbazaar, is now
reshaping the way some students burn the midnight oil.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the bookstores are closed and the professor's office
hours are over, college students are getting study help online _
either with book summaries or course notes.
</P>
<P>
   Two recently launched Web sites _ sparknotes.com and
StudentU.com _ are run by recent college graduates and aim to
maximize the interactivity of the Net for student benefit. While
both provide written book summaries, StudentU.com, founded by a
University of Texas alumnus, also has a note-taking service for
classes at dozens of universities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students like the fact that it's not written by professors,''
said Eli Olotin, one of the founders of sparknotes.com. ``It's in
their same voice, but not in a slacker mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Note-taking services, which employ students or others to attend
college classes and then sell the notes as study aids, are not new.
In a pre-dot-com world, students might have purchased commercially
produced book summaries. The online newcomers, whose founders say
get their revenues from ads, do not charge a fee.
</P>
<P>
   By using the Web, these services allow students to post
questions and receive answers from their peers across the country
any time.
</P>
<P>
   Those who run the sites are able to receive and accommodate
requests for certain books much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Both Web sites, with healthy investments from Wall Street,
roared to life this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oran Wolf, a 1995 University of Texas graduate, who himself used
study notes, founded StudentU.com in September, four years after
operating a note-taking service at the University of Houston.
StudentU.com is now at 80 universities across the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, sparknotes.com was founded last spring by four
Harvard University students whose experience in study aids amounted
to the occasionally picked up Cliffs Notes, well-known book
summaries which retail for about $7. The men, who have all
graduated, said one of their main selling points is that they are
written by Harvard students. Sparknotes.com also allows people to
chat online and get feedback from others reading the same book.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their strategies, targeting students online is smart.
Almost 50 percent of 16- to 22-year-olds _ or 12.4 million
spend-happy consumers _ in the United States alone are active Web
users, said Ekaterina Walsh, an analyst with Forrester Group in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're online all the time, and they're only going to be
online in bigger numbers,'' she said. ``We're seeing a growth in
educational sites. They used to be focused on entertainment or
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web's move into study aids doesn't erase questions about
whether these services enable student to cheat, either by skipping
the class or book. The Web masters say this is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to most of the professors about this, and for most I
was able to change their view of it,'' Wolf said. ``The students
aren't skipping the class because of (the service.)''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Salinas, a UT professor of psychology, said he doesn't
believe that note-taking services necessarily encourage students
not to attend class. He said he recognizes that students could find
the notes helpful supplements and ``doesn't discourage'' the
commercial note-takers from being in his class.
</P>
<P>
   But Elizabeth Hedrick, a UT English professor, said she doesn't
approve of note-taking services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be sure of the accuracy,'' she said. ``And my notes
are my writings. It's the idea of intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   There is legal precedent for the services. A Florida note-taking
service won an appeal by the University of Florida, which had sued
the service for infringing on any copyright claims.
</P>
<P>
   At least one competitor questions whether the online services
will last. Internet newcomers won't be able to maintain a network
of capable note-takers over the long haul, said Robert Pyeatt,
owner and founder of Paradigm Books, a service that has been
selling class notes at UT for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be certain that every class is covered for every
day,'' he said. ``We have a complex system of sending substitutes
if our note-takers can't make it to the class.''
</P>
<P>
   Student note-takers said they have a powerful incentive to show
up to class: the ability to earn between $150 to $300 per course,
with more paid for expertise or talent. Stephanie Coppedge, a
20-year-old math student at UT who takes notes for StudentU.com in
a chemistry class, said the service ``trusts that you'll go to
class'' but said that if she can't, she must ask someone else in
the class _ a person whom StudentU.com has not interviewed _ for
his or her notes.
</P>
<P>
   While note-takers are asked to post their notes within 24 hours,
Coppedge acknowledged that personal schedules can sometimes delay
the postings. One recent browse through StudentU.com's list of
class notes showed that for one architecture class at UT, the last
set of notes posted was dated Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Also in dispute is who is best-qualified to take notes: the
students themselves, graduate students in the same or related
fields or academics who have completed their educations?
</P>
<P>
   Answers remain to be seen. Both sparknotes.com and StudentU.com
employ primarily undergraduate students. While sparknotes.com
requires employees to submit writing samples and take a writing
test, StudentU.com has no such requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it is up to the students to realize that the notes _
whether online or in hard copy _ are not a cure-all for making the
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Students who rely too heavily on notes services ``will pay the
price for it,'' said UT's Salinas. ``It's kind of buyer-beware.
There are things that don't show up well in the notes.''

StudentU.com _ are run by recent college graduates and aim to
maximize the interactivity of the Net for student benefit. While
both provide written book summaries, StudentU.com, founded by a
University of Texas alumnus, also has a note-taking service for
classes at dozens of universities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students like the fact that it's not written by professors,''
said Eli Olotin, one of the founders of sparknotes.com. ``It's in
their same voice, but not in a slacker mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Note-taking services, which employ students or others to attend
college classes and then sell the notes as study aids, are not new.
In a pre-dot-com world, students might have purchased commercially
produced book summaries. The online newcomers, whose founders say
get their revenues from ads, do not charge a fee.
</P>
<P>
   By using the Web, these services allow students to post
questions and receive answers from their peers across the country
any time.
</P>
<P>
   Those who run the sites are able to receive and accommodate
requests for certain books much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Both Web sites, with healthy investments from Wall Street,
roared to life this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oran Wolf, a 1995 University of Texas graduate, who himself used
study notes, founded StudentU.com in September, four years after
operating a note-taking service at the University of Houston.
StudentU.com is now at 80 universities across the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, sparknotes.com was founded last spring by four
Harvard University students whose experience in study aids amounted
to the occasionally picked up Cliffs Notes, well-known book
summaries which retail for about $7. The men, who have all
graduated, said one of their main selling points is that they are
written by Harvard students. Sparknotes.com also allows people to
chat online and get feedback from others reading the same book.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their strategies, targeting students online is smart.
Almost 50 percent of 16- to 22-year-olds _ or 12.4 million
spend-happy consumers _ in the United States alone are active Web
users, said Ekaterina Walsh, an analyst with Forrester Group in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're online all the time, and they're only going to be
online in bigger numbers,'' she said. ``We're seeing a growth in
educational sites. They used to be focused on entertainment or
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web's move into study aids doesn't erase questions about
whether these services enable student to cheat, either by skipping
the class or book. The Web masters say this is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to most of the professors about this, and for most I
was able to change their view of it,'' Wolf said. ``The students
aren't skipping the class because of (the service.)''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Salinas, a UT professor of psychology, said he doesn't
believe that note-taking services necessarily encourage students
not to attend class. He said he recognizes that students could find
the notes helpful supplements and ``doesn't discourage'' the
commercial note-takers from being in his class.
</P>
<P>
   But Elizabeth Hedrick, a UT English professor, said she doesn't
approve of note-taking services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be sure of the accuracy,'' she said. ``And my notes
are my writings. It's the idea of intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   There is legal precedent for the services. A Florida note-taking
service won an appeal by the University of Florida, which had sued
the service for infringing on any copyright claims.
</P>
<P>
   At least one competitor questions whether the online services
will last. Internet newcomers won't be able to maintain a network
of capable note-takers over the long haul, said Robert Pyeatt,
owner and founder of Paradigm Books, a service that has been
selling class notes at UT for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be certain that every class is covered for every
day,'' he said. ``We have a complex system of sending substitutes
if our note-takers can't make it to the class.''
</P>
<P>
   Student note-takers said they have a powerful incentive to show
up to class: the ability to earn between $150 to $300 per course,
with more paid for expertise or talent. Stephanie Coppedge, a
20-year-old math student at UT who takes notes for StudentU.com in
a chemistry class, said the service ``trusts that you'll go to
class'' but said that if she can't, she must ask someone else in
the class _ a person whom StudentU.com has not interviewed _ for
his or her notes.
</P>
<P>
   While note-takers are asked to post their notes within 24 hours,
Coppedge acknowledged that personal schedules can sometimes delay
the postings. One recent browse through StudentU.com's list of
class notes showed that for one architecture class at UT, the last
set of notes posted was dated Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Also in dispute is who is best-qualified to take notes: the
students themselves, graduate students in the same or related
fields or academics who have completed their educations?
</P>
<P>
   Answers remain to be seen. Both sparknotes.com and StudentU.com
employ primarily undergraduate students. While sparknotes.com
requires employees to submit writing samples and take a writing
test, StudentU.com has no such requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it is up to the students to realize that the notes _
whether online or in hard copy _ are not a cure-all for making the
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Students who rely too heavily on notes services ``will pay the
price for it,'' said UT's Salinas. ``It's kind of buyer-beware.
There are things that don't show up well in the notes.''

 &HT;    Imaginations aren't what they used to be
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In Ponder, Texas, a 13-year-old boy was
recently sprung from a juvenile detention facility after serving
half of a 10-day sentence for writing a particularly gross
Halloween horror story that described the shooting of two
classmates and a teacher. The kid thought he'd done real fine. Upon
his release from custody, the boy commented: ``I don't think I did
anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, he really didn't do anything wrong. Aside from the
fact that he should be serving some hard time in Saturday school
for atrocities committed to syntax, punctuation and spelling, the
boy's as innocent as his mother and his lawyer make him out to be.
And that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Any teacher with more than five minutes classroom experience
knows that an assignment without explicit instructions and
limitations can be disastrous, particularly when 13-year-old
imaginations are being tapped. The boy in Texas was simply spitting
onto paper a hairball he'd ingested from a daily dose of
television, movies and other available sleaze. The teacher should
have known better.
</P>
<P>
   Each year on the first day of school, a part of my ``Welcome to
the dungeon'' address was a handout explaining to students what I
expected of them and what they could expect from me. They were also
issued a list of essay guidelines so there would be no confusion
when Freddy ``zeroed'' out because he'd turned in a ``What I did
last summer'' story describing in 750 explicit words how he'd offed
his kindly old grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   The list was brief: 1. No profanity. Resist the childish urge to
see socially unacceptable words in print. This goes for bathroom
walls too. 2. No sex. Absolutely. 3. No blood. 4. No shooting,
stabbing, bludgeoning, bashing, smashing or crushing. Get over the
youthful ignorance that frequently confuses ``cool'' with erudite
(look it up). 5. No drugs. 6. ``Like'' is half of a simile _ it is
not punctuation for when you run out of vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Students were advised that when in doubt, it was probably a good
idea to run their ideas by me before they labored mightily over a
hot keyboard and brought forth trash. Naturally, once or twice each
year, a kid just like the one in Texas, would test the waters and
zero out. But unlike the one in Ponder, he'd never make it to the
``read it aloud in class for extra credit'' phase, which is what
happened in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of some of the children named in the essay complained
and the principal called the authorities, who then placed the boy
in juvenile detention. According to The Associated Press, the boy's
attorney readily admits his client has a history of discipline
problems at school and feels the administrators' concern was
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the tale of two scary stories. One written by a
13-year-old boy who tells how he and another boy ``...wated and
wated'' (sic) for a third friend who was supposed to ``bring the
ounce so we could get high....'' Then, when the supplier failed to
show, the author ``got the idea of freeon'' (sic) and he and his
buddy ``grabbed a bag and a knife and ran out back to the
airconditionar (sic). We througth (sic) the bag over the nostle
(sic) and covered it tightly and used the knife to press the volv
(sic). We started to hear something after we got high....''
</P>
<P>
   And then came the weapons. ``...so I busted out with a 12
gauge'' and his friend ``busted out with 9 mm and we step off the
porch and this bloody body dropped down in front of us...about 20
kids started cracking up and (vulgarity) me off so I shot...'' Here
the boy lists two of his classmates and his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The second, and scariest story of all, is that there are kids in
classrooms everywhere who are capable of creating tales of horrific
gore _ even before they've learned to spell.

   THE GIRLS, by Helen Yglesias. Delphinium; 213 pages; $19
</P>
<P>
   There are four sisters _ Jenny, the youngest at 80, a writer and
critic; Flora, 85, a tiresome drama queen; Naomi, 90 and dying of
cancer; and Eva, 95 and barely hanging on. Jenny lives in Maine,
the rest in and around Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Their brothers are dead, their husbands are dead, their children
scattered. As always, they depend on no one but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny has come to Miami to help ease Naomi through to the end,
and deal with the varying degrees of family tension and
decrepitude. Although Naomi is the one that's dying, everybody else
seems much more upset about it than she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did Naomi want? Peace, quiet. She didn't want to go
anywhere. She didn't want to go to the hospital for another
operation. ... She wanted to be left alone. She wanted to stay in
her 1920s run-down residence and pretend she was a guest in an
elegant hotel, dressing in her charming outfits, graciously tipping
the help, picking up her mail at the desk, calling for a taxi,
sitting in the lobby, dining at her reserved table. ... She wanted
to die smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Girls is a pas de deux between Jenny and Flora. One is
reserved, a watcher; the other is desperately seeking more of
everything, including men _ not that it does her much good. ``He
couldn't get it up,'' Flora complains of one of her pickups. We are
given to understand that it is not an infrequent occurrence among
the male members of Flora's age group.
</P>
<P>
   But for all her grievances and posturing, Flora is on to
something _ a hunger for living, a refusal to quit, while her
sisters are quietly settling for the final glide path.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble with you ,'' Flora tells her sister the writer,
``is that you've been thoroughly corrupted by New York. You think
New York is all that matters. ... Did you know I won first place
here in Miami in a worst poetry contest? In your book, that would
be a disgrace, in my book it's a triumph. Did you ever hear of
Allen Ginsberg? That man is a poet, not the kind of dried-up
academic poet you're always quoting and raving about. You don't
know anything about poetry. He said I was a terrific poet.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Yglesias has a good eye and a great ear: ``What can I tell
you, Naomi's Naomi. She's got her own way of doing things, nobody
can tell her anything. She doesn't eat right, she's too heavy, her
own fault, she can't walk, she won't exercise. ... All she talks
about are her bowel movements, she just won't listen about bran,
roughage, you have to be constipated the way she eats, never eats a
salad which is a crime on their part, the residence, they only
serve salad if you ask for it, now is that a crime or not?''
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to oversell The Girls; it's not literary in any
high-toned way, but plain-spokenness is not the same thing as
simple, and The Girls is never simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had given her a lot,'' Jenny thinks at one point. ``She
owed her sister's lives, her mother's life, for preparing her,
badly, for the field of battle she would enter behind them.
Remember, remember, she had told herself over and over again, don't
make their mistakes, make your own, create a different battlefield,
and if you fail you'll have fallen in a war where others may
succeed ... ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a straightforward, rigorously unsentimental story about a
largely grim place where the luckiest among us spend our end times
_ old age. Hanging over every sentence of this quietly lovely novel
is the perennial question everybody asks: Where did it all go?
</P>
<P>
   Not enough time. Never enough time.

 &HT;    From Burnett to Barbie, Mackie's dressed them all
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You can just envision Hollywood designer Bob
Mackie spending New Year's Eve in top hat and tails at a giant bash
surrounded by hundreds of lavishly costumed men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably going to be sitting in my own little house with
my cats and my friends,'' says the man best known for creating
spectacular gowns for the likes of Cher, Diana Ross, Mitzi Gaynor
and Angela Lansbury.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet night sounds especially appealing this year, Mackie
says, because his life has been kind of hectic recently.
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly. He's been designing eyewear, home
furnishings and a bed and bath collection. A retrospective of
Mackie's work is on exhibit at the museum at the Fashion Institute
of Technology in New York and a lavish coffee-table book on his
life and work recently was published. ``Unmistakably Mackie: The
Fashion and Fantasy of Bob Mackie'' (Universe Publishing, $45) was
written by Frank DeCaro and contains dozens of color photos.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie returns to Ohio Friday to promote a hand-numbered,
limited-edition fragrance, which also is called Unmistakably
Mackie.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he was busy creating costumes for Liza Minnelli's
upcoming show at the Palace in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   How does the process evolve? ``She goes through the show with me
and we talk about her needs for each number,'' he explains. ``She
may be in that dress for just one song.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackie has designed both ready-to-wear and custom collections
(prices range from $300 to $15,000 per outfit) but says designing
for celebrities is the easiest, ``because you know who is wearing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His list of celebrity clients reads like a Hollywood Who's Who:
He's dressed Lana Turner and Tina Turner, Jayne Mansfield and Oprah
Winfrey, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The FIT exhibit includes more than 125 of Mackie's lavish
creations as well as sketches, photos, videos and ephemera
chronicling his extraordinary career. ``There's a big Cher section,
25 pieces,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie has amassed 30 Emmy Award nominations, seven Emmy Awards,
three Oscar nominations and numerous fashion and costume design
awards.
</P>
<P>
   He says there's nothing like the classic fabrics: a beautiful
silk chiffon or six-ply silk crepe.
</P>
<P>
   He's especially remembered for creating costumes for ``The Carol
Burnett Show'' for 11 years and for the amazing outfits he has
designed for Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't sweat and she can wear anything,'' says Mackie
about the 12-inch doll he's come to know intimately. ``The Barbie
costumes come out of my imagination. I do them completely based on
fantasy, but I design them as if they were a full-size dress.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorites? ``There's a Fantasy Goddess of Africa, a Fantasy
Goddess of Asia. For FAO Schwarz, I've just done Le Papillon
Barbie, with butterfly wings embroidered in pink and holographic
thread and dusted with sparking rhinestones.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackie laments America's dress-down trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sad,'' he says. ``People aren't having a good
time with their clothes anymore. They live for a wedding once a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lack of color in fashion, a lack of excitement. It's
so minimal and depressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like ladies to dress up. When you put on an evening gown and
change your hair, you can tap into the fantasy thing and be anybody
you want to be!''
</P>

   Inside Sony: Tales of an amphibian's battles
</P>
<P>
   By Jeff Ostrowski
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   SONY: The Private Life, by John Nathan. Houghton Mifflin; 347
pages; $26.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, Sony co-founder Akio Morita drank sake and played
cards at an exclusive Tokyo club where a telling plaque decorated
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The inscription read, ``We Japanese businessmen must be
amphibians. We must survive in water and on land.''
</P>
<P>
   For executives such as Morita, water represented the insular
world of Japanese business, where employee loyalty runs deep, and
layoffs, lawsuits and outward shows of ambition are rare. Land
symbolized the freewheeling United States.
</P>
<P>
   Morita was the ultimate corporate amphibian, according to Sony:
The Private Life. Author John Nathan describes Morita, who died in
October at 78, as a master at straddling cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Morita's labor is a massive empire: Sony sells
electronics, movies and music, and its brand name is one of the
best-known in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's reach is especially impressive considering its modest
beginnings. The company was born after World War II, when resources
were scarce in Japan. The nation's per-capita income in 1946 was
$17.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, when audiotape was a novelty, Sony tried to mimic the
tape produced in the U.S. by 3M. Because plastic was unavailable in
Japan, Morita bargained for 100 pounds of hemp paper.
</P>
<P>
   Workers painstakingly cut the paper with razor blades, then
coated it using fine brushes made of badger hair. The concoction
worked, although sound quality wasn't perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Sony soon outgrew such rudimentary techniques, thanks to the
success of its transistor radios and tape players. Its Trinitron TV
sets were a hit in the U.S. in the late '60s. By the time Sony's
Betamax lost out to the VHS videotape format, the company was rich
enough to weather the loss. But Sony's failure to sell Betamax led
to its move into music and movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Betamax debacle of the seventies had confirmed Morita in
his vision of hardware and software as interdependent: looking back
on Betamax, he had often reflected that Sony would not have lost
the battle to VHS if he controlled a movie and television library
at the same time,'' Nathan writes.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is at its best when it describes the company's foray into
show business. Sony shelled out $2 billion in 1987 for CBS Records.
In 1989, the company put up $5 billion for Columbia Pictures, while
observers chided that the company had overpaid. The critics were
right. In 1994, Sony took a $3.4 billion writeoff on its foray into
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While Nathan's account is generally laudatory, he readily points
out Sony's Hollywood missteps. The American executives who run
Sony's film division spent $250,000 to have Japanese craftsmen
decorate their Hollywood offices, only to move to another building.
Then Sony misjudged moviegoers' tastes, passing on money machine
Independence Day but releasing bombs such as The Cable Guy and
Striptease.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's top brass was uncharacteristically absent from the
show-biz divisions, Nathan writes. That's in contrast to Morita's
chronically hands-on role, illustrated by his interest in the
development of the Walkman, one of Sony's best sellers. Morita
rejected the bulky headphones originally planned to be sold with
the Walkman, telling his engineers to design something lighter.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman also told engineers to add a button that would
lower the stereo's volume to allow conversation, a feature Morita
suggested after his wife found she didn't enjoy the isolation of
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's an expert on Japanese language and culture, Nathan
devotes large parts of his tale to the cultural obstacles facing
Morita. For instance, Morita had to adapt to America's litigious
businessmen. In Japan, no one files lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, a professor at the University of California-Santa
Barbara, paints Morita as a tireless promoter of Japan in general
and Sony in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Because he teaches culture rather than business, Nathan has a
few blind spots. He often ignores the relationship between the
business moves he documents and their effect on Sony's stock price
and profits.
</P>
<P>
   And Nathan's writing tends to bog down at times, slowed by a
sometimes-confusing parade of names and less-than-scintillating
details.
</P>
<P>
   Those weak spots aside, Sony offers a revealing look at a
corporate amphibian whose success helped change the world's
economy.

   KOSHER-SEX _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Shmuley Boteach says he's
past his prime. He never really had a childhood, he laments,
children of divorce never do, so he's been old since he was young.
And now, at 32, he's peaked. But with 10 books to his credit, six
children to his family, and a reputation somewhere between Deepak
Chopra and Dr. Ruth, if he's peaked, he's peaked with a pretty good
view. His funny and poignant book, ``Kosher Sex,'' has been
translated into 13 languages, run into six and seven printings in
Britain and the United States, and become a No. 1 bestseller in

   Goldenrod sets roads, fields ablaze
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Browning
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   The harbinger of autumn, goldenrod lights up the Florida
Panhandle this time of year, with its brilliant, candelabra-like
blooms, breeze-tossed beside roads, across hilltops, in fallow
fields, brilliant against pure blue skies.
</P>
<P>
   It comes and goes without press releases or film at 11, but it
is a quietly magnificent event all the same. Goldenrod presages the
chill of winter and the waning of the year, a kind of last floral
fling. How many more displays of goldenrod have you got left in
life?
</P>
<P>
   Poet John Greenleaf Whittier recalled in his
</P>
<P>
   The Last Walk in Autumn:
</P>
<P>
   ``Along the rivers summer walk,
</P>
<P>
   The withered tufts of asters nod;
</P>
<P>
   And trembles on its arid stalk
</P>
<P>
   The hoar plume of the golden-rod.''
</P>
<P>
   Falsely accused of causing hay fever (it is ragweed, not
goldenrod, that makes you sneeze this time of year), goldenrod is
far and away Florida's most glorious weed. Florists use it in fancy
arrangements, and you can buy bouquets of it at Winn-Dixie. Bees,
moths, ladybug beetles, butterflies and praying mantises go insane
over it, hovering in fluttery clouds over its powdery-pollened
flowerlets.
</P>
<P>
   Solidago speciosa, ``showy goldenrod,'' is the king of its kind,
towering up in woody stalks as high as 8 feet from the ground. It
flourishes in North Florida, but it appears throughout the state,
lighting up a landscape that is increasingly martyred by
development.
</P>
<P>
   In North Florida there are near-forests of goldenrod. Stepping
into a field of this stuff makes you feel like all three Hebrew
children, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, the innocents who were
cast into the fiery furnace by King Nebuchadnezzar in the biblical
book of Daniel: You are surrounded by a sea of golden flames, yet
not a hair on your head is singed. You emerge uplifted, filled with
grace, your trouser cuffs and shoelaces speckled with stick-tights,
but who cares?
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldenrod, collectively, is a delight to the eye, for its
color and indispensable factor in the landscape,'' wrote botanist
Mabel Osgood Wright in 1901.
</P>
<P>
   ``For decorative purposes it is eminently satisfactory, sought
out and beloved by all men, as is amply proved by goldenrod
weddings, and by the numerous jars, pitchers, water cans, and bean
pots filled with it that decorate suburban stoops.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the world, 125 species of goldenrod are known; of
these, around 90 are found in North America. The Northeast and
particularly New England is home to up to 50 kinds. One variety is
limited to shady ground beneath cliffs in Sauk, Wisc. Botanist F.
Schuyler Mathews tells of finding no less than 15 varieties in a
quarter-mile length of road in Campton, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Goldenrod has no smell. Its impact is all visual: It smites your
eye with luminous yellow, the brightest yellow imaginable, against
blue October skies and green pines. But the plant is as useful as
it is beautiful. Goldenrod is mentioned as an herbal remedy as far
back as the Middle Ages (its Latin name, solidago, means ``to make
whole,'') and effusions of goldenrod leaves are good for catarrh
and phlegmy throats and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Saladin (1137-93), the poor boy who rose to be caliph of Egypt
and fought King Richard the Lion-Hearted in the Third Crusade, was
said to have greatly treasured goldenrod as a medicine and
introduced its cultivation into the Middle East where it long
remained an important crop. When Mediterranean-grown Solidago
virgaurea was first introduced into Elizabethan England as a
medicinal herb, it was much sought after and commanded high prices
_ as much as a half-crown an ounce. The price plummeted after
people discovered the same plant growing wild along the roads.

   One of the oddest Florida goldenrod stories involves inventor
Thomas Alva Edison, who spent the last years of his life attempting
to make rubber out of goldenrod sap. He actually succeeded, and
four goldenrod-based tires are on display today at the Edison-Ford
Museum in Fort Myers. A champion stalk of goldenrod is affixed to
one wall of the museum today.
</P>
<P>
   But Edison's attempt to turn goldenrod into gold failed. The
resultant rubber proved too soft to stand up to highway travel.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the experiment had a curious sequel: Goldenrod was
raised again on government plantations in the southeastern U.S.
during World War II, when the Japanese controlled most of the
rubber plantations in Southeast Asia. This time, toughened with
acetone and other chemicals, the goldenrod-rubber showed real
promise. It was expensive to manufacture, but it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Then we won the war, and goldenrod retreated into the shimmering
distance again, becoming what it has always been _ the ornament of
fall, the shining frontispiece of winter.

   KOSHER-SEX _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Shmuley Boteach says he's
past his prime. He never really had a childhood, he laments,
children of divorce never do, so he's been old since he was young.
And now, at 32, he's peaked. But with 10 books to his credit, six
children to his family, and a reputation somewhere between Deepak
Chopra and Dr. Ruth, if he's peaked, he's peaked with a pretty good
view. His funny and poignant book, ``Kosher Sex,'' has been
translated into 13 languages, run into six and seven printings in
Britain and the United States, and become a No. 1 bestseller in

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AMENDMENT A BLUEPRINT FOR DISCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   Rep.
Ernest Istook, R-Okla., enjoys slamming his head against the wall _
the wall that separates church and state.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In September, he once again introduced his deceptively named
``religious freedom amendment'' (House Joint Resolution 66).
Istook's proposed amendment to the Constitution violates the intent
of the founders and the will of the states that ratified the First
Amendment back in 1791.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months ago, the U.S. House rejected this same amendment
_ an amendment that, if ratified, would wreck the wall of
separation between church and state and destroy religious liberty
in our nation. But Istook isn't listening; he's playing the
politics of the Religious Right. The 66 members of the House who
are co-sponsors have earned their Religious Right credentials. And
if the amendment ever gets to the floor of the House, so will those
who vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal states that ``the people's right to pray ... on
public property, including schools, shall not be infringed.''
Students already have the right to pray in public schools, as long
as no other student is coerced to join and as long as prayer
sessions do not interfere with the normal running of the school.
</P>
<P>
   The wording of that clause, however, goes much further. It would
allow public school teachers to lead prayer in their classrooms.
Public school teachers work for local, county or state governments.
They are government employees. When a public school teacher leads a
class in prayer, the teacher is endorsing a specific religion or a
particular religious viewpoint _ over all other religious beliefs.
And from the teacher's elevated position, in the minds of
elementary school children, the teacher is favoring one religion
and snubbing a number of her students' religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The founders did not want government or government employees
while on the job to endorse or to favor one religion over another
or to endorse religion over non-religion. For over 200 years as a
nation, our citizens have enjoyed freedom for religion and freedom
from religion. And that is precisely why we have religious liberty
matched by no other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In those nations where religion and government are wedded, there
is always persecution of religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Istook amendment would also allow religious institutions to
apply for public funds. That would force the tax-paying public to
support religions in which they do not believe. Both Thomas
Jefferson and James Madison were vehemently opposed to a religion
tax. The founders believed that if a religion was vital, then it
would be self-sufficient. Only a lazy ministry will hold out a hand
for government dole.
</P>
<P>
   Istook knows, as every member of Congress knows, that with
government funding comes government control or government coercion.
Every state in this country has suffered from federal restrictions
tied to federal funds; religions will not be exempt from such
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who takes a moment to think about this proposed amendment
must wonder whether Istook wants to destroy religions in America.
H.J. Res. 66 is a thoughtless, ill-conceived proposal that will do
exactly the opposite of what it claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant
denomination, supports the Istook proposal and seems to be blind to
its real-life ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Southern Baptist Convention passed a
proselytization resolution to convert Jews to Christianity,
claiming that _ as former SBC president, The Rev. Bailey Smith,
bluntly put it _ ``God Almighty does not hear the prayer of a
Jew.'' The SBC's Home Mission Board has a mandate to ``develop
evangelistic ministries among Jews and start churches in
predominantly Jewish communities.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 15,000 delegates to the Southern Baptist Convention met
in Salt Lake City with the express intent to evangelize Mormons to
the true religion. The SBC had prepared a training video titled
``The Mormon Puzzle'' to educate its members about the differences
between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and
orthodox Protestant Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the SBC has urged its members to pray for
millions of Hindus. On Nov. 3, Hindus began the celebration of
Divali, the annual feast of lamps to honor the goddesses Lakshmi
and Parvati. That same day, the SBC launched a program of 12 days
of prayer to ``ask God to show Hindus that their worship of and
prayers to the gods ultimately are futile,'' according to the
prayer booklet the SBC prepared. The SBC booklet, entitled
``Divali: Festival of Lights, Prayer for Hindus,'' states with
stark assurance that Hindus suffer from ``darkness in their hearts
that no lamp can dispel.''
</P>
<P>
   The SBC plans another prayer guide, one that will focus on the
faults of Buddhism from a Christian perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention can urge its members to pray for
whomever they chose. And, of course, they can even pray for those
whose religious beliefs they do not respect or understand. However,
if the Istook amendment was ratified, would a Hindu prayer be
tolerated in a public school where the majority of the students
were Southern Baptists?
</P>
<P>
   One would doubt it, based upon that statements SBC made about
Hinduism.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu child would be discriminated against by the students
and the very climate of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Would a lone Southern Baptist in a Jewish community tolerate a
Judaic prayer in the public school he or she attends?
</P>
<P>
   And why should a Hindu, Jew or Buddhist join or tolerate a
Southern Baptist prayer _ with the attitude the SBC has toward
those religions?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Houston, Texas or even Birmingham, Ala., is
Southern Baptist _ and certainly not many in upstate New York or
Massachusetts are. Classroom prayer in the public schools, with the
schools' vast diversity of children from different cultures and
religious backgrounds, will only lead to enmity and conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Istook amendment is a blueprint for discord and intolerance
hidden behind a misleading title. Fortunately, it doesn't have a
chance of passing in the House with the required two-thirds
majority. Let's pray this is the last we see of H.J. Res. 66.

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinnin

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.
</P>

   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, gener &UR; ~? &LR;  &QC; ZPyH &QC; zQ

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinnin

   This is a testplease ignore. (test 1) This is ``a banner year''
for enrolling first-year black students at Texas's public law
schools, but 90 percent of them are attending one school --
historically black Texas Southern University, state higher
education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.

TAKE STOCK IN YOUR WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you were a stock, what kind of a stock would
you be? If you know the answer to that question, it might help you
during those times when your career seems ready for a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Employers look at workers the same way investors look at stocks:
They want someone with the potential to make them gobs of money,
but they also want to minimize risk. Here are some ways to take
stock of yourself:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fast growers can be irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are appalled at the lofty prices for certain
Internet stocks. But others will pay almost anything when they see
tremendous potential for growth. If a company's revenue is doubling
every few months, even a very high price can eventually seem like a
bargain _ assuming that the company continues growing at that rate.
That's a risky assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans do the same thing. How many basketball players will
be called ``the next Michael Jordan'' before someone comes along
who is more talented than the real Michael Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   The hype isn't as great, but employers look at inexperienced
workers the same way. If they're going to take a big risk on you,
they have to be convinced that you will be worth a heck of a lot
more in a year or two than you are now. Otherwise you won't seem
like a bargain. And they won't be buying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steady growers often pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Once a company has been around a few years, its growth slows.
You can't keep doubling in size forever (unless you find an
all-you-can-eat chocolate place).
</P>
<P>
   But successful stocks in this category are usually the most
attractive to the masses. They will do better than almost everyone
else, with far less risk than the fast growers. People already know
that the company has a successful formula.
</P>
<P>
   When these companies know that they can't keep expanding the
business and they have cut all the expenses they can, they attract
other types of investors by offering regular dividends. Investors
then know they will get a specific reward every quarter.
</P>
<P>
   What all the companies know, though, is that nobody will want
the stock if the company is flat. If it isn't growing or at least
evolving, investors might as well put their money in their
mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   No company wants a ``mattress'' employee, either. Even if you
have learned all the necessary skills, you can discover ways to
manage your time better, come up with suggestions on how the
company can improve or help others with difficult tasks. If you are
not constantly improving in one way or another, nobody will be
buying.
</P>
<P>
   Pay some dividends to yourself, too. Think about how you can
evolve so that employers will consider you a better investment. Or
learn more about investing so you can get more out of what you
already have.
</P>
<P>
   _ A bad quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors hate rude surprises, and can overreact when a company
offers bad news without warning. Bosses hate rude surprises, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get a project done in time, give the boss enough
warning so that extra workers can be assigned or the deadline
pushed back. Make sure you are absolutely clear about what the boss
wants. If you can see that a project will be wasting the company's
time and money, explain why.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep it in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you have owned a stock for several years. It hit a high
of 30 this year, then fell to 15. Now it's at 20.
</P>
<P>
   The news media would probably say your stock is down 33 percent
from its yearly high, which is absolutely correct. But your stock
is also up 33 percent from its yearly low, even if the media are
less likely to say that.
</P>
<P>
   Every year of your career has highs and lows, too. You will hit
a good streak when your boss and co-workers seem to love you, and a
bad streak when it seems like the whole world is against you.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is somewhere between the two. Don't be fooled by the
extremes. Sometimes workers will hit a bad week and overreact to
it, turning it into a bad month or quarter or even year. If you
have screwed up, recognize that, learn from it and move on.
</P>
<P>
   If your career stock is at a particular high, exploit it. See if
you can get a raise or promotion, or look to move up to a better
company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look at the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Even the greatest of stocks will have ups and downs, just as the
best workers will have bad weeks or months or even years. But there
is one eternal truth about the stock market: If you invest in great
companies, you will eventually be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a great worker, you will eventually be rewarded, too.
</P>

`POKEMON' FOR CHILDREN ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:  1-4 stars  (age dependent) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a certain selflessness, a certain sacrifice required of
parents for the greater good and joy of the child. ``Pokemon, The
First Movie'' is one such duty.
</P>
<P>
   You may not enjoy this movie. Chances are, in fact, that you
won't if you're an adult. The strange alchemy that is Pokemon seems
to leave unaffected most people above the age of, say, 15. And the
movie's slim charms are such that they are unlikely to convert many
adults to the cult.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, however, that fulfilling your parental duty in
this regard won't be a wholly anguish-filled experience.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's ultimate message of can't-we-all-just-get-along
tolerance is an admirable object lesson for often fractious little
ones. The fighting and other violence leaves no one bloody, much
less dead, of which parents will definitely approve. And the
animation is decent enough and in places great, especially compared
to some of the conventions of Japanese animation, from which the
movie clearly springs.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is a movie for the munchkins. As a parent, you are
merely a chauffeur and paymaster. Remember that, and all is well _
even if you do lose a couple of hours of your life to this
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that your child between the ages of 6 and 13 has
avoided infection by these strange animated creatures known as
Pokemon. If so, here's the phenomenon in a nutshell: Starting in
Japan about three years ago with a pair of nearly identical games
for the hand-held Game Boy, Pokemon has blown up into a $5 billion
cultural phenomenon on both sides of the Pacific, with playing
cards, other games, a hugely popular TV show and much, much more.
</P>
<P>
   So what will you see upon arriving, oh dutifully loving mother,
father, uncle, aunt, grandmother, grandfather?
</P>
<P>
   First, there'll be an almost wholly incomprehensible, somewhat
hallucinatory opening short called ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' You
won't understand. Your children will.
</P>
<P>
   Pikachu is the round, yellow Pokemon that is something of a
mascot for the game/show/phenomenon. Because most of the Pokemon of
all types communicate only by saying all or parts of their name,
and human characters are in only the last 20 seconds or so of the
short, dialogue is rather sparse.
</P>
<P>
   The animation in the short is similar to the TV show: simple and
bright like much Japanese animation, with the dropped frames that
save money and create a choppier look than most American eyes are
used to seeing in action-oriented animation.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Your children will love the short and laugh hard at
several of the sight gags, if the child-heavy audience with which I
sat is any indication. And it will be over much sooner than
puberty.
</P>
<P>
   Then the movie starts. It actually looks great in many places,
mixing quite striking computer-generated, three-dimensional imagery
with the flatter, more traditional look of the Pokemon and their
human ``trainers.''
</P>
<P>
   The story line revolves around a genetically engineered super
Pokemon, Mewtwo, with a bad attitude about the circumstances of his
provenance. He lures the top Pokemon trainers in the world to his
offshore lair, nabs their favorite Pokemon for DNA sampling to make
more super Pokemon and prepares to wipe humans and their pet pocket
monsters off the face of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   How this unpleasant end to an array of species is headed off,
with the beneficent help of a Pokemon long though extinct (Mew, the
genetic wellspring of MewTwo), provides the main source of dramatic
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is beside the point. This one is for the kids. Do
your duty.

REVISING THE LEGACY OF JOAN OF ARC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before WEDNESDAY, NOV. 10) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the century, she has been St. Joan, a woman of
divine purpose and unimpeachable actions. Consider the treatment:
Carl Dreyer's 1928 silent classic, ``The Passion of Joan of Arc,''
aimed to achieve a ``realized mysticism,'' while Victor Fleming
pursued a sincere canonization in his 1948 collaboration with
Ingrid Bergman, ``Joan of Arc.'' ``Saint Joan,'' Otto Preminger's
1957 adaptation of the George Bernard Shaw play, may have been
somewhat ambiguous in tone but remained reverential at its core.
</P>
<P>
   The beatification has not gone on, however, in two projects
released this year about the 15th-century heroine. The first,
``Joan of Arc,'' debuted as a four-hour miniseries on CBS in May
and was recently released on tape and DVD by Artisan Entertainment.
Here, Joan, played by 16-year-old Leelee Sobieski, was portrayed as
a real and imperfect young woman; a legend, but one relatable to
the all-important 16- to 24-year-old audience coveted by networks
during sweeps periods.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in theaters this week is Luc Besson's ``The Messenger:
The Story of Joan of Arc,'' which takes the revisionism even
further. The film suggests that the voices that inspired Joan to
unite France under Charles VII might not have come from God, but
were instead a result of self-delusional hysteria. As played by
model-actress (and estranged wife of Besson) Milla Jovovich, Joan
is as much of a kook as she is a saint, a balance Besson believes
is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan the saint is too big; I cannot learn anything from her,''
the French-born director says. ``When you portray someone who is
untouchable, all the audience can do is watch and say, `Thank you
for making me feel small.' I wanted to make a movie that would give
her back to the audience, to normal people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Besson is hardly the first to put a different spin on
Joan's life. Historians, essayists and novelists have been busy
overhauling Joan for the past five centuries; movies are only now
catching up. In fact, until she popped up as an ersatz aerobics
instructor in ``Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure'' (how's that
for an unlikely landmark?), Joan had primarily been seen in one
light _ a divine one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminism adopted Joan as an example of female heroism, but it
took a while for movies to look at her in a different way,'' says
USC English professor Leo Braudy, whose book, ``The Frenzy of
Renown,'' examines fame, including Joan's, throughout history.
``The problem with Joan is that if you say she's crazy and didn't
hear voices, it undermines what she accomplished. So a lot of
people just steer entirely clear of that and you have the portraits
of her as a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's portrait remains the most compelling. ``The Passion of
Joan of Arc'' focuses solely on the final stages of her trial and
her execution. Dreyer, a Dane, wasn't interested in costumes or
battle scenes, but in creating a ``hymn to the triumph of the soul
over life.'' The film is a tapestry of close-ups, featuring a
remarkably intense performance from Renee Falconetti, whose facial
expressions tellingly convey a profound sorrow and spirituality. It
was Falconetti's only film role.
</P>
<P>
   A master print of ``Passion'' was destroyed in a fire, as was a
subsequent version that Dreyer cobbled together of alternate takes.
However, a surviving print of the original was found in 1981 at a
Norwegian mental hospital and Criterion Collection has put together
a brilliant DVD and video from this version. The DVD arrived in
stores Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a tough film to watch because the existing prints
haven't been very good,'' says Criterion producer Issa Clubb.
``It's also a movie that kind of scares some people because it has
this reputation for being such a relentlessly intense film. And
admittedly, it is, but I think we've provided a version that will
help people appreciate and discover it for the masterpiece that it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The main addition is Richard Einhorn's oratorio, ``Voices of
Light,'' a powerful choral and instrumental piece, that accompanies
the movie on video. (On DVD, viewers can watch the film with or
without the oratorio.)
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn composed the piece after seeing ``Passion'' for the
first time in 1988 and being ``blown away'' by the film's power. He
never intended the music to actually accompany the film (it is
available as a separate CD on the Sony Classical label), but the
oratorio's running time nearly coincides with the movie's 82-minute
length. And the film plays beautifully with it.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine anyone, say, 50 years from now, being
equally inspired by Besson's ``The Messenger'' or the recent CBS
miniseries. Both projects, in their attempts to humanize Joan, try
a little too hard to make her relevant to modern times, and the
effort shows.
</P>
<P>
   A comment from ``Messenger'' star Jovovich underscores the
simplistic approach. ``She's a woman with a mission,'' Jovovich
says. ``And I think a lot of girls today can understand that.''

   As modern Joans, Jovovich and Sobieski look great and execute
Joan's battle scenes with a remarkable physicality. But when they
open their mouths, you almost long for the days of Dreyer's silent
era. At one point in the miniseries, Joan is asked by a trusted
friend, ``Where's all this going?'' Sobieski, as Joan, replies: ``I
dunno. I just take it all as it comes.'' Surprisingly, she was not
chewing gum when she said this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger'' is also filled with another nod to modern
times _ graphic brutality. There are decapitations, severed limbs
and an explicit rape scene involving Joan's sister. The soldiers
use the f-word an alarming amount for 15th-century times, although
we're spared the dubious thrill of hearing Joan utter it. Her
mouth, at least, remains chaste.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a casualty of modern filmmaking,'' Braudy says.
``Directors feel like they have to show everything instead of
implying things and let the audience use its imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   One cannot help but contrast such vivid harshness to the poetic
power of Dreyer's powerful close-ups of Falconetti, shots that took
days of work to get right.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dreyer in an interview: ``With Falconetti, it often
happened that, after having worked all afternoon, we hadn't
succeeded in getting exactly what was required. We said to
ourselves then, `Tomorrow we will begin again.' And the next day,
we would have the bad take from the day before projected, we would
examine it, we would search and we always ended by finding, in that
bad take, some little fragments, some little light, that rendered
the exact expression, the tonality we had been looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was from there that we would set out again, taking the best
and abandoning the remainder. It is from there that we took, in
order to begin again ... and succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   That meticulousness resulted in one of the great films of the
century, a work that all cinematic portraits of Joan will forever
be measured against. Dreyer's obsession, too, neatly parallels a
quality of the heroine that helps explain her enduring appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan embodies the romantic myth of the uncompromising
artist,'' Einhorn says. ``She was true to her inner voice until
death.''

`LIGHT IT UP' SURPRISES AND ENTERTAINS

<P>
   ``Light It Up'' plays like a ghetto-melodrama update of ``The
Breakfast Club.'' There are two important differences: This time
the students impose detention on themselves by taking a policeman
hostage. And Judd Nelson has graduated from troublemaker to
trustworthy teacher.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds worse than it is.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the wake of Columbine and other school shootings,
``Light It Up'' is actually a fairly thoughtful look at the dangers
of stereotyping and closed-minded thinking. But it's better than a
civics lesson, generating genuine tension from a situation that,
thankfully, isn't sensationalized. With fine performances from its
ensemble and some taut camera work, this is a movie that frequently
rises above its thin writing and the somewhat strange casting of
``Club'' member Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   As with most ensemble pictures, ``Light It Up'' introduces its
six disparate personalities in the opening moments. There's a
sensitive artist (Robert Ri'chard), a brainy beauty (Rosario
Dawson), a troubled jock (R&AMP;B singer Usher Raymond), a sardonic
wheeler-dealer (Clifton Collins, Jr.), a pregnant outcast (Sara
Gilbert) and a hardened thug (Fredro Starr).
</P>
<P>
   They all attend a crumbling high school in Queens, where there
is a shortage of books, window panes and, yes, hope. Tension
escalates when a popular teacher (Nelson) is suspended and a
protesting student accidentally shoots the school's police officer
(Forest Whitaker). Soon the students and the officer are holed up
inside the school, staging a rather spontaneous hostage situation.
</P>
<P>
   As written and directed by Craig Bolotin, ``Light It Up''
sometimes strives a little obviously for street credibility.
Contrived lines such as ``There was a quiet riot in all of us,''
said by a student, sound as though they came from a focus group,
and others (``going postal'') are outdated already. But the movie
is savvy with its modern institutions, including the Internet and
tabloid media, which will make it palatable for its target teen-age
audience.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Light It Up'' most palatable are its performances.
Whitaker, predictably, is solid, giving his hardened police officer
some nicely subtle nuances. Raymond is a pleasant surprise as the
ringleader and Dawson gives her honor student a quiet, sensitive
authority. Film newcomer Ri'chard, a Nickelodeon veteran, is also
quite strong as the group's poetic voice, a brave young man hiding
a horrible secret.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's presence gives the whole thing a full-circle feel,
showing how far the disaffected teen-movie genre has gone. Of
course, when Nelson is playing the school's ``coolest'' teacher,
the institution might have deeper problems than short supplies and
broken window panes. But that's for another film to solve.

   AN UNEMPLOYED PRINCE STIRS THE CAULDRON OF HATE AND
DIVISIVENESS. Ron Prince, the author of the infamous California
Prop. 187 _ the 1994 state ballot measure designed to deny
government benefits to illegal immigrants _ is now making noise
about bringing a clone of Prop. 187 back to the California voters
in next year's presidential election. Prince's proposition was
declared unconstitutional after it passed with 59 percent of the
vote. This time, however, Prince doesn't have the money former
California Gov. Pete Wilson pumped into his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   BAD MEMORIES STYMIE COP TRUST WHERE IT'S NEEDED THE MOST. When
the U.S. Supreme Court weighed the William Wardlaw stop-and-frisk
case last week, one of Vernon Jarrett's old friends renamed it the
``cops-vs-blacks shuffle.'' William Wardlaw, a young black man, was
standing around on a Chicago street when he noticed four patrol
cars coming in his direction. Suddenly he began to run, as though
by instinct. His running prompted two cops to suspect him of
committing a crime. When they caught him, they found a gun. He was
arrested for being illegally armed. This week, Jarrett writes about
his own brushes with police officers and imagines himself in
Wardlaw's shoes. ``Maybe, if I were a teen-ager feeling trapped by
street gangs on the one hand and the fear of rogue cops on the
other, I might try to `escape' at the sight of either `enemy.'''
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-VIOLENCE SUMMIT SETS NEW TONE FOR GAY COMMUNITY. During the
weekend of Oct. 22 to 24, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a noted
gay-rights opponent and morality crusader, sat down for a
conversation with the Rev. Mel White, spiritual leader of the
Cathedral of Hope Metropolitan Community Church _ the nation's
largest gay-lesbian congregation. The purpose: to end the vitriolic
rhetoric that far too often accompanies the national public
discourse about homosexuality. Columnist Chuck Colbert thinks the
summit has set a new tone for public discourse about homosexuality.
``It is wrong to hate homosexuals, and those who lift a violent
hand against them invite the wrath of God,'' Falwell said. For his
part, White apologized for the misbehavior of some gays. More
important, Colbert writes that both men ``have begun using the
language of hope, the language of redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   LAYING DOWN THE CORPORATE LAW. In recent years much has been
written about the problem of getting blacks on the main track
toward partnerships in major law firms and in senior positions in
company law departments, writes Ernest Holsendolph in this feature
from Emerge magazine. There are many reasons why African-American
lawyers aren't getting promoted to powerful positions: Smart young
black lawyers have many options. Many come to a law firm with no
intention to stay but just to pick up skills for use in setting up
their businesses or their own practices. In other cases, partners
will lean toward young white lawyers who might be able to draw
business better than black neophytes. In this article, Holsendolph
explores these reasons, and reports on some firms that have worked
hard toward increasing the number of minority employees.
</P>
<P>
   FOR ASIAN-AMERICANS, POLITICAL APATHY BEGINS AT HOME. Columnist
Amy Wu comments on the political apathy among many Asian-Americans.
``In college my Asian-American classmates chose not to run for
student council. They chose not to become involved in political
causes, and yet they complained that Asians weren't visible,'' Wu
writes. The Asian-American community has many needs, but the danger
of apathy is that those needs are not vocalized. Asian-Americans
remain the silent minority in politics. ``It's not necessarily
because the system has a `do not enter' sign, but because we choose
to remain outsiders instead of participants,'' Wu writes.

   BAD MEMORIES STYMIE COP TRUST WHERE IT'S NEEDED THE MOST. When
the U.S. Supreme Court weighed the William Wardlaw stop-and-frisk
case last week, one of Vernon Jarrett's old friends renamed it the
``cops-vs-blacks shuffle.'' William Wardlaw, a young black man, was
standing around on a Chicago street when he noticed four patrol
cars coming in his direction. Suddenly he began to run, as though
by instinct. His running prompted two cops to suspect him of
committing a crime. When they caught him, they found a gun. He was
arrested for being illegally armed. This week, Jarrett writes about
his own brushes with police officers and imagines himself in
Wardlaw's shoes. ``Maybe, if I were a teen-ager feeling trapped by
street gangs on the one hand and the fear of rogue cops on the
other, I might try to `escape' at the sight of either `enemy.'''

   ANTI-VIOLENCE SUMMIT SETS NEW TONE FOR GAY COMMUNITY. During the
weekend of Oct. 22 to 24, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a noted
gay-rights opponent and morality crusader, sat down for a
conversation with the Rev. Mel White, spiritual leader of the
Cathedral of Hope Metropolitan Community Church _ the nation's
largest gay-lesbian congregation. The purpose: to end the vitriolic
rhetoric that far too often accompanies the national public
discourse about homosexuality. Columnist Chuck Colbert thinks the
summit has set a new tone for public discourse about homosexuality.
``It is wrong to hate homosexuals, and those who lift a violent
hand against them invite the wrath of God,'' Falwell said. For his
part, White apologized for the misbehavior of some gays. More
important, Colbert writes that both men ``have begun using the
language of hope, the language of redemption.''

<P>
   LAYING DOWN THE CORPORATE LAW. In recent years much has been
written about the problem of getting blacks on the main track
toward partnerships in major law firms and in senior positions in
company law departments, writes Ernest Holsendolph in this feature
from Emerge magazine. There are many reasons why African-American
lawyers aren't getting promoted to powerful positions: Smart young
black lawyers have many options. Many come to a law firm with no
intention to stay but just to pick up skills for use in setting up
their businesses or their own practices. In other cases, partners
will lean toward young white lawyers who might be able to draw
business better than black neophytes. In this article, Holsendolph
explores these reasons, and reports on some firms that have worked
hard toward increasing the number of minority employees.

   FOR ASIAN-AMERICANS, POLITICAL APATHY BEGINS AT HOME. Columnist
Amy Wu comments on the political apathy among many Asian-Americans.
``In college my Asian-American classmates chose not to run for
student council. They chose not to become involved in political
causes, and yet they complained that Asians weren't visible,'' Wu
writes. The Asian-American community has many needs, but the danger
of apathy is that those needs are not vocalized. Asian-Americans
remain the silent minority in politics. ``It's not necessarily
because the system has a `do not enter' sign, but because we choose
to remain outsiders instead of participants,'' Wu writes.

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, general counsel for
the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees
public colleges.

STRONACH IS A MAN ON A MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Frank Stronach, a noted horseman and founder
of Magna International, a wildly successful maker of auto parts, is
on a roll. A native of Austria who immigrated to Canada in 1954,
Stronach recently purchased four tracks: Santa Anita in Southern
California, Gulfstream in Florida, Thistledown in Ohio, and
Remington in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, prior to the Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream,
Stronach took the opportunity to meet the press and announce that
he had purchased a fifth track, Golden Gate Fields in Northern
California, for $87 million. He continues looking to buy, casting
an eye toward Monmouth, Pimlico, and Hialeah. Stronach is close to
becoming the biggest force in the game _ if he is not already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do like racing,'' said Stronach, who bought his first
yearling in 1962 and now has farms in Florida, Kentucky, and
Ontario, with 800 horses under his ownership. ``It's a hobby, but
when a hobby gets larger, it becomes a business of love. I've been
in racing, and I have an understanding of it. Racing has not been
organized properly; there is no system to it. The racetracks still
haven't come to the realization that racing is entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Gulfstream, one of my first priorities is to build a
training track. No matter how good a track is, you can't have a
safe track if it is continually pounded by horses during workouts.
We also need more barns, about 50 more. My goals are (1) to keep
the horsemen happy; (2) to offer a great environment; and (3) to do
things that are more pleasant for the people. We must provide an
environment where we will attract families and offer entertainment.
When you have a big facility and use it for only a few months, it
doesn't make sense. What kind of theme park can we create?''
</P>
<P>
   In this era of simulcasting, Stronach believes that live racing
is still the way to go, and that's why he's in acquisition mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that we do not neglect live racing,'' he
said. ``Simulcasting is very important, but if we neglect live
racing, this industry will not work. The big tracks can't kill the
little tracks. We have to be flexible and let them live. They are
the feeder stations; they are the ones who get the people
interested in racing. I really believe it will not work if we have
two or three major tracks and the rest is all simulcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the situations to watch within the sport is how Stronach
gets along with the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. The
NTRA was formed in 1997 to be the marketing and public relations
arm of the industry, and it is only now starting to make some
strides. Stronach, however, is not yet convinced that the NTRA is
the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that the NTRA was a good idea,'' said Stronach. ``It
asked the question: Can we pool our resources? But it's veered in
so many directions. I'd like to see a clearer mandate, to see that
more well-defined. There is a lot of common good at stake, and we
must have proper procedures to elect the directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the NTRA changes. If it changes, we will support it. If
not, we will stake out our own ground. I would like to see it
succeed. We do not want to dominate racing. We want to play a role
and make a contribution. But it has to be based on common sense.
Don't do any marketing until you have a better product. Our product
isn't good enough. I want to make it better. We put our money where
our mouth is. If we make the investment, we have to have the
lattitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTRA was so sensitive to Stronach's remarks that it issued a
press release moments after the press conference ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a day when the focus should be on the competition, and
the great champions here to compete,'' said NTRA commissioner Tim
Smith in the statement. ``There will be ample time to address Mr.
Stronach's concerns, and we hope to have further discussions in the
coming weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach and the NTRA may not see eye to eye on everything, but
he articulates the one thing that everybody in the industry agrees
on: It is long past the time for government to loosen its grip on
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great believer in free enterprise,'' Stronach said.
``Yes, government has a role to play. There has to be rules and
regulations so the public is protected. But if they told a
restaurant when to open, it wouldn't make any sense. Let everybody
run, and the one who puts on the best show will survive. America is
built on competition; that's what made America great. The
government makes too many rules and regulations in other countries;
that's why they don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach has a gleam in his eye. He's a man on a mission, out to
change the way racetracks do business. Only time will tell if his
ideas are the right ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope, after a few years have gone by, people will say that
Frank Stronach made a great contribution to racing in America,'' he
said.

MAJORITY OF ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Thomas Penfield Jackson, the judge who is preparing to throw
the book at Microsoft, was a grass-roots Republican activist from
Montgomery County in Maryland who once represented Richard Nixon's
Committee to Re-Elect the President. He was appointed to the
federal bench by Ronald Reagan in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   What are we supposed to make of that?
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the trial attorney who ran rings around the
Microsoft team is the same man who sucessfully defended IBM Corp.
against an epic antitrust action brought by the government. He also
won a $1 billion civil settlement for the government against
Michael Milken for his raid on several savings and loan
associations.
</P>
<P>
   What are we supposed to make of that?
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Fisher, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
economist who was the government's chief economic expert against
Microsoft, also spent a dozen years defending IBM _ ultimately
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   What are we supposed to make of that?
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general for antitrust who
charged Microsoft with violating the terms of an earlier consent
decree after it bundled its Internet Explorer with its Windows 95
operating system in such a way as to make running Netscape's
browser difficult, had been so successful as a corporate lawyer
that his nomination in 1997 was opposed by consumer advocates and
politicians. ``We've got an antitrust fellow here who rolls over
and plays dead'' said then-Senator Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.).
</P>
<P>
   What are we supposed to make of that?
</P>
<P>
   Janet Reno, the attorney general who has presided over the
Justice Department since 1993, has been ridiculed by nearly every
major paper in the country at one time or another for her alleged
lack of perpendicularity? Yet when President Clinton himself tried
to run her off at the beginning of his second term, she hunkered
down and stayed.
</P>
<P>
   What are we supposed to make of that?
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the answer is that the power of individuals who do
the right thing is enormous. These individuals are not a group of
``wingers'' of one sort or another. They are sophisticated students
of corporate behavior, well-versed in the deepest meaning of the
antitrust statutes.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy reading through Jackson's 207-page ``findings of
fact'' in the Microsoft trial. The opinion is dense with close
reasoning about whether a given program consituted ``cross-platform
middleware'' or not.
</P>
<P>
   But almost anyone who does read the opinion even casually likely
will come away convinced that the judge was correct when he wrote
that: ``Through it's conduct towards Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel
and others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its
prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm'' that
poses a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   There is in fact much to be said for what Microsoft did to
advance the personal computer industry. The existence of a single
standard operating system for which any number of programmers could
write programs permitted computers to be adapted to a myriad uses
of which makers of the hardware never dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Apple Computer's insistence on installing its
operating system only on Apple hardware and writing most of its
software itself proved to be a disasterously bad business decision.
Computing went ahead far faster at Microsoft's direction than it
ever would have at Apple's. As often has been noted, the impulse to
rationalization was much the same in computing as was the
discovery, refining and sale of oil in the hands of John D.
Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there is even more to be said about the ruthlessness with
which Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer and their associates have gone
about their task _ and Jackson has only just begun to say it. The
sheer disingenuousness of the defense they presented at their
trial, for example, has barely begun to be understood.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge's findings, built on the skillfully marshalled
testimony of the government's witnesses and the penetrating
construction of the evidence by its attorneys, will provide a solid
narrative spine on which subsequent commentators will write the
history of these last thirty years. As it comes to be better
understood, this will be one verdict that history will embrace and
sustain.

THERE IS DRAMA AFOOT IN THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Nov. 21 is an odd date for a championship game in most sports.
But though Major League Soccer's playoffs have been extended to an
unreasonable length, they have produced some drama leading up to
the MLS Cup final, which will held at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is a good chance of a matchup other than the
anticipated D.C. United-Los Angeles Galaxy rematch of the '96 game
at Foxborough. The Columbus Crew and Dallas Burn are on the verge
of upsets in the best-of-three series.
</P>
<P>
   Had United and the Galaxy been able to conclude their series
Sunday, the MLS would have had two weeks to sell tickets for the
matchup. But, even with the finalists unknown, Foxboro Stadium
officials are expecting to match the 34,643 crowd that got soaked
in the driving rainstorm of Oct. 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United is the most coveted finalist, since it would bring
thousands of its own fans, plus attract many aficionados who
appreciate the team's style of play. But Columbus would provide a
viable theme for a selling point, whether the Crew can maintain the
level of play that produced a 5-1 win over United Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If not D.C. United, the perennial finalist, the standard-setting
team, then the potential successors. In fact, though Columbus might
not have as glamorous a reputation as D.C. United, the Crew has the
potential to be every bit as intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus has an excellent blend of athleticism and skill, but
has not been able to consistently find an effective combination.
But after Andy Williams and Ansil Elcock combined to produce the
Crew's first goal Sunday, questions were raised about why they were
missing from the starting lineup in Game 1. In any case, the
pressure is on United and former Revolution coach Thomas Rongen,
who was able to maintain United's regular-season hegemony but so
far has not been able to produce results in tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has given a spirited challenge to Los Angeles in the
Western Conference, and might already have eliminated the Galaxy
but for a couple of key injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to the conference finals _ Los Angeles-Dallas
Thursday and United-Columbus Saturday _ will be refereeing.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hall allowed Columbus to play aggressively against D.C.,
and United failed to either campaign or retaliate effectively. In
last year's playoffs, Bruce Arena conducted a campaign against the
gamesmanship of Miami's Paulinho McLaren and Diego Serna, and
referees responded, making life much easier for his team.
</P>
<P>
   Hall will work the Los Angeles-Dallas game and Ricardo
Valenzuela will be in the middle for the D.C.-Columbus match.
Valenzuela refereed two Revolution games this season _ the shootout
fiasco in Miami Sept. 11 during which Joe-Max Moore ended up
playing goalkeeper, and the well-played 2-1 victory over the
MetroStars at Giants Stadium Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Weyland, who will referee the MLS Cup final, has a solid
reputation. But Revolution fans will remember him for having been
pursued by Rongen into the dressing room at halftime of a 3-1 win
over Dallas June 1, 1997. Rongen was suspended for the next game, a
shootout victory over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rivalry renewed
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were more than a million requests for tickets on the day
the Scotland-England matchup for Euro 2000 qualifying was announced
last month. The games will be played Saturday in Glasgow and Nov.
17 at Wembley Stadium, and tickets are being scalped for thousands
of pounds sterling.
</P>
<P>
   England-Scotland is the most historic of modern sporting
rivalries, dating back to the first official international match in
1872. The Home International Championships became an official
competition, but were discontinued in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every game between the two countries has been a
high-intensity affair, and British newspapers have been listing the
top games in recent weeks. Probably the most significant were:
</P>
<P>
   --Scotland's 5-1 win March 31, 1928, in which players such as
Alex Jackson and Alex James destroyed the English with their
dribbling and changes of pace. The Scots were nicknamed the
``Wembley Wizards'' and won seven of the next eight games;
</P>
<P>
   --Scotland won, 2-1, June 4, 1977, but after the match 132 Scots
were arrested and one died after diving head-first in the fountains
in Trafalgar Square. The Scots' behavior helped lead to the demise
of the competition, but also became a wakeup call for the more
sensible of their fans, who have set high standards for behavior in
recent years;
</P>
<P>
   --England took a 2-0 victory June 5, 1996 during the European
Championships as Paul Gascoigne led the way in a game that
rekindled interest in the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the stakes are high, even beyond qualifying for
next year's tournament in Belgium and Holland.
</P>
<P>
   England also is hoping to present a positive image for its World
Cup 2006 campaign. Last week, the English played host to a FIFA
committee and lined up a two-man attack of Sir Bobby Charlton and
Hugh Grant. Charlton played the history card, presenting England as
the birthplace of modern soccer. Grant played the humor card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my girlfriend what I should do to convince you and she
told me to sit myself on their knees and seduce them,'' Grant told
the committee. ``For England I am ready to do this.''

DOUBT LINGERS, DESPITE DESALVO'S CONFESSION

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The only calling card left by Boston's most notorious
criminal was a piece of clothing _ a scarf, hosiery, a blouse _
often tied in a bow around the neck of the victim he had strangled.
No signs of forced entry. No screams heard by neighbors. No murder
weapon left at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been convicted of the beastly murders of the 13 women
believed to be the victims of the Boston Strangler between June
1962 and January 1964. And Albert H. DeSalvo, the man who owned up
to the killings more than a year after the last victim was found,
was not a convincing enough confessor to erase all doubt that he
perpetrated the heinous acts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Boston Police Department began a hunt for
evidence of bodily fluids or tissue remaining from the massive
investigation to see whether modern DNA testing might verify
DeSalvo's guilt. The hope was that by developing a genetic
fingerprint from pieces of bone, tissue, or bodily fluids left at a
crime scene, the identity of the perpetrator could be narrowed to
one in millions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe DeSalvo responsible, as well as those who
suspect he had other motives to confess, expressed hope that the
crimes might be solved. But Police Commissioner Paul F. Evans
downplayed the effort, calling it ``a technical exercise just to
see how good our DNA lab is.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, police have found little evidence left from the murders
to submit to testing. The police lab examined a semen-stained item
from one victim's apartment, but no DNA information could be
gleaned from it. The effort is currently suspended, according to
Margot Hill, spokeswoman for the Boston Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, they did not keep evidence in such a fashion as
to be pristine for the tests,'' she said. ``The evidence we could
find was fairly useless.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fear robs sense of safety
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of the brutal crimes was at terrible odds with the
vision Boston's inhabitants shared of the small city. About 140,000
women were living alone in Boston in 1960, according to the US
Census Bureau. For the most part, they went about their daily lives
without special regard for their personal safety. They did not hide
their feminine first names by using a first initial in phone
directories or on their doorbells. They were not suspicious of a
handyman or salesman at their door.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed over the course of the summer and fall of 1962.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, Anna E. Slesers was found dead in her Gainsborough
Street apartment. The 55-year-old woman had been strangled with the
cord from her housecoat. Before the month was out, two more women,
both in their 60s, would be found strangled with their own
clothing: Nina G. Nichols in Brighton and Helen E. Blake in Lynn.
July and August brought three more victims: Margaret Davis, Ida
Irga, and Jane Sullivan. All were residents of Boston who lived
alone and were over 60. All died by strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   Police were not ready to call the crimes the work of one man,
but newspaper articles focusing on the similarities of the deaths
began to appear after the fourth body was found. The killer was
referred to as the ``phantom fiend'' or ``the strangler.'' The more
grotesque details of the crimes _ the nature of the sexual assaults
on some of the women while unconscious or dead, as well as the
bizarre positions in which their bodies were found _ did not always
make it into print.
</P>
<P>
   Though the six women killed did not lead remarkable lives, their
stories were compelling. To those reading the newspapers, the
victims could have been their own mothers and grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the year was out, the victims would begin to become
younger. In early December, 21-year-old Sophie Clark was found dead
in the living room of her Back Bay apartment. After Christmas,
Patricia Bissette, 24, met her death on Park Drive in Boston. Nine
months later, in September 1963, Evelyn Corbin, 50, was found
strangled in her Salem apartment. In November, Joann M. Graff, 22,
was strangled with her stockings and leotard in Lawrence. On the
New Year's holiday weekend of 1964, the youngest of the women, Mary
E. Sullivan, 19, was found by her roommates in their apartment on
Charles Street in Boston. She, too, was strangled with her own
clothing, left propped in a grotesque position, and sexually
assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Though the term ``serial killer'' was not in use in the '60s,
``the randomness of these kinds of serial killings does generate
the highest degree of fear,'' said Edith Flynn, a criminology
professor at Northeastern University. She added that ``when
something like this grabs the imagination, the media reinforces the
sense of uncertainty that people feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Police blamed much of the phobia about the strangler on the
media. There were stories of hardware stores running low on locks
and women purchasing dogs for protection. The Record-American ran a
three-part series in March 1963 by a self-defense specialist ``for
the benefit of women, particularly those in Boston apprehensive
about the strangler.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement responded to the public outcry. A strangler task
force was formed. The files of hundreds of sex offenders were
reviewed. Suspects would be arrested, including a 57-year-old shoe
salesman and a 22-year-old bookbinder from Fitchburg. Governor
Endicott Peabody offered a reward for help in finding the killer or
killers.
</P>
<P>
   For 14 months after the death of Mary Sullivan, no progress had
been made in catching the killer. Then, a 32-year-old Malden
handyman, a married father of two who was in state custody on
sexual assault charges, confessed to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Albert DeSalvo not only took the blame for the 11 unsolved
murders that were the focus of attention, but for two more: the
1962 death of an 85-year-old Boston woman, who DeSalvo said died of
heart failure in his arms, and the stabbing of a 23-year-old
Cambridge woman in 1963. The names of Mary Mullen and Beverly
Samans were added to the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   DeSalvo gave police intricate details. He described how he used
various pretenses _ representing a modeling agency or checking the
bathroom ceiling for leaks _ to talk his way into apartments. For
reasons he could not himself understand, he decided to kill the
women.
</P>
<P>
   Nonbelievers point to the many discrepancies in DeSalvo's
confessions and see the murders as the work of several suspects,
some of whom police had in custody but never charged. DeSalvo, who
was sentenced to life in prison in 1965 on unrelated sexual assault
charges, was stabbed to death in his prison bed in 1973. He was
never prosecuted for any of the strangler deaths.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Limited investigative tools
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I would assume they did the best they could with the tools
they had at the time,'' said Lieutenant Marie Donahue, head of the
Police Department's sexual assault unit.
</P>
<P>
   And while DNA testing may not be able to solve the crimes, in
retrospect, advances in computers, electronic communication,
forensics, training, and other techniques suggest a strangler may
have a harder time getting away with murder today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Massachusetts became the 47th state to pass some form
of a DNA collection law that calls for blood samples to be taken
from certain felons and used to create a statewide database. The
testing of blood, tissue, and bone for DNA traits ``has been
well-characterized as the next major crime-fighting tool that
provides for, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty and
under the best of circumstances, the identity of the donor,'' said
Carl Selavka, director of the Massachusetts State Police crime lab.
</P>
<P>
   Selavka said the DNA databank is similar to other crime-fighting
tools, such as fingerprint and firearms databases, in that it can
be shared by law officers across a wide geographic area. Still, he
said, ``You can have the greatest database, but if you don't
recover, visualize, and compare unknowns against the database, you
will not have a successful tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The science of fingerprinting was also limited in the 1960s.
Donahue described a recent assault case that was solved because
police were able to lift a fingerprint from a lottery ticket. ``Who
would have thought that we could get a print from a piece of
paper?'' she said. ``It's a classic example of what we are learning
daily as a police department. These are things I might have
overlooked just months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   During the strangler's reign, prison psychologists and seasoned
investigators had tried to create a profile of the perpetrator. Dr.
Philip Solomon, psychiatrist in chief at Boston City Hospital at
the time, suggested that he might be ``a Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde
personality _ a man who worked at a menial job . . . a man who
might seem quiet and well-adjusted when actually he was a psychotic
sex pervert suffering from the most malignant form of
schizophrenia,'' according to Gerold Frank's account in his 1966
book, ``The Boston Strangler.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hagmire, chief of the FBI's National Center for Analysis of
Violent Crime said criminal profiling was in its infancy then and
has evolved dramatically. ``Each crime is unique and each
perpetrator may be singular in nature, but we see certain trends
from what's available at crime scenes and from other aspects of the
investigation,'' he said. ``What we do is not a science, but we
rely on scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the FBI has 36 ``profilers'' as compared with four just
16 years ago and Hagmire said it is the accumulation of information
from past cases and interviews with criminals that has helped them
aid other law enforcement agencies around the country in solving
crimes. ``We see cases every day that most police officers see once
in a career,'' he said. ``What we've learned from literally
thousands of other cases and investigators gives us the benefit of
a collective intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such advances, Donahue and others said, the hardest
cases to solve are often those that involve perpetrators who
probably did not know their victims. And, it is these violent,
random deaths that strike a fear that is not easily erased. ``There
will always be a mystery to this case,'' Flynn said of the
strangler murders. Sex, violence, uncertainty, randomness, it has
all the key variables to make it a so-called crime of the century
and so memorable for generations to come, particularly for females
who were the victims of all of this.''

ESTONIA TAKES TURN FOR THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NARVA, Estonia _ Russians live on both sides of the Narva River,
but on one side there is hope, and on the other despair.
</P>
<P>
   More than a border between two countries, the river divides two
worlds. To the east is Russia where financial crises, rampant
crime, and pervasive corruption are the norm. And nestled to the
west is tiny, prosperous Estonia with its booming economy, vibrant
democracy, and easygoing well-to-do population.
</P>
<P>
   When Estonia won its independence following the 1991 Soviet
collapse, the 500,000 Russians living here feared discrimination by
their new government. Today, however, there are few complaints.
While Russia's attempts at reform have floundered, Estonia's have
succeeded and have brought about noticeable improvements in
people's lives. Russians here are prospering, along with the rest
of the country, and most now are happy that fate landed them in
Estonia, which could join the European Union as soon as 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is filled with chaos and corruption,'' said Igor
Rubtsov, a 41-year-old ethnic Russian who lives in Estonia's
capital city, Tallinn. ``There isn't such nonsense in Estonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing better illustrates the different paths Russia and
Estonia have taken since the breakup of the Soviet Union than the
conditions of the two cities that straddle their common border:
Ivangorod on the Russian side and Narva on the Estonian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivangorod is a village in a dark forest and Narva is a
civilized European city,'' said a 24-year-old student who gave his
name as Viktor. He spoke as crossed the border from Narva, where he
lives, to visit his parents in Ivangorod.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Soviet breakup in 1991, the two were twin cities
sharing municipal services. Families like Viktor's were spread over
both sides of what was a meaningless border. When Estonia won its
independence, Narva's 77,000 residents _ 70 percent of whom are
Russian _ found themselves residents of a foreign country.
Initially, they flirted with the idea of seceding from Estonia and
joining Russia, to avoid possible discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how much has changed since then, last year, 500
Ivangorod residents signed a petition to have their city leave
Russia and unite with Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   In Ivangorod, a city of 13,000, crumbling and dilapidated
Soviet-era buildings dominate the landscape. For a year there has
been no hot water and, in some apartment buildings, no water at
all. The city can't even afford to process its own sewage, and
instead dumps it raw into the river. Unemployment is at 50 percent
and pensions, when they are paid, run from $10 to $15 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no future and there are no prospects here,'' said
Inna Bogdanova, a 33-year-old woman who earns just $16 a month
working in an Ivangorod convenience store. ``I would rather live in
Estonia. They have created a real European country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Narva, the contrast could hardly be more stark. Well
manicured lawns surround handsome apartment blocks. Signs of middle
class prosperity like mobile telephones, automated teller machines,
and new cars are everywhere. Pensioners can count on $100 a month
and the average monthly wage is $300. While both figures are low by
American standards, they are respectable sums here.
</P>
<P>
   But, more important, in Narva, like in the rest of Estonia,
opportunity and optimism about the future abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Europe is now open to me,'' said Vadim Orlov, a
27-year-old ethnic Russian who lives in Narva. ``I have friends in
Russia and I worry about them, but I am glad I live in Estonia.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Orlov won a seat on Narva's city council on a
platform of attracting tourism and investment to the city.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians like Orlov, Estonia's economic reforms, unlike
those in Russia, have worked.
</P>
<P>
   Upon gaining independence, the Estonian government instituted a
radical reform program. Against the advice of the International
Monetary Fund, Estonia quickly issued its own currency, the kroon,
and boldly pegged it to the German mark. They also eliminated trade
tariffs, adopted a simplified flat income tax, and quickly
privatized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been impressive. Growth was 11.4 percent in
1997 and has since slowed but is still impressive, at 4.2 percent
last year, according to the Foreign Ministry, or 5.5 percent, by US
government estimates. Some $1.5 billion in foreign investment has
poured in. Estonia has shocked the World Bank by offering to repay
its loans before they were due.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Estonia's elected leaders have not lost touch
with their people _ and are not seen as a separate privileged
class. Earlier this year, for example, the country's top law
enforcement official was given a $250 speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Mart Laar, Estonia's 39-year-old prime minister, is accessible
to just about everybody. He sometimes is even seen relaxing and
chatting with his constituents in Tallinn's downtown pubs, just one
of the guys, who happens to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   Laar said that it doesn't surprise him that Estonia's Russians
are increasingly content.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the result of a successful economy,'' Laar said. ``If
we are going to move forward we need to do so together, Russians
and Estonians. Once Russians understood that it was beneficial to
be in Estonia, that there was opportunity for them here, the
problem began to disappear. Economic success is not confined to one
or another nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``the Russia question,'' particularly regarding
citizenship, is a prickly issue in Estonia.
</P>
<P>
   Under Soviet rule, tens of thousands of Estonians were deported
to Siberia during Josef Stalin's purges. Loyal Russians were then
moved in along with thousands of Soviet troops and KGB officials.
</P>
<P>
   After independence in 1991, Russians who moved to Estonia during
``the Soviet occupation'' were required to pass exams in the
civics, history, and the Estonian language if they wanted to become
citizens. Many Russians, accustomed to their own language being
official, called the policy discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 150,000 of Estonia's 500,000 Russians have
citizenship, and the number is increasing every year as Russians
see the increasing prosperity around them _ not to mention the
benefits of a European Union passport.

STUDY QUESTIONS EFFECT OF `THREE STRIKES' LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A study by a University of California at
Berkeley law professor finds that California's three strikes law
has no known deterrent effect on previously convicted felons, nor
has it made any discernible contribution to the state's 37 percent
drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Professor Frank Zimring, concluded that the
decline in California's crime rate has been spread over many types
of potential offenders, not concentrated among just the repeat
felons who could face stiff sentences under the three strikes law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found no evidence that this law was having any deterrent
effect on the target group _ previously convicted felons,'' Zimring
said. ``The statistical effect of three strikes is negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   The study comes at a time when many lawmakers on both the right
and the left are questioning the effectiveness of the law, which
requires a 25-year-to-life sentence for anyone convicted of a third
felony crime, violent or otherwise. Last month Gov. Gray Davis, a
Democrat, vetoed a bill to require a nonpartisan study of the
effect of the law. A separate measure to amend the law died in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was passed overwhelmingly by the Legislature in
1994, signed into law by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and
ratified by voters 72 percent to 28 percent. The ``third strike''
is an analogy to baseball _ three strikes and you are out.
</P>
<P>
   California's law is the most stringent in the nation because
only one of the three felony convictions needs to be violent for
the tough sentencing to kick in. The result has led to several
controversial 25-year sentences. The most notable were given to a
man whose third strike was a bicycle theft and to a homeless man
who was convicted of snatching a slice of pizza. Most other states
that have similar laws require that all three strikes be violent
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In his study, Zimring concluded that only 10 percent of felons
in California who have been convicted or are facing a third strike
were accused of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The study immediately was criticized by Secretary of State Bill
Jones, who co-authored the law as a legislator. Jones spokesman
Alfie Charles said the study is flawed because Zimring only looked
at numbers and did not interview actual convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In trying to determine its value as a deterrent, you try to
ask some of the criminals themselves,'' Charles said. ``All the
anecdotal evidence that we have from police, prison guards and
parole officers is that the target population is very aware of the
law and is intent on avoiding going to prison under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles said that because of three strikes, felons have only
three choices: ``They either clean up their act, go to jail or
leave the state. All three of those lead to a reduction in crime.
We have more parolees leaving California than coming to California.
Before three strikes, more parolees came here than left.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Jones released a study that said that three
strikes had prevented more than a million crimes, saving the state
and its residents $21.7 billion. He said he would fight any effort
to modify the law.
</P>
<P>
   The UC-Berkeley study looked at a sample of about 3,500 criminal
cases in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco before the three
strikes law took effect and in 1994 and 1995, after the law was in
force.
</P>
<P>
   Zimring found that before the law took effect, people with one
or two strikes on their record accounted for 13.9 percent of all
adults arrested for felonies in the three cities. The number fell
only slightly, to 12.8 percent, after the new law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If California's crime decline were a three strikes effect, we
would expect to see the drop in arrests concentrated among the
target groups. Instead, the decline is spread evenly,'' Zimring
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study indicates that prosecutors are reluctant to prosecute
offenders to the full extent of the law. The study estimated ``that
between 30 and 60 percent of so-called second-strike-eligible cases
are treated as such under the new law, while only 10 to 20 percent
of the third-strike-eligible cases get full third strike
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a statewide prosecutors group supported an alternative
form of three strikes that would have required that all three
convictions be violent crimes.

HEAVY STAKES IN VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best thing that can happen when Evander Holyfield and Lennox
Lewis meet Saturday night is that the two heavyweights battle until
the last round and the best man wins.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing, well . . . no need to go into the mutations
that have become professional boxing. The dives. The corruption.
Mike Tyson. The judges.
</P>
<P>
   This is not new to Ross Greenberg, HBO Sports executive
producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get into the ring and throw punches,'' Greenberg
said. ``We'll have plenty of cameras and equipment there to record
the action. All we can do is hope that the two fighters inject some
life into the sport. They need to put together a scintillating
performance for themselves as well as the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport survives because lots of people are making money. The
first Lewis-Holyfield fight in March generated 1.2 million
pay-per-view buys, the eighth-most in history. Greenberg readily
admits that the fight, which ended in a draw, was a disppointment
because of the controversial scoring of one judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of events just don't work for the sport anymore,''
Greenberg said. ``How many times can boxing go to the well?
Everyone can play in their piles of money, but we all need that
'80s type of feeling when fights surpassed the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no one better than Holyfield to respond to the
challenge. Of the top nine pay-per-view fights in history,
Holyfield has been in five of them. The second Holyfield-Tyson
fight pulled 1.99 million buys. The first got 1.55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said the worst thing that can happen is ``another
lackluster fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters have a lot at stake. Holyfield, who has performed
better the second time around against opponents, needs to beat
Lewis convincingly because many observers thought he lost the first
fight. Lewis, likewise, said he won the first fight and he plans to
let his boxing speak for itself this time.
</P>
<P>
   And that would suit Greenberg just fine.
</P>

   CBS had a few good nuggets during its NFL coverage Sunday. In an
interview with 49ers coach Steve Mariucci, Armen Keteyian asked
about concussion-plagued quarterback Steve Young. Mariucci said
that Young wants to play this year but the coach ``won't take the
risk'' and oblige him. ``I couldn't live with myself,'' Mariucci
said. Keteyian also interviewed Jerry Rice, who said that if the
49ers continue to slide, he doesn't plan on being around much
longer. ``I would like to end myt career in San Francisco, but I
would consider going to another (team) with a shot at the Super
Bowl if I'm not in the team's plans,'' Rice told Keteyian. He said
Miami was the team that first came to his mind . . . Fox NFL
analyst Howie Long got off a good line Sunday about Trent Dilfer,
the hapless Tampa Bay quarterback. ``When you have a Warrick Dunn
and a Mike Alstott in the backfield, it's hard for me to figure
that Trent Dilfer can't throw the ball down the field when he
constantly sees eight-man fronts,'' Long said on ``Fox NFL
Sunday.'' ``Defenses are defying him to throw the ball down the
field. If you are looking at this game today as a young
quarterback, turn away from the screen.'' Cohost Terry Bradshaw was
equally blunt on NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue denying Marshall
Faulk's request to wear No. 34 in honor of the late Walter Payton.
Tagliabue ``should be ashamed of himself,'' said Bradshaw. ``If
Faulk wants to wear No. 34, let him do it. He is honoring the
greatest running back in the history of the NFL, so take these
rules and bury them you know where.''

HOW ROD SHOATE DRITED AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COFFEE, Okla. _ Today, those who lived in Rod Shoate's
worlds _ and there were many of them _ still do not know what to
make of his rise and terrible fall. From the family farm in Spiro,
Okla., to Boston's Combat Zone; from a loving family that wanted to
welcome him back _ no questions asked _ to his New England Patriots
teammates; from ``Peanut,'' a street hustler on Boston Common, to
police officers at the Area A station in downtown Boston; from
Derek Sanderson to Reggie White; from his wife, Debbie, to so many
others, there are such tangled views of the man. Kind and gentle,
quiet but angry, so strong yet so weak.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is baffled about the plight of Shoate: a three-time
All-American at Oklahoma in the early '70s, a standout Patriots
linebacker from 1975-81, a drug abuser and drifter on Boston's
streets for the next 16 years, and finally, back home in Oklahoma,
a casualty of that ravaging lifestyle, dead Oct. 4 at age 46.
</P>
<P>
   Before that final, futile homecoming, a man who in the '70s had
made a reputation as a swift, hard-hitting, ball-hawking linebacker
had become a familiar, pitiable figure to street people and to the
Boston Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's down in the Zone all the time,'' a Boston Police officer
said in summer 1995. Shoate, the officer went on, ``still has his
moves. One time he was arrested _ I think it was for breaking into
a car _ and
</P>
<P>
   he was being booked at Area A. Then _ whoosh _ he just started
running, like a bat out of hell. They finally caught up to him down
at North Station.''
</P>
<P>
   Another police officer called Shoate a crack-head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He breaks into cars, he does B&AMP;E's, all the usual stuff that
crack-heads do to get more money to feed their habit,'' said the
officer. ``It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another officer who patrolled the downtown area said he had
talked to Shoate many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod's really come down just to be here,'' he said in '95.
``But the feeling I get is that Rod's not fighting it anymore, that
he has accepted what has happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be rehabilitations that lasted a few days or,
sometimes, a few months. Shoate tried to find jobs coaching high
school teams (``Just as an assistant,'' he said), and he would work
on construction crews or as a roofer. Once in 1995 when he seemed
determined to salvage his life, he spent months building houses in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, he would return to the dark world of the street
hustlers. One day on Boston Common in '95, Peanut talked about his
pal. His good pal. Rod Shoate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's told me it all,'' said Peanut. ``Rod's told me he used to
play for the Patriots. But I'm the only one he's been telling that.
He doesn't tell no one he used to be a player, because he doesn't
want no one to know. I guess he's ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Peanut didn't talk for nothing. Money is needed to get through
the day and night. A few bucks bought the word that Shoate didn't
use his own name, that his street name was ``Rod Sims'' some days
and ``Ken Sims'' on other days. ``Ken Sims,'' of course, was the
No. 1 draft choice of the Patriots the year Shoate's career ended,
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that Rod went through some hard times,'' said
Peanut. ``Real hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Shoate managed to make his way back home to Oklahoma a
couple of years ago, things didn't get much better.
</P>
<P>
   Rod's father, Levester, spoke in the spring of '95 of how
Shoate's former Oklahoma teammates would call or drop by the
farmhouse and ask if they could do anything to help Rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially the Selmon brothers, Lee Roy and Dewey, were always
trying to help Rod,'' said Levester. ``But I guess you can't be
helped unless you want to be helped.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Lula, said, ``Rod was such a good boy until he got
into that (drug) stuff. That changed him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So this was the ``back 40,'' part of the acreage of Levester
Shoate's farm in Fort Coffee, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   This was where Rod Shoate never wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very happy to be down on the farm and just going to the
`back 40' every morning, and leave me out of everything else,'' Rod
Shoate said a few years ago. ``No matter what I'd be doing, I'd
come home from a football game and I'd think, `I'd be so happy just
being on my daddy's tractor.' It doesn't take much to make me
happy. Just riding that tractor would have made me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   (Shoate spoke those words while lounging in his living room for
that day _ the Park Street T station in Boston.)
</P>
<P>
   Just a mile or so from that little farm of 100 acres or so is a
world-famous archeological site, the Spiro Indian Mounds. It is the
only reason to draw the outside world off the main road from Fort
Smith, Ark., into the back country _ to see artifacts from a tribe
of Mississippi Indians who lived here beginning in 1000 A.D., only
to mysteriously disappear 400 years later.
</P>
<P>
   There is a left turn just before the Spiro Indian Mounds.
Tourists barely notice it. Few cars turn down it. Rod Shoate wished
he had never traveled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is 189 miles to Norman,'' Shoate once said. ``I had to know
how far away from home I was, so I clocked it once on the meter in
the car when I was going back to college. It's 189 miles. It was so
far away.''
</P>
<P>
   (Shoate spoke of his homesickness while sitting in his home for
another day _ a bench in the Government Center T station.)
</P>
<P>
   Shoate never would have been asked to leave the farm and travel
those 189 miles to the University of Oklahoma in Norman if fate
hadn't twisted in such an improbable way. Recruiters for Chuck
Fairbanks, then the Oklahoma coach and later the Patriots' head
man, scoured the Southwest for football players, but rarely did
they venture into the backwaters of far eastern Oklahoma, where
loyalties bend more toward the University of Arkansas in
Fayetteville, much closer than Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we had ourselves an end (Wayne Hoffman), and Fairbanks
sent down Larry Lacewell to take a look,'' remembered Gerald
Blankenship, who coached the Spiro High School Bulldogs 30 years
ago. ``But I told Lacewell, `Don't you even bother coming down here
if you won't promise to come back next year to look at another boy
we have.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was worth a look, and he made it to OU and later the
Kansas City Chiefs. The next year, Lacewell did return, and he saw
Shoate, whom no other college in America knew about. Lacewell
returned to Norman and raved about the linebacker. Fairbanks
offered Shoate a scholarship to OU, a fantasy come true for many an
Oklahoma boy. But not for Rod Shoate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to leave Spiro,'' said Shoate. ``I remember
(Fairbanks) saying, `People will kill to come to Oklahoma. If you
don't take this scholarship today, it'll be gone tomorrow.' So I
told him I wouldn't go unless I got two scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   Two?
</P>
<P>
   ``One for me and one for my sister Charlotte. I wasn't going
anywhere without Charlotte. She had always been my mouthpiece.
Charlotte would say things to my parents that I always wanted to
say, but didn't. And we always played together. Charlotte was
always there when I needed her.''
</P>
<P>
   (Shoate spoke lovingly of his sister while at a lunch meeting he
had suggested, at a fast-food restaurant on Massachusetts Avenue
near Central Square in Cambridge.)
</P>
<P>
   Shoate would regret that decision. He left for the fast life of
Norman, big sister Charlotte leading the way and protecting him,
and Shoate took the first steps on his Trail of Tears.
</P>
<P>
   Those words, ``Trail of Tears,'' are so apt.
</P>
<P>
   This part of Oklahoma is still known as the Trail of Tears for
the Cherokee Nation, which was forced out of the southeastern
United States by the US government in the mid-1800s and forced to
travel 1,000 miles or more and resettle in what was then Indian
Territory. They dubbed their trek the ``Trail of Tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cherokee people were forced to leave their homeland and
settle around Spiro and to the north. Shoate's Trail of Tears went
in the opposite direction: Men asked him to leave Spiro so he could
play football.
</P>
<P>
   Shoate and the Cherokees and the Trail of Tears are all
intertwined. Levester Shoate, the 87-year-old patriarch, stood in
the ``back 40'' a few years ago and told his tale. This land, this
100 or so acres of soybeans and cows of which he was so proud, had
been his father's from the turn of the century. His father had once
been a slave owned by the Cherokee Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Once freed, the slaves of the Cherokee and the slaves of the
neighboring Chickasaw Indian Nation gathered together and settled
in outposts like this one in Fort Coffee, a few miles from Spiro.
The aftereffects would burn on for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to deal with so much anger all my life,'' said Rod
Shoate. Anger at attending segregated schools until he was 10, then
anger at attending integrated schools ``when the white boys would
call us names and I never knew why they were doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being over in Fort Smith one day when I was a boy,
and I got separated from my parents. And the white kids'd say to
me, `You got a nice little tan there, boy.' I didn't know. I
couldn't understand this. We were taught by my parents to be equal,
that everybody was equal.''
</P>
<P>
   (Shoate recounted his tale during a rendezvous at another of his
homes on yet another day _ the Esplanade near the Hatch Shell, in
Boston.)
</P>
<P>
   There was anger, too, at his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in a Southern Baptist household, and kids never had
an opinion,'' said Shoate. ``I guess I learned that at an early age
_ to be quiet. Like all the whippings I got, I deserved them all.
But I'd say, `If you're going to whip me, whip me now, but don't
scream at me. Get it over now.' But I also liked nothing more than
to be with my father.''
</P>
<P>
   (Those words were spoken at yet another of Shoate's homes on yet
another day _ a bench on Boston Common.)

BILL LOOKS TO CLOSE HEALTH CARE GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Various studies have documented the racial and ethnic
disparities in income, education and housing in America.
</P>
<P>
   But one additional disparity _ just as troubling, yet perhaps
more curable _ is the gap in health care. African-Americans,
Hispanics and other ethnic groups are not getting their fair share
of health care in this nation, according to a number of
authenticated reports released this past year.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with US Senator Edward M. Kennedy and US Representative
John Lewis leading the effort, Congress will hear legislation
calling for health care fairness. The bill, introduced by both men
in their respective chambers, is designed to close the racial and
ethnic gap on health care which is as alarming as any epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal
of the American Medical Association, the Institute of Medicine in
the National Academy of Sciences, and in studies by the Kaiser
Family Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, the following
statistics reveal the size of this gap:
</P>
<P>
   --African-Americans are 40 percent more likely to die from
coronary disease, and 35 percent are more likely to die from cancer
than whites.
</P>
<P>
   --Diabetes strikes African-Americans 70 percent more often, and
Hispanics twice as often, as whites.
</P>
<P>
   --While racial and ethnic minorities make up approximately half
of the total US population, these groups account for more than half
of all AIDS cases. Worse, African-American and Hispanic women
account for nearly 80 percent of the AIDs cases reported among
women.
</P>
<P>
   --African-American patients with lung cancer tumors small enough
to be removed were treated surgically in only 64 percent of the
cases, compared with 77 percent of white patients treated
surgically for the tumors. As a result, African-Americans have only
a 26 percent chance of surviving lung cancer, compared with a 34
percent survival rate among whites.
</P>
<P>
   --Hispanic children were four times more likely than white
children, and African-American youth were five times more likely
than white children, to lack a usual source of health care, even
after obtaining health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   --In an experimental study to test bias in doctors' decisions,
91 percent of white males, white females, and African-American
males were referred for cardiac catheterization, a more effective
but more expensive diagnostic procedure, but only 79 percent of
African-American females in the study were referred for this test.
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy acknowledged: ``Despite our knowledge of these
alarming statistics, we have not made the commitment necessary to
understanding how barriers to health care or genetic and behavioral
differences affect the health outcomes of minority communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is joined in sponsoring the measure by senators Daniel
Akaka and Daniel Inouye. And Lewis is joined on the House versions
by representatives Bennie Thompson, Jesse Jackson Jr., and Charles
Norwood. The need for such legislation arose from a report issued
last February by the Institute of Medicine, which concluded that
federal efforts to research cancer in minority communities are
insufficient. More resources are needed and a strategic plan was
necessary to coordinate the research, the report added.
</P>
<P>
   The health fairness bill, as written, would elevate the current
Office of Research on Minority Health into a Center for Health
Disparities Research at the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The center, according to Lewis's announcement last week, ``would
provide significant support for research on health disparities, and
funding major increases in minority medical training and curriculum
development.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the center would oversee the development of a
National Institutes of Health strategic plan for research on
minority health. Kennedy said in his announcement that this step
``will enable the Congress, the communities affected by racial amd
ethnic disparities, and NIH to monitor the progress of NIH in this
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are learning that bias in the health care system is also a
factor in racial and ethnic health disparities. Each of these areas
must be addressed in order to give these communitiies the fair
chance for a healthy future that all Americans deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   That fair chance is now in the hands of Congress. If there are
enough members of the House and Senate willing to place the issue
of good health care for all Americans above their own political
health, this bill ought to pass.
</P>

HERRING AUTHORS, BUFFETT WARY OF NET STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his new book about Silicon Valley, writer Michael Lewis tries
to explain the spell Internet companies have cast over Wall Street.
He is referring to Healtheon, a medical information firm, but he
could be describing any of the new breed of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said to the stock market: Our future will look nothing like
our present; ergo you cannot determine our value by looking at the
present. You must close your eyes and imagine a new world. In this
new world, skepticism was not a sign of intelligence. It was a
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, count us among the sinners. We have been skeptical about
the valuations placed on most Internet companies. So have many
others. Recently the ranks of sinners have been joined by some
interesting thinkers from different ends of the investment
spectrum. Warren Buffett is a classic old-style value investor.
Anthony and Michael Perkins were founders of Red Herring, a
magazine that reports on the new economy from Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that both have come to the same conclusion _ that
Internet stocks are overvalued _ makes their critiques worth
listening to.
</P>
<P>
   In several recent speeches reprinted in Fortune magazine,
Buffett compares the rise of the Internet to two other
technological breakthroughs: the invention of the automobile and
the airplane. Both were hugely important to the world and both gave
birth to enormous industries.
</P>
<P>
   Both industries also have been hugely disappointing to
investors. Of the thousands of car and airline companies that have
emerged over the years, only a handful have provided handsome
returns. Buffett says the airline business has been so awful that
if he had been present at Kitty Hawk when Orville Wright took off
in 1903 he would have shot down the plane. ``Karl Marx couldn't
have done as much damage to capitalists as Orville did,'' Buffett
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett sums up his philosophy in one succinct and insightful
paragraph: ``The key to investing is not assessing how much an
industry is going to affect society or how much it will grow, but
rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company
and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or
services that have wide sustainable moats around them are the ones
that deliver rewards to investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Perkinses are fans of the Internet. They have no doubt it
will change the world. But like Buffett, they argue that great
technology does not lead to great investment results. If the title
of their book, ``The Internet Bubble,'' isn't enough of a clue to
their thinking, the two make it as plain as day in their open
letter to investors:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advice to Interent investors is simple: If you hold any of
these stocks, it's time to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Their logic would bring a smile to the face of a traditionalist
like Buffett. They make the assumption that to justify sky-high
valuations, Internet companies will have to grow rapidly for years
and eventually earn sizable profits.
</P>
<P>
   Using some back-of-the-envelope calculations about growth rates
and profit margins, they conclude that the 133 Internet companies
that went public between 1995 and the middle of 1999 would have to
boost their sales 80 percent a year for the next five years to
justify their stock price levels.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of achieving those targets are slim. In the five
years after its initial public offering, Microsoft's sales grew 52
percent a year; Dell Computer's revenue grew 66 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   How badly are Net stocks overvalued? The authors say that the
group as a whole could easily fall 50 percent before reaching fair
value. That amounts to a loss of $230 billion in market
capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers look even worse for retailer Amazon.com. As of June,
the company should have been worth about $4 billion, according to
the ``Internet Bubble'' methodology. At the time the stock had a
market cap of $17 billion; as of Monday Amazon was worth $24
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The New Thing,'' his Silicon Valley book, Michael Lewis
says that we have moved to a world in which ``the most appealing
companies became those in a state of pure possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, no one can stay in that pure state forever.
Eventually potential must translate into performance, which in
business, means profits. Investors may give the Internet companies
a little more time to show those profits, but they won't wait
forever.
</P>
<P>
   If those profits don't appear, look out below.

A KNOCKOUT SHOWING NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Boxing is the hurt business, and it's in some pain
today.
</P>
<P>
   A week before its latest last chance to redeem itself, the sport
was rocked by the 32-count indictment of International Boxing
Federation president Bob Lee and three of his cronies on charges of
selling ratings to the highest bidder. Only days earlier, a story
in the Miami Herald quoted several journeyman boxers who said they
took dives to advance the comeback of George Foreman and the career
of Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch. Although many in boxing were skeptical
of those charges because most of the fighters named would have gone
down whether paid or not, few insiders doubted the likelihood that
IBF title shots were for sale.
</P>
<P>
   These charges come near the end of a long year in which every
major boxing event seemed to disappoint. The Evander
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification fight in March
turned into a boring two-step that ended in a controversial draw
and launched federal and state investigations into the judging of
Eugenia Williams and the symbiotic relationship between judges and
promoters. It was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by September's god-awful affair between Oscar
De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad, a fight that saw two men earn $33
million while exhibiting all the passion of a couple of guys
flipping burgers for minimum wage. When De La Hoya didn't get the
victory, his promoter, Bob Arum, implied that rival promoter Don
King had more to do with it than Trinidad, but his own fighter's
lack of fire in the late rounds was more to blame than anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   In between came the incarceration of Mike Tyson not long after
he nearly caused a riot in his January comeback fight with Frans
Botha. Then came a disqualification in another Tyson comeback fight
in October when he cold-cocked Orlin Norris after the bell sounded
to end the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The night before that debacle, cult hero Prince Naseem Hamed
turned a featherweight unification fight in Detroit into an absurd
wrestling match with World Boxing Council champion Cesar Soto.
Hamed flipped Soto over his back onto the floor once and pushed him
down four times without knocking him down once.
</P>
<P>
   After all this comes Holyfield-Lewis II Saturday night. It is
not so much a fight for the ages as it is a fight for life. A fight
that could lift up a sport beaten down by the greedy hands of its
own practitioners. A fight that is carrying the hopes of boxing on
the broad shoulders of two combatants at a time when even a sport
in which hand-to-hand combat is the aim can't afford another hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is starving for an exciting fight,'' said Lewis, who
holds the WBC title and convinced many he should have been the
undisputed champion after his first meeting with Holyfield. ``I
plan to do my part. I'll do anything possible to make it so. I
imagine Evander is thinking the same way. It's important for us and
it's important for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   It's important because boxing continues to foul its own nest
with scandal, questionable decisions, and underwhelming
performances by its biggest stars. Had De La Hoya-Trinidad or
Lewis-Holyfield lived up to the hype, Saturday's fight would be of
far less significance, but with all of boxing's ills laid out
before the public, it is time for redemption, and there could be no
greater stage for that than a heavyweight unification fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tolerance for boxing is very low with the public right
now,'' said longtime promoter Dan Goossen. ``That's why you don't
find it on network television and it's why the pay-per-view market
is very small when the superstars aren't involved. For the past
five years, people have gotten away with things that would have had
them sitting with their dog Schottzie if they had owned a baseball
team, and there's a limit to what the public will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no time to waste. We need to reassure the fans we're
acting with integrity so when an official does blow a call it's
easily accepted. We need some great events without controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   A heavyweight unification fight always offers such a
possibility. There remains nothing like a meeting between two giant
gladiators, which is why the Thomas and Mack Center is nearly sold
out and why celebrities have bombarded King's office searching for
tickets. It is also why boxing people hope Saturday night will not
follow the year-long pattern of high expectations followed by low
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or for worse, this is now more important than just
a fight for the undisputed heavyweight title, and that is saying
something,'' said Seth Abraham, president of HBO Sports. ``That's
still one of the most important titles in sports but because of all
the problems this year, this fight has taken on a larger
significance. It's not the crusades. It's not the Christians vs.
the Muslims. But for the boxing industry, it's a very important
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last big fight of the century. It doesn't have to be
the Thrilla in Manila. If it can just be Bowe-Holyfield I, the echo
will be very positive. If, on the other hand, it's Holyfield-Lewis
I, the silence will be deafening. It's probably unfair, but these
two men are carrying more than their title belts into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing has had some very bad setbacks this year. They've
affected the fans' faith in the sport. That's why in all our
advertising we're not calling this a rematch or Holyfield-Lewis II.
I've spoken to all sides about that. We're not selling this as a
rematch. We don't want to remind people of March 13. We're selling
it as the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world, the
biggest night in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been stirring moments on smaller scales this year,
like the Micky Ward-Reggie Green donnybrook on ESPN2 and last
weekend's HBO ``Boxing After Dark'' knockout fest involving Derrick
Jefferson-Maurice Harris and Oleg Maskaev-Hasim Rahman, but the
sport's failure to deliver on several promised ``SuperFights of the
Millennium'' has hurt badly. Worse, boxing remains unable to create
a sense that everything is on the up-and-up or that the men in
power have learned from their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Saturday night is a crossroads not just for Lewis and
Holyfield but for the sport itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a second chance for both fighters and it's a remarkable
testament to our country that it's going on,'' said King, who is
promoting the match. ``This will bring vindication to one fighter
and it can uplift the sport if the result is looked upon without a
jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much is riding on this. The physical prowess of two men.
The rights and privileges of Americans. If any other country had a
fight so vilified for crookery and trickeration, it would never
have happened again. So this fight is more than a boxing match.
It's a victory for America.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be overstating the case. Let's just hope it's a
victory for boxing.

FRUSTRATION OF INJURY HAS ALLISON OFF HIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Jason Allison was working out in the offseason, he
formulated a plan. Unlike many hockey players who go into a year
with specific offensive goals but don't say what they are for fear
of failing to meet them, the Bruins center took the idea of
self-imposed pressure one step further.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about elevating his game to become one of the elite
players in the NHL. He wasn't content to be the team's top scorer
the past two years; he wanted to be one of the league's best
scorers.
</P>
<P>
   He took power-skating lessons, worked out hard in the gym, and
felt confident he was doing everything to prepare himself.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ankle injury that kept him out of training camp.
Then came an even more serious problem that Allison never saw
coming: a right forearm injury that has kept him out of the last
two games and was expected to sideline him for three weeks. Then
again, it's possible Allison might play Wednesday in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. Allison's problem, a combination of tendinitis in the
wrist and a torn muscle at the midpoint of the forearm, is a puzzle
with no definitive answers, a riddle with no concrete clues, a
mystery with no obvious resolutions. It's not an injury seen in
tennis or baseball or other arm-intensive sports. It's not an
injury seen much of anywhere, which is why it's so difficult to
figure out. So, Allison could be back very soon or he could be
sitting for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's close to playing,'' said Allison, who Monday did
more than just skate for the first time in a week _ or since being
told he'd have to sit out three weeks. ``It feels a lot better.
Whether they think it's good enough or not . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play, obviously. It's just the dilemma of how long
it's going to be. If it's something where if I take another week
off, is it going to be 100 percent. If it's not . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It's a conundrum. At the beginning of the year, Allison pushed
his arm too much, then backed off. He started feeling better, so he
started pushing again. The pain persisted the harder he pushed, and
now he's at the point where he's not supposed to be pushing at all.
No faceoffs in games, no real battling or excess shooting in
practice, and scheduled days off. That's a lot to handle for a
24-year-old in the prime of his career with big dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he's his own worst enemy. Now, he's going to have to
be his own jockey, pulling in the reins to slow himself down when
he needs it, telling the training staff just how badly it feels
rather than trying to play through the pain. It sounds a lot easier
than it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard,'' said Allison, who has 12 assists in 13
games. ``That's what happened last time. I felt good, we had big
games and were losing, and we had some big draws in our own end and
I thought I'd try it. I felt it a little bit. We'd have another
draw in our own end. We'd be up or in a tie and I'd take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended up hurting me and the team by doing that. I think
that's what they're worried about now, too. They don't want me to
be out too long. That's going to hurt the team, too, so we have to
come up with the best solution, if it's ready now or in a week or
two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison, by nature an optimist, said this setback hasn't altered
his season goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day there, when they told me to take off three
weeks, I was just sour,'' he said. ``I thought, `Again, here we
go.' Here was the year I was excited for and I don't have a goal
yet, too, and now I'm sitting out again. I just thought, `You know
what? I feel great on the ice. I feel great about everything this
year. Whatever happens, happens.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's me playing the way I did the last couple of games or
taking a couple of weeks off, I can take a couple of weeks off and
still have a great year. If I can come back in a week or two weeks
instead of three, then I'm going to want to do that. Again, I've
got to make sure I can play the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want to play for two weeks, then be forced to sit for
two. He firmly believes that's something he can control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I'm smarter, that won't happen,'' he said. ``I
think the worst-case scenario is I have to take a day or two (of
practice) off or a game or two off during the year. If you separate
your shoulder or tear this or pull that, it's six weeks or four
weeks, give or take. This isn't anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``A regular person, they'd probably cast it for six weeks and
then do therapy for another month after that. I obviously can't do
that. I can't even do that in the summer. I would've gotten better
if I'd have been smarter with it. That's why I'm optimistic. I
don't want to go through this all year.''
</P>
<P>
   So he spends an inordinate amount of time with the medical
staff, working to keep the swelling down, wearing a cortisone
patch, undergoing muscle stimulation, taking anti-inflammatory
medication, and crossing his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hitting it with everything,'' he said. ``And hoping.''
</P>
<P>
   When Allison returns, whether it's sooner or later, there won't
be any faceoffs. He'll have to recognize the warning signs and pull
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful but that's what I have to do,'' he said. ``But I
think if I do that, I don't have to sit out for four weeks. I have
to suck it up. Hopefully by Christmas, I can start taking draws
again.''
</P>
<P>
   As badly as he feels on the one hand, that's how great he feels,
too. A puzzle and contradiction, which sort of sums up his
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what is so frustrating: I feel like I'm skating good,''
he said. ``I've got a lot more energy and I'm in better shape and
stronger. I'm in a good place mentally, confidencewise. I've had
four or five games where I've felt good.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what is frustrating. It's feeling sore during a game
and a big faceoff comes up and you can't take it. That's stuff that
I relish. I want those responsibilities. The faceoff part isn't
going to come for a while but hopefully, I'll be good enough to
go.''

HOMOSEXUALS TO RALLY IN STATE CONSIDERING ANTI-GAY INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Gay and lesbian organizers will meet in
California this week to get a firsthand lesson in campaigning
against legislation and initiatives that seek to limit homosexual
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force's 12th annual Creating
Change conference will be held Wednesday through Sunday in Oakland
with some 2,200 delegates expected to attend. One of the chief
issues on the agenda is a California ballot initiative that would
bar same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Lobel, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based
organization, said the conference would give gays and lesbians
``the nourishment and energy to keep going'' amid efforts to block
homosexual marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition that will appear on the primary ballot in March
would bar marriages between gay and lesbian couples in California.
The measure is commonly referred to as the ``Knight initiative''
for the conservative state senator, William J. ``Pete'' Knight,
R-Palmdale, who sponsored the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-nine states still do not recognize gay, lesbian,
bisexual, transgender civil rights,'' Lobel said Monday.
``Twenty-eight states still do not have strong hate crimes laws.
And the struggle for recognition for our families and our committed
relationships remains arduous, as the anti-gay Knight initiative
teaches us.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference features 120 workshops, with special attention
this year to religion, family issues such as marriage and adoption,
the challenges of youth and aging, racism and health.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers will be the Rev. Mel White, the
fundamentalist minister who is fighting anti-gay bias in organized
religion, and Urvashi Vaid, former head of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said news coverage of the conference would allow them
to educate the public about the Knight initiative. Participants
will trained in organizing against the ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Knight initiative, task force spokesman David Elliot
said, ``The theme permeating this year's conference is the
importance of local organizing and that equality really does begin
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, state legislatures considered 541 gay-related bills,
more than ever before. Of the total, 309 were favorable to gays,
232 were not, and most did not pass, according to Elliot.
</P>
<P>
   California led the nation in passing laws sought by homosexuals
this year, including a ban on discrimination against them in jobs
and housing, establishment of a statewide domestic partners
registry, and a measure to reduce anti-gay harassment in schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Knight initiative had no trouble getting
enough signatures to make the March ballot. Thirty states so far
have passed such laws, anticipating possible court rulings from
Hawaii and Vermont legalizing gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Human Rights Campaign, the other big national gay
organization that raises huge sums for issues and candidates, the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force focuses on local organizing.

REPORTS ON BOOKS OF INTEREST TO THE TRAVELER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   ``When Joanna loved me,'' sings Tony Bennett, ``every town was
Paris.'' Such is the magic of the city that it has come to
symbolize all that is wondrous in a community.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a hard city for outsiders to get to really know, for
Paris can be intimidating as well as fascinating. And that's where
Mary Blume comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Blume, an American columnist for the International Herald
Tribune and a Paris resident for more than three decades, has
assembled a collection of her columns into ``A French Affair''
(Free Press, $24), with drawings by Ronald Searle. Here are the
people who make up the city: workers, artists, inventors,
expatriates, politicos, filmmakers, and just plain characters. She
covers everything from an elite cooking school to a soup kitchen,
and visits everywhere from the exclusive St. Germaine de Pres to
the raucous Montmarte. Here, for example, is her take on the Mona
Lisa:
</P>
<P>
   ``She can be found advertising everything from grapes to
condoms, parodying politicians from Mao to John Major, decorating
beaded curtains found in Vietnam and a cookie jar made in the USA.
. . . She is the most famous artwork in the world. The space
surrounding her bulletproof frame is the noisiest in the Louvre,
with people jostling as they might to see a celebrity, which she
is.''
</P>
<P>
   This detailed look is aimed at the Paris-ophile, and every
chapter might not appeal to someone with just a casual interest in
the city. But, once having visited, who can be just casually
interested in Paris? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Guidebooks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful way to see Paris is on foot. But there are so many
walks that it would be foolish to try to fit them into one volume.
``Around and About Paris'' by Thirza Vallois (Iliad Books, $19.95)
is divided into three volumes, with the recently reprinted Volume
One covering the first through seventh arrondissements (districts),
which the author's subtitle says brings you ``From the Dawn of Time
to the Eiffel Tower.'' (Volume 2, covering arrondissements 8 to 12,
takes you ``From the Guillotine to the Bastille Opera'' and Volume
3, covering arrondissements 13 to 20, deals with ``New Horizons:
Haussman's Annexation''). Each chapter begins with an overview of
the arrondissement; thus you learn that the first arrondissement
was the ``first to be settled by the Celtic tribe of the Parisi,
the early inhabitants of Paris.'' More important, though, you learn
where to go to find the sights, sounds, and smells of the city.
</P>
<P>

   ``Paris'' is but one of the volumes available in the
``Eyewitness Travel Guides,'' surely one of the most elegant series
of guidebooks ever published, with hundreds of color pictures (most
of them are tiny) sprinkled through the text, along with street
maps, cutaways and floor plans, and information on how to use local
currency, public transit, and telephones. (A good thing to know: A
telephone in Venice once swallowed my phone card when I inserted it
into the wrong slot.) New so-called millennium issues have been
published for several of the world's great cities, regions, and
countries. The books are from DK Publishing Inc., and prices
generally range from $19.95-$29.95.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Avant Guide: New York City'' (Empire Press, $19.95) is geared
to those who don't want to look like tourists (heaven forbid!). The
book does list hotels, restaurants, etc., but refrains from telling
readers to ``pack a rain poncho'' or ``wear comfortable shoes.''
Instead, it offers suggestions on what will appeal to the
cosmopolitan traveler. Editor in chief Dan Levine (a Manhattan
resident) and his staff don't shrink from expressing opinions.
Example: ``We hate theme restaurants. We despise their universally
mediocre food and detest their sub-par theater.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's one for the nervous traveler: ``The Worst-Case Scenario
Survival Handbook'' by Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht (Chronicle
Books, $14.95) delves into such topics as how to wrestle an
alligator (very carefully, I'd imagine), punch a shark (ditto),
break down a door, identify a bomb, or even land a plane. No
kidding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, because travel sites are multiplying daily on the
Internet, The Vacation Travel Mart's ``Worldwide, Webwide, Online
Travel Guide &AMP; Logbook'' (Britannica Travel Press, $12.95) can be
updated daily at www.vacmart.com. The spiral-bound 256-page book,
by Jacques Abitan and Jim Woodman, is designed for use beside a
computer and features top Web sites for destinations throughout the
world. There are areas for taking notes as well.

AN ITALIAN IGLOO? ONLY IN PUGLIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FASANO, Italy _ Hurrah: Truly some trulli have appeared!
</P>
<P>
   Can it be? ``Ma, si _ but, yes,'' Clerici, my friend from Como,
had promised. ``When you see these funny Italian igloo way down
south, you will know immediately that they are really and truly
trulli. Only in Puglia. And, truly, they can have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never go to see them myself. I avoid the deep south,''
he often says grandly. Clerici, a northerner, good naturedly
admits, ``We feel about our deep south the way you Bostonians used
to feel about Alabama and Mississippi. Maybe still do. We need a
civil war like you had. We would love them to secede, but no
chance. They live off our taxes. Too bad they don't have southern
fried chicken, grits, and cornbread. But I must concede their
pasta, olive oil, and wine are very good.''
</P>
<P>
   This southern extremity, Puglia, has been just fine with us.
Maybe I can persuade Clerici to do an Italian version of the
classic Phil Harris tune, ``That's What I Like About the South.''
And maybe not. To most Italians, north is north and south is south,
and never should the trulli meander.
</P>
<P>
   Trulli is the plural of trullo, a small round building with a
roof of carefully fitted-together limestone slabs that rise in a
cone to a top knot. Something like a rocky Dairy Queen. Peculiar to
the Murge, this dry, hilly sector of Puglia, the southeast heel of
the Italian boot, they are peculiar indeed. The name is said to
come from the Greek ``i halos,'' a circular building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old, very old. I don't know how old,'' says Antonio, a farmer
outside the village of Fasano, who uses the trullo amid his ancient
olive grove as a storehouse.
</P>
<P>
   A guidebook is uncertain, too, saying trulli date probably to
the 15th or 16th centuries as serfs' abodes. But Antonio says some
of his trees in the stonewalled grove are older, some of them 600
years old, and they look it. Gnarled, twisted, deformed _ yet still
producing ``olio superbo,'' he says _ they seem to have been
crossbred with wandering banyans. His goitered fig trees are
geriatric wonders, too, and he is pleased with his up-to-date
artichokes, fennel, and melons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to Alberobello to see many trulli,'' he suggests. ``It is
the trulli capital city.'' Truly.
</P>
<P>
   Quite different in style and status from Castel del Monte, a
stopover earlier in the day. Lording it over remote farmland, the
13th-century castle of a regal German invader, Holy Roman Emperor
Frederick II, sticks out like a suave thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight thumbs really,'' said my friend Aurelio, noting the
towers at each point of the octagonal stronghold of
butterscotch-hued brick. You might say a vacation home since
Frederick planned it as a country-place getaway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very homey. Just a simple, uh, fortified cottage. By an
emperor's standards anyway, I suppose,'' nodded fellow roamer, Ron
Sampson, as we entered an elegant entrance of ruby-flecked marble
to inspect the high, groin-vaulted interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merely eight rooms upstairs and eight down, and the fireplaces
aren't too grandiose,'' he said. ``Although you could live in any
of them. The private toilet in one of the towers is a nice feature,
probably the king's throne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural air-conditioning, too,'' said Aurelio, who felt a
20-degree drop in temperature within the thick stone walls and was
glad be outside, dealing with sunshine again, and on the road to
the trulli town, Alberobello.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of trulli appeared on the way, formerly one-room
peasant hovels but now spruced up, often enlarged as summerhouses.
But, be they ever so humble, did the builders and occupants chorus,
``I love you trulli''?
</P>
<P>
   However, we aren't prepared for the mob of trulli marching up
and down an Alberobello hillside called Rione Monti like a regiment
of coneheads in cream uniforms and gray helmets. Whitewashed walls
and slate roofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've cloned cones,'' says Sampson of this site for soaring
eyes. ``Talk about a housing development, medieval style. This is
it. Cookie-cutter condos.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the story goes, the trulli dwellers of Puglia, this
far-removed end of Italy, were fugitives from debts, justice, or
jail. Maybe they truly wanted a new start in life and built a new
kind of home from the slate found in the neighborhood. Whatever,
the locals eventually became respectable and the trulli deemed so
distinctive that in 1797 a zoning law stated that they couldn't be
torn down or replaced with an altered structure. It even decreed
that no other style would be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   That got watered down, of course, as greater Alberobello
expanded and modified the look while branching out architecturally.
Still, about 400 trulli remain in a historic district, the Trulli
Zone. Their pointy roofs are a tribute to laborers who layered the
slim stones to form narrowing circles that hold together without
mortar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they get tired and fall in sometimes,'' says a resident,
``but you know when it's going to happen. There are indications. A
certain sag and stirring. You get out and call a contractor.'' He
says no human domes have been damaged in his time by the roofs
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Six parallel cobbled lanes, limited to pedestrians, divide the
trulli zone that has become a cottage industry site. It is largely
occupied by commercial enterprises to feed visitors edibles and
satisfy their insatiable hunger for keepsakes from serious artists
as well as the usual peddlers of souvenir gewgaws.
</P>
<P>
   Trulli come in a variety of sizes and departures from the
pioneering single-roomers, surrendering outwardly to modernity only
with TV antennas and inwardly with plumbing. They can't do much to
fight claustrophobia, though.
</P>
<P>
   The church of St. Antonio, however, is large and triple-domed.
Some homes are multidomed, too, and several look like trulli
Siamese twins. One that would have inspired author Nathaniel
Hawthorne has enough domes to rival his House of Seven Gables in
Salem, Mass. Maybe he even saw it during his Italian sojourn in
1857.
</P>
<P>
   Are the inhabitants called trullinese? ``No, we're just Italians
proud of our unique houses,'' says a waiter in one of them,
expanded as the trattoria L'Aratro. ``No longer scoundrels like the
first settlers. Not much anyway,'' he says with a smile, putting a
very good mushroom risotto on the table.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk the trulli seem softer, rows of haystacks on their
slope. Walking down the lane toward the parking lot we encounter a
group of field-tripping grammar school kids in red baseball caps,
backpacks, and bored countenances, herded by a harried teacher, a
nun. ``Sister, liberate us!'' they seem to be saying. They are not
ancestor worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly they're paraphrasing Spiro Agnew's ``if you've seen one
ghetto, you've seen them all.'' As in, Sister, seeing one of the
trulli in this ghetto was plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Not for a true trulliophile, though.

   The anger boiled in a quiet cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   The anger boiled as the football world discovered Rod Shoate, an
All-American for Oklahoma on a national championship team in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The anger boiled in an even quieter cauldron when Shoate was
drafted by the Patriots and landed in that faraway and strange city
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The anger boiled even more when Shoate broke his leg making a
tackle against the Bengals in 1975 and then even more when he tore
up his knee in 1976. The only reason he had left the farm was to
play football. Everybody was better than he was, anyway, he always
thought. ``I was always looking over my shoulder for the next guy
to take my place even when I was healthy,'' he said. ``And now that
I couldn't move, I was so afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   So the anger boiled. More than a few of the Patriots used drugs,
said Shoate, so he tried them. This hadn't happened in Norman (``In
all my years at OU, I must have smoked all of three joints''), but
big sister Charlotte had been with him in Norman, protecting him
and warning him, going to parties with him ``where I'd sit in the
corner and I'd let Charlotte be my mouthpiece and do all my talking
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charlotte was nowhere near Foxborough, Mass., where things
spiraled downward horribly.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs and more drugs. Money going, going, gone. The need for
more drugs, the need for more money. But Shoate's source of money
was football, and after his Patriots career ended in 1981 and a
stint in the US Football League was over, he had to turn to other
means.
</P>
<P>
   Shoate held up convenience stores in Attleborough, Mass., and
Cumberland, R.I. Shoate shoplifted. Shoate stole. Shoate broke into
his wife's home when the two were estranged and stole money and
bonds. Shoate bought and sold drugs. Shoate finally entered the
tawdry world of homosexual prostitution and sold his body at the
old Greyhound bus station on St. James Avenue in Boston. Shoate was
homeless in Boston's Combat Zone. Shoate's life itself had become
combat.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruins star Derek Sanderson tried to help Shoate. For a
while, Shoate responded. Reggie White, the Green Bay Packers' star
defensive lineman, tried to help Shoate. Lee Roy and Dewey Selmon,
Shoate's teammates at Oklahoma, tried to help. Shoate's teammates
on the Patriots tried. Shoate's wife, Debbie, tried.
</P>
<P>
   Many tried.
</P>
<P>
   And failed.
</P>
<P>
   Always the anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of anger at the world,'' said Shoate. ``I also
learned I have an addictive personality. I also like to be
isolated. I guess all of them are connected as to what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet always he would return to the decision he had made, the
decision that changed his life. To leave Spiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when I most loved football?'' he said once. ``When
the kids from the other farms would get together in the field next
to my house. We played football with a little milk box. We'd
flatten it out, and that'd be our football.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoate, with no money, no home, no hope, then said, ``Any way I
could help my father in the fields, I would do that. I used to love
being on that tractor. I wished I'd never left the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cry came, ``Amen,'' from the Mt. Triumph Missionary Baptist
Church choir last month in Fort Coffee when the Rev. Kenneth Myers
shouted, ``Life is not a game!'' Whenever he repeated the theme of
his eulogy, the congregation would shout, ``Hallelujah, brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimbo Elrod, the former All-American defensive end at OU and
Kansas City Chief, was forced to stand, like many others. He leaned
against a wall for support as tears rolled down his cheeks. Barry
Switzer's flowers, up there behind Rev. Myers, seemed to droop.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Hoffman's head hung low. Gerald Blankenship thought again
and again of the greatest linebacker he had ever coached _ no, ever
seen. Terry Webb, another All-American, a guard who used to lead
the blocking for quarterback Steve Davis and running back Joe
Washington in that Oklahoma Wishbone offense, stood up in the
middle of the church and began, ``I'm Terry Webb, and I was Rod's
roommate in college . . .'' He could barely go on.
</P>
<P>
   The 1974 Oklahoma Sooners football team, best in the land for
that glorious year, had come full circle in a quarter-century, from
a time when the game was life to a little church in a little town
where they heard, ``Life is not a game!''
</P>
<P>
   So many people packed the church that there was no room for
Shoate, the Spiro Superman, himself. He was outside, no more than
20 yards from the church, lying near the field that he once had
helped landscape.
</P>
<P>
   He heard nothing. A large yellow backhoe was next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Life and death are very real in this small outpost of Oklahoma.
Hundreds came to the Mt. Triumph Church from near and far, and more
than a few of them were caught up in a traffic jam behind the
backhoe as it lumbered up the farm roads before turning at the
dusty dirt road into the Fort Coffee Cemetery. And began digging.
</P>
<P>
   And continued digging while the service went on for nearly two
hours. Shoate's brothers and sisters had put together a collage of
prayers and photos and memories, and from time to time those inside
the church would glance down and read the words:
</P>
<P>
   ``He enjoyed family but craved his solitude. He was fiercely
independent, although he tried to find where he fit. He was thrown
into the limelight because of his God-given talent, though he
desperately clung to familiarity and the security of a simple life.
To the end, he shied away from any fuss over him. To the end, he
maintained his solitude and quiet dignity . . . Our Rod's life was
a paradox that was puzzling, especially to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   When the service ended, hundreds left the church, led by Lula
and Levester, who walked the few yards over to the grave site for
the final public words to God. Then friends and family mingled and
told stories of the glory days at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Shoate had come back to Spiro within the last two years, had
lived with his parents for a while, but had taken an apartment
about 3 miles from the family farm. Those who saw him remarked how
thin he looked. ``More like a basketball player than a football
player,'' said one acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd drive by the farm,'' said neighnor Jeff Gist, ``and once
in a while I'd see Rod out back, puttering around. But I didn't see
him much. We'd talk, but Rod kept to himself, and I couldn't know
if Rod had made peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gist, who owns the ``Big Farm'' just up the road from the
Shoates' smaller farm, grew up with Shoate and was one of the
friends who'd kick around that flattened milk carton in pickup
football games.
</P>
<P>
   When Shoate would return home from Oklahoma for a visit, said
Gist, ``I can't tell how you much I idolized him, how every kid
idolized him, how all of us thought _ we're here in Spiro, mind you
_ that nobody could make it bigger than Rod had made it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, when Gist might come by to help
Levester on the farm, they would talk about Rod. Lula would lament
that she had not heard from her son in years, except maybe for a
call on Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yes,'' said Gist, ``I heard of the horror stories from
Boston. Or at least as much as Lula and Levester knew them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gist's wife was in the hospital this past summer, ``and I heard
that Rod was in the hospital, too,'' said Gist. ``He'd been in and
out of the hospital. I wanted to go see him and maybe talk to help
him find his peace, but I couldn't get in. He was off-limits. He'd
had these infections, and you couldn't get in to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Shoate's body was found in his apartment Oct. 4. His family
had last seen him three days earlier. Shoate was 41 years younger
than his father when he died. The medical examiner of LeFlore
County said Shoate had died of natural causes, pending the results
of blood tests, which would take several months.
</P>
<P>
   His casket was closed.

UNCOMMON APPLE PRESENTS POP WITH A BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, Fiona Apple, then 19, released ``Tidal,'' a
debut album that was as muddled and profound as a page ripped from
her journal. For all its precocious smolder and swaggering
loveliness, Apple's songs seemed stuck in a teenager's emotional
quagmire. Her new CD, out Tuesday (Nov. 9), sports a 90-word title
that actually is a page ripped from her journal _ written, for that
matter, on a not especially inspired day, and superimposed on
translucent red vellum over an image of a blissed-out Apple. Gazing
up toward the heavens. Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   Pay no attention to the smiling girl behind the bad poem. ``When
The Pawn . . .'' (Epic/Clean Slate) is a deep, fascinating, rich
work of art. The brazen fits of honesty, the flirtation with torch
music and jazz, the Beatles and heavy beats, the written word and
the sullen vocal; all of it merges under producer Jon Brion's
endlessly inventive watch into music that is as intensely realized
as it is intensely felt.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare thing, the surprising-sounding pop album. This one
is full of Brion's signature retro-sounding instruments and quirky
sounding samples; he played much of everything on it besides piano,
Apple's instrument. Synthesizers and chamberlins, Wurlitzer organs
and brush-stroked snare drums, crackles and strings, are cobbled
into patterns that bear little resemblance to a traditional rhythm
section. The sounds hang like lush, luminous ornaments around
Apple's voice, which comes out fierce and swinging on the first
single, ``Fast As You Can,'' smoky and tremulous on the languid ``I
Know.'' ``You can use my skin / To bury secrets in,'' she offers on
``I Know,'' and that pungent mix of intimacy and agony infuses the
entire collection.
</P>
<P>
   Apple truly is the antidote to pop's current starry-eyed
approach to romance; even love songs are occasion for painstaking
reflection and merciless appraisal. While her word play can falter
at times from the weight of its own aggressive poetry, her songs
move with genuinely fresh cadence and rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limp'' intersperses eerily simplistic, diverging piano scales,
something a small child would accidentally pick out, with
galloping, drum-and-horn-fed tirades. ``Paper Bag,'' a piano ditty,
owes equally to Kurt Weill and Paul McCartney. A quiet shuffle
takes on searing textures that collide with brash, theatrical chord
changes on ``Get Gone''; the escalating drama forces Apple to find
the harshness in her singing; and she lets the tones come out as
hard and shattered as her feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Tidal'' was challenging, ``When the Pawn . . .''
fulfills the promise of the challenge. Apple is _ to coin the
obvious but accurate phrase _ ripening. At 22, she's a formidable
art-pop songwriter and a captivating singer: a beautiful, uncommon
fruit, indeed.

SPAIN'S MAGICAL CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVILA, Spain _ Night comes late to the plains of central Spain
in midsummer, and the dark had only recently descended when my bus
rolled up to this famous walled city.
</P>
<P>
   With its lofty stone turrets looming above, the mile-long
medieval wall is a dramatic sight under any circumstance. My first
glimpse was made even more memorable by the nearly full moon rising
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bigger thrills of visiting Spain's walled cities is
the arrival. After traversing mile after mile of dry, yellow
fields, you come on castle walls that rise up before you suddenly,
almost magically, from the dusty plain.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, it was Segovia, whose majestic cathedral seemed to
float on the horizon. In the foreground, thousands of sunflowers
inclined their heads, as if in devotion, toward the house of
worship shimmering in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   If the first glimpse of fortress towns like Avila and Segovia is
the most exciting, it hardly exhausts their storybook appeal.
There's the narrow, crooked streets, the central plazas that are
both stately and intimate, the little restaurants with regional
specialties, and Spanish wine that is both good and cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The names, even those only vaguely familiar to the first-time
visitor, evoke a shiver of romance. Avila and Segovia, Toledo and
Salamanca. They come with a thousand years of history and the kind
of dramatic settings and monumental architecture that can capture
the imagination of even the most jaded tourist.
</P>
<P>
   From a practical standpoint, I found that visiting walled cities
outside Madrid can be an attractive summer alternative to the
capital city _ or Spain's sweltering south. Four of the five on my
list, including the less well known but surprisingly appealing
Burgos, are located north of Madrid, Toledo being the only
exception. Avila is cooled by its mountain location. Besides
offering a less oppressive summer climate, the walled towns seemed
less crowded with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   I used Madrid as my base. With no rental car and relying
exclusively on Spain's excellent intercity buses, I visited the
five walled cities in a week. None was more than a three-hour ride
from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In Avila, after arriving at 10 p.m., I walked to Hostal Meson
del Rastro, listed by my guidebook as budget accommodations but
with a nice location just inside the city wall. After climbing the
stairs from the lobby, adorned with antlers, the desk clerk showed
me to a modest second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
   When she threw open the double window to let in the cool evening
air, the slotted top of the castle wall was barely 6 feet outside
my room. If the year had been 1299 instead of 1999, and if it
weren't for the metal security bars, it would have been nothing to
step through the window with my crossbow and take up a position
against the attacking infidels.
</P>
<P>
   The walled cities vary in the visual appeal and extent of their
remaining fortified perimeters. But they have key features in
common. They were built on hills for defensive purposes and
frequently have rivers wrapping around the towns at their base.
While their continuing growth has contributed to sprawl around the
edges, the physical constraints on building within the elevated
walls have helped keep their cores intact.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fortifications trace back to Roman times, according
to my guidebooks. The Muslims, after invading from North Africa in
711, built many castles and mosques. Walled cities changed hands
repeatedly during the centuries-long struggle for dominance between
the Muslims and the Christians to the north.
</P>
<P>
   King Fernando and Queen Isabel, who in 1492 sent Christopher
Columbus on his voyage west and ordered the expulsion from Spain of
Jews who refused to convert to Christianity, had personal ties to
several of the walled cities. They spent summers in Avila, and
their only son, Prince Juan, is buried in its cathedral. So is
Tomas de Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor who sent thousands to
their deaths for being deemed on the wrong side of the religious
divide. Segovia was another favorite of Fernando and Isabel, whose
portraits are found with those of other Spanish monarchs in
Segovia's famous castle.
</P>
<P>
   The castle, so striking that Disney copied it in Anaheim,
Calif., is a fascinating and hugely popular attraction. But I had
almost as much fun visiting the Segovia home of a largely forgotten
Spanish poet, Antonio Machado. After seeing the home mentioned in
my guidebook, I stumbled on it almost by accident on my way to the
castle. The house, where Machado lived through the 1920s after
giving up a teaching post he hated in Madrid, is now a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Although Segovia is a delight to tourists and other visitors, it
does not appear to have provided an easy life for the poet. He
boarded in a cramped second-floor room that could only be reached
by passing through the room of another guest. His space heater
didn't work, according to the guide, and Machado joked he had to
open his window to get warm in the depth of winter.
</P>
<P>
   In Salamanca's main square, or Plaza Mayor, I sat down for lunch
at one of its many open-air restaurants and surveyed the scene.
This splendid public space, bounded on four sides by stone-faced
buildings with balconies, is considered one of Spain's finest
squares. It might suggest an idea or two to the planners struggling
to remake Boston's City Hall Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The square has no trees or grass, and the midday sun was hot.
But it's easy to duck through an archway into the shadows along the
perimeter, where the shops are largely out of view but spill
customers and life into the public space. I sat in the shade of an
umbrella put out the restaurant. Additional relief came in the form
of a couple of draft beers to wash down my steak, omelette, and
French fries.
</P>
<P>
   Later, tipped off by my guidebook, I wandered toward one corner
of the square. A bas relief of Franco joined those of other Spanish
leaders along the lower face of the perimeter buildings. The only
difference was that white paint had been splattered around the
representation of Franco, evidence of the continuing acrimony
surrounding his 36 years of absolute rule.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the more sleepy Avila, Salamanca was bustling with
activity. Much of it comes from the city's nearly eight-century-old
university _ the third oldest in Europe _ whose students include
large numbers of foreigners who come for its Spanish language
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, at only an hour from Madrid the closest of my five
destinations, was in the running 400 years ago to become Spain's
capital. Although it lost out to Madrid, the walled city is still
regarded as one of Spain's greatest treasures. Among other
attractions, its cathedral includes a collection of paintings by El
Greco, who lived in Toledo for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to get back to Madrid and visit the great Prado art museum
on my last afternoon in Spain, I did not spend enough time in
Toledo to do it justice. Wandering through its narrow, twisted
streets and not finding a vantage point from which to view the city
as a whole, I felt disoriented. And I did not find the time to peek
into the inner courtyards and other private spaces that my
guidebook said provide a lot of the city's charm.
</P>
<P>
   I was there long enough to tour the beautiful cathedral and look
over one of its biggest treasures, a 10-foot-tall gold and silver
religious artifact that is paraded through the streets on an annual
feast day. Toledo also prides itself for its steel blades. There
seemed to be a shop on every corner offering every kind of blade,
from two-fisted swords to pocket knives.
</P>
<P>
   Burgos, a former wool center three hours north of Madrid, does
not rank as highly on the tourist circuit as the others. Its site
is less dramatic and only part of its defensive wall remains. But
the thriving city of 100,000, Franco's headquarters during the
Civil War, has charm and is worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Its cathedral, undergoing a time-consuming restoration, is
Spain's third largest. Visitors to the ruined castle on a hill
overlooking the city can dine at a restaurant with a panoramic
view. After dark, the cathedral is bathed in floodlights.
</P>
<P>
   More so perhaps than the others, Burgos is an ordinary working
town. It has block after block of newish apartment buildings, with
more under construction. But up close, the city is charming and
approachable, with small squares, tree-shaded pedestrian malls, and
spiffy looking shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Thickets of construction cranes suggest the city is thriving.
Handicrafts and artworks were for sale at an open-air market along
the river during my brief visit. A museum in what's left of the old
wall featured an exhibit on El Cid, the 11th-century warrior and
Spanish hero who was born near Burgos and is buried in its
cathedral.

OFF-SEASON EUROPE A BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A colleague just booked a weekend in London. Three nights in a
superior hotel in Hyde Park, near great stores and museums, and air
fare cost $550 a person. I stayed in Boston for a weekend and the
hotel bill for two nights, parking, and a couple of breakfasts was
more than $600. It makes London look good at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Europe off season is a good deal. Name your city, and chances
are you can find a similar package for the same _ or lower _ cost.
And it gets even better as winter continues _ except, of course,
for the Christmas-New Year's Eve period.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot going on as well _ from theater and museum touring
to special events and shopping. Surprisingly, those are the same
reasons for going in season. You really don't go to Europe for the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   If you are interested in the millennium, the European Travel
Commission offers a free ``Countdown'' edition of ``Planning Your
Trip to Europe.'' For a copy, call 800-816-7530 or visit
www.visiteurope.com.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs down, buy as much of your European vacation before
leaving home. Packages that combine hotel, air fare, and other
items are the best buys. Ask also about discount travel cards
offered in many cities that cut the cost of transportation,
entrance fees, meals, and shopping. When shopping, ask about tax
refunds on the Value Added Tax goods. Travel agents are a good
source of information on packages and money-saving deals.

Live like a Parisian &QL;

1 and March 15 to those booking by Nov. 30. January is a good month
to visit as there are lots of sales, including clothing with
designer labels. Rentals begin at $80 for a studio and $350 for a
two-bedroom unit. For information, call the Chicago-based firm at
312-587-7707; to view photos, floor plans, and descriptions of the

<P>
   Security and personal safety are concerns of most travelers. And
these can be ensured with only a few precautions as the special
sections in the newest edition of ``The Travel Adviser'' show. The
pocket-sized book offers detailed information on European
countries, including holidays (some different from ours), using
telephones, taxes, travel tips, and business advice, as well as
advice from Jeff Beatty, the president of an international security
firm. For a copy, send $12 (includes postage and handling) to
International Media Communications, 1643 Beacon St., Newton, MA

<P>
   Thinking of traveling to China, Russia, or India to usher in the
millennium? The US State Department warns that these countries are
among those likely to experience disruptions caused by computers
fumbling the handoff to Year 2000. If you still plan to go and want
insurance coverage in the event your reservations are lost or your
trip is canceled, Consumer Reports Travel Letter notes that of six
companies offering travel insurance, only one had a Y2K specific
policy _ and that policy had enough restrictions to give the
newsletter pause about its worth. That report, along with 10 hot
spots for the off-season and other valuable travel advice, can be
found in the October issue of the newsletter. Subscriptions are $39
a year; single copies of back issues are $3. To subscribe, call

FOREIGN FLAVORS FOR ICE CREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's another reason to travel: to sample ice cream flavors
like roasted wattle seed and Caffrey's Irish Cream. Travel Holiday
reports that flavors like the following are found only overseas:
</P>
<P>
   --Ireland. Guinness, Whiskey Cream, and the aforementioned
Caffrey's Irish Cream. All pack an authentic wallop, the magazine
says.
</P>
<P>
   --Australia. Kakadu plum, roasted wattle seed, and wild Roselle
Flower. All are made from nuts found in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   --Thailand. Coconut ice cream. Sure that's available in the
United States, but not with kernels of corn or chunks of fragrant
jackfruit.
</P>
<P>
   --China. Many Chinese favor a less sweet concoction made from
partially hulled rice (something like the Rice Dream brand sold in
the United States). But how about authentic green-tea ice cream?
You'll find that only in America, says Travel Holiday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: In which city will you find Lester B. Pearson
Airport? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: In Kansas, the Arkansas River is pronounced ar-KAN-zas,
never AR-k'n-saw. (With thanks to Jim Dickeson of Acton, who is
from Kansas and should know.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful,
we must carry it with us or we find it not'' _ Ralph Waldo
Emerson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
They're everywhere! Starbucks has come to South Korea, opening its
first full-service shop in Seoul. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gizmos at sea: Now you can get your amazing gizmos and gadgets at
sea: Royal Caribbean Cruise Line has opened a Sharper Image store
on its Monarch of the Seas. This is the first seagoing outlet of
the electronics and gifts chain. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Traveling the Web: LastMinuteTravel.com now offers My Travel
Minder, an e-mail system that alerts customers to travel
opportunities that match their preferences for, among other
choices, point of departure, destination, types of activities, and
price range. . . . Grace Gard, 11, of Brookline was a weekly winner
in the Family Travel essay contest on Expedia.com, where her essay
was posted. . . . www.telegraphe.com is a Quebec City guide in
French and English, with information on theaters, museums,
galleries, restaurants and bars, lodging, sites, parks and gardens,
and events. . . . www.drugstore.com has a ``Solutions'' section
that offers tips for travelers, from combating allergies to
avoiding sunburn to packing your suitcase. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's fractured English lesson: The room service menu of the
Winter Palace in Luxor, Egypt, advises, ``A selection of drinks and
snakes are available in your Minibar.'' (With thanks to Peter and
Sherlyn Morrissette of Lyndonville, Vt.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mailbag: Arrggggh! In listing Las Vegas hotels that represent
various countries, we somehow moved Algiers across North Africa by
saying it represented Egypt. Algiers, of course, is in Algeria. We
thank Ralph Jones of West Tisbury and Betty Reid of Acton for
pointing out the blunder. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of mail: Whether writing or e-mailing, please include
your name and community. We received several interesting letters
last week without that information. &QL; 
 &QL; 
2,000 (years and dollars): For those who want to begin Year 2000
with an adventure, The Inn at Roberts Grove in Belize is offering a
seven-night, eight-day ``Two for $2,000'' Y2K package, available
Jan. 5-April 30. The 20-room luxury inn is in Placencia, on the
Caribbean coast, in an area offering many opportunities to see
exotic animals, birds, and fish. The package for two includes
round-trip domestic air fare from Belize City to Placencia; deluxe,
air-conditioned, beachside guest rooms; all meals except one dinner
and lunch; a river and rain forest excursion; a snorkeling trip to
Placencia's barrier reef, with a picnic on the inn's private isle;
airport transfers; and a complimentary cocktail. The inn is also
near a jaguar preserve and Mayan ruins. For more information, call
800-565-9757 or visit www.robertsgrove.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Toronto.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 FORT COFFEE, Okla.: ... was closed.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his first semester at Oklahoma, Shoate remembered, ``I got
all `U's' _ `unsatisfactory' in every course.'' As for football,
when spring practice began, ``I was on the sixth team.'' His
position coach came up to Shoate late in spring practice, though,
and told him he was on the first team now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the coach, `I don't want it,' '' Shoate said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, when Oklahoma opened the 1972 season against Utah
State, ``I was a sophomore and I started the first game of the
season,'' said Shoate. By season's end, Shoate was All-America, an
honor he would repeat the next two seasons _ only the second player
to be All-America three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``But self-esteem was a problem with me,'' Shoate said. ``I
didn't think I was any good. I had teammates who I could see were
better than I was. Every time I was out there on the field, I was
fighting for my life. I was afraid somebody better was going to
take my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wins, despite the honors, Shoate would go to
parties, head for the darkest corner, ``and people wouldn't even
know I was there.'' His friends would be happy that OU had just
whipped Texas or won the Cotton Bowl, but ``my friends were more
happy for me than I was. It wasn't a big thing for me; I'd have
been happy to be back on the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final year of college, Shoate was invited to the Senior
Bowl, where he got a glimpse of players such as Walter Payton, Fred
Dean, and Robert Brazile and thought his usual thoughts: ``Can I
play with these guys? Do I belong here?''
</P>
<P>
   When the National Football League draft came, ``I was sitting
around, listening to the radio,'' said Shoate. ``For some reason, I
thought they drafted only to the second round, and I didn't think I
was going to be drafted. But the phone rang and it was Coach
Fairbanks. He said, `Pardner, we just drafted you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks was coaching the Patriots by then, and he summoned
Shoate to Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farthest north I'd ever been was New York, and that was
only once,'' said Shoate. ``I remember I looked at my watch when
the plane touched down and it was 12:01. It was January, and you
know it was snowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm in Spiro seemed very far away.
</P>
<P>
   The usual doubts surfaced (``I never thought I could play pro
football''), but Shoate soon felt ``right at home,'' thanks in part
to veteran linebacker George Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Webster taught me more about the game of football than
any coach ever did,'' said Shoate. ``In my mind, I don't think
there ever has been a linebacker better. He'd say to me, `Stop
trying to outrun everybody and just step back and read the play.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Shoate vividly recalled one conversation with Webster, who had
nicknamed him ``Youngblood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George said to me, `Youngblood, you know why they got you
here?' and I said, `To play football.' And he said to me,
`Youngblood, you're wrong; the only reason you're here is to take
my job from me.' And then he said, `Youngblood, you're never going
to play linebacker as well as I did, but I'm still going to try and
teach you all I know about being a linebacker.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was such a conflicted time. Shoate looked over his shoulder
every day ``to see if there was a new guy in the locker room with a
linebacker's number to take my job from me.'' But playing with such
an intelligent group of linebackers such as Webster and Sam Hunt
was a joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams would have to call timeouts,'' said Shoate. ``They'd
come out of the huddle and Sam Hunt would be calling out their
plays. They'd say, `Sam, stay out of our damn playbook.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I cherish that time with those guys. I had such fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shoate broke a leg when he leg-whipped a Bengal in his
fourth professional game and later busted a knee. Eventually, his
body was no longer young and fresh. Speed, not size, was his
calling card, and his speed was being slowed by injury.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Is this game for me?' I thought. `I can't do it, I just
can't do it,' '' recalled Shoate. ``I thought about another career.
I remember that stinking thinking, always thinking that stinking
thinking: `I'm not that good.' By my third year, I was thinking,
`What's going to happen to me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   By his fourth year, ``I was never at ease. In training camp, I'd
see a lot of talent coming in. During the season, I was looking
over my shoulder every day,'' Shoate remembered.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he had begun taking drugs, and the spiral that would
continue out of control was under way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Levester had seen a glimmer of hope in the early '90s. He knew
how Rod loved to drive the tractor, and he offered his son a chance
to return to the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a few head of cattle, and I thought it might give
him roots,'' said Levester. ``But Rod said to me, `I'm going to
sell those cattle.' Then I said, `At least let me buy them from
you. I'll give you what they'd give you on the market for them.' So
I gave Rod the $800 he would have gotten if he he'd sold those
cattle outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoate told his father he was going to use the money to fly back
to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `I'll help you, son,' '' said Levester. ``It was
then that I bought his plane tickhim to get back to
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The father's heart was heavy as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boy's just a farm boy,'' he said. ``But it was those drugs
. . . He was into those drugs even before he was done playing
football. Yup, he was in drugs when he was with those Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Charlotte could not rescue her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod and Charlotte were very close, Rod and my baby daughter
were,'' said Lula. ``And Charlotte tried so hard to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson, the former Bruin and once a substance abuser himself,
thought there was a chance five years ago. Shoate had agreed to be
treated at a mental health center in Cambridge, but group therapy
was not working. Sanderson was called in as a last resort by the
staff to see if he could help. This would be former athlete to
former athlete, drug abuser to drug abuser, addictive personality
to addictive personality. Kindred spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Progress was made for months, but once again, Shoate turned his
back on help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried,'' said Sanderson, shaking his head sadly.
</P>
<P>
   The most persistent attempts to help Shoate were made by his
former wife, Debbie, a psychologist. Despite untold frustration and
more than a few horror stories, Debbie kept trying to rescue the
man who had been the love of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Rock bottom had come in March 1987, when Shoate held up two
convenience stores in one day. Police captured him that day after
he had lain partially submerged in the freezing Blackstone River
for nearly half an hour. Shoate was sentenced to 10 years
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie had noticed problems long before this, of course. The
true frustration for years was Shoate's drug and alcohol use.
Fights and separations piled one upon the other. But Shoate, when
desperate and tired of the streets, always would contact Debbie.
Trained to help, she continued to try.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst times came in 1994, when Shoate had promised to
mend his ways and the Patriots were planning to honor many of their
best players from earlier years. The Packers were coming to
Foxborough, and Shoate had been asked to attend the game and be
honored.
</P>
<P>
   He had wavered about attending, Debbie recalled, and as Sunday
drew near, she grew more concerned. Then she realized Reggie White
played for the Packers, and Shoate and White had been teammates 10
years earlier in the USFL. She called White and asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   White, a minister, promised he would meet with Shoate when the
Packers came to New England and would minister to the troubled
soul. But Shoate didn't come to the game.
</P>
<P>
   He went back to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In time, the prodigal son returned to Oklahoma. In time, his
body wasted away. In time, he died.
</P>
<P>
   The calling hours for Shoate's wake ended at 9 p.m. at the
Mallory Funeral Home, near the one and only traffic light in Spiro.
</P>
<P>
   Around 9, an assistant in the funeral home approached. She said
she was a high school classmate of Shoate's, that he was always so
humble and modest, even though the town fathers had strung a banner
across the main street that had Shoate's name and Wayne Hoffman's
name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a good guy,'' she said. ``It's so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral home closed. The next afternoon, a brilliant, sunny,
warm afternoon, Shoate's casket was carried out to the Fort Coffee
Cemetery. When mourners told their stories, hints hung in the air
about why Shoate found it so hard to return to the one place he
never wanted to leave. So many great football players had come from
one little area of Oklahoma, yes, but when football was done for
them, Steve Davis became a successful businessman, Wayne Hoffman
had a nursing home business, the Selmon brothers were selling
barbecue sauce.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 in the afternoon, all the mourners had left and only
Shoate's casket and the big yellow backhoe were left. The backhoe
finished its work.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Shoate was buried.
</P>
<P>
   And his grave is no more than a few yards _ a few yards that
Shoate could have covered by drop-kicking that flattened milk
carton that once was his football _ from the backyard of the
farmhouse he never wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Shoate was home. And finally at peace.

REINVENTING THE NERD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. -- We have become a state of absent-minded nerds
with pocket protectors and bad haircuts, people with advanced
degrees from MIT and Stanford whose idea of social grace is
flawlessly ordering Chicken McNuggets at a McDonald's drive-thru.
</P>
<P>
   We have become a state of engineers, filthy, dirty obscenely
rich engineers.
</P>
<P>
   You know about engineers. The joke goes that four of them get
stuck in a broken car. The electrical engineer says it must be
faulty wiring. The mechanical engineer says the pistons must have
seized. The chemical engineer says it's got to be bad fuel. The
computer engineer says, ``Let's all just get out and get back in
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers see an eagle soaring over a forest and wonder aloud
about the composition of the soil. They think of great literature
as the operating manual to Lotus Notes. They giggle so hard at the
idea that pie is something you eat, not calculate, that Dr.
Peppercomes out their noses.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes a gentleman named Bernard Gordon to try to change
all that.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is himself an engineer, a modern-day inventor in the
tradition of Thomas Edison and Benjamin Franklin, the creator 40
years ago of a device that converts analog signals into computer
language codes. He has since become the fabulously wealthy founder
and chief executive of a high-tech company here called Analogic,
the dean of that street of dreams known as Route 128.
</P>
<P>
   He is distinctly old school. He squints when he talks, shines
his own shoes every morning. He refers often to his days as a Naval
officer fighting in the war, ``the real war,'' as he calls it,
World War II. He takes great pride in bringing immigrants into his
company ranks, men and women whose hardscrabble backgrounds propel
them toward the uniquely American goal of invention.
</P>
<P>
   And herein, some news: Disgusted with the current state of
engineering, Gordon has pledged to give Tufts University in Medford
$20 million to enhance and restructure its programs.
</P>
<P>
   The figure is in itself stunning, especially to a relatively
small school such as Tufts, which generally only reads about such
eight-figure contributions when they are made to Harvard. It is
twice the size of any such gift ever given to Tufts by an
individual. It is even more stunning when you consider that Gordon
graduated from MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still modestly endowed,'' Tufts President John DiBaggio
says. ``Gifts of this magnitude are of extraordinary importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon explains his point. He's sick of engineers who don't
build entire things anymore, but concentrate on fragments. He's
tired of engineers who can't communicate their ideas, who can
barely carry on a conversation, who write as if English is a
foreign language. He's frustrated with engineers who aren't
leaders, who stand apart from the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engineering schools are giving people a limited education in
the fundamentals,'' he was saying last week as he reclined in a
leather swivel chair in his office. ``They encourage students to
sit at a computer and get all the answers to life, but that isn't
the way it works. You need an understanding of how the world
operates, and how people think.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to a poster on his wall of a mobile CAT scan and says
with pride, ``Every day, that saves people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon walks around his massive complex with pride, poking
through the engineering laboratories, stopping at the CAT scans
being built, bragging about a high-powered bomb scanner that will
be shipped soon to the Rome airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read an article that said MIT people have a flaw _ they
can't relate to other people, and that is to some extent true,''
Gordon says. ``It's not true of Tufts graduates. They can talk,
they can relate to people, they get a broader education.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes Tufts, with a strong liberal arts bent, is the place
to launch the transformation he envisions. A telling story: When he
attended officer training on the Tufts campus during the war, the
college president walked past him and greeted him by name though
the two had never met.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an atmosphere there that brings out the pleasantness,
the collegiality,'' he says. ``It sets it apart from the other
factories in the area. This is tuition for making a gentleman out
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gordon can now make gentlemen and women in a profession
so notoriously disconnected from the rhythms of everyday life is
probably a harder goal. If he succeeds, what could possibly be
next? A campaign to make news reporters be nice?

<P>
   `Lizzie A. Borden is Acquitted,'' proclaimed a Globe headline in
1893, and present-tense headlines have been the rule in the century
since, from ``Red Sox Win Opener'' in 1929 to ``Nixon fires Cox''
in 1973 to last week's ``217 on EgyptAir jet die.''
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper usage, the present-tense headline implies a certain
time frame: ``Here's what's happened, or been revealed, since our
last edition'' it tries to say. Sometimes a story demands a past or
future tense _ ``White House Forgave Drug Use,'' ``Infectious
diseases will feed on complacency'' _ but when a present-tense
headline can be used, with its this-just-in immediacy, it's the
preferred option.
</P>
<P>
   But what works in print doesn't always translate to TV and
radio, judging by complaints from some readers. Jean Forster of
Danvers wrote to complain of newscasters who say ``A 2-year-old boy
dies when he falls out of a window.'' ``He died; he fell; it's PAST
TENSE,'' she insists. Radio listener Jack Ubersax of Wilbraham
disapproves of both NPR's Carl Kassel, caught saying ``President
Clinton goes to the hill'' to mean ``will go,'' and Rush Limbaugh,
guilty of ``I am sitting in front of the television and I see . . .
.'' For Dana Whittemore of Wakefield, the sore spot is ``We're back
in 60 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please tell me it's just a gimmick,'' begs Forster.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's just a gimmick. We journalists want everything to sound
as if it's hot off the griddle, happening as we speak, before your
very eyes. Your friend is trying for the same effect when she tells
you about her encounter with the traffic cop: ``So he says to me,
`Did you see the sign back there?' and I say, `No, what sign?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a gimmick with a name and a pedigree. It's called the
historic (or historical) present, and its literary uses range from
classical Greek literature to John Updike's ``Rabbit, Run,''
written in the present tense.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who turn off the TV when they hear those
``screamer'' headlines probably use the idiom in daily life. When
other clues make the time clear, English allows us to use present
tense instead of the bulkier future: ``I can't come to your party _
I'm in Italy that week'' is perfectly proper, even if the date is
months in the future. ``She starts work tomorrow,'' we say, and ``I
hear you're leaving soon,'' even though you heard in the past and
he's leaving in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But a present-tense narrative can be tricky to sustain over any
length; it demands some verb-tense dance steps that daily news
media probably shouldn't be messing with.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmick isn't right or wrong, though _ it's just a
convention, like the fork on the left or the greeting ``Hey.''
You're free to set the table as you like, and greet colleagues with
``Good morning,'' but if you don't like hearing ``We're back in two
minutes,'' your only recourse is to switch off the offender.
Wouldn't you rather be reading the newspaper, anyway?

   The air was so hot, so dusty when Laura Langley arrived in Niger
in August 1998 that grains of the Sahel Desert lodged under her
fingernails. On her way to the dormitory where she'd live for four
months, the dust on the bus window did not obscure her view of
camels and goats and beggars or her exhilaration that Africa,
literally and not, would get under her skin.
</P>
<P>
   It was hot, too, last February when Meredith Brown, on her way
to five months in Australia, went bungee jumping in the mountains
of New Zealand, plunging 340 feet into a canyon, feeling she was
``falling forever'' at the far end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Langley, 21, a senior at Boston University, and
Brown, 21, a senior at Boston College, began their junior years
abroad. Not quite like parlez vous-ing francais at some sidewalk
cafe in Paris, is it?
</P>
<P>
   In a convergence of globalization and adventure travel, overseas
study is changing. Not only are a record number of undergraduates
tucking passports in their book bags, they're also studying in a
wider variety of places. And they're spending less time away as the
semester, summer, and winter break abroad replace the academic year
overseas that once was the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is still the destination of choice for almost two-thirds
of undergraduates who study abroad, but that's down from 80 percent
in 1985-86, according to the New York-based Institute of
International Education. The number of Americans studying abroad
has more than doubled in that time, from 48,000 to more than
100,000. Although only 5 percent of undergraduates in four-year
institutions study overseas before graduation, some private
colleges now send at least a quarter of their students abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Study abroad was once something done by language majors
putting the finishing touches on their language studies,'' says
William Hoffa, of Academic Consultants International in Amherst.
``Today study abroad is done across the curriculum. If engineering
students can study abroad and architecture students can study
abroad, with opportunity come numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shrinking global village is a cliche, but it happens to be
true,'' says William Cotter, president of Maine's Colby College,
where 63 percent of students study abroad before graduation, up
from 42 percent in 1989. ``You must be internationally
sophisticated if you're going to be prepared for the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia, one of the decade's hot spots (think English-speaking
and exotic), expects 6,000 American students this year, up from
2,000 in 1996-97. Now comes a ``Study in Australia 2000'' campaign
to coincide with next year's Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends were going to Europe. I didn't want to be left
out of anything,'' says Brown, a finance major from California who
spent a semester at Murdoch University in Perth. ``But I had this
desire to go to Australia, `the land down under.' It would be my
time, and I could make of it what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came down to it, I thought England would be more
boring than Australia,'' says Brown's BC classmate, Matthew Woods,
21, a communications major from Colorado who spent last spring at
the University of Melbourne. ``I just knew there were a lot of fun
things down there. The Great Barrier Reef. Beautiful sights and
hiking and camping and stuff. Everyone said the people are really
friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Also moving up in popularity is Latin America (think high school
Spanish). One of every seven students going overseas heads to Latin
America, up from one of every 14 in 1985-86.
</P>
<P>
   Langley's roommate and BU classmate, Sariel Ende, 22, an
international relations major from North Carolina, is back from a
semester in Quito, Ecuador, where she studied in Spanish at the
University of San Francisco and lived with an Ecuadoran family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spain isn't that intriguing to me,'' she says. ``Ecuador is
completely different. I loved that it's a dancing culture. I loved
the music. Everybody is more relaxed. I absolutely loved the
Spanish. I liked not being in America. It was just fun to be
somewhere where every day is an adventure and you learn something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter of BU undergraduates now study abroad before
earning their diploma, up from 10 percent in 1990-91, and the
university has its own programs in 16 cities in 14 countries on
five continents. One fifth of those who go abroad study outside
Europe, up from less than 5 percent in 1990-91, and a majority are
placed in internships as part of their overseas experience.
</P>
<P>
   At BC, a third of the junior class is studying abroad this
academic year, up from 10 percent in 1993. Add the students who
study overseas during the summer or intersession, and BC expects
close to half its student body will have studied abroad by
graduation. At Wellesley College, 40 percent of students study
abroad before commencement, up from a quarter in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   At Tufts University, the number of students going abroad hasn't
changed much in the past decade _ 420 in 1988-89 and 441 in 1998-99
_ but the geography has. Two-fifths of Tufts students who went
abroad last year did not go to Europe, compared with one-fifth in
1988-89. At Northeastern University, the business school five years
ago launched an undergraduate major in international business that
requires a semester abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts in Amherst has programs for
engineering students in Germany and science majors in India, but
the proportion of students who study abroad for at least a semester
before graduating _ 8 percent _ is lower than at many private
colleges. ``There's a great divide between what is possible in the
best of private and the best of public institutions. That is
largely a product of money,'' says Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   This disparity is one reason Allan Goodman, president of the
Institute of International Education, sees an American collegiate
system that has barely tapped the potential of overseas study,
particularly at a time when it's increasingly possible to study in
English in non-English speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should make sure all our college-bound students, whether
they go to elite colleges or community colleges, know it's
desirable if they take a semester or more to study abroad,'' he
says. ``We tend to gravitate toward the European and the
English-speaking. Their minds need to be open to the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods came back from Australia energized from SCUBA diving at
the Great Barrier Reef, viewing aboriginal cave paintings in Kakadu
National Park, and playing Australian football, which makes ``you
feel like I'm really immersing myself in the culture.'' Did the
experience change him? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were definitely cultural differences, but it wasn't that
big of a culture shock. There were many things that were familiar.
The products. The people spoke English. They love American
culture,'' he says. ``As for profound discovery of myself, I know
who I am and I've known for a while. That's not why I went. I went
to have a new experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown went to Australia with a list of personal goals. ``To
travel. To have fun,'' she says. ``Also to relax and de-stress.
They're very laid-back people, and I wanted to absorb that.'' She
came back with two albums full of photographs, an aboriginal
painted canvas to display on her dresser _ and her goals met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more relaxed,'' she says. ``I don't work as much. I don't
worry as much. People are shocked when they see me.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-bedroom apartment Langley shares in Brookline, Mass. is
decidedly post-junior year abroad. There are African drums in
Langley's room, and the book ``London'' on the living room coffee
table is a gift from the London law firm where she interned last
spring. The cereal box adorning the kitchen wall spells ``Corn
Flakes'' in Hebrew, courtesy of Dena Gottesman's spring semester in
Haifa. The batik hanging in the living room is courtesy of Kavita
Bhandary's spring semester in Niger. The Latin music is courtesy of
Ende's Ecuador experience.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly rent of $2,800, Langley points out, compares with an
annual per capita income in Niger of $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niger is an absolutely amazing place. Where do I begin?'' she
says. ``How caring and giving the people are when they have
nothing. They'll give you their last bowl of rice before they feed
their children. It's a compliment to fall asleep in somebody's
house because it shows you're comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I'm back the more I realize it changed me,'' she
says. ``You have this big life experience, and to see what some
people get caught up in is very, very frustrating. Every day you
live affects you in some way. In Niger, every day was intense.''

MAKING THE PRESIDENTIAL GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The buzz is that George W. Bush isn't the sharpest
knife in the drawer. That his grades at Yale were mediocre. That he
can't pass a pop quiz naming the leaders of Chechnya, India,
Pakistan, and Taiwan. That he doesn't know Slovenia from Slovakia,
and that he can't tell a Greek from a ``Grecian.''
</P>
<P>
   The grades are great grist for the late-night comics. And the
quiz indicated that Bush may be vulnerable in a foreign-policy
debate. But opponents who try to exploit the issue of braininess
should beware: Americans like their presidents smart, but not so
intellectual that they can't reach down from their ivory tower.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, this political season offers them quite a choice:
Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley come off as a studious, cerebral
pair, the dutiful students who retain to this day a passion for
policy detail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across the political campus are Bush and John McCain,
the two leading Republicans, who admit that in college they often
walked right by the library to find the best fraternity party or
touch football game, or girls who wanted to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   So what will it be, America? A wonk or a gentleman's C?
</P>
<P>
   That has been a complex question for voters through the years,
and with reason: There is no clear correlation, in presidential
politics as in corporate life, between good study habits and
leadership success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overachievers don't do very well in the White House,'' said
Dean Keith Simonton, a psychology professor at the University of
California at Davis who wrote a book about the formation of
presidential prowess. ``Remember how annoying Jimmy Carter was,
always preaching and acting smarter than everybody else?''
</P>
<P>
   This year's crop of presidential postulants seems to remember.
Some of them, in fact, seem to be appealing directly to an
anti-intellectual strain that political scientists have long
identified in the American electorate. McCain frequently jokes
about his fifth-from-the-bottom finish at the US Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore, in going back to his roots, some days seems to act
more like a Tennessee hayseed than a Harvard man. And Bradley says
his pro basketball career was more life-shaping than was the
Princeton pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bush, who certainly ranks in the Ivy League elite,
with his degrees from Yale and the Harvard Business School, but who
also has asserted that he was put off at both places by
``intellectual arrogance.'' At Yale, Bush passed every subject, but
he has made no secret of the fact that he frequently put football,
baseball, and his fraternity ahead of academics.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the New Yorker magazine published what it said was
Bush's Yale transcript. He had highs of ``88'' in philosophy and
anthropology, a low of ``69'' in astronomy, and many mid-70s scores
in between.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokesman, Scott McClellan, said that the New
Yorker ``stole'' the report, but then discounted it as
``irrelevant'' to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unimpressive academic record,'' said Alan Lichtman, a
presidential historian at American University. ``If it shows that
Bush is intellectually incapable of doing any better, then I'm not
sure he is the kind of person I want in the Oval Office. If it
indicates he was simply interested in other things at college, then
the grades really don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Bennis, a business professor at the University of
Southern California, has spent 20 years studying what makes top
corporate leaders tick, and he is sure it is not their grade-point
average. ``Unless you are a moron, there is zero correlation
between grades or IQ and success in life,'' Bennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto on SAT scores. Bush's, according to the New Yorker, were
in a respectable but not spectacular range: 566 on the verbal
score, and 640 for math, out of a possible 800 in each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SAT is a remarkable judge of how well a student will
perform in college, but nothing beyond that,'' said Gaston
Caperton, the president of the College Board, which conducts the
SATs. Caperton, a former two-term governor of West Virginia, says
he is a good example of how grades don't make the man. He became a
successful politician despite his dyslexia, a reading disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skills that really help you in politics are having a huge
amount of energy and knowing how to get along with people,''
Caperton said.
</P>
<P>
   Academic achievement is not totally irrelevant, since it can be
a measure of focus, ambition, and discipline. But taking Bradley as
an example, Bennis said his success as a politician may have more
to do with the qualities that made him a great basketball star _
his timing, his intensity, his drive _ than with his Rhodes Scholar
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who graduated with honors from Harvard, may not derive
great political benefit from what voters perceive as his superior
intellect. In a recent debate, Gore said his biggest mistake was
saying he invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates who come off as some awe-inspiring Einstein will be
at a disadvantage if voters think they are too brilliant to work
with the masses,'' Simonton said. Gore may alienate people by
seeming so smart on issues like technology and science that
confound average Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Academic achievement has not necessarily resulted in popular
presidencies _ Carter's (Naval Academy) and Woodrow Wilson's
(Princeton, Johns Hopkins) spring to mind. Some of the nation's
favorite presidents, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt despite
his degrees from Harvard and Columbia, Ronald Reagan , and Harry S.
Truman, seemed to show that scholarship isn't required for
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar, yet he played up his
good-old-boy background in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who commanded the Allied
invasion of Europe in World War II, was no dummy, but his stump
rhetoric was deliberately homespun. He sometimes spoke in a
deliberately inarticulate way to confuse critics and make himself a
more appealing candidate. And for all his intellectual modesty,
Eisenhower certainly had no difficulty in twice trouncing Adlai
Stevenson, the self-consciously cerebral Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while campaigning, Stevenson was flattered by a woman who
had told him he would get the vote of every thinking person. ``But
madam,'' Stevenson replied, ``I need a majority to win.''
</P>
<P>
   History also shows that presidents can get into big trouble when
they surround themselves with really smart people _ the ``best and
the brightest'' are sometimes blinded by their own intellectual
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, who seemed to have an intellectual
inferiority complex, leaned on the corps of advisers he had
inherited from the Kennedy administration _ men like Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara _ with disastrous results. Reagan put his
national security adviser, John Poindexter, first in his class at
the Naval Academy, in charge of the Iran-Contra arms sale episode.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was in the same Annapolis class, but at the bottom. He
writes in his memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' that two things
brought his class rank down: terrible grades in math and science,
and very bad behavior. ``John wasn't intellectually sloppy,'' said
Frank Gamboa, who roomed with him at the academy, ``but he
deliberately did not try to excel.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's story, however, did not end at Annapolis, but continued
to Vietnam and into a Hanoi prisoner of war camp. He came back as a
hero, proving himself and rising above his undistinguished academic
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are looking, above all, at authenticity because they
are fed up with handlers, pollsters, focus groups, and politics as
performance art,'' said Richard Norton Smith, director of the
Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``There is something
refreshing about candidates who seem real, don't make exaggerated
claims, and seem perfectly comfortable in their own skin.''

DIRTY TACTICS BY SOME UTILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR;  _ Explaining a complex but crucial environmental
point with customary patience, Carol Browner urged me to consider
an old car.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, suggested the head of the Environmental Protection
Agency, that you change the oil regularly, rotate the tires, get
new oil filters and spark plugs as recommended, maybe even add a CD
player. You're operating and maintaining the vehicle, right? Now,
imagine that you have the engine rebuilt, taking you from four to
eight cylinders. Hardly the same old heap, is it?
</P>
<P>
   In Browner's metaphor, this is what power plants that burn coal
have been doing, except that where their acid rain-causing,
health-threatening pollution is concerned, there is a serious
federal law involved.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, after two years of an ongoing investigation, the
EPA and the Justice Department filed seven lawsuits charging that
17 power plants in the Midwest and South have been masking major
changes in their facilities as routine maintenance to avoid the
clear intent of the Clean Air Act. For good measure, the EPA
slapped an administrative order on the Tennessee Valley Authority
affecting seven of the federal agency's generating facilities.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Microsoft-sized deal. Instead of anti-trust, though,
what's involved here are violations of trust.
</P>
<P>
   As Browner explained, the original Clean Air Act of 1970
contained a sensible grandfather clause regarding coal-fired power
plants, based on the assumption that time would gradually lead to
their replacement by new, much cleaner technologies. Accordingly,
these older facilities were exempt from the more exacting standards
on new plants as long as they stayed the same. The law is explicit
about what that meant. The companies could perform normal
maintenance but they could not make changes that altered their
basic nature _ like raising the generating capcity, or making
possible more coal-burning that lengthened the plant's life span
unless they got special permits and added the best available
pollution-control equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's investigation charges that the companies made changes
to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars of bigtime
``improvements'' that lengthen their life and increase pollution,
none of them accompanied by permit applications, much less the
installation of devices to control emissions.
</P>
<P>
   At one facility, Browner said, $60 million had been spent not
just on redesisgn but on five new furnaces that on their face
increased the plant's capacity. At another, 10 new coal burners
costing $8 million will extend its useful life.
</P>
<P>
   The response of the companies _ including American Electric
Power and covering facilities from Florida and Alabama to Indiana
and Ohio _ is a ``did not'' to the lawsuit's ``did, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is no usual squabble between business and government.
The stuff that comes out of their smokestacks, usually built
sky-high to export it East, includes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, mercury, and soot. That's the basic ingredients of air
pollution of the worst kind. As Browner put it, ``Drifting on the
wind, the smog and acid rain generated by a Midwest coal plant can
trigger breathing problems, deforestation, dying lakes, and fish
kills through the Mid-Atlantic states, and up and down the East
Coast all the way through to New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Browner's many notable accomplishments running the EPA
since President Clinton took office, none outranks her elevation of
public health to a prime consideration in environmentalism. In this
case, the pollutants produced by coal-burning are a known trigger
for asthma and other respiratory problems that are exacting a
growing toll on children.
</P>
<P>
   The automobile is obviously at the center of all this. But as
Browner also noted, these old power plants that are being
artificially kept on line could, if their sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides emission were controlled by technology that already
exists, have those emissions cut by 85-95 percent. And that would
be the same as taking 26 million cars out of service and cutting
acid rain by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's lawsuit and the continuing investigation are in one
important respect related to Browner's efforts to toughen standards
for smog and soot in the future, which the pollution business has
for the moment stalled via lawsuits that have succeeded for the
moment as a result of two rulings in an appeals court here.
</P>
<P>
   These rulings, on appeal in what will probably become a landmark
Supreme Court case, upset a 22-state compact painstakingly
negotiated under Browner's leadership that could have produced
giant steps forward in controlling air pollution using common sense
techniques that would not have been disruptive. As she said, one of
the ways states could meet the tougher standards would be to look,
cost-effectively, at these older, coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their practices will be examined in court as possible
violation of the law. At a minimum, the EPA investigation
demonstrates the extreme bad faith of the utility industry. It is a
matter of the highest public health importance that they not be
permitted to flout the law in order to pollute the air.

DESPITE POLLS, KEYES STICKS TO HIS GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is Alan Keyes's vision for America: Guns are
plentiful. Abortions are banned, always and everywhere. God is
revered as the moral leader of the nation. Gun ownership is an
inalienable right. And no one has to pay the income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a moral crisis,'' Keyes said in a telephone
interview. ``It's a question being put to us. What kind of people
can we be? What self-discipline do we have? . . . Are we showing
proper respect for our family life?''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes is espousing some of the most audacious ideas of the
presidential campaign, and he does so with an articulate passion
that has his audiences bobbing heads in enthusiasm. But how many,
outside of Keyes's corps of loyalists, are paying attention?
</P>
<P>
   According to recent polls, not many. But Keyes is undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan is constantly running against the odds,'' said Marlo
Lewis, a Republican Capitol Hill staff member who is a close friend
of Keyes. It is Keyes's belief in the Bible, in a strict reading of
the Declaration of Independence, and an unwavering commitment to
conservative principles that keeps him going, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always tells the audience what he thinks they need to hear,
instead of what they want to hear. He is greatly prepared to be
unliked by the people he speaks to,'' Lewis said. ``He is
campaigning for votes, but he is not pandering for votes.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Keyes, 49, a second-time presidential candidate, does
not appear to be winning over many voters.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight Republican presidential candidates, he generally
runs last or next to last in national polls. A recent CNN-USA Today
poll had Keyes's support at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only African-American running for a major party
nomination, but that distinction has earned him neither heavy press
coverage nor the endorsement of major black leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, he lacks the campaign funds to build an organization
or take his message to the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   But Keyes, undiscouraged, forges on, spelling out his philosophy
and damning what he considers immoral behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In public, Keyes speaks thunderously and persuasively, without
notes, making compelling arguments for provocative ideas even his
Republican colleagues consider somewhat extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a cross between a politician and a preacher. He's a
wonderful public speaker, and I think he's sincere,'' said
University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. ``But I
don't think many Republicans agree with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of attention is a source of major frustration for Keyes.
With a Harvard doctorate in government affairs, Keyes held numerous
State Department posts, including ambassador to the United Nations'
Economic and Social Council during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific essayist and speaker, Keyes has written two books and
is radio host of ``the Alan Keyes Show: America's Wake-Up Call.''
Keyes has temporarily given up the radio show while he is
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes centers his campaign on abortion, which he said is
inherently banned under the ``life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness'' clause of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   That stance would normally draw loyal support from antiabortion
groups, while alarming advocates for abortion rights. But Keyes,
who is perhaps the most eloquent and unwavering candidate on the
issue, cannot stir up either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any plans to run any ads against him. We're
focused on George Bush,'' said William Lutz, spokesman for the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   His economic plan for the nation includes a dramatic change in
the tax code, to eliminate the income tax and replace it with a
national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is fraught with political and economic complications:
How would the poor pay for basic goods? How can the government plan
a budget, given the unpredictability of consumer spending patterns?
Would Congress pass such a plan?
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't thought it through,'' said Martin Regalia, an
economist with the US Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Where Keyes misses with economists, he hits with his audiences,
turning a disputed budgeting issue into a philosophical question of
what it means to be free in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we remove the socialist shackles from our economic and
social lives, the 21st century will see a real blossoming of
freedom,'' Keyes said when asked about eliminating the income tax.
Getting rid of the income tax ``puts control of money back into
people's hands,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes also adamantly favors the right to own guns, not ``merely
to allow us to intimidate burglars, or hunt rabbits to our hearts'
content,'' but to ensure, he said, the right of Americans to
overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few things could make the need for vigorous defense of Second
Amendment rights clearer than the ongoing spectacle of Clinton
contempt for the citizens he is supposed to serve,'' Keyes wrote in
an essay on guns, referring to the president. ``For the Second
Amendment is really in the Constitution to give men like Bill
Clinton something to think about when their ambition gets
particularly over-inflated.''
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, Keyes is, by his own definition, ``not a
globalist.'' Despite his tenure at the United Nations, Keyes has
suggested that the United States withdraw from the organization. He
opposed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and denounced
what he calls the ``facile interventionism'' of bombing Yugoslavia
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes is against affirmative action, gay rights, sex education
in schools, welfare, and the separation of church and state, which
Keyes insists is unconstitutional. Instead, Keyes says, children
should pray in school or be tutored at home.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of agenda that would normally gain the support of
the right wing of the Republican Party, as well as Christian
conservatives. But with several other conservatives running for
president _ opponents with better name recognition and more money _
Keyes isn't attracting that much attention.
</P>
<P>
   He has raised about $2.5 million, a tiny fraction of the amount
raised by GOP front-runner George W. Bush, the governor of Texas,
and his campaign chest is $38,000 in the red. His campaign is
scattered; Keyes lives in Maryland, but his campaign headquarters _
where calls are often picked up by an answering machine _ is in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sort of invented the virtual office everyone claims to
want to have,'' said Dan Godzich, Keyes's national campaign
manager. Keyes has no pollster and cannot yet afford TV
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   His irritation at the conventional-wisdom tautology _ that he's
unelectable because he's unelectable _ came through recently, when
he called people ``very stupid'' for refusing to vote for him based
on his performance in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who give into that logic are either very stupid or
they're insincere,'' Keyes told Iowa Public Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we have not reached the stage in America where
elections are decided by money,'' Keyes said in the telephone
interview. ``Do I think I have a chance to win? Of course.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The fall of the Berlin Wall, 10 years ago today (Tuesday), was
perhaps the most extraordinary political event that any of us are
likely to witness in our lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   An emblem of oppression was swept away. The tumultuous scenes as
crowds chipped away at the object that had come to be a symbol of
political evil encapsulated all the other changes of that dramatic
year in which communism so suddenly collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, it has become fashionable to express
pessimism about all that has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the people,'' chanted the demonstrators in 1989 in
defiance of the people's police. Then, ``We are one people,'' in
the heady run-up to German unification.
</P>
<P>
   But finding optimists in Germany today is a tough business. The
``wall in the heads'' _ the mutual distrust between east and west
Germans _ scarcely seems to diminish.
</P>
<P>
   The resentments mean that the former communists, now cutely
restyled as Democratic Socialists, are successful in a way they
could never have dreamed of when the Wall itself came down.
</P>
<P>
   The single most mocked phrase in Germany in the past 10 years
has been Helmut Kohl's declaration that east Germany would be full
of ``blooming landscapes'' within just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   In failing to deliver the proverbial ``blood, sweat and tears''
speech, Kohl was indeed misguided. When times looked tough, voters
felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, eastern Germany enjoys a standard of living that
would have seemed unthinkable to anyone who looked soberly at the
disastrous state of the east German economy 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's greatest problems are not economic, but social. East
Germans feel bitter that they are patronized by their affluent
western cousins.
</P>
<P>
   West Germans took decades to liberate themselves from the legacy
of a totalitarian regime after 1945. But they were scornful when
east Germans were disoriented by being thrust overnight into an
entirely new political and economic world.
</P>
<P>
   East Germans resent being perceived as less capable than the
west Germans. West Germans are contemptuous of the fact that the
easterners, despite the billions of marks in subsidies that they
have received, still complain of being badly off.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the problems are generational. The distance between a
50-year-old from Dusseldorf in the west and a 50-year-old from
Dresden in east Germany is likely to remain.
</P>
<P>
   The Dusseldorfer will continue to think of the east Germans as
grasping and ungrateful; the Dresdener will think of west Germans
as arrogant and condescending. But their children are growing up
less conditioned and, gradually, the psychological scars will fade.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, too, there is cause for optimism. The fall of the
Wall was only the most dramatic of all the changes that took place
in the extraordinary year of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Political collapse in Poland and Hungary paved the way for the
destruction of the Wall; Prague followed hard on Germany's heels.
Within two weeks, the Czechs' own revolution was complete. A month
after that, even the hated Romanian dictatorship of Nicolae
Ceausescu had been swept away.
</P>
<P>
   In these countries, there was no east-west divide, which meant
that the problems of coming to terms with life after
totalitarianism could be addressed in relative privacy. There was
no know-it-all rich sugar daddy offering unwanted advice.
</P>
<P>
   Although economic recovery was less dramatic than in east
Germany, the psychological effect has been more positive: everybody
knows economic progress has been achieved by their own efforts, not
because of a financial drip feed.
</P>
<P>
   Following German unification, less than a year after the Wall
came down, east Germany was absorbed into the European Union. For
countries such as Poland and Hungary, the fact that they are now
leading candidates for EU membership is itself a remarkable
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Even Romania, once seen as a basket case, is clawing its way
towards economic self-confidence and political stability. The
relative progress is just as remarkable as the fact that the
challenges remain enormous. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the region formerly ruled by Moscow, the most obvious
exception remains the former imperial power itself. Russia has
scarcely come to terms with the loss of its political colonies.
More importantly, it has little understanding of what has gone so
badly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet coup by hard-line communists failed disastrously
in August 1991, there was brief optimism that Russia could break
free of its own repressive history.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Russia _ which has a highly educated population, and
is rich in natural resources _ has stumbled from one disaster to
another, always blaming others for its woes.
</P>
<P>
   Some former Soviet republics, most notably the Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania _ whose economic viability was
questioned by Western economists before the Soviet Union broke up _
have proved well able to adjust to the rigor of the free-market
economy. Potentially rich Russia, by contrast, remains enmired.
</P>
<P>
   The war that Moscow has relaunched against the little republic
of Chechnya in recent weeks, where civilians have been the
principal victims, is only the most glaring example of Russia's
failure to connect.
</P>
<P>
   The economy, despite a partial recovery after last year's
disasters, remains brittle; the criminal mafias sometimes seem to
be the most powerful branch of government in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Russia, however, there are signs of hope. After 70 years
of totalitarianism (and centuries of feudal rule before that), it
is hardly surprising if the first years of attempted democracy have
been chaotic and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is as capable as Poland or Germany of becoming
successful. Like the school bully in the playground, weighed down
by many complexes, Moscow throws its weight around while seeming
unable to believe that things can ever get better.
</P>
<P>
   The message of 1989 _ that change is possible, even in the most
unpropitious circumstances _ remains valid.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in Moscow helped unleash miraculous change in the rest
of eastern Europe. If Russians can believe in themselves, they may
look forward to the return of the boomerang of democratic reform
that they helped to launch, and the economic prosperity that it
could bring in its wake. &QL;

<P>
   The war that Moscow has relaunched against the little republic
of Chechnya in recent weeks, where civilians have been the
principal victims, is only the most glaring example of Russia's
failure to connect.
</P>
<P>
   The economy, despite a partial recovery after last year's
disasters, remains brittle; the criminal mafias sometimes seem to
be the most powerful branch of government in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Russia, however, there are signs of hope. After 70 years
of totalitarianism (and centuries of feudal rule before that), it
is hardly surprising if the first years of attempted democracy have
been chaotic and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is as capable as Poland or Germany of becoming
successful. Like the school bully in the playground, weighed down
by many complexes, Moscow throws its weight around while seeming
unable to believe that things can ever get better.
</P>
<P>
   The message of 1989 _ that change is possible, even in the most
unpropitious circumstances _ remains valid.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in Moscow helped unleash miraculous change in the rest
of eastern Europe. If Russians can believe in themselves, they may
look forward to the return of the boomerang of democratic reform
that they helped to launch, and the economic prosperity that it
could bring in its wake. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ An East-West row that threatened to mar Tuesday's
celebrations of the fall of the Berlin Wall a decade ago has been
defused. The organizers _ Germany's two main parties _ graciously
consented to cutting their respective festive speeches by five
minutes each.
</P>
<P>
   The time saved by Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schroder rushing
through their scripts is to be donated to a genuine East German,
someone who had actually contributed to the historic event.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Joachim Gauck, a Lutheran pastor and former
dissident who gets to play the token Ossi, is not without
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992 Gauck has led the government's Stasi-busting agency,
which roots out agents of the former communist secret police from
public life.
</P>
<P>
   Many East Germans complain that their entire nation has been
unfairly tarred with the Stasi brush, and suspect Gauck's agency of
conducting an institutionalized witch-hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But his 10 minutes in the Reichstag on Tuesday goes a long way
to placating the 16 million eastern Germans outraged by the way the
``Wessi''-dominated political establishment airbrushed them out of
the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it not the people of East Germany who prised open the
Berlin Wall?'' asked a group of indignant former dissidents in an
open letter.
</P>
<P>
   The event, like much of what happened in the past 10 years, has
clearly been mishandled. To eastern Germans, it was the most vivid
demonstration yet of Wessi high-handedness. Wessis always seem to
know best, even about a moment of history in which they were
bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Just to recap: it was east Germans who had stormed the Wall on
the night of Nov. 9, 1989, though listening to the accounts of west
German politicians, one might think east Germans had only been
extras in a west German show.
</P>
<P>
   But it is useless to dwell on matters that took place such a
long time ago. The two Germanies are undoubtedly growing together.
</P>
<P>
   Much complaint has been made about the way the eastern education
system, in some ways superior to west German schooling, was
pronounced totally worthless. East German teachers were booted out
of the class rooms into the dole queues.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, after 10 years, the culture ministers of
all German ``Lander'' have decided that east German teaching
qualifications will henceforth be recognized nationwide. That
decision was reached last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the higher echelons of learning, the situation is worse.
According to a recent survey, 80 percent of senior professors at
eastern universities are Wessis, and their proportion is rising.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of lawyers, doctors, artists, civil servants and other
professionals also lost their jobs to Wessis, either because they
were judged _ by Wessis _ to be unqualified, or had had links with
the Stasi, which was almost unavoidable in the old GDR.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the industrial working class, meanwhile, was abolished
when their factories closed down soon after reunification.
</P>
<P>
   To many east Germans, therefore, the past decade has been the
most painful in their lives. They can be excused for not opening
champagne on Tuesday, and for shunning the party at the Brandenburg
Gate.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the anniversary is an ordinary working day,
because ``Unification Day'' falls on Oct. 3, the day the west
German parliament voted to incorporate the east German provinces
into the existing Federal Republic.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, most east Germans will reluctantly concede that the
system they have now is better than what they had in communist
times. Not even the 20 percent who vote for the cuddly communists
of the Party of Democratic Socialism want the Wall back. Most will
settle for of old-fashioned compassion and solidarity, and maybe a
little more respect. &QL;

the responsibility to grandparents. n estimated 5.5 million
children, or 7.7 percent, live in the custody of a grandparent,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It's a structure even more
common than the statistics show, and it's growing, according to Amy
Goyer, a program specialist with the Grandparent Information Center
in Washington, D.C. ``The next census is going to ask specific
questions about about raising grandchildren,'' Goyer said. ``We
think that we will get more accurate numbers once the census comes
out.'' (McGillicuddy, Rocky Mount Telegraph) MOVED.

<P>
   TOKYO _ The mood in Japan on the 10th anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall is in stark contrast to the euphoria felt
immediately after the historic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past 10 years have been a great disappointment in just
about every field, including economics and politics,'' said
Terumasa Nakanishi, a professor of international relations at Kyoto
University.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, a country whose foremost self-identify lies with its
economic power, the past 10 years can be summarized as a
humiliating decade with no bright prospects in sight.
</P>
<P>
   One comparison helps explain why many economists call the past
10 years a ``lost decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's key stock index, the Nikkei Stock Average, closed at
35,657.42 yen ($340) on Nov. 9, 1989, the day the Berlin Wall came
down. At that time, the stock market was said to be defying the law
of gravity amid Japan's high-flying period of asset-inflation
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the index has been nearly cut in half, opening
at 18,470.22 on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   One report, issued by the Economic Planning Agency the day after
the Berlin Wall collapsed, would sound totally out of context if it
were applied on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's study said the reason why Japanese could not feel
affluent despite their materially enriched lifestyles and increased
wages was because they worked too many hours. The report said
Japanese should work less.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding concern for workers on Nov. 9, 1999 is job
security.
</P>
<P>
   And the cries of joy shared by the Japanese when the Berlin Wall
collapse can no longer be heard here.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the low-key mood, the government has no plans to
observe the 10th anniversary with any special event.

   ``The anniversary does not give us any special feeling because
the post-Cold War era has become so much a part of us that we don't
find the 10th anniversary a special one,'' a senior Foreign
Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
   Nakanishi said Japan lost the past decade not just on the
economic front but also on the diplomatic front.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to Tokyo's failure to resolve the Northern
Territories dispute with Russia and the fact that Asia remains
plagued with Cold War legacies such as the potentially explosive
Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan problem.
</P>
<P>
   As a sense of insecurity prevailed in the nation, the word
``adrift'' was often used to describe not only the status of the
nation's economy but also the status of the Japan-U.S. Security
Treaty _ the postwar foundation of Japan's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is meaningful to think about the past 10 years in terms of
change in the meaning of alliances,'' one senior Foreign Ministry
official commented.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting such uneasy sentiment over such changes, Washington's
commitment to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty was questioned at a
recent study forum organized by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Yukio Okamoto, a former diplomat who runs an international
consulting firm, said Washington's commitment to Japan has
weakened. Shotaro Oshima, director-general of the Economic Affairs
Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, echoed Okamoto's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the same way,'' Oshima said. ``For example, the U.S.
government has clearly distanced itself from the Japan-China
dispute over the Senkaku Islands. This stance has made me wonder if
it reflected a change in its attitude toward its security
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakanishi observed: ``Japan has not been able to know what to
make of the meaning of the end of the Cold War. As far as the
Japan-U.S. security alliance is concerned, Japan had no choice but
to try to stick to the alliance in the continued uncertain and
unstable security environment in Asia, even after the Cold War
ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Takakazu Kuriyama, who was vice foreign minister when the Berlin
Wall fell, said the government had been justified in redefining and
maintaining the alliance. ''We needed to have an alliance with a
strong country that has a keen interest in Asia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to the fact that 10 years after the Cold War
ended, Japan's political standing in Asia is still limited by its
legacy in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to Asian nations' sentiments (lingering from the war),
Japan is still not allowed to try to go it alone,'' Kuriyama said.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, one thing was certain: The end of the
Cold War drastically changed the nation's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``For domestic Japanese politics, the end of the Cold War meant
that the LDP's factional dispute would no longer be contained
within the boundaries of the LDP itself,'' Gerald Curtis, a
professor of Japanese politics at Columbia University, wrote in his
recently published book, ``The Logic of Japanese Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Japan has witnessed five coalition governments,
including the current one that comprises the LDP, the Liberal Party
and New Komeito.
</P>
<P>
   Takamitsu Sawa, a professor of economics at Kyoto University,
laments that there has been very little ideological debate on
economic and welfare policy in Japan over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, Japan was filled with self-confidence, but now
its mainstream thinking calls for reform toward (American-style)
market economy, despite the fact that the Asian financial crisis
proved that market economy globalization was hardly stable,'' the
economist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past decade, the poverty of Japan's intellectual
power has become very visible, failing to create a national debate
on such fundamental ideological issues as economic and welfare
policy like Britain's debate on the ``Third Way,'' initiated by
Prime Minister Tony Blair,'' Sawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the coalition government decided to temporarily ease
the burden on those who will pay for the new nursing care program _
a move viewed as a transparent ploy to please voters ahead of the
next Lower House election, which must be held within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The relief measures were announced as the outstanding balance of
government bonds, which stood at 258 trillion yen, is projected to
exceed 330 trillion yen by the end of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the debts in the Japanese government sector,
including local governments, would surpass 600 trillion yen _ the
worst figure among industrialized democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there has been no fundamental philosophical debate on
welfare and economic policy in the decision-making process. &QL;

   TOKYO _ The mood in Japan on the 10th anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall is in stark contrast to the euphoria felt
immediately after the historic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past 10 years have been a great disappointment in just
about every field, including economics and politics,'' said
Terumasa Nakanishi, a professor of international relations at Kyoto
University.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, a country whose foremost self-identify lies with its
economic power, the past 10 years can be summarized as a
humiliating decade with no bright prospects in sight.
</P>
<P>
   One comparison helps explain why many economists call the past
10 years a ``lost decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's key stock index, the Nikkei Stock Average, closed at
35,657.42 yen ($340) on Nov. 9, 1989, the day the Berlin Wall came
down. At that time, the stock market was said to be defying the law
of gravity amid Japan's high-flying period of asset-inflation
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the index has been nearly cut in half, opening
at 18,470.22 on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   One report, issued by the Economic Planning Agency the day after
the Berlin Wall collapsed, would sound totally out of context if it
were applied on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's study said the reason why Japanese could not feel
affluent despite their materially enriched lifestyles and increased
wages was because they worked too many hours. The report said
Japanese should work less.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding concern for workers on Nov. 9, 1999 is job
security.
</P>
<P>
   And the cries of joy shared by the Japanese when the Berlin Wall
collapse can no longer be heard here.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the low-key mood, the government has no plans to
observe the 10th anniversary with any special event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anniversary does not give us any special feeling because
the post-Cold War era has become so much a part of us that we don't
find the 10th anniversary a special one,'' a senior Foreign

GOP BACKS (GASP) A DEMOCRAT FOR SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ During his 15 years as the powerful speaker of
the California Assembly, Willie Brown was demonized by Republicans
and used as a poster child for everything wrong with liberal
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Monday night the San Francisco Republican Central
Committee endorsed Brown in his bid for re-election, even though
some committee members gritted their teeth at giving a boost to the
already powerful incumbent Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unusual situation that could only happen in San
Francisco,'' said Arthur Bruzzone, a former chairman of the
Republican Central Committee who cast his vote for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement arose in part because Brown's opponent in the
Dec. 14 run-off election is Board of Supervisors President Tom
Ammiano, who has advocated new taxes on the wealthy and businesses
and whose strong write-in showing in last week's election has some
Republicans fearing he could oust the more business-friendly Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement vote was also surprising because it included
some high-pressure lobbying to support Brown by some of the state's
most prominent Republicans, including former Gov. George Deukmejian
and current Republican state Senate Caucus Chairman Jim Brulte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics does make strange bedfellows,'' said Harold
Hoogasian, a member of the central committee. ``I think it has to
do with Tom Ammiano to a large extent. Although Mayor Brown, shall
we say, is not a Republican icon, Tom Ammiano is uncharted
territory. He's just way off any charts that any of us want to get
anywhere close to. His socialist ideas are just anathema to most of
us on the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement came after an hourlong presentation by the mayor
and another hour of questions. When a motion was finally brought to
the floor to endorse Brown, 18 central committee members supported
it, six opposed it and two abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement was a political plum for the mayor. Though
Republicans make up only 15 percent of the electorate in San
Francisco, the endorsement could help the mayor appeal to the
moderate-to-conservative voters most pundits agree will decide the
election between Brown and Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, the endorsement could further anger some
progressive voters, many of whom are already suspicious of Brown's
ties to developers and business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, 58, a sometime stand-up comedian who has led the city's
school board and board of supervisors, secured second place in the
Nov. 2 election after an unprecedented three-week write-in
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 65, the city's first black mayor, has spent a lifetime in
politics, earning him fund-raising power, influence with state and
federal officials and a night in the Lincoln bedroom at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Ammiano were the top vote-getters in a crowded race
for mayor. Since neither man earned more than 50 percent of the
vote, they must compete in the run-off election next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown campaign gloated over the Republican endorsement,
which the mayor's aides said bolstered his position as the lone
centrist in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just shows that Mayor Brown is the one candidate in the
race who can bridge traditionally warring factions in San
Francisco,'' said P.J. Johnston, the mayor's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement showcased Brown's powerful Sacramento
connections. In addition to Deukmejian, other prominent Republican
making last-minute phone calls to twist arms to support the mayor
were Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, and Bob White and
Joe Shumate, two high-level aides to Brown's old nemesis, former
Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure from people like Chuck Quackenbush
and Jim Brulte,'' Bruzzone said. Brulte is the former state
assemblyman who engineered the 1994 Republican takeover of the
Assembly.

   Testing. Please ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

The following stories moved Tuesday in the ``e'' entertainment
category for New York Times News Service clients: LIGHT-REVIEW _ A sensitive artist (Robert Ri'chard), a brainy
beauty (Rosario Dawson), a troubled jock (R&AMP;B singer Usher
Raymond), a sardonic wheeler-dealer (Clifton Collins, Jr.), a
pregnant outcast (Sara Gilbert) and a hardened thug (Fredro Starr)
all attend a crumbling high school in Queens, where there is a
shortage of books, window panes and, yes, hope. Things get out of
hand _ and a hostage situation ensues _ when a popular teacher
(Judd Nelson) is suspended. Film review by Glenn Whipp. 
 
 
JOAN-FEATURE _ The maid of Orleans has been depicted more times _
and in more genres _ than you can count. Follow them all _ or as
many as WE can count. The latest, of course, is Luc Besson's ``The

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Sniffing around Paris
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Nobody's fault but mine. I brought it on myself. I
brought my wife to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   I always like to concentrate on the brasseries, the little
French cafes you find on most any corner.
</P>
<P>
   Now I find myself concerned with brassieres, or the lack
thereof. What a bust.
</P>
<P>
   The zipper on a piece of her luggage was somehow hammered shut
in transit. Most everything she needs _ clothes, makeup, whatever _
she has access to. The exception is her bras, permanently encased
in the damaged suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go buy a brassiere,'' I tell her. If nothing else I'm a good
provider.
</P>
<P>
   But no, she'll do without, she says.
</P>
<P>
   So, here we are, bouncing along the streets of Paris, her with
her arms folded in front of her, holding out her purse, it would
seem, as an offering to the purse snatchers.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies, don't you know.
</P>
<P>
   That's a mistake I made, telling her to be on the lookout for
gypsies. I've read about them, these expert pickpockets and purse
snatchers who frequent the tourist sites, ever on the prowl for an
easy prey.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I've ever seen one of them myself. But I figure that
just goes to show how stealthy they stalk you.
</P>
<P>
   It's just the opposite for my wife. She sees gypsies everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame Cathedral was the worst. Everywhere she looked she
saw gypsies perched, ready to pounce. That's a problem she has _
can't tell the gypsies from the gargoyles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she's practiced her evil eye. That's what tourists
are told. Give the gypsies the evil eye and they give you wide
berth.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about the gypsies, but that mean look in her eye
has always scared the heck out of me.
</P>
<P>
   Paris is for romantics. It's no place for a wife.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out to her the lovers on park benches, lost in one
another's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmph,'' she sniffed. ``They act like they think they invented
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out to her the writers who make Luxembourg Garden
their office, scribbling away in notebooks, looking as if their
thoughts are a thousand miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmph,'' she sniffed. ``They look like they're posing for the
tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   I took her to my favorite cafe on the Left Bank for coffee,
cheese and bread. Nowhere else, I told her, is bread like the bread
of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmph,'' she sniffed. ``The stuff is hard enough to knock a dog
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we found our way to the Louvre museum. Finally, I
thought I had found something that would impress her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmph,'' she sniffed. ``They need to put some clothes on these
statues of men.''
</P>
<P>
   But Winged Victory, she liked.
</P>
<P>
   The Mona Lisa, she liked.
</P>
<P>
   The Venus de Milo, she particularly liked.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I showed her a side of the Venus that not
everyone sees _ the backside, where the sculptured robe is draped
seductively to expose the upper portion of her buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it always makes me think of?'' I said. I didn't wait
for her answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that time we had the plumber working under the sink,
the way he was squatted down, with the back of his shirt hiked up
and his blue jeans pulling down ...?''
</P>
<P>
   She stalked off.
</P>
<P>
   Now she says I've ruined Paris for her. I told her it was just
the gypsy in my soul. Now she's giving me the evil eye.
</P>
<P>
   (P.S. Later she used my pocketknife to cut open the luggage that
wouldn't unzip and was able to fish out her brassieres. I think
she's feeling more herself now, and less the Venus de Milo.)

   Testing. Please ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

   BERLIN _ You can see Berlin grow. A resident away from just one
week will be confronted with skyscrapers a story or two taller,
cranes that have migrated from their previous spots, and new
bridges across the Spree.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's biggest construction site is filling up. On the
Potsdamer Platz, bissected by the border 10 years ago, the world's
foremost architects have been allowed to act out their fantasies,
not always to good effect.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile north, the Reichstag is at last complete, its dome
lighting up the night sky. A wonderous sight, even if it true, as
the government alleges, that Sir Norman Foster's creation has a
leaky roof.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk from the Reichstag is Pariser Platz and Brandenburg
Gate. Once an eerie no-man's land dividing east and west Berlin, it
is now a crowded tourist trap. Many of the buildings destroyed here
during the Second World War have been rebuilt, and other new
structures have cropped up around the square.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the overground and underground railway lines have
already been patched together, and in many parts east and west have
become indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall is certainly hard to locate. In some parts a line has
been drawn on the pavement for the sake of tourists, and only a few
segments here and there have survived the efforts of overzealous
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The city has just rebuilt a section at Bernauer Street, so that
visitors have something to gape at.
</P>
<P>
   But east and west still feel different. The west is infinitely
more prosperous, the east more vibrant. One of the biggest losers
of the Fall of the Wall was the west Berlin district of Kreuzberg
on the front line. It could not compete with the seediness of the
east.
</P>
<P>
   The action nowadays is in the Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg, two
formerly derelict working-class districts that have been receiving
a new coat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Yuppy new arrivals live cheek by jowl with artists, dropouts and
increasingly hostile original residents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main attractions of the pubs and night clubs of the
east is the beer they serve: the original Berliner. It is one of
the few east German products that somehow managed to survive the
influx of western capital and know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Berliner is vastly superior to any of the western brews, but you
will struggle to find it in the pubs of west Berlin. In their
drinking habits, as in so much else, the two Berlins remain
divided. &QL;

influx of western capital and know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Berliner is vastly superior to any of the western brews, but you
will struggle to find it in the pubs of west Berlin. In their
drinking habits, as in so much else, the two Berlins remain
divided. &QL;

DIRTY TACTICS BY SOME UTILITIES

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR;  _ Explaining a complex but crucial environmental
point with customary patience, Carol Browner urged me to consider
an old car.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, suggested the head of the Environmental Protection
Agency, that you change the oil regularly, rotate the tires, get
new oil filters and spark plugs as recommended, maybe even add a CD
player. You're operating and maintaining the vehicle, right? Now,
imagine that you have the engine rebuilt, taking you from four to
eight cylinders. Hardly the same old heap, is it?
</P>
<P>
   In Browner's metaphor, this is what power plants that burn coal
have been doing, except that where their acid rain-causing,
health-threatening pollution is concerned, there is a serious
federal law involved.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, after two years of an ongoing investigation, the
EPA and the Justice Department filed seven lawsuits charging that
17 power plants in the Midwest and South have been masking major
changes in their facilities as routine maintenance to avoid the
clear intent of the Clean Air Act. For good measure, the EPA
slapped an administrative order on the Tennessee Valley Authority
affecting seven of the federal agency's generating facilities.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Microsoft-sized deal. Instead of anti-trust, though,
what's involved here are violations of trust.
</P>
<P>
   As Browner explained, the original Clean Air Act of 1970
contained a sensible grandfather clause regarding coal-fired power
plants, based on the assumption that time would gradually lead to
their replacement by new, much cleaner technologies. Accordingly,
these older facilities were exempt from the more exacting standards
on new plants as long as they stayed the same. The law is explicit
about what that meant. The companies could perform normal
maintenance but they could not make changes that altered their
basic nature _ like raising the generating capcity, or making
possible more coal-burning that lengthened the plant's life span
unless they got special permits and added the best available
pollution-control equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's investigation charges that the companies made changes
to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars of bigtime
``improvements'' that lengthen their life and increase pollution,
none of them accompanied by permit applications, much less the
installation of devices to control emissions.
</P>
<P>
   At one facility, Browner said, $60 million had been spent not
just on redesisgn but on five new furnaces that on their face
increased the plant's capacity. At another, 10 new coal burners
costing $8 million will extend its useful life.
</P>
<P>
   The response of the companies _ including American Electric
Power and covering facilities from Florida and Alabama to Indiana
and Ohio _ is a ``did not'' to the lawsuit's ``did, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is no usual squabble between business and government.
The stuff that comes out of their smokestacks, usually built
sky-high to export it East, includes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, mercury, and soot. That's the basic ingredients of air
pollution of the worst kind. As Browner put it, ``Drifting on the
wind, the smog and acid rain generated by a Midwest coal plant can
trigger breathing problems, deforestation, dying lakes, and fish
kills through the Mid-Atlantic states, and up and down the East
Coast all the way through to New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Browner's many notable accomplishments running the EPA
since President Clinton took office, none outranks her elevation of
public health to a prime consideration in environmentalism. In this
case, the pollutants produced by coal-burning are a known trigger
for asthma and other respiratory problems that are exacting a
growing toll on children.
</P>
<P>
   The automobile is obviously at the center of all this. But as
Browner also noted, these old power plants that are being
artificially kept on line could, if their sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides emission were controlled by technology that already
exists, have those emissions cut by 85-95 percent. And that would
be the same as taking 26 million cars out of service and cutting
acid rain by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's lawsuit and the continuing investigation are in one
important respect related to Browner's efforts to toughen standards
for smog and soot in the future, which the pollution business has
for the moment stalled via lawsuits that have succeeded for the
moment as a result of two rulings in an appeals court here.
</P>
<P>
   These rulings, on appeal in what will probably become a landmark
Supreme Court case, upset a 22-state compact painstakingly
negotiated under Browner's leadership that could have produced
giant steps forward in controlling air pollution using common sense
techniques that would not have been disruptive. As she said, one of
the ways states could meet the tougher standards would be to look,
cost-effectively, at these older, coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their practices will be examined in court as possible
violation of the law. At a minimum, the EPA investigation
demonstrates the extreme bad faith of the utility industry. It is a
matter of the highest public health importance that they not be
permitted to flout the law in order to pollute the air.

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    Carlos Museum tempers desire to acquire
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIKE MANY MUSEUMS THESE DAYS, the Michael C. Carlos Museum at
Emory University is taking a closer look at its holdings. Unlike
many museums, it is being disarmingly open about what it knows _
and what it doesn't know _ about its collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every museum has skeletons in its closets,'' says museum
director Anthony Hirschel. ``We have them too, but we are trying
hard to find them and do the right thing when we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mayan cyclinder vase the museum once called ``the finest
piece in our meso-American holdings,'' for instance, has finally
been returned to its display case after six months of
rehabilitation by a New York conservator.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-inch high polychrome vase is now minus most of the
familiar spear-wielding warrior god that museum goers saw during
the eight years in was previously on exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The vase dated from about A.D. 650, in the Peten region of
Guatemala. The painted warrior, unfortunately, dated from the
1960s, probably from somewhere in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered, on close examination, that the side of the vase
we were exhibiting had been rather creatively imagined by some
fellow who overpainted it in modern times,'' Hirschel says. ``The
things he added are gone now. That side is now mostly just a patch
of brown. We turned it around so that people can now see the side
that we now know to be genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   The forged portion of the Mayan cylinder vase was discovered in
the course of the museum's effort to publish its massive collection
of ancient American artifacts _ the first comprehensive catalog of
its holdings the museum has ever conducted.
</P>
<P>
   For an institution that started out in 1876 as a few dusty
display cases in the library of Emory's old Oxford, Ga., campus,
the Carlos _ now housed on Emory's quadrangle in a modern,
neo-Florentine building designed by architect Michael Graves _ has
come a long way. Many of the 16,000 items it owns, including
Georgia's oldest Maytag washer, have been relegated to storage to
make room for its growing collection of pre-Columbian, Egyptian,
Greek, Roman and African materials.
</P>
<P>
   With a budget of only $2.5 million a year, the Carlos is spared
the temptation of trying to compete head-to-head for new material
with the country's major museums, which sometimes pay that much to
add a single piece to their permanent collections.
</P>
<P>
   But its reputation as an innovative, up-and-coming
university-affiliated art and archaeology museum keeps its staff
wary of any new material _ purchased or donated _ whose recent
history can't be documented sufficiently to assure that it has not
been stolen or looted.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's largest purchase, the $2 million Egyptian mummy
collection, acquired from the Niagara Falls Museum this year, was
possible not only because of a community fund-raising effort, but
also because the Carlos was sure that the mummies met the museum's
acquisition guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt comfortable with it because it had been assembled by a
group of people in the 1860s,'' says Hirschel. ``Abe Lincoln went
to see it. So did Jules Verne and Teddy Roosevelt. It was legally
exported a long time ago _ one of many such collections that people
in Egypt acquired for interested parties in Europe and America.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection greatly expands the museum's existing mummy
collection, begun by Emory theology professor William Shelton, who
mounted an expedition to the Near East in 1920 with financial
support from Atlanta cotton merchant John Manger.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Shelton and his staff traveled in an armor-plated
Rolls Royce as they collected more than 250 artifacts, mostly
Egyptian and Babylonian, for the museum. These days, such activity
is outlawed in most of the countries Shelton visited.
</P>
<P>
   As concern grows that museums' acquisitive nature contributes to
the trade in stolen and looted antiquities, Carlos officials have
grown increasingly suspicious of new materials whose recent
ownership can't be easily tracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very careful about material from Latin America,'' says
Rebecca Stone-Miller, the museum's curator of ancient American
arts. ``We're suspicious of anything that has come through Europe,
which is the main conduit for illicit objects. If it looks like it
has been laundered through Europe, we won't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for a museum determined to ``do the right thing,'' the
decision can be agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one buying trip to Europe last year, I encountered a Swiss
dealer who had a very beautiful Greek antiquity: a statue of
Aphrodite,'' Hirschel says. ``Because we don't have a nude female
in our collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, it would have
made a perfect addition. It was early second century, 4 feet high,
broken at knees and neck. It was very beautiful and at $100,000 it
seemed reasonably priced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have bought it on the spot, but the dealer didn't have
any documentation. He said it had been in a mysterious old French
collection, but because the owner didn't want to disclose that for
tax reasons, he couldn't prove it. So I had to let it go. When I
asked later about the fate of my lost love, I was told she had been
sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the museum does occasionally indulge its passion for
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschel, formerly director of the University of Virginia's
Bayley Museum, is especially proud of a red and black Greek
drinking cup, a kylix, which the museum bought from a Swiss dealer
last year for a sum reputed to be in the $100,000 range. The piece
now occupies a small alcove in the museum's Greek and Roman
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that an awful lot of art passes through Switzerland to
erase any problems it may have, but in this case we knew it came
from the highly regarded Studen collection in Lugano, Switzerland,
so we felt comfortable with it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like most museums, most of the Carlos' holdings are a result of
others' generosity. Over the past 10 years, the museum has received
more than $3 million worth of pre-Columbian materials from the
private collection of Carol and William Thibadeau, who founded the
Atlanta real estate company that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Thibadeau collected arrowheads along Peachtree
Creek. Later in life, the collecting bug bit with a vengeance and
he began buying pre-Columbian material from dealers in Central
America. ``Sometimes they would come to Atlanta,'' he says. ``And
sometimes they would just send us things. Prices were much lower
then. A piece you could buy for $5 or $6 then, now costs 20 or 30
times that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to go to the airport and pick up huge crates of
artifacts. It went through Customs with no trouble. We'd buy what
we wanted and store the rest of it in our garage until they were
ready to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thibadeau, 79, still recalls the details of many of the 1,300
pieces he donated to the museum: The matched pair of 2,000-year-old
clay figures, Ixtan del Rio style, that he got from Costa Rican art
dealer Enrique Vargas in exchange for a used Oldsmobile, the Mayan
polychrome vase _ now known to have been overpainted by forgers _
that he paid $1,800 for at a show at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Thibadeau, who continues to collect, says it was his wife's
insistence that he ``clean out'' the basement that prompted the
series of gifts to the Carlos _ which he chose, in part, because of
frequent visits to the old Emory museum.
</P>
<P>
   Because any undocumented piece has the potential to tarnish its
reputation, however, the museum is careful, even about generous
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have turned down some gifts because the owners didn't know
where they came from,'' Hirschel says. ``If it doesn't have proper
paperwork, we can't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outright ownership, however, is not the only way for a museum to
offer quality art and archaeology to the public. The Carlos' former
director, Maxwell Anderson, who now heads the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York, inaugurated an ambitious program of
inter-museum loans that many experts believe should be the future
standard for museums that don't want to encourage illicit traffic
in antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loans can give museums like the Carlos access to materials
that they could never afford _ from places like the Louvre and
institutions of that caliber,'' Anderson says. ``It also provides a
sensible alternative to the rapacious acquisition that has
contributed to the worldwide market in ancient art.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschel agrees. ``It provides a way for people who come to the
museum to see the cultural heritage of other parts of the world
without them having to fear that those treasures are being spirited
away,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do our best. But regardless of what we do, we will
never be able to eliminate illegal exploitation of archaeological
sites. And we are never going to suppress the urge to collect. It
is basic to human nature.''

wary of any new material _ purchased or donated _ whose recent
history can't be documented sufficiently to assure that it has not
been stolen or looted.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's largest purchase, the $2 million Egyptian mummy
collection, acquired from the Niagara Falls Museum this year, was
possible not only because of a community fund-raising effort, but
also because the Carlos was sure that the mummies met the museum's
acquisition guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt comfortable with it because it had been assembled by a
group of people in the 1860s,'' says Hirschel. ``Abe Lincoln went
to see it. So did Jules Verne and Teddy Roosevelt. It was legally
exported a long time ago _ one of many such collections that people
in Egypt acquired for interested parties in Europe and America.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection greatly expands the museum's existing mummy
collection, begun by Emory theology professor William Shelton, who
mounted an expedition to the Near East in 1920 with financial
support from Atlanta cotton merchant John Manger.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Shelton and his staff traveled in an armor-plated
Rolls Royce as they collected more than 250 artifacts, mostly
Egyptian and Babylonian, for the museum. These days, such activity
is outlawed in most of the countries Shelton visited.
</P>
<P>
   As concern grows that museums' acquisitive nature contributes to
the trade in stolen and looted antiquities, Carlos officials have
grown increasingly suspicious of new materials whose recent
ownership can't be easily tracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very careful about material from Latin America,'' says
Rebecca Stone-Miller, the museum's curator of ancient American
arts. ``We're suspicious of anything that has come through Europe,
which is the main conduit for illicit objects. If it looks like it
has been laundered through Europe, we won't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for a museum determined to ``do the right thing,'' the
decision can be agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one buying trip to Europe last year, I encountered a Swiss
dealer who had a very beautiful Greek antiquity: a statue of
Aphrodite,'' Hirschel says. ``Because we don't have a nude female
in our collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, it would have
made a perfect addition. It was early second century, 4 feet high,
broken at knees and neck. It was very beautiful and at $100,000 it
seemed reasonably priced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have bought it on the spot, but the dealer didn't have
any documentation. He said it had been in a mysterious old French
collection, but because the owner didn't want to disclose that for
tax reasons, he couldn't prove it. So I had to let it go. When I
asked later about the fate of my lost love, I was told she had been
sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the museum does occasionally indulge its passion for
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschel, formerly director of the University of Virginia's
Bayley Museum, is especially proud of a red and black Greek
drinking cup, a kylix, which the museum bought from a Swiss dealer
last year for a sum reputed to be in the $100,000 range. The piece
now occupies a small alcove in the museum's Greek and Roman
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that an awful lot of art passes through Switzerland to
erase any problems it may have, but in this case we knew it came
from the highly regarded Studen collection in Lugano, Switzerland,
so we felt comfortable with it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like most museums, most of the Carlos' holdings are a result of
others' generosity. Over the past 10 years, the museum has received
more than $3 million worth of pre-Columbian materials from the
private collection of Carol and William Thibadeau, who founded the
Atlanta real estate company that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Thibadeau collected arrowheads along Peachtree
Creek. Later in life, the collecting bug bit with a vengeance and
he began buying pre-Columbian material from dealers in Central
America. ``Sometimes they would come to Atlanta,'' he says. ``And
sometimes they would just send us things. Prices were much lower
then. A piece you could buy for $5 or $6 then, now costs 20 or 30
times that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to go to the airport and pick up huge crates of
artifacts. It went through Customs with no trouble. We'd buy what
we wanted and store the rest of it in our garage until they were
ready to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thibadeau, 79, still recalls the details of many of the 1,300
pieces he donated to the museum: The matched pair of 2,000-year-old
clay figures, Ixtan del Rio style, that he got from Costa Rican art
dealer Enrique Vargas in exchange for a used Oldsmobile, the Mayan
polychrome vase _ now known to have been overpainted by forgers _
that he paid $1,800 for at a show at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Thibadeau, who continues to collect, says it was his wife's
insistence that he ``clean out'' the basement that prompted the
series of gifts to the Carlos _ which he chose, in part, because of
frequent visits to the old Emory museum.
</P>
<P>
   Because any undocumented piece has the potential to tarnish its
reputation, however, the museum is careful, even about generous
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have turned down some gifts because the owners didn't know
where they came from,'' Hirschel says. ``If it doesn't have proper
paperwork, we can't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outright ownership, however, is not the only way for a museum to
offer quality art and archaeology to the public. The Carlos' former
director, Maxwell Anderson, who now heads the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York, inaugurated an ambitious program of
inter-museum loans that many experts believe should be the future
standard for museums that don't want to encourage illicit traffic
in antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loans can give museums like the Carlos access to materials
that they could never afford _ from places like the Louvre and
institutions of that caliber,'' Anderson says. ``It also provides a
sensible alternative to the rapacious acquisition that has
contributed to the worldwide market in ancient art.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschel agrees. ``It provides a way for people who come to the
museum to see the cultural heritage of other parts of the world
without them having to fear that those treasures are being spirited
away,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do our best. But regardless of what we do, we will
never be able to eliminate illegal exploitation of archaeological
sites. And we are never going to suppress the urge to collect. It
is basic to human nature.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ In what for many museums is rare candor, Emory
University's Michael C. Carlos Museum opened its files to reveal
what it knows _ and doesn't know _ about several objects selected
by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Each of the 16,000 objects in
the museum has its own story, but for many _ like most pieces in
most museums _the history of their recent travels and previous
ownership is thinly documented.
</P>
<P>
   Linen-shrouded mummy of a middle-aged man
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, probably 167-30 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   One of 250 objects collected by William Arthur Shelton of
Emory's divinity school during a 1920 expedition to Egypt and the
Near East. Financing for the expedition by Atlanta cotton merchant
John Manget included use of an armor-plated Rolls Royce mounted
with a machine gun to ward off bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Light tan storage jar with double handle
</P>
<P>
   Israel, Middle Bronze Age, 1800-1550 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   One of many pieces excavated from Tomb J42 in Jericho by Dame
Kathleen Kenyon of the British School of Archaeology in 1955.
Financial backing for the dig by Emory assured the museum a portion
of the artifacts recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Matched pair of clay figures, Ixtan del Rio style
</P>
<P>
   Nayarit, western Mexico, 200 B.C. to A.D. 200
</P>
<P>
   One of 299 pre-Columbian artifacts donated to the museum in 1990
by William and Carol Thibadeau of Atlanta. The deed of gift says
the pair of seated figurines are thought to have been ``imported
into the United States prior to 1983.'' Thibadeau got them in
barter for a used Oldsmobile from Enrique Vargas, a Costa Rican
artifact dealer who claimed they had been sold off by the Denver
Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan polychrome cylinder vessel with underworld scene
</P>
<P>
   eten region, Guatemala, Late Classic Period, A.D. 670 - 750
(Pictured on cover)
</P>
<P>
   Described by the museum as ``the finest piece of our
meso-American holdings.'' Donated in 1990 by William and Carol
Thibadeau, who paid $1,800 for it at an artifact show at Duke
University in the mid-1980s. Thought to have been imported before
1983. Removed from display for several months after curators
determined that a portion of the design was a forgery. The
overpainted portion has been stripped off and the vase is back on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Marble head of AphroditePossibly Greek, first century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased from Acanthus Gallery in New York in 1992. Price
undisclosed. Previously owned by a duke in Northern Ireland who, as
a condition of sale, insisted that he ``be not in any way
approached or contacted'' by anyone wanting to know more about the
piece. Not reported stolen, according to International Foundation
for Art Research database.
</P>
<P>
   Headless marble torso of Roman citizen in toga
</P>
<P>
   Roman or Greek Ionian,
</P>
<P>
   A.D. first century
</P>
<P>
   Purchased for $175,000 from London art dealer Bruce McAlpine.
Reported to have been part of an unidentified Austrian collection
for two generations. Warranted by McAlpine that it complies with
the export law of the country of origin, although the country of
origin is undetermined, and all U.S. import laws.
</P>
<P>
   Marble funery urn of Gaius Pompeius Ireneus
</P>
<P>
   Roman, Flavian period, first century
</P>
<P>
   Donated by William and Carol Thibadeau in 1997. They bought it
for an undisclosed sum in 1990 from Laurence Witten, who shipped it
to them via United Parcel Service with a cautionary note to ``avoid
hernia when lifting it about.'' Witten purchased it in the 1960s
from Carlebach Galleries in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Black-figure kylix, attributed to the Parisian Gigantomachy
Painter
</P>
<P>
   Greek, late Archaic, 480 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased, for an undisclosed sum, at a European auction from
Kunst der Antike, a Swiss dealer in antiquities. Reported to have
been owned by an E. Studer, a collector of ancient art from Lugano,
Switzerland. The only published mention of it before its sale to
the Carlos was in 1993 in the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, a
multi-volume compendium of ancient vases. Previous whereabouts,
date of export and country of origin are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   153,000 pot shards, varying sizes and colors
</P>
<P>
   Wadi Mujib area, Jordan, 400 B.C. to present
</P>
<P>
   Collected by Emory archaeologists from 443 sites on the Al-Kerak
plateau between 1978 and 1983 as part of an archaeological survey
of the ancient land of Moab. Released to Emory in 1988 by Jordan's
department of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Burnished brownware vessel with feline headed snake motif
</P>
<P>
   Coastal Peru, Chavin culture, about 700 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   One of 223 pre-Columbian pieces donated to museum in 1991 by
William and Carol Thibeadeau of Atlanta. Date of import and origins
unknown. The deed of gift declares that, to the Thibadeaus'
knowledge, it was ``not imported into or from any country contrary
to its laws.'' Peru has forbidden the export of cultural objects
since 1926. The United States banned the import of Chavin artifacts
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Red-figure volute krater by the Underworld Painter
</P>
<P>
   Apulia, Italy, 350-340 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased for an undisclosed sum in 1994 from an art broker in
Riehen, Switzerland, who reported that the previous owner
``acquired the vase in the late '60s.'' Earliest public exhibit was
at an exhibition in Geneva in 1986. Bill of sale warrants that the
vase was exported ``in conformity'' of the laws of the country of
origin. Italy has forbidden the unauthorized export of all ancient
art since 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Bronze tumi, in the form of the Sican lord
</P>
<P>
   Central Peru, Inca culture, 900-1100 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   One of 57 pre-Columbian artifacts donated in 1994 by Laurence
and Cora Witten, of Vero Beach, Fla. The deed of gift states it is
not known to have been ``imported or exported from any country
contrary to its laws.'' The date of import is unknown. The United
States has banned the import of Inca artifacts from Peru since
1997.

 &HT;    The Past in Peril
 &HT;    Greece fights Britain for all of the marbles
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Greece wants its marbles back. All of them. And soon.
Preferably in time to show them to the world when Athens hosts the
Olympic Games in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years after Scotland's Lord Elgin stripped most of
the marble sculptures from the towering pediments of Athens'
Parthenon, Greece is turning up the heat on one of the world's most
enduring feuds over the rights to cultural property _ hoping that a
little public humiliation will accomplish what decades of dogged
diplomacy have failed to do: bring the marbles home.
</P>
<P>
   The Parthenon, built atop the highest point of the Acropolis,
towers as imposingly over Athens today as it did 2,500 years ago.
But for those who want to fully appreciate the artistic high point
of Athenian democracy, the line forms not at the foot of Athens'
sacred rock, but just off Great Russell Street in London.
</P>
<P>
   It is there, at the British Museum, that most of the surviving
marble sculptures _ 88 magnificent works of ancient art in all _
have resided since the museum bought them from a cash-strapped Lord
Elgin in 1816.
</P>
<P>
   And it is there, says the head of the world's best-known museum,
that they should stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marbles were acquired legally,'' says museum director
Robert Anderson, mincing no words with diplomatic niceties. ``They
are our property. They have been an important part of British
cultural life for two centuries. This is where they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   But not according to Greece, which contends that the marbles _
interpretations of mythology by Phidias, ancient Athens' greatest
and most prolific sculptor _ have been a part of Greek cultural
life for a lot more than two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marbles belong in Athens,'' says archaeologist Heleni
Korka, secretary of Hellenic Committee for Restitution of Parthenon
Marbles. ``The marbles are not free-standing works of art. They are
an integral part of the Parthenon. They belong together. And they
belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   The relative positions of the parties have changed little since
1802 when Thomas Bruce, the seventh earl of Elgin and Britain's
ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, took down the marble freizes,
reliefs and sculptures and, with a little help from the British
Navy, shipped them off to London for ``safekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elgin wasn't planning to stock a museum. The headless Iris,
the torso of Hermes, the breast of Athena and the other marbles
that he took were intended to grace his home in Scotland. Even in
those days it was an audacious example of cultural piracy _ an act
that prompted his fellow nobleman, Lord Byron, to publicly
castigate him as ``the last, the worst dull spoiler'' of one of the
world's architectural wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Byron nor Elgin could have imagined that the dispute
over what impartial observers now call ``those marbles'' would
still be raging on the eve of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could they have guessed that one of the world's great
museums _ itself nearing its 250th anniversary _ would now stand
accused as the latest ``dull spoiler'' of Greece's marble
masterpieces. That charge was leveled last year after the museum's
disclosure of a long-suppressed report showing that the museum had
``greatly damaged'' the marbles during an ill-advised attempt to
clean them in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any claim that the Elgin marbles have been well taken care of
is a cynical sham,'' says William St. Clair, a senior research
fellow at Trinity College in Cambridge, who obtained the report
after repeated requests for it under Britain's open records laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to 2 centimeters of the surface of some of the marbles has
been scraped,'' says St. Clair. ``The natural patina has been
removed. The Elgin marbles are physically very different now than
when they were first brought to London.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, museum officials now concede, a tragic error. After more
than a century in London's foul air, the sculptures had turned a
dirty gray. So when Lord Duveen commissioned a new wing for the
marbles _ the simple, but elegant gallery in which the disembodied
marbles stand today _ the museum decided to spruce them up a
little.
</P>
<P>
   Museum workers scrubbed the marbles. They scoured them with wire
brushes. And with blunt tools. And caustic chemicals. For 18 months
they cleaned the marbles until they were white. In the process,
they all but destroyed the stone's natural honey-colored patina,
scraped away the last traces of the original paint that had once
decorated the marbles and obliterated much of the fine detail on
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable museum officials were so horrified when they saw
what had happened that they fired the people responsible, erected a
barrier to keep spectators from inspecting the marbles too closely,
and kept the episode under wraps until St. Clair obtained it 60
years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``British authorities went to tremendous lengths, first of all
to pretend that nothing had happened, then to conceal the fact that
anything had happened, and then to prevent anyone from discovering
the truth by denying access to the records,'' St. Clair says.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials acknowledge that the report was initially
suppressed out of embarrassment over the incident, but they say the
damage to the marbles is not as severe as St. Clair claims.
</P>
<P>
   Greek diplomats insist that the incident shows that the British
have no moral authority to keep the marbles. Generations of Greeks
have insisted they never did. Like any controversy that has
festered for two centuries, however, morality is only part of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The current round of the dispute began in 1982, when actress
Melina Mercouri, the Greek minister of culture, formally asked the
British to return the marbles. After her death in 1994, the
campaign intensified, led by the Athens-based Mercouri Foundation,
which is headed by her widower, filmmaker Jules Dassin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear moral justification for returning the
marbles,'' says Dassin. As intense at the age of 88 as when he
directed ``Topkapi,'' in 1964, he seldom misses a chance to take a
swipe at the British. ``How could anyone think it was moral to take
hacksaws, cut away these magnificent sculptures and cart them off
to England? It is obscene to have the head of Athena here and the
torso there, Poseidon's balls in one place and his other body parts
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Some British leaders have been sympathetic to the Greek claims.
In the mid-1980s, Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock compared the
Parthenon without its marbles to a smile without a tooth. He vowed
that if the Labor Party ever came to power the sculptures would be
returned. When the party did in 1997, it took just 48 hours for
Prime Minister Tony Blair to reverse course and announce that the
marbles would stay in England.
</P>
<P>
   While Greece claims the high moral ground, the English case is
more legalistic. The British insist that their ownership of the
marbles is entirely legal. Elgin, they point out, had written
</P>
<P>
   permission from the Ottoman Turks, who ruled Greece during his
ambassadorship to take away ``some pieces of stone with
inscriptions or figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Greeks say Elgin, who plied Turkish officials with lavish gifts
to gain their favor, liberally interpreted ``some pieces'' to
include more than 150 linear yards of marble friezes, 15
high-relief sculptures, 19 free-standing sculptures and assorted
portions of other Greek monuments on the Acropolis _ several
shiploads of sculpture in all. And Greek legal experts point out
that even the Turks' agreement with Elgin specified that he do ``no
harm to the monuments.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of its public protestations, Greece has never taken
legal action to recover its treasures, and isn't likely to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the marbles are now in Britain, we would have to do it
under British law,'' Korka explains. ``We are reluctant to pursue
legal action because any decision would be final. Instead, we are
relying on public pressure.''

<P>
   The British Museum has 56 portions of the frieze, 15 high-relief
panels and 19 free-standing sculptures or partial sculptures from
the pediments.

   French consul and archaeologist Charles Champoiseau found pieces
of the headless statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, scattered
across a lonely hillside on the Aegean island of Samothrace in
1863. The head was never found, but the other 118 pieces were
reassembled at the Louvre, which has had it on display ever since.
Several years ago, the Greek government actually sent the Louvre
one of the statue's missing fingers so that it could be reattached.
But now, Giorgos Hanos, mayor of Samothrace, says the people of the
island want the 2,200-year-old statue returned. The Louvre has
refused. ``The world would be awfully sad if all archaeological
pieces had to be exhibited in their country of origin,'' says
Louvre spokesman Christophe Monin.

   German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann spent years excavating
ancient Troy in western Turkey. But when he smuggled King Priam's
gold hoard out of the country in his wife's petticoats in 1873, he
started a fuss that's tarnished his achievements. Until World War
II, Priam's gold _ incorrectly named for the Homeric king who
supposedly owned it _ was on display in Berlin. In 1945, it was
seized by the invading Russian army and taken to Moscow. Now,
despite President Boris Yeltsin's promise to return seized German
art, Russia's Constitutional Court has held that the treasure
should remain in Russia. Germany is pressing its case. Turkey is
planning to pursue its own claims to the treasure, and the heirs of
British archaeologist Frank Calvert say it belongs to them because
he owned half of Turkey's Hisarlik mound, where Schliemann found
it.

   EUPHRONIUS KRATER
</P>
<P>
   Who has it: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York
</P>
<P>
   Who wants it: The Italian government
</P>
<P>
   Status: Currently on display at the Met
</P>
<P>
   Former Met director Thomas Hoving suspected that the
2,500-year-old Greek vase, one of only a handful attributed to
Greek master painter Euphronius, might be ``sublime'' when he paid
a European art dealer $1 million for it in 1971. Later, after
Italian police informants reported that it had been looted from a
site north of Rome, it became known as the Met's ``hot pot.'' By
the time he had left the museum, even Hoving was convinced that it
probably had been looted. Despite its suspicions, the Italian
government has never taken legal action to recover the vase.

   HEAD OF DIADOUMENOS BY POLYKLEITOS
</P>
<P>
   Who had it: J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Who wanted it: No claims made
</P>
<P>
   Status: Returned to the Italian government
</P>
<P>
   The Getty received the second century marble head as part of the
$80 million Fleischman collection, which was donated to the museum
in 1996 _ and learned later from a specialist in Polykleitan
sculpture than it had been reported missing from an excavation
storeroom in southern Italy. The museum voluntarily returned it to
the Italian government.

   GHOST SHIRT FROM WOUNDED KNEE
</P>
<P>
   Who had it: Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow, Scotland, municipal
museum
</P>
<P>
   Who got it: Lakota Sioux Tribe
</P>
<P>
   Status: Buried on the Pine Ridge Reservation, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show donated the
bloodstained, fringed tunic to the Glasgow museum during a visit in
1892, two years after the Army killed more than 200 Sioux men,
women and children at Wounded Knee. John Earl, a Woodstock, Ga.,
attorney and Cherokee Indian, noticed the shirt _ worn by ``Ghost
Dance'' warriors who believed it would make them immune to the
white man's weapons _ in the Scottish museum in 1992. He notified
the Lakota's Wounded Knee Survivors Association and, after hearing
a series of pleas from the Lakota, the Glasgow City Council
voluntarily agreed to its return. The shirt was laid to rest in a
cemetery near the site of the Wounded Knee massacre.
</P>
<P>
   TORSO OF THE GOD MITHRA
</P>
<P>
   Who had it: J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Who wanted it: No claims made
</P>
<P>
   Status: Returned to the Italian government
</P>
<P>
   The Getty acquired the marble torso of the Persian god Mithra in
1982, with later additions of the arms and head. In the course of
its own research, the Getty discovered that the pieces had been
stolen from a private collection in Italy. It was turned over to
the Italian government for eventual return to the owner.

   WOODEN LINTEL FROM GUATEMALA
</P>
<P>
   Who had it: Denver Art Museum
</P>
<P>
   Who got it: Guatemalan Institute of Anthropology
</P>
<P>
   Status: On display at the National Museum of Archaeology in
Guatemala City
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-wide wooden lintel, a decorative portion of a
1,300-year-old door frame, disappeared from an archaeological site
in the Peten region of Guatemala in the 1960s. The Denver Art
Museum acquired it through donation in 1973 and only recently
concluded, from photographs showing it in place at the Mayan ruins
of El Zotz, that it should be returned to Guatemala. Although only
a dozen such pieces are known to exist, museum officials concede
they weren't giving up much. ``It was not on display at the time,''
says pre-Columbian Curator Margaret Young-Sanchez. ``It was a
wonderful piece, but it was not in good condition. Its limited
benefit to visitors was one of the reasons we decided to return
it.''

   ROSETTA STONE

<P>
   Who has it: The British Museum
</P>
<P>
   Who wants it: Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities
</P>
<P>
   Status: On display at the British Museum
</P>
<P>
   The world's most famous slab of black basalt was discovered near
Alexandria, Egypt, in 1799, as Napoleon's forces were constructing
a fort. The British took control of the stone two years later when
the French in Egypt surrendered to them. Inscriptions on the stone
contain a homage to King Ptolemy Epiphanes in three languages:
Greek, an ancient Egyptian language called demotic and
hieroglyphics. Because Western scholars understood Greek, they were
able to decipher the secrets of the hieroglyphic symbols, providing
a firm foundation for modern Egyptology. Egypt isn't happy that
this year's 200th anniversary of the discovery of the stone is
being celebrated at the British Museum. The Cairo Museum has a copy
of it.

 &HT;    Stakes are high in tug of war over artifacts
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the marbled elegance of the New York Metropolitan Museum of
Art's new Greek and Roman galleries, the waist-high display case
holding a 15-piece set of Greek silver is easy for the casual
visitor to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Museumgoers browsing the second-floor gallery would never know,
from the terse but vague description of its ``early Hellenistic''
origins, that the 2,200-year-old silver setting cost the museum a
tidy $2.7 million. Nor would they suspect that it lies at the
epicenter of a highly charged dispute over the future of the
Metropolitan and other museums as custodians of the world's
cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Italy claims that looters stole the Greek silver from an
archaeological site in Sicily about 1980, only a few years before
the Met bought it. The Met, which has displayed the silver
prominently since 1984, insists that it has seen no evidence to
support such charges. Italian authorities have not taken any direct
legal action to recover the silver, but two government ministries
are gathering evidence to make a case.
</P>
<P>
   Once revered as the guardians of cultural heritage, the Met and
other museums are increasingly being accused of hastening its
destruction. Countries and cultures whose art and artifacts have
stocked the world's museums for centuries want their treasures
back. And, in what museum officials see as alarming precedents,
some are getting them.
</P>
<P>
   Greece wants the British Museum to hand over the marbles that
Lord Elgin stripped from the Parthenon 200 years ago. Egypt wants
England to return the Rosetta stone and a fragment of the Great
Sphinx's beard. Nigeria wants its Benin bronzes, seized by a
British expeditionary force in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek island of Samothrace wants France to send home the
statue of Winged Victory that stands at the top of the Louvre's
main staircase. Turkey wants Germany to return the Trojan gold that
archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann smuggled out of the country in
1873. But the Turks are standing in line for the privilege: Germany
first has to get it back from the Russians, who took it from a
German museum during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The rising clamor for the return of ancient art and artifacts
reflects global changes in attitudes toward cultural property, and
the laws that affect it.
</P>
<P>
   Museums in the United States are returning human remains and
sacred objects to Native Americans. Museums throughout the world
are reviewing their collections to identify works that may have
been taken from Holocaust victims by the Nazis. And since 1970, two
major international treaties have created the legal framework for
countries that want to recover stolen or looted cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Some objects were looted
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to objects of archaeological importance, however,
museums are feeling the heat not only for what they have done, but
also for what they continue to do. Some critics say museums are
adding new material to their collections when an expanding
international market for ancient art is spurring demand for new
material _ and, in turn, the pillage of archaeological sites and
monuments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acquisitions by museums just create a bigger market, and there
is no doubt that some looted material is finding its way into
museums,'' says Manus Brinkman, secretary general of the
International Council of Museums in Paris, an affiliate of the
United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
which encourages museums to learn more about the things it buys and
receives as gifts before accepting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we published a list of 100 objects stolen from
Cambodia's temples in the 1980s, we have found missing pieces at
the Metropolitan Museum in New York, at Sotheby's, with an art
dealer in London, on the market in Hong Kong and at the Honolulu
Academy of Arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Sidibe, director of the national museum in the West
African nation of Mali, says museums contribute to the growing
market for antiquities from his country. ``Many of the rich
collections of African cultural heritage now found in northern
museums come from the pillage of archaeological sites,'' he says.
``By buying these objects on the market, museums are supporting the
despoliation of the patrimony of African countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Chippindale, a curator at the Cambridge University
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge, England,
agrees. ``Museums assembling a collection these days are forced to
take it from a small pool of private stuff that comes up for
sale,'' he says. ``But that small pool is constantly being topped
off with freshly looted and stolen material.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the world's most acquisitive museums, the Met, with
its familiar beaux arts facade on Fifth Avenue and 5 million
visitors a year, is at the center of the storm. And the case of the
Greek silver service promises to be one of the stormiest
controversies yet.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday afternoon last month, the scholar whose research is
destined to play a key role in the case strolled unnoticed among
the crowds in the Met's Greek and Roman galleries, pausing longer
than most at the case containing the 2,200-year-old silver
collection for a moment of reflection. University of Virginia
archaeologist Malcolm Bell III, the Andrew Mellon professor of
advanced studies at the National Gallery of Art, says the view of
the silver under glass was a melancholy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even tell you where it's from,'' he says. ``It's
tragic to see objects like this languish in a museum case without
context. The museum doesn't want to know too much about it, so
information gets suppressed. It's a shame because I have been able
to identify the house in Sicily where it was found. We know the
name of the owner who buried it in the third century B.C. We even
know the spot in the house where it was buried. I wish it were
possible for other people to know these things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's involvement stems from archaeological excavations he once
directed in Sicily _ at Morgantina, a part of the Hellenistic
kingdom of Syracuse, until it fell to the Romans in the third
century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   It was from Morgantina, police informants have told Italian
authorities, that the Met's silver collection _ or one very much
like it _ was unearthed by local tomb robbers. One particular piece
described by informants was a silver medallion depicting the sea
monster Scylla, similar to the one in the Met's collection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Italian authorities asked Bell to investigate the story
on two fronts: through new digs in Italy and through a closer look
at the Met's silver. Bell completed his excavations in 1998, but it
wasn't until this year that the Met agreed to let him examine the
silver.
</P>
<P>
   He turned over his findings to an Italian magistrate in May. He
won't disclose the details, but he doesn't mind summarizing his
conclusions. ``The uncertainty about the origins of these pieces is
decreasing,'' he says. ``I am more convinced than ever that they
came from Morgantina.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Holzer, the museum's vice president for communications,
says the Met is doing its own research on the collection. ``Because
this is an ongoing effort, we cannot discuss the case in further
detail,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials have told U.S. Customs officials that the
silver collection was purchased, in two installments, through
European art dealer Robert Hecht Jr., who told them that it had
been owned for decades by a Lebanese art dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The story _ right down to the Lebanese owners and Hecht as
intermediary _ echoes another controversial acquisition by the Met:
the $1 million purchase in 1971 of a spectacular 2,500-year-old
vase, a krater decorated by the Greek master painter, Euphronius.
Italian police informants later reported that it had been looted
from a site north of Rome and smuggled out of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Even former museum director Thomas Hoving, who once admitted ``a
near-sexual pleasure'' from obtaining the Euphronius krater for the
Met, has since acknowledged that the krater _ forever known in New
York art circles as the Met's ``hot pot'' _ probably was smuggled
out of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Italy long ago barred Hecht from the country for his alleged
role in the incident, but the Euphronius krater _ with its
red-painted figures depicting a scene from Homer of the dead
warrior Sarpedon _ remains on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 2 million works of art,'' says Holzer. ``We're not
about to start returning things just because someone asks for them.
But we are always willing to look at any evidence that is brought
to our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Met has voluntarily returned some contested objects in
recent years. When curators discovered they had the missing heads
of a 10th century Khmer temple sculpture being sought by the
International Council of Museums, it was returned to Cambodia in
1996. It also sent a 10th century stone Buddha back to India.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive legal battle
</P>
<P>
   The Met parted with another famous collection more reluctantly.
In 1993, the museum ended a six-year dispute with Turkey over the
Lydian Hoard, a 225-piece collection of sixth century B.C. gold,
silver and bronze artifacts that the government claimed had been
looted from sites near Sardis in the 1960s. The Met, which paid
$1.5 million for the collection, argued that the statute of
limitations had expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them to return the pieces, and they said no, so we
hired a law firm in New York and sued them,'' says Engin Ozgen,
former director general of Turkey's museums. ``Eventually, they
said they were willing to settle. They came to Turkey, and we
bartered. It was like in the bazaar. They offered half and we said
no. They offered three-quarters and we said no. Finally they gave
in.''

   Of the hundreds of museum visits in a lifetime, none moved me
quite as much as the stops photographer David Tulis and I made in
London and Athens for these articles _ the third installment of
``The Past in Peril'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a busy Sunday at the British Museum, there's a reverent
hush among the crowd in the Duveen Gallery, where the Parthenon
marbles are exhibited. They are magnificent, but eerie _ headless,
limbless, disembodied torsos. They look a little lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning on the Acropolis, before the tourists
arrive, there's a different kind of quiet _ punctuated by the
chip-chip of marble workers sculpting the stone with which Greece
hopes to partially restore the 2,500-year symbol of its Golden Age.
You won't find marble sculptures on the Parthenon, either. They're
in a nearby museum, looking a little lost.
</P>
<P>
   After 200 years of sound and fury over who should have the
marbles, two moments of silence a thousand miles apart open the
door to this thought. The fuss over the marbles, like disputes over
cultural property in other museums, is really an argument over
custody. Ownership is another matter. The world's cultural
treasures really belong to humanity.

   ATHENS: on public pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   UNESCO, the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, has listened patiently to Greek pleas, but has no
power to compel the return of the marbles, which were taken long
before today's international agreements on rights to cultural
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every few years since 1984, we have tried to broker some
agreement between the two countries, so far without success,'' says
David Walden of Canada, the chairman of the UNESCO's cultural
property committee. ``We met with both countries in January 1999,
but there was only a further hardening of positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Legalities and politics aside, those on Britain's side insist
that the Parthenon marbles _ even after the disastrous cleaning _
have fared better in London during the past 200 years than they
would have in Athens, where the last two centuries have witnessed
revolution, earthquakes and some of the world's worst air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is clearly struggling with the upkeep of the Acropolis'
architectural treasures. Although there have been a number of
restorations since 1834, all of the ancient structures _ the
Parthenon, as well as the temple of Athena Nike, the Propylaea and
the Erechtheon _ show evidence of damage from acid rain, soot from
air pollution and the inevitable effects of aging. In some cases,
restoration has done more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only took Pericles eight years to build the Parthenon and
another eight for the sculptures,'' says Nikos Toganidis, the
architect in charge of the current Acropolis restoration. ``We
started our current restoration in 1984 but we are far from
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beneath a giant construction crane that rises from the
center of the Parthenon while the chip-chip of marble workers'
hammers rings in the air, he shakes his head sadly at the thought
the task is unlikely to be completed in his lifetime. ``We don't
have enough marble workers to go any faster. And we don't have
enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   High on the eastern pediment, the head of a horse and a
reclining Dionysus provide a tantalizing hint of what the
Parthenon's decorative marbles may once have looked like at the
height of its glory. Even the hint is illusory.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the caustic nature of Athens air, the Greek
Ministry of Culture moved its own marbles _ the ones that Elgin
left behind _ into a nearby museum in 1992. Officials acknowledge
that even if the rest of the marbles are returned they will not be
reattached to the facade of the Parthenon _ merely housed on a new,
grander museum, now under construction at the foot of the
Acropolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we need a proper museum to display the marbles
properly,'' says Sotiris Mousouris, president of the Organization
for Construction of New Acropolis Museum. ``The existing museum on
the rock is much too small.''
</P>
<P>
   The new museum, however, has encountered its own problems.
Selection of the architect, Nicollete Passorini, consumed two years
of Greek political squabbling. Then, no sooner had workers broken
ground for the new structure than they discovered it lay atop a
2,300-year-old Roman neighborhood. The required archaeological
excavations are expected to delay the start of construction at
least until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, the debate is about more than marbles _
even more than a debate about magnificent, 2,500-year-old marbles
from the birthplace of democracy. In the end it is about who owns
culture _ and how, in a world of so many diverse cultures, it
should be preserved and appreciated, and by whom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British say more people will see the marbles in London
because the British Museum has more than 3 million people a year
and the Parthenon only has a little over a million visitors,''
Dassin says. ``But the marbles belong in Greece. If all the number
of people who saw them were all that mattered, we would send them
to Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who would keep the marbles in London, however, see another
issue looming on the horizon. Since its founding in 1754, the
British Museum, like most of the world's great museums, has
assiduously gathered art and artifacts from the far corners of the
world. Many of the 7 million objects in the museum collection might
have been lost, forgotten or destroyed had they not been curated at
the sprawling museum on Great Russell Street, now in the midst of
its own $150 million reconstruction project.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, with increasing frequency, countries which some objects
came are asking _ even demanding _ they be returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not recommend to Parliament that the marbles be
returned,'' museum director Anderson says adamantly. ``We have some
very important material from all over the world. If we return the
marbles, it will only encourage more requests like this, and I am
not going to be the known as director of the British Museum who
started disassembling the collections.''

   UNDATEDU museum in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal costs to Turkey were about $2 million,'' says Ozgen.
``It was very expensive, but we wanted to send a message. We think
we have it all now, but for all we know the Met may still have some
of it in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many disputes involve pieces purchased outright,
museums are also discovering that donated items _ even those from
revered patrons and trustees _ can be hot potatoes. The Boston
Museum of Fine Arts found itself in the spotlight last year because
Guatemala claimed that 25 pieces of Mayan pottery donated by
trustee Landon Clay, were looted and illegally exported. Although
the provenience _ the place where the objects were originally found
_ is unknown, the pieces remain on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guatemala has offered no proof that they were removed from the
country illegally,'' says Brent Benjamin, deputy director for
curatorial affairs for the museum. ``Many of the objects we have
are unprovenienced. That is often the case. You can't run down the
provenience of every item.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Art Museum recently returned a 1,300-year-old carved
Mayan lintel, part of an architectural door frame, to Guatemala
when it was discovered to have been stolen from an archaeological
site in the Peten region of Guatemala only a few years before being
donated to the museum in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Most items in museums today were looted or stolen at some point.
Romans looted Greek cities. The barbarians looted Rome. Over the
centuries, many art treasures might have been lost forever had they
not been saved in museums. Many others, however, might have never
been dug up at all, if museums hadn't been so determined to build
their collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums were founded in a time when knowledge was compiled
encyclopedically, on the assumption that all knowledge was
useful,'' says Robert Anderson, director of the British Museum.
``Our philosophy is to have the best of everything from all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the London museum's ongoing feud with Greece over the
Parthenon marbles is the best-known dispute, it's not the only one
of its 7 million pieces being contested.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the museum celebrates this year's 200th anniversary of
the discovery of the Rosetta stone _ one of its biggest attractions
_ it is fending off requests by Egypt to return the rock that
helped break the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics. The stone was
actually found by Napoleon's forces in 1799. The British didn't get
it until the French surrendered it to them two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get 20 or 30 requests a year for returns,'' says Anderson.
``There are strong feelings behind most requests. But they all
receive a no in the most understandingly possible way. We are not
going to give up the world of objects we have assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   Because museums differ so widely in size, mission, budget and
behavior, generalizations about their stewardship of cultural
history are all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the material in American museums is legally
there,'' says Edward Able, president of the American Association of
Museums, which represents 3,100 institutions. ``Our code of ethics
makes it clear that objects should be legally acquired. But museums
have a right to insist a claim of ownership be proved. In every
instance where that has been established, museums have returned the
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent clear proof, museums have very different responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many museums simply assume that all objects are innocent until
proven guilty,'' says Marion True, curator of antiquities for the
J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. ``They may make inquiries, but
if an object has been illicitly excavated, no one will know it is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any major acquisitions without established provenience are
quite likely to have come from illicit excavations. There is simply
not that much major material out there in old collections that is
unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to clean up its own act, Getty trustees now require
the museum to seek comment on new pieces from the country of origin
and to refuse any that were not in an established collection before
1995.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore its new attitude, the museum this year voluntarily
sent three important pieces back to Italy. The returns included
what True calls one of the museum's ``great vases'' _ a drinking
cup by the Greek painter Euphronius, which the Getty bought from a
European dealer in 1983, but later concluded must have been
illegally excavated.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy did not, to the dismay of some archaeologists,
deter the Getty from accepting $80 million worth of classical
antiquities from New York art collectors Barbara and Lawrence
Fleischman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the 295 entries in the recent catalog of the Fleischman
collection, not one had an archaeological provenience,'' says
Boston University archaeologist Ricardo Elia, a regular critic of
the trade in illicit antiquities. ``Unfortunately, that's not
uncommon. In the last few years I have looked at over 30 private
and institutional collections. Overall, 85 to 90 percent of the
objects give no indication of a previous owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mum's usually the word
</P>
<P>
   Because many museums keep their detailed information in private,
so-called deep files, it is difficult for third parties to find out
what the museum itself knows _ or doesn't _ about its acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art world is famously discreet about how it conducts
business,'' says Anthony Hirschel, director of the Michael C.
Carlos Museum at Emory University. ``Some even say that it couldn't
function if there were more light cast on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask for documentation, but if we're told it doesn't exist,
it becomes a judgment call. If it's some minor pieces, it's easy to
have high principles. It is much harder to resist the temptation
when you are presented with an object that might transform your
collection or, in the case of the MFA, when it comes from one of
your major benefactors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Getty's True says balancing museum interests against the
worldwide loss of archaeological resources may require drastic
measures. ``We may need some kind of moratorium on the importation
of works of art,'' she says. ``During that moratorium, pieces
currently on the market should be inventoried and documented. After
that, if there is no documentation, it should be clear that it is
recently excavated material and probably illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Most museums, however, are discovering that there are major gaps
in what they know about material they own.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the effort to track down looted Nazi art, the French
government concluded that as many as 2,000 artworks in its national
museums may have been looted from European Jews by the Nazis or
sold under duress. Tens of thousands of pieces in museums
throughout the world may be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the passage of the Native American Graves and
Repatriation Act required more than 1,000 U.S. museums to inventory
their collections in preparation for returning human remains and
sacred objects to Indian tribes. Many museums were surprised by
what they found.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology, one of the most
reputable in the country, discovered that instead of the 7,000
Indian remains officials thought they had, the Peabody actually had
15,000. And although the museum thought it had 800,000 Native
American artifacts, the survey turned up 8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Museums have raised the specter that repatriations _ whether to
Indians or countries of origin _ threaten to empty their display
cases. Experience suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   At the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History, only one of the
250,000 artifacts inventoried for possible return to the tribes was
actually removed from public display. The rest were in storage or
in the museum's research collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most museums have 90 percent of their collections in
storage,'' says Maxwell Anderson, director of the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York, and former director of Emory University's
Carlos Museum. ``They don't need to be going out into the market to
buy material that encourages tomb robbers, forgers and smugglers.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much in their basements, and so little certifiably legal
material on the open market, why do museums still vie for one more
piece of culture for posterity?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a prevailing feeling in the museum world that
museums need to make spectacular additions, no matter how much they
already own,'' says Martin Sullivan, chairman of the U.S. State
Department's Cultural Property Advisory Committee, which advises
the government on actions to limit illicit trade in antiquities.
``This is a very competitive industry and spectacular new things
mean more visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But museums enjoy special benefits under the tax code, and
they need to remember that they have special obligations to the
public,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many museums are still thinking in terms of ownership,
rather than custody and care of the objects they own. There has to
be a realization that countries which have traditionally been the
source of ancient art are losing their heritage and it is hurtful
to them. Museums started out being institutions for the
preservation of cultural heritage. We have to get back to that _
and find some new ways to do it.''

 &HT;    Details behind the objects
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In what for many museums is rare candor, Emory
University's Michael C. Carlos Museum opened its files to reveal
what it knows _ and doesn't know _ about several objects selected
by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Each of the 16,000 objects in
the museum has its own story, but for many _ like most pieces in
most museums _the history of their recent travels and previous
ownership is thinly documented.
</P>
<P>
   Linen-shrouded mummy of a middle-aged man
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, probably 167-30 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   One of 250 objects collected by William Arthur Shelton of
Emory's divinity school during a 1920 expedition to Egypt and the
Near East. Financing for the expedition by Atlanta cotton merchant
John Manget included use of an armor-plated Rolls Royce mounted
with a machine gun to ward off bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Light tan storage jar with double handle
</P>
<P>
   Israel, Middle Bronze Age, 1800-1550 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   One of many pieces excavated from Tomb J42 in Jericho by Dame
Kathleen Kenyon of the British School of Archaeology in 1955.
Financial backing for the dig by Emory assured the museum a portion
of the artifacts recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Matched pair of clay figures, Ixtan del Rio style
</P>
<P>
   Nayarit, western Mexico, 200 B.C. to A.D. 200
</P>
<P>
   One of 299 pre-Columbian artifacts donated to the museum in 1990
by William and Carol Thibadeau of Atlanta. The deed of gift says
the pair of seated figurines are thought to have been ``imported
into the United States prior to 1983.'' Thibadeau got them in
barter for a used Oldsmobile from Enrique Vargas, a Costa Rican
artifact dealer who claimed they had been sold off by the Denver
Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan polychrome cylinder vessel with underworld scene
</P>
<P>
   eten region, Guatemala, Late Classic Period, A.D. 670 - 750
(Pictured on cover)
</P>
<P>
   Described by the museum as ``the finest piece of our
meso-American holdings.'' Donated in 1990 by William and Carol
Thibadeau, who paid $1,800 for it at an artifact show at Duke
University in the mid-1980s. Thought to have been imported before
1983. Removed from display for several months after curators
determined that a portion of the design was a forgery. The
overpainted portion has been stripped off and the vase is back on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Marble head of AphroditePossibly Greek, first century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased from Acanthus Gallery in New York in 1992. Price
undisclosed. Previously owned by a duke in Northern Ireland who, as
a condition of sale, insisted that he ``be not in any way
approached or contacted'' by anyone wanting to know more about the
piece. Not reported stolen, according to International Foundation
for Art Research database.
</P>
<P>
   Headless marble torso of Roman citizen in toga
</P>
<P>
   Roman or Greek Ionian,
</P>
<P>
   A.D. first century
</P>
<P>
   Purchased for $175,000 from London art dealer Bruce McAlpine.
Reported to have been part of an unidentified Austrian collection
for two generations. Warranted by McAlpine that it complies with
the export law of the country of origin, although the country of
origin is undetermined, and all U.S. import laws.
</P>
<P>
   Marble funery urn of Gaius Pompeius Ireneus
</P>
<P>
   Roman, Flavian period, first century
</P>
<P>
   Donated by William and Carol Thibadeau in 1997. They bought it
for an undisclosed sum in 1990 from Laurence Witten, who shipped it
to them via United Parcel Service with a cautionary note to ``avoid
hernia when lifting it about.'' Witten purchased it in the 1960s
from Carlebach Galleries in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Black-figure kylix, attributed to the Parisian Gigantomachy
Painter
</P>
<P>
   Greek, late Archaic, 480 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased, for an undisclosed sum, at a European auction from
Kunst der Antike, a Swiss dealer in antiquities. Reported to have
been owned by an E. Studer, a collector of ancient art from Lugano,
Switzerland. The only published mention of it before its sale to
the Carlos was in 1993 in the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, a
multi-volume compendium of ancient vases. Previous whereabouts,
date of export and country of origin are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   153,000 pot shards, varying sizes and colors
</P>
<P>
   Wadi Mujib area, Jordan, 400 B.C. to present
</P>
<P>
   Collected by Emory archaeologists from 443 sites on the Al-Kerak
plateau between 1978 and 1983 as part of an archaeological survey
of the ancient land of Moab. Released to Emory in 1988 by Jordan's
department of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Burnished brownware vessel with feline headed snake motif
</P>
<P>
   Coastal Peru, Chavin culture, about 700 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   One of 223 pre-Columbian pieces donated to museum in 1991 by
William and Carol Thibeadeau of Atlanta. Date of import and origins
unknown. The deed of gift declares that, to the Thibadeaus'
knowledge, it was ``not imported into or from any country contrary
to its laws.'' Peru has forbidden the export of cultural objects
since 1926. The United States banned the import of Chavin artifacts
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Red-figure volute krater by the Underworld Painter
</P>
<P>
   Apulia, Italy, 350-340 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased for an undisclosed sum in 1994 from an art broker in
Riehen, Switzerland, who reported that the previous owner
``acquired the vase in the late '60s.'' Earliest public exhibit was
at an exhibition in Geneva in 1986. Bill of sale warrants that the
vase was exported ``in conformity'' of the laws of the country of
origin. Italy has forbidden the unauthorized export of all ancient
art since 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Bronze tumi, in the form of the Sican lord
</P>
<P>
   Central Peru, Inca culture, 900-1100 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   One of 57 pre-Columbian artifacts donated in 1994 by Laurence
and Cora Witten, of Vero Beach, Fla. The deed of gift states it is
not known to have been ``imported or exported from any country
contrary to its laws.'' The date of import is unknown. The United
States has banned the import of Inca artifacts from Peru since
1997.

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    Carlos Museum tempers desire to acquire
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ LIKE MANY MUSEUMS THESE DAYS, the Michael C. Carlos
Museum at Emory University is taking a closer look at its holdings.
Unlike many museums, it is being disarmingly open about what it
knows _ and what it doesn't know _ about its collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every museum has skeletons in its closets,'' says museum
director Anthony Hirschel. ``We have them too, but we are trying
hard to find them and do the right thing when we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mayan cyclinder vase the museum once called ``the finest
piece in our meso-American holdings,'' for instance, has finally
been returned to its display case after six months of
rehabilitation by a New York conservator.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-inch high polychrome vase is now minus most of the
familiar spear-wielding warrior god that museum goers saw during
the eight years in was previously on exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The vase dated from about A.D. 650, in the Peten region of
Guatemala. The painted warrior, unfortunately, dated from the
1960s, probably from somewhere in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered, on close examination, that the side of the vase
we were exhibiting had been rather creatively imagined by some
fellow who overpainted it in modern times,'' Hirschel says. ``The
things he added are gone now. That side is now mostly just a patch
of brown. We turned it around so that people can now see the side
that we now know to be genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   The forged portion of the Mayan cylinder vase was discovered in
the course of the museum's effort to publish its massive collection
of ancient American artifacts _ the first comprehensive catalog of
its holdings the museum has ever conducted.
</P>
<P>
   For an institution that started out in 1876 as a few dusty
display cases in the library of Emory's old Oxford, Ga., campus,
the Carlos _ now housed on Emory's quadrangle in a modern,
neo-Florentine building designed by architect Michael Graves _ has
come a long way. Many of the 16,000 items it owns, including
Georgia's oldest Maytag washer, have been relegated to storage to
make room for its growing collection of pre-Columbian, Egyptian,
Greek, Roman and African materials.
</P>
<P>
   With a budget of only $2.5 million a year, the Carlos is spared
the temptation of trying to compete head-to-head for new material
with the country's major museums, which sometimes pay that much to
add a single piece to their permanent collections.
</P>
<P>
   But its reputation as an innovative, up-and-coming
university-affiliated art and archaeology museum keeps its staff
wary of any new material _ purchased or donated _ whose recent
history can't be documented sufficiently to assure that it has not
been stolen or looted.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's largest purchase, the $2 million Egyptian mummy
collection, acquired from the Niagara Falls Museum this year, was
possible not only because of a community fund-raising effort, but
also because the Carlos was sure that the mummies met the museum's
acquisition guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt comfortable with it because it had been assembled by a
group of people in the 1860s,'' says Hirschel. ``Abe Lincoln went
to see it. So did Jules Verne and Teddy Roosevelt. It was legally
exported a long time ago _ one of many such collections that people
in Egypt acquired for interested parties in Europe and America.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection greatly expands the museum's existing mummy
collection, begun by Emory theology professor William Shelton, who
mounted an expedition to the Near East in 1920 with financial
support from Atlanta cotton merchant John Manger.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Shelton and his staff traveled in an armor-plated
Rolls Royce as they collected more than 250 artifacts, mostly
Egyptian and Babylonian, for the museum. These days, such activity
is outlawed in most of the countries Shelton visited.
</P>
<P>
   As concern grows that museums' acquisitive nature contributes to
the trade in stolen and looted antiquities, Carlos officials have
grown increasingly suspicious of new materials whose recent
ownership can't be easily tracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very careful about material from Latin America,'' says
Rebecca Stone-Miller, the museum's curator of ancient American
arts. ``We're suspicious of anything that has come through Europe,
which is the main conduit for illicit objects. If it looks like it
has been laundered through Europe, we won't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for a museum determined to ``do the right thing,'' the
decision can be agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one buying trip to Europe last year, I encountered a Swiss
dealer who had a very beautiful Greek antiquity: a statue of
Aphrodite,'' Hirschel says. ``Because we don't have a nude female
in our collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, it would have
made a perfect addition. It was early second century, 4 feet high,
broken at knees and neck. It was very beautiful and at $100,000 it
seemed reasonably priced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have bought it on the spot, but the dealer didn't have
any documentation. He said it had been in a mysterious old French
collection, but because the owner didn't want to disclose that for
tax reasons, he couldn't prove it. So I had to let it go. When I
asked later about the fate of my lost love, I was told she had been
sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the museum does occasionally indulge its passion for
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschel, formerly director of the University of Virginia's
Bayley Museum, is especially proud of a red and black Greek
drinking cup, a kylix, which the museum bought from a Swiss dealer
last year for a sum reputed to be in the $100,000 range. The piece
now occupies a small alcove in the museum's Greek and Roman
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that an awful lot of art passes through Switzerland to
erase any problems it may have, but in this case we knew it came
from the highly regarded Studen collection in Lugano, Switzerland,
so we felt comfortable with it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like most museums, most of the Carlos' holdings are a result of
others' generosity. Over the past 10 years, the museum has received
more than $3 million worth of pre-Columbian materials from the
private collection of Carol and William Thibadeau, who founded the
Atlanta real estate company that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Thibadeau collected arrowheads along Peachtree
Creek. Later in life, the collecting bug bit with a vengeance and
he began buying pre-Columbian material from dealers in Central
America. ``Sometimes they would come to Atlanta,'' he says. ``And
sometimes they would just send us things. Prices were much lower
then. A piece you could buy for $5 or $6 then, now costs 20 or 30
times that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to go to the airport and pick up huge crates of
artifacts. It went through Customs with no trouble. We'd buy what
we wanted and store the rest of it in our garage until they were
ready to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thibadeau, 79, still recalls the details of many of the 1,300
pieces he donated to the museum: The matched pair of 2,000-year-old
clay figures, Ixtan del Rio style, that he got from Costa Rican art
dealer Enrique Vargas in exchange for a used Oldsmobile, the Mayan
polychrome vase _ now known to have been overpainted by forgers _
that he paid $1,800 for at a show at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Thibadeau, who continues to collect, says it was his wife's
insistence that he ``clean out'' the basement that prompted the
series of gifts to the Carlos _ which he chose, in part, because of
frequent visits to the old Emory museum.
</P>
<P>
   Because any undocumented piece has the potential to tarnish its
reputation, however, the museum is careful, even about generous
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have turned down some gifts because the owners didn't know
where they came from,'' Hirschel says. ``If it doesn't have proper
paperwork, we can't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outright ownership, however, is not the only way for a museum to
offer quality art and archaeology to the public. The Carlos' former
director, Maxwell Anderson, who now heads the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York, inaugurated an ambitious program of
inter-museum loans that many experts believe should be the future
standard for museums that don't want to encourage illicit traffic
in antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loans can give museums like the Carlos access to materials
that they could never afford _ from places like the Louvre and
institutions of that caliber,'' Anderson says. ``It also provides a
sensible alternative to the rapacious acquisition that has
contributed to the worldwide market in ancient art.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschel agrees. ``It provides a way for people who come to the
museum to see the cultural heritage of other parts of the world
without them having to fear that those treasures are being spirited
away,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do our best. But regardless of what we do, we will
never be able to eliminate illegal exploitation of archaeological
sites. And we are never going to suppress the urge to collect. It
is basic to human nature.''

 &HT;    The Past in Peril
 &HT;    Greece fights Britain for all of the marbles
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Greece wants its marbles back. All of them. And soon.
Preferably in time to show them to the world when Athens hosts the
Olympic Games in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years after Scotland's Lord Elgin stripped most of
the marble sculptures from the towering pediments of Athens'
Parthenon, Greece is turning up the heat on one of the world's most
enduring feuds over the rights to cultural property _ hoping that a
little public humiliation will accomplish what decades of dogged
diplomacy have failed to do: bring the marbles home.
</P>
<P>
   The Parthenon, built atop the highest point of the Acropolis,
towers as imposingly over Athens today as it did 2,500 years ago.
But for those who want to fully appreciate the artistic high point
of Athenian democracy, the line forms not at the foot of Athens'
sacred rock, but just off Great Russell Street in London.
</P>
<P>
   It is there, at the British Museum, that most of the surviving
marble sculptures _ 88 magnificent works of ancient art in all _
have resided since the museum bought them from a cash-strapped Lord
Elgin in 1816.
</P>
<P>
   And it is there, says the head of the world's best-known museum,
that they should stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marbles were acquired legally,'' says museum director
Robert Anderson, mincing no words with diplomatic niceties. ``They
are our property. They have been an important part of British
cultural life for two centuries. This is where they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   But not according to Greece, which contends that the marbles _
interpretations of mythology by Phidias, ancient Athens' greatest
and most prolific sculptor _ have been a part of Greek cultural
life for a lot more than two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marbles belong in Athens,'' says archaeologist Heleni
Korka, secretary of Hellenic Committee for Restitution of Parthenon
Marbles. ``The marbles are not free-standing works of art. They are
an integral part of the Parthenon. They belong together. And they
belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   The relative positions of the parties have changed little since
1802 when Thomas Bruce, the seventh earl of Elgin and Britain's
ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, took down the marble freizes,
reliefs and sculptures and, with a little help from the British
Navy, shipped them off to London for ``safekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elgin wasn't planning to stock a museum. The headless Iris,
the torso of Hermes, the breast of Athena and the other marbles
that he took were intended to grace his home in Scotland. Even in
those days it was an audacious example of cultural piracy _ an act
that prompted his fellow nobleman, Lord Byron, to publicly
castigate him as ``the last, the worst dull spoiler'' of one of the
world's architectural wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Byron nor Elgin could have imagined that the dispute
over what impartial observers now call ``those marbles'' would
still be raging on the eve of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could they have guessed that one of the world's great
museums _ itself nearing its 250th anniversary _ would now stand
accused as the latest ``dull spoiler'' of Greece's marble
masterpieces. That charge was leveled last year after the museum's
disclosure of a long-suppressed report showing that the museum had
``greatly damaged'' the marbles during an ill-advised attempt to
clean them in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any claim that the Elgin marbles have been well taken care of
is a cynical sham,'' says William St. Clair, a senior research
fellow at Trinity College in Cambridge, who obtained the report
after repeated requests for it under Britain's open records laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to 2 centimeters of the surface of some of the marbles has
been scraped,'' says St. Clair. ``The natural patina has been
removed. The Elgin marbles are physically very different now than
when they were first brought to London.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, museum officials now concede, a tragic error. After more
than a century in London's foul air, the sculptures had turned a
dirty gray. So when Lord Duveen commissioned a new wing for the
marbles _ the simple, but elegant gallery in which the disembodied
marbles stand today _ the museum decided to spruce them up a
little.
</P>
<P>
   Museum workers scrubbed the marbles. They scoured them with wire
brushes. And with blunt tools. And caustic chemicals. For 18 months
they cleaned the marbles until they were white. In the process,
they all but destroyed the stone's natural honey-colored patina,
scraped away the last traces of the original paint that had once
decorated the marbles and obliterated much of the fine detail on
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable museum officials were so horrified when they saw
what had happened that they fired the people responsible, erected a
barrier to keep spectators from inspecting the marbles too closely,
and kept the episode under wraps until St. Clair obtained it 60
years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``British authorities went to tremendous lengths, first of all
to pretend that nothing had happened, then to conceal the fact that
anything had happened, and then to prevent anyone from discovering
the truth by denying access to the records,'' St. Clair says.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials acknowledge that the report was initially
suppressed out of embarrassment over the incident, but they say the
damage to the marbles is not as severe as St. Clair claims.
</P>
<P>
   Greek diplomats insist that the incident shows that the British
have no moral authority to keep the marbles. Generations of Greeks
have insisted they never did. Like any controversy that has
festered for two centuries, however, morality is only part of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   The current round of the dispute began in 1982, when actress
Melina Mercouri, the Greek minister of culture, formally asked the
British to return the marbles. After her death in 1994, the
campaign intensified, led by the Athens-based Mercouri Foundation,
which is headed by her widower, filmmaker Jules Dassin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear moral justification for returning the
marbles,'' says Dassin. As intense at the age of 88 as when he
directed ``Topkapi,'' in 1964, he seldom misses a chance to take a
swipe at the British. ``How could anyone think it was moral to take
hacksaws, cut away these magnificent sculptures and cart them off
to England? It is obscene to have the head of Athena here and the
torso there, Poseidon's balls in one place and his other body parts
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Some British leaders have been sympathetic to the Greek claims.
In the mid-1980s, Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock compared the
Parthenon without its marbles to a smile without a tooth. He vowed
that if the Labor Party ever came to power the sculptures would be
returned. When the party did in 1997, it took just 48 hours for
Prime Minister Tony Blair to reverse course and announce that the
marbles would stay in England.
</P>
<P>
   While Greece claims the high moral ground, the English case is
more legalistic. The British insist that their ownership of the
marbles is entirely legal. Elgin, they point out, had written
</P>
<P>
   permission from the Ottoman Turks, who ruled Greece during his
ambassadorship to take away ``some pieces of stone with
inscriptions or figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Greeks say Elgin, who plied Turkish officials with lavish gifts
to gain their favor, liberally interpreted ``some pieces'' to
include more than 150 linear yards of marble friezes, 15
high-relief sculptures, 19 free-standing sculptures and assorted
portions of other Greek monuments on the Acropolis _ several
shiploads of sculpture in all. And Greek legal experts point out
that even the Turks' agreement with Elgin specified that he do ``no
harm to the monuments.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of its public protestations, Greece has never taken
legal action to recover its treasures, and isn't likely to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the marbles are now in Britain, we would have to do it
under British law,'' Korka explains. ``We are reluctant to pursue
legal action because any decision would be final. Instead, we are
relying on public pressure.''

   ATHENS: on public pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   UNESCO, the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, has listened patiently to Greek pleas, but has no
power to compel the return of the marbles, which were taken long
before today's international agreements on rights to cultural
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every few years since 1984, we have tried to broker some
agreement between the two countries, so far without success,'' says
David Walden of Canada, the chairman of the UNESCO's cultural
property committee. ``We met with both countries in January 1999,
but there was only a further hardening of positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Legalities and politics aside, those on Britain's side insist
that the Parthenon marbles _ even after the disastrous cleaning _
have fared better in London during the past 200 years than they
would have in Athens, where the last two centuries have witnessed
revolution, earthquakes and some of the world's worst air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is clearly struggling with the upkeep of the Acropolis'
architectural treasures. Although there have been a number of
restorations since 1834, all of the ancient structures _ the
Parthenon, as well as the temple of Athena Nike, the Propylaea and
the Erechtheon _ show evidence of damage from acid rain, soot from
air pollution and the inevitable effects of aging. In some cases,
restoration has done more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only took Pericles eight years to build the Parthenon and
another eight for the sculptures,'' says Nikos Toganidis, the
architect in charge of the current Acropolis restoration. ``We
started our current restoration in 1984 but we are far from
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing beneath a giant construction crane that rises from the
center of the Parthenon while the chip-chip of marble workers'
hammers rings in the air, he shakes his head sadly at the thought
the task is unlikely to be completed in his lifetime. ``We don't
have enough marble workers to go any faster. And we don't have
enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   High on the eastern pediment, the head of a horse and a
reclining Dionysus provide a tantalizing hint of what the
Parthenon's decorative marbles may once have looked like at the
height of its glory. Even the hint is illusory.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the caustic nature of Athens air, the Greek
Ministry of Culture moved its own marbles _ the ones that Elgin
left behind _ into a nearby museum in 1992. Officials acknowledge
that even if the rest of the marbles are returned they will not be
reattached to the facade of the Parthenon _ merely housed on a new,
grander museum, now under construction at the foot of the
Acropolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we need a proper museum to display the marbles
properly,'' says Sotiris Mousouris, president of the Organization
for Construction of New Acropolis Museum. ``The existing museum on
the rock is much too small.''
</P>
<P>
   The new museum, however, has encountered its own problems.
Selection of the architect, Nicollete Passorini, consumed two years
of Greek political squabbling. Then, no sooner had workers broken
ground for the new structure than they discovered it lay atop a
2,300-year-old Roman neighborhood. The required archaeological
excavations are expected to delay the start of construction at
least until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, the debate is about more than marbles _
even more than a debate about magnificent, 2,500-year-old marbles
from the birthplace of democracy. In the end it is about who owns
culture _ and how, in a world of so many diverse cultures, it
should be preserved and appreciated, and by whom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British say more people will see the marbles in London
because the British Museum has more than 3 million people a year
and the Parthenon only has a little over a million visitors,''
Dassin says. ``But the marbles belong in Greece. If all the number
of people who saw them were all that mattered, we would send them
to Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who would keep the marbles in London, however, see another
issue looming on the horizon. Since its founding in 1754, the
British Museum, like most of the world's great museums, has
assiduously gathered art and artifacts from the far corners of the
world. Many of the 7 million objects in the museum collection might
have been lost, forgotten or destroyed had they not been curated at
the sprawling museum on Great Russell Street, now in the midst of
its own $150 million reconstruction project.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, with increasing frequency, countries which some objects
came are asking _ even demanding _ they be returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not recommend to Parliament that the marbles be
returned,'' museum director Anderson says adamantly. ``We have some
very important material from all over the world. If we return the
marbles, it will only encourage more requests like this, and I am
not going to be the known as director of the British Museum who
started disassembling the collections.''

   WINGED VICTORY
</P>
<P>
   Who has it: The Louvre in Paris
</P>
<P>
   Who wants it: The Greek island of Samothrace
</P>
<P>
   Status: Still standing at the top of the Louvre's main staircase
</P>
<P>
   French consul and archaeologist Charles Champoiseau found pieces
of the headless statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, scattered
across a lonely hillside on the Aegean island of Samothrace in
1863. The head was never found, but the other 118 pieces were
reassembled at the Louvre, which has had it on display ever since.
Several years ago, the Greek government actually sent the Louvre
one of the statue's missing fingers so that it could be reattached.
But now, Giorgos Hanos, mayor of Samothrace, says the people of the
island want the 2,200-year-old statue returned. The Louvre has
refused. ``The world would be awfully sad if all archaeological
pieces had to be exhibited in their country of origin,'' says
Louvre spokesman Christophe Monin.
</P>
<P>
   PRIAM'S TREASURE
</P>
<P>
   Who has it: Pushkin State Fine Arts Museum in Moscow
</P>
<P>
   Who wants it: Germany, Turkey and private parties
</P>
<P>
   Status: Still in Moscow
</P>
<P>
   German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann spent years excavating
ancient Troy in western Turkey. But when he smuggled King Priam's
gold hoard out of the country in his wife's petticoats in 1873, he
started a fuss that's tarnished his achievements. Until World War
II, Priam's gold _ incorrectly named for the Homeric king who
supposedly owned it _ was on display in Berlin. In 1945, it was
seized by the invading Russian army and taken to Moscow. Now,
despite President Boris Yeltsin's promise to return seized German
art, Russia's Constitutional Court has held that the treasure
should remain in Russia. Germany is pressing its case. Turkey is
planning to pursue its own claims to the treasure, and the heirs of
British archaeologist Frank Calvert say it belongs to them because
he owned half of Turkey's Hisarlik mound, where Schliemann found
it.
</P>
<P>
   EUPHRONIUS KRATER
</P>
<P>
   Who has it: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York
</P>
<P>
   Who wants it: The Italian government
</P>
<P>
   Status: Currently on display at the Met
</P>
<P>
   Former Met director Thomas Hoving suspected that the
2,500-year-old Greek vase, one of only a handful attributed to
Greek master painter Euphronius, might be ``sublime'' when he paid
a European art dealer $1 million for it in 1971. Later, after
Italian police informants reported that it had been looted from a
site north of Rome, it became known as the Met's ``hot pot.'' By
the time he had left the museum, even Hoving was convinced that it
probably had been looted. Despite its suspicions, the Italian
government has never taken legal action to recover the vase.
</P>
<P>
   HEAD OF DIADOUMENOS BY POLYKLEITOS
</P>
<P>
   Who had it: J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Who wanted it: No claims made
</P>
<P>
   Status: Returned to the Italian government
</P>
<P>
   The Getty received the second century marble head as part of the
$80 million Fleischman collection, which was donated to the museum
in 1996 _ and learned later from a specialist in Polykleitan
sculpture than it had been reported missing from an excavation
storeroom in southern Italy. The museum voluntarily returned it to
the Italian government.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST SHIRT FROM WOUNDED KNEE
</P>
<P>
   Who had it: Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow, Scotland, municipal
museum
</P>
<P>
   Who got it: Lakota Sioux Tribe
</P>
<P>
   Status: Buried on the Pine Ridge Reservation, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show donated the
bloodstained, fringed tunic to the Glasgow museum during a visit in
1892, two years after the Army killed more than 200 Sioux men,
women and children at Wounded Knee. John Earl, a Woodstock, Ga.,
attorney and Cherokee Indian, noticed the shirt _ worn by ``Ghost
Dance'' warriors who believed it would make them immune to the
white man's weapons _ in the Scottish museum in 1992. He notified
the Lakota's Wounded Knee Survivors Association and, after hearing
a series of pleas from the Lakota, the Glasgow City Council
voluntarily agreed to its return. The shirt was laid to rest in a
cemetery near the site of the Wounded Knee massacre.
</P>
<P>
   TORSO OF THE GOD MITHRA
</P>
<P>
   Who had it: J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Who wanted it: No claims made
</P>
<P>
   Status: Returned to the Italian government
</P>
<P>
   The Getty acquired the marble torso of the Persian god Mithra in
1982, with later additions of the arms and head. In the course of
its own research, the Getty discovered that the pieces had been
stolen from a private collection in Italy. It was turned over to
the Italian government for eventual return to the owner.
</P>
<P>
   WOODEN LINTEL FROM GUATEMALA
</P>
<P>
   Who had it: Denver Art Museum
</P>
<P>
   Who got it: Guatemalan Institute of Anthropology
</P>
<P>
   Status: On display at the National Museum of Archaeology in
Guatemala City
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-wide wooden lintel, a decorative portion of a
1,300-year-old door frame, disappeared from an archaeological site
in the Peten region of Guatemala in the 1960s. The Denver Art
Museum acquired it through donation in1973 and only recently
concluded, from photographs showing it in place at the Mayan ruins
of El Zotz, that it should be returned to Guatemala. Although only
a dozen such pieces are known to exist, museum officials concede
they weren't giving up much. ``It was not on display at the time,''
says pre-Columbian Curator Margaret Young-Sanchez. ``It was a
wonderful piece, but it was not in good condition. Its limited
benefit to visitors was one of the reasons we decided to return
it.''

   The world's most famous slab of black basalt was discovered near
Alexandria, Egypt, in 1799, as Napoleon's forces were constructing
a fort. The British took control of the stone two years later when
the French in Egypt surrendered to them. Inscriptions on the stone
contain a homage to King Ptolemy Epiphanes in three languages:
Greek, an ancient Egyptian language called demotic and
hieroglyphics. Because Western scholars understood Greek, they were
able to decipher the secrets of the hieroglyphic symbols, providing
a firm foundation for modern Egyptology. Egypt isn't happy that
this year's 200th anniversary of the discovery of the stone is
being celebrated at the British Museum. The Cairo Museum has a copy
of it.

 &HT;    Stakes are high in tug of war over artifacts
 &HT;    By Mike Toner

<P>
   Amid the marbled elegance of the New York Metropolitan Museum of
Art's new Greek and Roman galleries, the waist-high display case
holding a 15-piece set of Greek silver is easy for the casual
visitor to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Museumgoers browsing the second-floor gallery would never know,
from the terse but vague description of its ``early Hellenistic''
origins, that the 2,200-year-old silver setting cost the museum a
tidy $2.7 million. Nor would they suspect that it lies at the
epicenter of a highly charged dispute over the future of the
Metropolitan and other museums as custodians of the world's
cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Italy claims that looters stole the Greek silver from an
archaeological site in Sicily about 1980, only a few years before
the Met bought it. The Met, which has displayed the silver
prominently since 1984, insists that it has seen no evidence to
support such charges. Italian authorities have not taken any direct
legal action to recover the silver, but two government ministries
are gathering evidence to make a case.
</P>
<P>
   Once revered as the guardians of cultural heritage, the Met and
other museums are increasingly being accused of hastening its
destruction. Countries and cultures whose art and artifacts have
stocked the world's museums for centuries want their treasures
back. And, in what museum officials see as alarming precedents,
some are getting them.
</P>
<P>
   Greece wants the British Museum to hand over the marbles that
Lord Elgin stripped from the Parthenon 200 years ago. Egypt wants
England to return the Rosetta stone and a fragment of the Great
Sphinx's beard. Nigeria wants its Benin bronzes, seized by a
British expeditionary force in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek island of Samothrace wants France to send home the
statue of Winged Victory that stands at the top of the Louvre's
main staircase. Turkey wants Germany to return the Trojan gold that
archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann smuggled out of the country in
1873. But the Turks are standing in line for the privilege: Germany
first has to get it back from the Russians, who took it from a
German museum during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The rising clamor for the return of ancient art and artifacts
reflects global changes in attitudes toward cultural property, and
the laws that affect it.
</P>
<P>
   Museums in the United States are returning human remains and
sacred objects to Native Americans. Museums throughout the world
are reviewing their collections to identify works that may have
been taken from Holocaust victims by the Nazis. And since 1970, two
major international treaties have created the legal framework for
countries that want to recover stolen or looted cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Some objects were looted
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to objects of archaeological importance, however,
museums are feeling the heat not only for what they have done, but
also for what they continue to do. Some critics say museums are
adding new material to their collections when an expanding
international market for ancient art is spurring demand for new
material _ and, in turn, the pillage of archaeological sites and
monuments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acquisitions by museums just create a bigger market, and there
is no doubt that some looted material is finding its way into
museums,'' says Manus Brinkman, secretary general of the
International Council of Museums in Paris, an affiliate of the
United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
which encourages museums to learn more about the things it buys and
receives as gifts before accepting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we published a list of 100 objects stolen from
Cambodia's temples in the 1980s, we have found missing pieces at
the Metropolitan Museum in New York, at Sotheby's, with an art
dealer in London, on the market in Hong Kong and at the Honolulu
Academy of Arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Sidibe, director of the national museum in the West
African nation of Mali, says museums contribute to the growing
market for antiquities from his country. ``Many of the rich
collections of African cultural heritage now found in northern
museums come from the pillage of archaeological sites,'' he says.
``By buying these objects on the market, museums are supporting the
despoliation of the patrimony of African countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Chippindale, a curator at the Cambridge University
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge, England,
agrees. ``Museums assembling a collection these days are forced to
take it from a small pool of private stuff that comes up for
sale,'' he says. ``But that small pool is constantly being topped
off with freshly looted and stolen material.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the world's most acquisitive museums, the Met, with
its familiar beaux arts facade on Fifth Avenue and 5 million
visitors a year, is at the center of the storm. And the case of the
Greek silver service promises to be one of the stormiest
controversies yet.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday afternoon last month, the scholar whose research is
destined to play a key role in the case strolled unnoticed among
the crowds in the Met's Greek and Roman galleries, pausing longer
than most at the case containing the 2,200-year-old silver
collection for a moment of reflection. University of Virginia
archaeologist Malcolm Bell III, the Andrew Mellon professor of
advanced studies at the National Gallery of Art, says the view of
the silver under glass was a melancholy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even tell you where it's from,'' he says. ``It's
tragic to see objects like this languish in a museum case without
context. The museum doesn't want to know too much about it, so
information gets suppressed. It's a shame because I have been able
to identify the house in Sicily where it was found. We know the
name of the owner who buried it in the third century B.C. We even
know the spot in the house where it was buried. I wish it were
possible for other people to know these things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's involvement stems from archaeological excavations he once
directed in Sicily _ at Morgantina, a part of the Hellenistic
kingdom of Syracuse, until it fell to the Romans in the third
century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   It was from Morgantina, police informants have told Italian
authorities, that the Met's silver collection _ or one very much
like it _ was unearthed by local tomb robbers. One particular piece
described by informants was a silver medallion depicting the sea
monster Scylla, similar to the one in the Met's collection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Italian authorities asked Bell to investigate the story
on two fronts: through new digs in Italy and through a closer look
at the Met's silver. Bell completed his excavations in 1998, but it
wasn't until this year that the Met agreed to let him examine the
silver.
</P>
<P>
   He turned over his findings to an Italian magistrate in May. He
won't disclose the details, but he doesn't mind summarizing his
conclusions. ``The uncertainty about the origins of these pieces is
decreasing,'' he says. ``I am more convinced than ever that they
came from Morgantina.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Holzer, the museum's vice president for communications,
says the Met is doing its own research on the collection. ``Because
this is an ongoing effort, we cannot discuss the case in further
detail,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials have told U.S. Customs officials that the
silver collection was purchased, in two installments, through
European art dealer Robert Hecht Jr., who told them that it had
been owned for decades by a Lebanese art dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The story _ right down to the Lebanese owners and Hecht as
intermediary _ echoes another controversial acquisition by the Met:
the $1 million purchase in 1971 of a spectacular 2,500-year-old
vase, a krater decorated by the Greek master painter, Euphronius.
Italian police informants later reported that it had been looted
from a site north of Rome and smuggled out of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Even former museum director Thomas Hoving, who once admitted ``a
near-sexual pleasure'' from obtaining the Euphronius krater for the
Met, has since acknowledged that the krater _ forever known in New
York art circles as the Met's ``hot pot'' _ probably was smuggled
out of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Italy long ago barred Hecht from the country for his alleged
role in the incident, but the Euphronius krater _ with its
red-painted figures depicting a scene from Homer of the dead
warrior Sarpedon _ remains on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 2 million works of art,'' says Holzer. ``We're not
about to start returning things just because someone asks for them.
But we are always willing to look at any evidence that is brought
to our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Met has voluntarily returned some contested objects in
recent years. When curators discovered they had the missing heads
of a 10th century Khmer temple sculpture being sought by the
International Council of Museums, it was returned to Cambodia in
1996. It also sent a 10th century stone Buddha back to India.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive legal battle
</P>
<P>
   The Met parted with another famous collection more reluctantly.
In 1993, the museum ended a six-year dispute with Turkey over the
Lydian Hoard, a 225-piece collection of sixth century B.C. gold,
silver and bronze artifacts that the government claimed had been
looted from sites near Sardis in the 1960s. The Met, which paid
$1.5 million for the collection, argued that the statute of
limitations had expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them to return the pieces, and they said no, so we
hired a law firm in New York and sued them,'' says Engin Ozgen,
former director general of Turkey's museums. ``Eventually, they
said they were willing to settle. They came to Turkey, and we
bartered. It was like in the bazaar. They offered half and we said
no. They offered three-quarters and we said no. Finally they gave
in.''

   ``The legal costs to Turkey were about $2 million,'' says Ozgen.
``It was very expensive, but we wanted to send a message. We think
we have it all now, but for all we know the Met may still have some
of it in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many disputes involve pieces purchased outright,
museums are also discovering that donated items _ even those from
revered patrons and trustees _ can be hot potatoes. The Boston
Museum of Fine Arts found itself in the spotlight last year because
Guatemala claimed that 25 pieces of Mayan pottery donated by
trustee Landon Clay, were looted and illegally exported. Although
the provenience _ the place where the objects were originally found
_ is unknown, the pieces remain on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guatemala has offered no proof that they were removed from the
country illegally,'' says Brent Benjamin, deputy director for
curatorial affairs for the museum. ``Many of the objects we have
are unprovenienced. That is often the case. You can't run down the
provenience of every item.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Art Museum recently returned a 1,300-year-old carved
Mayan lintel, part of an architectural door frame, to Guatemala
when it was discovered to have been stolen from an archaeological
site in the Peten region of Guatemala only a few years before being
donated to the museum in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Most items in museums today were looted or stolen at some point.
Romans looted Greek cities. The barbarians looted Rome. Over the
centuries, many art treasures might have been lost forever had they
not been saved in museums. Many others, however, might have never
been dug up at all, if museums hadn't been so determined to build
their collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums were founded in a time when knowledge was compiled
encyclopedically, on the assumption that all knowledge was
useful,'' says Robert Anderson, director of the British Museum.
``Our philosophy is to have the best of everything from all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the London museum's ongoing feud with Greece over the
Parthenon marbles is the best-known dispute, it's not the only one
of its 7 million pieces being contested.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the museum celebrates this year's 200th anniversary of
the discovery of the Rosetta stone _ one of its biggest attractions
_ it is fending off requests by Egypt to return the rock that
helped break the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics. The stone was
actually found by Napoleon's forces in 1799. The British didn't get
it until the French surrendered it to them two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get 20 or 30 requests a year for returns,'' says Anderson.
``There are strong feelings behind most requests. But they all
receive a no in the most understandingly possible way. We are not
going to give up the world of objects we have assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   Because museums differ so widely in size, mission, budget and
behavior, generalizations about their stewardship of cultural
history are all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the material in American museums is legally
there,'' says Edward Able, president of the American Association of
Museums, which represents 3,100 institutions. ``Our code of ethics
makes it clear that objects should be legally acquired. But museums
have a right to insist a claim of ownership be proved. In every
instance where that has been established, museums have returned the
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent clear proof, museums have very different responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many museums simply assume that all objects are innocent until
proven guilty,'' says Marion True, curator of antiquities for the
J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. ``They may make inquiries, but
if an object has been illicitly excavated, no one will know it is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any major acquisitions without established provenience are
quite likely to have come from illicit excavations. There is simply
not that much major material out there in old collections that is
unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to clean up its own act, Getty trustees now require
the museum to seek comment on new pieces from the country of origin
and to refuse any that were not in an established collection before
1995.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore its new attitude, the museum this year voluntarily
sent three important pieces back to Italy. The returns included
what True calls one of the museum's ``great vases'' _ a drinking
cup by the Greek painter Euphronius, which the Getty bought from a
European dealer in 1983, but later concluded must have been
illegally excavated.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy did not, to the dismay of some archaeologists,
deter the Getty from accepting $80 million worth of classical
antiquities from New York art collectors Barbara and Lawrence
Fleischman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the 295 entries in the recent catalog of the Fleischman
collection, not one had an archaeological provenience,'' says
Boston University archaeologist Ricardo Elia, a regular critic of
the trade in illicit antiquities. ``Unfortunately, that's not
uncommon. In the last few years I have looked at over 30 private
and institutional collections. Overall, 85 to 90 percent of the
objects give no indication of a previous owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mum's usually the word
</P>
<P>
   Because many museums keep their detailed information in private,
so-called deep files, it is difficult for third parties to find out
what the museum itself knows _ or doesn't _ about its acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art world is famously discreet about how it conducts
business,'' says Anthony Hirschel, director of the Michael C.
Carlos Museum at Emory University. ``Some even say that it couldn't
function if there were more light cast on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask for documentation, but if we're told it doesn't exist,
it becomes a judgment call. If it's some minor pieces, it's easy to
have high principles. It is much harder to resist the temptation
when you are presented with an object that might transform your
collection or, in the case of the MFA, when it comes from one of
your major benefactors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Getty's True says balancing museum interests against the
worldwide loss of archaeological resources may require drastic
measures. ``We may need some kind of moratorium on the importation
of works of art,'' she says. ``During that moratorium, pieces
currently on the market should be inventoried and documented. After
that, if there is no documentation, it should be clear that it is
recently excavated material and probably illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Most museums, however, are discovering that there are major gaps
in what they know about material they own.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the effort to track down looted Nazi art, the French
government concluded that as many as 2,000 artworks in its national
museums may have been looted from European Jews by the Nazis or
sold under duress. Tens of thousands of pieces in museums
throughout the world may be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the passage of the Native American Graves and
Repatriation Act required more than 1,000 U.S. museums to inventory
their collections in preparation for returning human remains and
sacred objects to Indian tribes. Many museums were surprised by
what they found.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology, one of the most
reputable in the country, discovered that instead of the 7,000
Indian remains officials thought they had, the Peabody actually had
15,000. And although the museum thought it had 800,000 Native
American artifacts, the survey turned up 8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Museums have raised the specter that repatriations _ whether to
Indians or countries of origin _ threaten to empty their display
cases. Experience suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   At the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History, only one of the
250,000 artifacts inventoried for possible return to the tribes was
actually removed from public display. The rest were in storage or
in the museum's research collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most museums have 90 percent of their collections in
storage,'' says Maxwell Anderson, director of the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York, and former director of Emory University's
Carlos Museum. ``They don't need to be going out into the market to
buy material that encourages tomb robbers, forgers and smugglers.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much in their basements, and so little certifiably legal
material on the open market, why do museums still vie for one more
piece of culture for posterity?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a prevailing feeling in the museum world that
museums need to make spectacular additions, no matter how much they
already own,'' says Martin Sullivan, chairman of the U.S. State
Department's Cultural Property Advisory Committee, which advises
the government on actions to limit illicit trade in antiquities.
``This is a very competitive industry and spectacular new things
mean more visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But museums enjoy special benefits under the tax code, and
they need to remember that they have special obligations to the
public,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many museums are still thinking in terms of ownership,
rather than custody and care of the objects they own. There has to
be a realization that countries which have traditionally been the
source of ancient art are losing their heritage and it is hurtful
to them. Museums started out being institutions for the
preservation of cultural heritage. We have to get back to that _
and find some new ways to do it.''

   Of the hundreds of museum visits in a lifetime, none moved me
quite as much as the stops photographer David Tulis and I made in
London and Athens for these articles _ the third installment of
``The Past in Peril'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a busy Sunday at the British Museum, there's a reverent
hush among the crowd in the Duveen Gallery, where the Parthenon
marbles are exhibited. They are magnificent, but eerie _ headless,
limbless, disembodied torsos. They look a little lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning on the Acropolis, before the tourists
arrive, there's a different kind of quiet _ punctuated by the
chip-chip of marble workers sculpting the stone with which Greece
hopes to partially restore the 2,500-year symbol of its Golden Age.
You won't find marble sculptures on the Parthenon, either. They're
in a nearby museum, looking a little lost.
</P>
<P>
   After 200 years of sound and fury over who should have the
marbles, two moments of silence a thousand miles apart open the
door to this thought. The fuss over the marbles, like disputes over
cultural property in other museums, is really an argument over
custody. Ownership is another matter. The world's cultural
treasures really belong to humanity.

   Q: For years, I've been looking for the soundtrack to ``Ferris
Bueller's Day Off'' with no luck. Where can I find it?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.B., Hawthorne, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: No soundtrack was ever released for the film, according to
information on filmmusic.com, a site compiled by movie and TV music
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Director John Hughes refused to release a soundtrack album,''
according to information on the site. ``He didn't think that the
diverse collection of songs in the movie would `work' together.''
</P>
<P>
   The film includes the following songs:
</P>
<P>
   ``Twist and Shout'' by the Beatles, ``B.A.D.'' by Big Audio
Dynamite, ``I'm Afraid'' by Blue Room, ``Please Please Please Let
Me Get What I Want'' (instrumental) and ``The Edge of Forever'' by

FORT PLANS TO RE-CREATE FRONTIER LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSBORO, Texas _ In just a few weeks, we'll enjoy a lavish
meal to celebrate the association of newly arrived Europeans with
Native Americans. We'll commemorate the event with roasted turkey
and marshmallows toasted atop sweet potatoes. It will represent a
bounty shared by two friendly peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, however, we'll take just a couple of days to note
how sour that relationship eventually became.
</P>
<P>
   This is the weekend for Fort Richardson Days, a Saturday and
Sunday re-enactment of frontier life at the old fort near
Jacksboro.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Richardson was the northernmost in a line of outposts built
by the federal government right after the Civil War. Others were
Fort Griffin, Fort McKavett, Fort Lancaster and Fort Concho.
</P>
<P>
   The forts were built to protect encroaching settlers from the
angry Comanche, Kiowa and Apache nations _ who were being pushed
off their land and onto reservations in the Oklahoma Territory.
</P>
<P>
   With most of Texas' able-bodied men gone during the War Between
the States, Indian raids in Texas had become epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Richardson Days is a yearly event designed to remember life
at the fort during the 1860s and 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I've studied this period for the past 25 years, but
I believe you can close your eyes and hear the sounds and smell the
smells of this place, and be transported back to the period,'' said
Marjorie Sewell, the interpretive ranger assigned to the state
park.
</P>
<P>
   Sewell said the park could play host to 1,200 to 5,000 visitors
this weekend. There will be exhibitors and re-enactors
demonstrating the military and civilian life at the fort. There are
several actors of special note, she said, especially the ones who
play the part of a dentist and his pained patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have drills by the foot soldiers and cavalry saber
drills,'' she said. ``We'll have fashion shows and a working
blacksmith.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more popular events, she said, is a drill sergeant
who patrols the crowd looking for recruits. When he finds them, he
begins drilling them on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to just do it with children, but adults started
joining in too,'' Sewell said. ``It's interesting to see how they
react.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Richardson was an important garrison in the Indian wars. In
May 1871, a large force of Kiowa attacked a wagon train headed from
Jacksboro to Fort Griffin. The wagon master and six teamsters were
killed. The day before, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and his
escort had passed along the same route.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiowas could have attacked Sherman's group but decided to
wait for a more lucrative target. Sherman was at Fort Richardson
when news of the attack reached the fort. Until then, he had been
skeptical about the dangers on the Texas frontier.
</P>
<P>
   No Indians are participating in the re-enactment, but Sewell
said a group from the Kiowa Nation visited this year. ``It was a
very interesting visit,'' she said. ``We talked about them
participating in the event, but it is something that has to be
decided on by their elders. We are hoping we can get more of them
to visit.''

MAKING THE PRESIDENTIAL GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The buzz is that George W. Bush isn't the sharpest
knife in the drawer. That his grades at Yale were mediocre. That he
can't pass a pop quiz naming the leaders of Chechnya, India,
Pakistan, and Taiwan. That he doesn't know Slovenia from Slovakia,
and that he can't tell a Greek from a ``Grecian.''
</P>
<P>
   The grades are great grist for the late-night comics. And the
quiz indicated that Bush may be vulnerable in a foreign-policy
debate. But opponents who try to exploit the issue of braininess
should beware: Americans like their presidents smart, but not so
intellectual that they can't reach down from their ivory tower.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, this political season offers them quite a choice:
Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley come off as a studious, cerebral
pair, the dutiful students who retain to this day a passion for
policy detail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across the political campus are Bush and John McCain,
the two leading Republicans, who admit that in college they often
walked right by the library to find the best fraternity party or
touch football game, or girls who wanted to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   So what will it be, America? A wonk or a gentleman's C?
</P>
<P>
   That has been a complex question for voters through the years,
and with reason: There is no clear correlation, in presidential
politics as in corporate life, between good study habits and
leadership success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overachievers don't do very well in the White House,'' said
Dean Keith Simonton, a psychology professor at the University of
California at Davis who wrote a book about the formation of
presidential prowess. ``Remember how annoying Jimmy Carter was,
always preaching and acting smarter than everybody else?''
</P>
<P>
   This year's crop of presidential postulants seems to remember.
Some of them, in fact, seem to be appealing directly to an
anti-intellectual strain that political scientists have long
identified in the American electorate. McCain frequently jokes
about his fifth-from-the-bottom finish at the US Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore, in going back to his roots, some days seems to act
more like a Tennessee hayseed than a Harvard man. And Bradley says
his pro basketball career was more life-shaping than was the
Princeton pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bush, who certainly ranks in the Ivy League elite,
with his degrees from Yale and the Harvard Business School, but who
also has asserted that he was put off at both places by
``intellectual arrogance.'' At Yale, Bush passed every subject, but
he has made no secret of the fact that he frequently put football,
baseball, and his fraternity ahead of academics.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the New Yorker magazine published what it said was
Bush's Yale transcript. He had highs of ``88'' in philosophy and
anthropology, a low of ``69'' in astronomy, and many mid-70s scores
in between.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokesman, Scott McClellan, said that the New
Yorker ``stole'' the report, but then discounted it as
``irrelevant'' to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unimpressive academic record,'' said Alan Lichtman, a
presidential historian at American University. ``If it shows that
Bush is intellectually incapable of doing any better, then I'm not
sure he is the kind of person I want in the Oval Office. If it
indicates he was simply interested in other things at college, then
the grades really don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Bennis, a business professor at the University of
Southern California, has spent 20 years studying what makes top
corporate leaders tick, and he is sure it is not their grade-point
average. ``Unless you are a moron, there is zero correlation
between grades or IQ and success in life,'' Bennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto on SAT scores. Bush's, according to the New Yorker, were
in a respectable but not spectacular range: 566 on the verbal
score, and 640 for math, out of a possible 800 in each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SAT is a remarkable judge of how well a student will
perform in college, but nothing beyond that,'' said Gaston
Caperton, the president of the College Board, which conducts the
SATs. Caperton, a former two-term governor of West Virginia, says
he is a good example of how grades don't make the man. He became a
successful politician despite his dyslexia, a reading disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skills that really help you in politics are having a huge
amount of energy and knowing how to get along with people,''
Caperton said.
</P>
<P>
   Academic achievement is not totally irrelevant, since it can be
a measure of focus, ambition, and discipline. But taking Bradley as
an example, Bennis said his success as a politician may have more
to do with the qualities that made him a great basketball star _
his timing, his intensity, his drive _ than with his Rhodes Scholar
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who graduated with honors from Harvard, may not derive
great political benefit from what voters perceive as his superior
intellect. In a recent debate, Gore said his biggest mistake was
saying he invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates who come off as some awe-inspiring Einstein will be
at a disadvantage if voters think they are too brilliant to work
with the masses,'' Simonton said. Gore may alienate people by
seeming so smart on issues like technology and science that
confound average Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Academic achievement has not necessarily resulted in popular
presidencies _ Carter's (Naval Academy) and Woodrow Wilson's
(Princeton, Johns Hopkins) spring to mind. Some of the nation's
favorite presidents, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt despite
his degrees from Harvard and Columbia, Ronald Reagan , and Harry S.
Truman, seemed to show that scholarship isn't required for
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar, yet he played up his
good-old-boy background in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who commanded the Allied
invasion of Europe in World War II, was no dummy, but his stump
rhetoric was deliberately homespun. He sometimes spoke in a
deliberately inarticulate way to confuse critics and make himself a
more appealing candidate. And for all his intellectual modesty,
Eisenhower certainly had no difficulty in twice trouncing Adlai
Stevenson, the self-consciously cerebral Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while campaigning, Stevenson was flattered by a woman who
had told him he would get the vote of every thinking person. ``But
madam,'' Stevenson replied, ``I need a majority to win.''
</P>
<P>
   History also shows that presidents can get into big trouble when
they surround themselves with really smart people _ the ``best and
the brightest'' are sometimes blinded by their own intellectual
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, who seemed to have an intellectual
inferiority complex, leaned on the corps of advisers he had
inherited from the Kennedy administration _ men like Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara _ with disastrous results. Reagan put his
national security adviser, John Poindexter, first in his class at
the Naval Academy, in charge of the Iran-Contra arms sale episode.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was in the same Annapolis class, but at the bottom. He
writes in his memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' that two things
brought his class rank down: terrible grades in math and science,
and very bad behavior. ``John wasn't intellectually sloppy,'' said
Frank Gamboa, who roomed with him at the academy, ``but he
deliberately did not try to excel.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's story, however, did not end at Annapolis, but continued
to Vietnam and into a Hanoi prisoner of war camp. He came back as a
hero, proving himself and rising above his undistinguished academic
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are looking, above all, at authenticity because they
are fed up with handlers, pollsters, focus groups, and politics as
performance art,'' said Richard Norton Smith, director of the
Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``There is something
refreshing about candidates who seem real, don't make exaggerated
claims, and seem perfectly comfortable in their own skin.''

MUSSELS WITH A SOUTHERN ACCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va.)   This is the first of eight columns by Patrick O'Connell, the chef
and an owner of the Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Va.
These columns are being written with Marian Burros.  
 (af)  
 By PATRICK O'CONNELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have always loved transferring the primitive, soulful
character of Southern food to something that is delicate and
refined. It's how I maintain a sense of place in my cooking, what
the French call cuisine terroir, here in back-country Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   For the next eight weeks, I'll be bringing you some of the
flavors of my region, combined in unusual ways and presented in
dishes where you wouldn't expect to find them.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Inn, we served mussels the traditional
way, in the shells. But as the years passed and things became more
``elegant,'' dealing with shells didn't seem appropriate. So, I
combined steamed, shelled mussels with orecchiette, because the
pasta has an indentation that's just right to hold a small mussel.
And I adapted a lighter version of Alfredo sauce made with the
steaming liquid. The sauce shouldn't be too thick; it should roll
off the pasta. (It thickens on the pasta, so make it a little
thinner than you like.)
</P>
<P>
   Like many of my dishes, the regional touch comes from an
indigenous ingredient: in this case, collard greens. I cut them
into julienne strips and fry them, which makes them look like
seaweed. Most people need three tastes before they can identify
that little Southern flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the first time I encountered fried collards was in
Hong Kong, where they were served as a crispy nibble with drinks. I
couldn't identify them at all. I thought they were some kind of
weird seaweed. It was that association that made me think of
serving them with mussels instead of a more traditional green like
crispy spinach or parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Collards stand up to frying much better than spinach or parsley
because they are so sturdy. In fact, you can fry them as much as
eight hours in advance. The fried collards turn emerald green and
provide a striking contrast to the creamy white of the pasta and
sauce, and add a pleasant crunch to the sensual softness of the
dish. They're an intriguing note in taste, texture and appearance. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSSELS WITH ORECCHIETTE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds (about 40) mussels
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs thyme
</P>
<P>
   { bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs parsley
</P>
<P>
   } cup dry white wine or vermouth
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   { cup plus 6 pinches finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   36 orecchiette
</P>
<P>
   Extra virgin olive oil, for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   Crispy collard greens (see recipe), for garnish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Discard any mussels with broken shells. Scrub mussels with a
brush under cold running water, and discard any that are not
tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a saucepan large enough to hold mussels after they open,
combine shallots, garlic, thyme, bay leaf, parsley and wine. Place
over high heat and bring to a rapid boil. Add mussels and steam for
about 3 minutes. Transfer opening mussels to a bowl; they do not
have to be fully cooked because they will be cooked again. Remove
mussels from shells and set aside; discard shells.
</P>
<P>
   3. Strain liquid and transfer to a small pan. Place over high
heat and bring to a boil. Reduce liquid by half and set aside. In
another small pan, bring cream to a boil and reduce by half. Cream
should coat back of a spoon. Add \ cup mussel liquid to cream,
adding more as desired for sauce consistency and flavor. Dish may
be prepared up to this point, with mussels, sauce and remaining

<P>
   A few of the original investors in Sonoma-Cutrer, the prominent
California winery, probably wish they had taken their profits in
old croquet balls. Or had consumed their moneys' worth. In the
first 17 years that it made wine, Sonoma-Cutrer produced some good
and extremely popular wines.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the host of spectacular croquet matches played on its
two international-class croquet lawns. But profits? There really
weren't any.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our 25th reunion, my class at Harvard Business School gave
me the `Long Suffering Award' for the 17 years it took me to break
even,'' said Brice Cutrer Jones, 60, the winery's founder and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brown-Forman, a big Kentucky wine and spirits company,
bought Sonoma-Cutrer last April, Jones' financial tightrope act is
probably over. But over a glass of his wine at Jean Georges in New
York last week, he insisted he plans to keep doing what he has done
from the start: pour almost all the profits back into the winery.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards started out in 1972 as a tax-shelter
affair. Jones, with his new MBA degree, worked in Sonoma County
gathering up vineyards and land with vineyard potential while a
financial partner in New York lined up investors. Soon, almost 200
acres of northern Sonoma were under vines.
</P>
<P>
   Like many grape growers, Jones decided that the only way to make
the wines he wanted _ and some profit _ was to make the wine
himself. In 1981, Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards made its debut in
Windsor, 80 miles north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, the federal courts ended the great tax shelter
schemes of the 1970s. With some effort, new investors were found.
Fortunately, Sonoma-Cutrer wines were a hit almost from the start,
due in large measure to Jones' choice of William Bonetti as his
first winemaker.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told of Jones' going through stacks of resumes,
throwing most of them out unopened until he came to the one he had
been hoping for, from Bonetti. He had gained a reputation for great
wines at Charles Krug and later at Souverain, and shared Jones'
almost obsessive insistence on perfection. He particularly liked
Jones' radical idea of concentrating on a single wine, chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former Air Force fighter pilot, brought other assets to
the table: faith in marketing and promotion, and the blend of
determination and boyish charm that an earlier generation used to
say could sell refrigerators to Eskimos. Even before he had wine to
pour, Jones visited wine writers and restaurants, telling them his
was going to be the best wine ever. And he delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma-Cutrer chardonnay began a rapid climb to the top of the
popularity charts and there it sits, year after year. Wine &AMP;
Spirits magazine reports that it is the most frequently ordered
wine in well-known American restaurants. Bonetti's protege, Terry
Adams, now makes it.
</P>
<P>
   In his Wine Atlas of California, James Halliday, the Australian
winemaker and writer, describes the attention to detail at
Sonoma-Cutrer as ``fanatical'' with the ``unbelievably rigorous
selection'' of grapes, the tunnel through which they pass to the
presses, the winery's almost hospital-worthy sterility and the
special machine that dusts each cork before it is pressed into the
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could write an entire book about Sonoma-Cutrer, so
extraordinary _ and at times bizarre _ is the whole venture,''
Halliday said. He was also taken with the winery's croquet lawns,
where the American Croquet Association's annual open raises
substantial sums for charity and garners publicity for the winery.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma-Cutrer produces 70,000 cases of wine each year, all of
them from its own grapes. Some 50,000 cases carry the name Russian
River Ranches and are made mostly from grapes from three of
Sonoma-Cutrer's five vineyards: Vine Hill, Kent and Shiloh, all in
the Russian River Valley viticultural area.
</P>
<P>
   The winery's most famous wines are Cutrer and Les Pierres, from
vineyards of the same names. Cutrer is in the Russian River Valley
and Les Pierres in the Sonoma Valley; 10,000 to 11,000 cases of
each are made each year. Both sell for about $29. The Russian River
Ranches is $16.50.
</P>
<P>
   If anything has informed Jones' winemaking philosophy, aside
from the skills of Bonetti and Adams, it is the exposure he gets
from meetings with Burgundian winemakers. Every two years since
1986, Jones has sponsored chardonnay symposiums that alternate
between Sonoma-Cutrer and Burgundy wineries. And the French growers
have had an effect on the style of Cutrer and Les Pierres.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the French influence on his thinking, Jones
eagerly opens bottles of Corton-Charlemagne and Batard-Montrachet
from Burgundy producers. His goal is to emulate the Burgundian
ability to make white wines that combine intensity with leanness
and elegance. Even he agrees that California chardonnays are often
too heavy-bodied to be elegant.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics have said that starting in the late '80s,
Sonoma-Cutrer wines have been leaner but at the cost of truly
intense flavors. However at lunch last week, there was no need to
open French wines. The Sonoma-Cutrer wines, the Les Pierres in
particular, were ``Corton-y,'' as Jones had promised.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Sonoma-Cutrer and other top California
chardonnays, it should be noted that the French don't always
achieve their goals. White wines from the northern half of the
Cotes-d'Or, like Corton-Charlemagne and the rare Musigny blanc, are
often more dependable than those from south of Beaune. Wines from
Meursault and the Montrachet communes can occasionally be insipid.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones was reluctant to be specific, it would appear that
his French connection may soon bear fruit in new ways. Most
Burgundian white wine producers also make red wines. Many are even
better known for their reds.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma-Cutrer has prime land set aside in the Sonoma Coast
appellation, and it would be no surprise to soon see Sonoma-Cutrer
end its long and monogamous affair with the chardonnay grape and
take up with the seductive pinot noir, Burgundy's only red wine
grape.

THE MINIMALIST: JUICY BIRD, NO MESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to keep a boneless chicken breast juicy inside a
flavorful exterior, all you have to do is coat it with flour or
cornmeal or a batter and cook it quickly in a fair amount of fat.
But there is a much lighter alternative, a combination of sauteing
and steaming.
</P>
<P>
   This technique relies on two properties of the chicken breast
that make it more like fish than meat: It cooks quickly, and it
contains a fair amount of moisture. This enables you to start
cooking the breasts with relatively little fat to begin the
browning, which will compensate for the lack of crust. Then you can
lower the heat and cover the pan so that the meat steams in its own
juices while maintaining a nicely browned exterior. As a bonus,
this method reduces spattering to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The cooking time for all but the thickest chicken breasts
prepared this way is less than 10 minutes. And when the meat is
done, it will take only a couple of minutes to build a flavorful
but light pan sauce that will enhance the chicken and give you
something to sop up with rice or bread. My suggestion is a
Provencal or Ligurian adaptation with capers, olives, tomatoes and
parsley, but you can use onions, shallots, mushrooms, chopped
vegetables, stock, cream, wine and almost any herb.
</P>
<P>
   This simple technique will work perfectly well with most fish
steaks or fillets, from salmon to cod to striped bass. Cooking time
for most cuts of these fish will be just a little bit less than
that for the chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   SEARED AND STEAMED CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or butter, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   4 plump boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, 1{ to 2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup dry white wine, chicken stock or water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peeled, seeded and diced tomatoes (canned are fine; drain
them first)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons bottled capers
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped pitted black olives, preferably imported
</P>
<P>
   { cup chopped parsley.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Place the oil or butter in a
12-inch skillet, and turn the heat to medium-high. After about 2
minutes, when the oil is hot or theg from the butter has
subsided, season the chicken breasts well with salt and pepper and
place them in the skillet, smooth (skin) side down. Turn the heat
to high, and cook about a minute, until the chicken begins to
brown. Turn the heat to medium, and cover the pan.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cook, undisturbed, until the chicken is firm and nearly
cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. To minimize the spattering, quickly
uncover the skillet, and remove the chicken to a plate. Place the
plate in the warm oven.
</P>
<P>
   3. Over high heat, add the wine, stock or water to the pan, and
stir and scrape to release any bits of chicken that have stuck to
the pan. When the liquid has reduced by about half, add the
tomatoes, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about a minute. Add
the capers, olives and all but 1 tablespoon of the parsley, and
cook a minute more, stirring occasionally. Return the chicken to
the sauce and turn once or twice. Sprinkle with the remaining
parsley, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

SAFETY FIRST WITH BAMBOO  
 A CHINESE DELICACY  
 HOLD THOSE EGGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is it safe to use my Chinese bamboo steamer in the microwave?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: It is, if you dampen the steamer beforehand; there is a slim
possibility that a dry bamboo steamer could catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lately, whenever it gets windy, I see a handful of older
Chinese women in my backyard gathering fallen nuts from two large
ginkgo trees. How do they cook them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ginkgo tree is dioecious, which means it has male and
female specimens. In autumn, the female trees drop their
foul-smelling yellow-fleshed fruits, which contain an edible white
or cream-colored nut with a soft shell.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese consider ginkgo nuts a delicacy, to be eaten
roasted as appetizers or used as an ingredient in soups, stews,
vegetable stir-fries and stuffings. The nuts are held in such high
esteem that they are often presented at wedding banquets with their
shells dyed red to symbolize happiness and good luck.
</P>
<P>
   The malodorous flesh must first be removed and the nuts washed
before shelling (use a nutcracker or a lightweight hammer). Then
the nutmeats can be boiled or roasted. Once cooked, ginkgo nuts
have a firm, starchy texture and a mild, slightly sweet flavor. The
nuts have little nutritional value and are notable only as a source
of vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   A caveat: the nuts can inflame the skin. Wear gloves in
gathering them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My children love eating the raw cookie dough when we bake,
but I worry about salmonella. Can I make raw dough safe to eat?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: These days, only a tiny percentage of eggs are infected with
enough salmonella to cause a healthy person any ill effect. The
risk is greater for children, who are more sensitive to bacteria
and less able to fight off disease. Being extra cautious with
children makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for them, this doesn't preclude licking the batter bowl,
with caveats. You may have to vary the cookies you are used to
making as there isn't an easy way to make an egg-based raw cookie
dough (like chocolate chip cookies) perfectly safe. The
sterilization methods that exist (beating eggs in a double boiler
over simmering water for several minutes) will drastically change
the baked cookie.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many cookie recipes that don't call for eggs at
all, like shortbread. These cookies (usually made from flour,
sugar, butter and salt) can be embellished with kid-pleasing
flavors like vanilla, orange, lemon or chocolate chip. Batters that
include only egg whites are also safe to nibble raw, like tuiles or
meringues.

TASTINGS: YOUNG, RICH AND A MATCH FOR TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gallo Sonoma Frei Ranch Zinfandel, 1995, California. About $18.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a good zinfandel not made from old vines? In recent
years, the ``old vine'' fad has virtually taken over the zinfandel
market. Very old vines, we are told, produce very little, but very
concentrated, fruit. I don't know whether they are using satellites
or divining rods, but California's winemakers seem to be finding
another lost zinfandel vineyard every few weeks. Invariably, the
vines are said to be from 50 to 100 years old. The Gallos make no
such claims for this wine from their huge Sonoma County vineyards,
but they don't have to. This is a full-bore zinfandel _ big, rich
and slightly rustic in style, with a beautiful, almost peppery
bouquet. It's the perfect wine for a big, hearty Thanksgiving
dinner, and not just because it goes well with turkey _ or any
other roast. It is the most American of all fine wines, which makes
it right at home at one of the most American of all festivities.

VEAL: THE ARISTOCRAT OF MEATS DOES STEW DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipes in 2nd take)  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veal is the prima donna of meat. Pale and delicate, with a
European heritage and a high price, it is more often associated
with expensive restaurants than with the corner supermarket. Even
the more robust cuts like the shank that have become popular
recently appear only infrequently on home dinner tables in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough though, this aristocrat of the meat world is also
an excellent candidate for humble, rough-hewn stews. Veal's
affinity for this proletarian role derives from its defining
characteristic, its youth. However it is raised and whatever its
diet, what makes a calf become veal instead of beef is the fact
that it is slaughtered before the age of 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Because veal calves do not live long enough to develop any
appreciable amount of intramuscular fat, their meat is quite lean.
This is generally not a great quality for stew, because fat helps
keep meat moist and flavorful during long cooking. But veal also
contains a high proportion of collagen, or connective tissue.
Harold McGee, the author of the classic ``On Food and Cooking''
(Collier Books), writes that a pound of veal has about twice as
much collagen as a pound of meat from even a year-old calf.
</P>
<P>
   Collagen can make meat very tough. But when the meat is cooked
slowly with liquid, the collagen melts into tender, slightly
viscous gelatin. This transformation takes place far more quickly
and easily in meat from young animals. And because veal contains so
much collagen, as the meat stews the resulting gelatin transforms
the cooking liquid into a sauce, imparting a luxuriously suave,
silken texture.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the home cook, veal stew meat is available in
supermarkets much more readily than more expensive cuts like
scaloppine or loin chops. Usually, it is sold already cut into
cubes and labeled for stew. It's always a bargain: At a butcher
shop like Oppenheimer Meats on Manhattan's Upper West Side, veal
for stew, from the neck or shoulder, is $5.90 to $7.50 a pound,
while the best veal for scaloppine, from the loin, costs $32.
</P>
<P>
   As with pork or beef, pre-packaged veal stew meat can come from
any part of the animal; it simply depends on where the butcher has
decent-size chunks left over after forming the larger cuts. But
because veal is so tender, the cut is not as crucial as it is with
tougher meats.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any cut is likely to be sufficiently tender, but meat
from the shoulder is ideal. The meat should be cut into relatively
large cubes, at least an inch in diameter, which gives the meat
prominence in the stew, making the dish seem more lavish.
</P>
<P>
   We also like to take advantage of veal's lightness, both in
color and flavor, to make stews that are not as heavy as most. Give
the cubes just a golden brown coat during the initial searing to
concentrate the flavor. Any darker and you run the risk of
toughening the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Veal stews are often served in springtime, but heartier
ingredients like beans and greens make them suitable for cold
weather as well. The meat's mild flavor seems to match up best with
classic Mediterranean accents like tomatoes. And because it is so
rich, it is best paired with something rather sharp or acidic.
Lemon is the classic accompaniment, but other types of citrus as
well as green olives, sherry or even slightly bitter greens also
enhance this meat.

<P>
   WHITE VEAL STEW WITH MUSHROOMS, CORN AND SHERRY
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 2 hours  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds veal stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly cracked white or black pepper
</P>
<P>
   { cup flour, approximately
</P>
<P>
   2 onions, peeled and diced small
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 pound white mushrooms, cleaned, trimmed and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1 cup corn kernels
</P>
<P>
   2 cups veal or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fresh thyme.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place 1 tablespoon each of the butter and the oil in a large
Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium heat, and heat until the
butter has just melted. Dry the veal cubes with paper towels.
Sprinkle them generously with salt and pepper and dredge lightly in
flour, shaking off any excess. Add half the veal to the pot in a
single layer and brown lightly on all sides, about 4 to 5 minutes,
removing the pieces to a platter as they are done. Add the
remaining butter and oil to the pot, let the butter melt and brown
the remaining veal. Transfer to a platter.
</P>
<P>
   2. About 2 tablespoons of fat should remain in the pot; add more
if needed or pour off any excess. Add the onions and saute,
stirring occasionally, until they are transparent, about 7 to 9
minutes. Add the garlic and saute 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and
saute, stirring frequently, 5 minutes more. Add the sherry and
continue to cook 2 more minutes, stirring to dissolve any brown,
crusty bits adhering to the pan.
</P>
<P>
   3. Return the veal to the pot, add the corn and the stock, and
season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce
the heat to low and skim any film off the surface. Cover and simmer
gently until the veal is fork tender, about 1 to 1{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   4. Skim any film off the surface of the stew. Taste and adjust
the seasonings. Stir in the fresh thyme, and serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   VEAL, SAUSAGE AND LIMA BEAN STEW WITH LEMONY GREENS
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 2 hours, or 3 hours plus overnight soaking if using
dried beans
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried lima beans (or substitute frozen)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound veal stew meat, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Italian sausage links, cut into 1-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, peeled and diced small
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 cup veal or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 cup canned whole tomatoes with juice, diced small
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spinach, Swiss chard, beet greens or young kale,
trimmed, washed well and dried
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved.
</P>
<P>
   1. Soak dried beans overnight in cold water. Drain and place in
a saucepan and cover with 2 inches of water. Simer, partially
covered, over medium heat for 1 hour. Drain and set aside. (If
using frozen beans, thaw according to package directions.)
</P>
<P>
   2. In a deep Dutch oven or other heavy pot, heat vegetable oil
over medium high heat until very hot but not smoking. Dry veal with
paper towels and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Add veal
and sausage to the pot in a single layer, cooking in batches if
necessary to avoid crowding the pan, and brown lightly on all
sides, about 4 to 5 minutes total, removing pieces to a platter as
they are done.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of fat from pan. Add
onions and saute, stirring occasionally, until transparent, 7 to 9
minutes. Add 2 tablespoons garlic and saute 1 minute more. Return
meat to pan and add drained beans, stock, tomatoes and white wine.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and skim any film off
surface. Cover and simmer gently until meat and beans are tender,
about 1 to 1{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   4. When stew is very close to done, cook greens: In very large
saute pan, heat olive oil over medium high heat until hot but not
smoking. Add remaining garlic and cook, stirring, for 10 seconds.
Add greens and saute, stirring very vigorously, until wilted, about
1 minute more. Remove from heat, squeeze both lemon halves over
greens and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   5. Spoon a generous serving of stew into each bowl, top with
equal portions of greens and serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

PARENTAL JUGGLING ACT TAKES ITS TOLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You want to believe you're special. ``I am unique,'' you say to
yourself. Or, in the spirit of individuality, ``I are unique.''
That's why you're so disappointed when you find your life is a
cliche.
</P>
<P>
   And life never becomes as cliche and predictable as when you
become a dad. You stop partying like a rock star because you don't
want your young 'un to know you only as ``that guy who shut down
the pub and drove his car through a bison.'' You move to the 'burbs
for better schools or safer neighborhoods because you want the best
for your Princess or Little Gipper.
</P>
<P>
   Most noticeably, you become the guy who worries about life.
Remember when you didn't worry? You may have been distraught about
a few bills, or getting to your job on time, but solutions were
easy and usually involved happy hour. Once you're a husband,
though, the worries increase, primarily because your previous
``solutions'' are frowned upon. Once you're a dad, those solutions
are usually labeled by your wife as ``mere temporary escape,'' and
you're threatened with legal papers should you not address the
day-to-day problems that face you.
</P>
<P>
   So you become a worrier. You worry about things that you thought
only accountants or Willie Nelson worried about, like interest
rates and tax breaks. You worry about ``down payments.'' You talk
about ``my money earning me money,'' and think this makes sense.
You research the recent pronouncements of Alan Greenspan. Money
begins to drive you, because, well, how else are you going to
ensure the life you want for your little Sugar Muffin or Buckaroo
Bonzai?
</P>
<P>
   Then the sub-worries begin, those concerns that evolve from the
life changes brought about by the aforementioned worries. Am I
focused too much on my paycheck? What about my idealism, my youth?
Shouldn't I write a novel, or at least play a few games of ``NFL
Y2K'' on my Sega Dreamcast? Is my commitment to the almighty dollar
obscuring my quest for theological or philosophical enrichment, no
matter that the increased coin is going into paying for an
education _ or, at least, a cool set of wheels for My No. 1 Little
Gal/Guy?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, about that time your wife says, ``This family needs a
Volvo,'' and those concerns are forgotten. (Buy low, sell high,
carry on!)
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, you begin to spend more money chasing the
dollar for the good of your family and less time actually doing
stuff with your Little Miss Debbie/Doug. You begin to question the
sacrifice that must be made. That is when you reach the ultimate
level of cliche, the pinnacle of familial-strife triteness: You
decide that you want to spend more time with your family.
</P>
<P>
   I reached this point last week, during bath time.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, a rising star in the human resources industry, has a
new position that requires her to do everyone else's work, or
something like that. I have a high-powered job at the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram that involves writing those ``What to do'' items at
the top of the Life &AMP; Arts page. These are both demanding,
time-consuming posts. So one day last week, we got home late, as we
often do. As a nation, we had entered the time of the year in which
we save daylight, so it was already dark outside when we picked our
child up from our wonderful after-care provider. She, the child,
was tired and hungry and needed a bath. We, her parents, were in
the same condition.
</P>
<P>
   When we got home, in fact, our child was so tired that she
wouldn't eat. Because of this, when she took a bath, she realized
she was starving. Then, once she realized she was exhausted and
hungry, she decided that was no state in which to bathe. So she
began crying. And screaming. Cryming, really, is what she did, an
explosion of noise and tears.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this is just one incident, and perhaps she was just feeling
particularly bratty that night. Normally she's a great kid, but,
you know, limits will be tested. But I don't think so. I declared
that this would not stand, that one of us needed to be there for
her at a reasonable hour, that all the weekend quality time in the
world would not make up for the extra hour or two or three we were
missing because of our go-go '90s routine.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, and, of course, nothing has changed. That's
cliche, too.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what to do. We both love our work. We are parents
first and foremost, but neither of us wants to give up roles we
cherish unless absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm not asking for advice. I'll figure it out, and I'll
do what is best for my kid. I just write this because it's good for
folks in similar situations to know that others struggle with these
decisions. That, despite the dime-a-dozen self-help books and
know-it-all acquaintances, the answers aren't easy and worrying
about it is OK, even if it's cliche. I write this because I know I
are not unique.

 &HT;    Teddy Turner wants to be a tycoon, too
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ It's a sunny weekday afternoon, and R.E.
``Teddy'' Turner IV races his small fishing boat through the chop
of the Intracoastal Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Grinning devilishly, he bounces along in shorts, worn red
baseball cap and sandals. One hand grips a small outboard motor
while the other presses an ever-present cellular telephone against
his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hire really smart people who work themselves to death so I
don't have to,'' Turner says, shouting into the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Those smart people are huddled a few miles away in the back
rooms of a beachfront motel they use for an office. Under Turner's
guidance, they're trying to figure out how to launch a new,
inexpensive and easy-to-use device that does everything from write
letters to surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They face an uphill battle against an entrenched industry
dominated by two multibillion-dollar players, Microsoft and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's a contrarian venture worthy of Turner's father,
billionaire media mogul Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Turner, Ted Turner's second child, is launching his
new computer without money or help from his father. And he's doing
so from this port city outside the influence of his father and four
siblings in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Turner is running away. He remains close to his
family, including his father. But this 36-year-old media scion is
trying to prove to them and _ most of all _ to himself that he,
too, can be a tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family money doesn't spend as well,'' Turner says, eyes
twinkling. ``It wouldn't be as rewarding if Dad was doing this for
me. Sink or swim, this is truly my own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Turner, success means not working around the clock,
sacrificing both a family life and a life on the water he loves.
But he'd also like his father's approval, which he is still
awaiting. ``You know he doesn't lavish praise,'' Turner says.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Turner has tried to make a name for
himself independent of his father. He nearly went bankrupt earlier
this decade, spending much of a multimillion-dollar trust fund
trying to turn his love of professional sailboat racing _ a passion
he shares with his father _ into a business.
</P>
<P>
   That failure taught Turner a tough lesson. ``When I was younger
I felt a lot more drive to compete with Ted,'' says Turner, who
often refers to his father by his first name. ``Now I don't see any
sense in it. Today I want to take what he's given me and move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner pauses for a moment and sighs. ``This wasn't something
easy to realize. Dealing with Ted, his success and legacy, was a
demon, a big choke.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner isn't choking any longer. In some ways, what he's
attempting now is a bigger stretch than Ted Turner's launch of CNN
in 1980. Personal computing has long been dominated by two
companies, Microsoft and Intel. Many have tried and failed to offer
an inexpensive, easy-to-use alternative to the duopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every attempt to introduce computers into the living room has
made a big fat splat,'' says Dan Tynan, executive editor for
features at consumer magazine PC World.
</P>
<P>
   Such skepticism makes Turner smile. ``If people tell you don't
do something, then you're doing the right thing,'' he says. ``And
if everyone loves your idea, then it is probably too conventional
and will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Unconventional venture
</P>
<P>
   Turner is beginning humbly. His staff of 10 occupies the back
rooms of a dilapidated beachfront motel. It sits on a deserted
stretch of boardwalk in Ponte Vedra Beach, just south of bustling
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Turner plans to move his company to larger quarters
in the front of the old motel. That space, under renovation, offers
a sweeping view of the ocean and distant freighters on the horizon.
You can hear the waves crashing against the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Turner's company, tentatively called MyTurn.com, is
trying to assemble an all-purpose computing device priced under
$300 and aimed at folks who haven't yet boarded the computing
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has produced a working model of the device. It's a svelte
black VCR-like box, with two silvery built-in speakers on the front
corners.
</P>
<P>
   Called GlobalPC, the device comes with a keyboard, mouse,
operating system and basic software. It works with either a TV or a
computer monitor, either of which you have to buy on your own.
</P>
<P>
   GlobalPC won't run the latest version of Quake or Microsoft
Office. But plug it in and you're immediately ready to write
letters, design greeting cards and make simple spreadsheets. And,
if you sign up for an Internet account for an extra charge, you can
surf the Internet and send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, easy and inexpensive, GlobalPC is designed for the 60
percent of U.S. households who don't own a computer and aren't
online.
</P>
<P>
   Turner reasons they're not because computers and the Internet
are just too darn expensive and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market for computers isn't expanding,'' Turner says. ``The
people who already own computers are buying second ones. I'm trying
to expand the market by drawing in more first-time users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've designed GlobalPC not from the office down, but for the
people up.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy. Turner has spent the past two years
assembling investors, engineers and partners. He didn't want to
manufacture the computer himself, but he couldn't persuade another
company to take on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with a working prototype, Turner doesn't expect to
release a commercial product until the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the guy introducing a new product, you can't
afford to make a mistake,'' Turner says. ``We've got to be
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they are, GlobalPC faces an uphill fight for acceptance.
For one, the trend now in personal computing industry is for ever
more powerful and complex computers. And the industry is selling
them for less and less. You can buy a basic computer for about
$500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some industry observers question the premise of
Turner's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price or ease of use aren't the only reasons keeping people
from buying computers,'' says Bruce Leichtman, a media analyst at
the Yankee Group consulting group. ``A lot of people still don't
see the utility, the need, for a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   To Leichtman, Turner's idea is all wrong. ``You should never
start a new technology with the techno-illiterate,'' he says. ``You
have to start with the first adopters. That's where the money is.
With technology, the money always trickles down, never up.''
</P>
<P>
   Father &AMP; son
</P>
<P>
   Criticism is nothing new to Turner. He grew up with a brilliant
but demanding father. It didn't help that father and son look like
they were carved from two different kinds of wood: Ted Turner is
tall and rectangular; Teddy is rounder with soft curly bangs. Ted
Turner's booming voice is legendary; Teddy talks softly.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner wouldn't dream of wearing anything but a suit and tie
to work. His son prefers working in sandals or cowboy boots, plaid
shirts and khaki pants.
</P>
<P>
   But Turner is clearly his father's son. He has the famous grin,
sharp wit, devilishly twinkling eyes and love of derring-do. He
also shares his father's penchant for challenging conventional
wisdom _ including that of his father and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the family's only card-carrying Republican,'' Turner says
with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   His easy laugh hides a life that, while privileged, has had its
rough edges. He grew up moving among estates in Roswell, South
Carolina and Florida. In South Carolina, he and his siblings weeded
a rice plantation in 100-degree heat at their father's command.
</P>
<P>
   That was life as a Turner. He grew up rich, but was required to
live like he wasn't. ``Teddy has always worked,'' says his second
wife, Leslie, 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been a double-edged sword,'' Teddy says with a
laugh. ``But would I trade places with anybody? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner required his three sons to attend The Citadel
military academy in Charleston, S.C., which wouldn't have been
Turner's first choice for college. Still, he values the trying
experience. ``It taught me how to work with difficult people in
challenging situations,'' Turner says.
</P>
<P>
   That training has come in handy. In 1979, Turner was a member of
his father's winning crew in a stormy race across the English
Channel that left 15 sailors from other crews dead.
</P>
<P>
   And, while a young CNN producer in Moscow, Turner crushed his
face in a car accident while on assignment.
</P>
<P>
   CNN producer is one of many jobs Turner has held at his father's
company. He began working for his father's business as a summer
intern when the company sold billboard space. By 1985 at age 22,
Turner was a CNN producer in Russia. He was with a crew that snuck
into Afghanistan to cover the Russian invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Turner fondly remembers his days at Turner Broadcasting. ``The
pay was notoriously low, but young people came because of the great
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Turner Broadcasting, if you had an idea and it worked, you
ended up running it,'' Turner says.
</P>
<P>
   His co-workers at Turner Broadcasting remember him as smart,
thoughtful, hardworking and humble. No one ever saw him trading off
his father's name.
</P>
<P>
   While often in the background at Turner Broadcasting, Turner was
watching and learning. ``My father always said, `If I can think it
then I can do it,''' Turner says. ``I learned to think the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in the opinion of some longtime friends, Turner has picked
up his father's ability to see around corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very good at studying an industry, seeing the big
picture and then coming up with a plan,'' says Hansell Roddenberry,
a longtime family friend who has worked for Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Roddenberry sees his friend as a born entrepreneur. ``It's in
his blood. He's that way, whether marketing bison (one of the jobs
he did for his father) or videos.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's entrepreneurial drive prompted him to leave his
father's company several times and strike out on his own. First he
left to work for then start-up country music channel CMT in
Nashville. Then came the sailboat venture. For Turner, sailboats
combined two thrills. ``Being an entrepreneur is a lot like racing
offshore sailboats,'' Turner says. ``You never know what will
happen. There are so many things outside your control. It's
absolutely terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrifying and addictive. ``It's a great feeling to have battled
and won,'' he says. ``You want to do it all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   With sailboats, Turner first learned that his famous last name
could hold him down as well as lift him up. His father declined to
invest in the sailboat business, and that made other investors
reluctant, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was skeptical because Ted wasn't behind me,'' Turner
says.
</P>
<P>
   Turner remains reluctant to invest in his son's ventures. ``I've
asked my father to invest in my company, but computers are not his
cup of tea,'' Turner says. ``I'm on my own, much to the dismay of
my investors and Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's interest in computers began at Turner Broadcasting. As
a TV producer he became well acquainted with new digital technology
and its potential.
</P>
<P>
   His first chance to invest in digital technology came when Time
Warner bought Turner Broadcasting. Turner's division at the company
was shut down. He was offered another job in Los Angeles but turned
it down.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he was uncomfortable with Turner Broadcasting's
burgeoning size. ``Eventually, the bureaucracy catches up with
you,'' says Turner. ``The company splinters into several kingdoms,
and the kingdoms splinter into fiefdoms. Change slows to a crawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner took a deep breath and decided it was time for him to go
out on his own again. ``You've never known the meaning of fear
until you've tried to make it on your own,'' he says. ``It is
absolutely the most terrifying thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This time Turner founded a company in Atlanta called Turner
Telecom. It was a vehicle to invest in and develop new digital
video technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But the company was outgunned by much bigger players, and it
didn't go anywhere. Turner shut it down and briefly helped his
father market bison from his vast ranch holdings in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Telecom wasn't a total bust for Turner. It exposed him to
other struggling high-tech entrepreneurs. One in particular caught
his eye: Rudy Theale, a 23-year-old computer whiz kid in
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an aggressive, fearless, damn-the-torpedoes kind of
guy,'' Turner says. ``In other words, a younger version of my
dad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Theale was all ideas and no follow through. He needed a
steady hand and strong marketer. Turner decided he could play that
role.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a 10 percent stake in Theale's company, then called
Localnet, for $150,000 of his own money. Turner was named chairman
and became the chief strategist. He could have moved the company to
the entrepreneurial hotbed of Atlanta. Instead, he moved himself
and Leslie to Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   For Turner, Atlanta had become too congested and sprawling. He
craved a smaller, more intimate place to live. And he missed the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get out on the ocean every month, I start to get
wiggy,'' Turner says. ``When you're out at sea you can't think of
anything other than getting back. It clears the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jacksonville, Turner found an old house on the Intracoastal
Waterway where he could dock his two motorboats. His racing yacht
is a 20-minute boat ride away. His house sits across the waterway
from a state park in a neighborhood with only 18 registered voters.
When he went to vote recently the poll watchers knew exactly who he
was.
</P>
<P>
   Turner loved his new home, but his family did not. His siblings
and his father began asking Turner to return to Atlanta.
</P>

   Turner finally persuaded his father and wife, Jane Fonda, to
spend a night in Jacksonville. Turner says he'll never forget his
father's first impression.

<P>
   Ted Turner walked out on the dock, looked out at the lush
waterway and said, ``I guess this means you won't be coming back to
Atlanta anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner got busy positioning LocalNet as a bigger player. He
merged it with a small public company called Compu-Dawn. And now
Compu-Dawn is using its stock to buy a Silicon Valley company
called GlobalPC. The merger will dilute Turner's stake to about 5
percent of the new company, but he'll remain chairman.
</P>
<P>
   If his board approves, Turner plans to rename the company
MyTurn.com when the merger is completed, probably in the next
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The success of MyTurn.com, Turner figures, hinges on timing. Is
the company offering a product consumers are ready to embrace?
</P>
<P>
   His father has had an unerring knack of when to launch seemingly
hopeless channels. Does Turner have the same knack?
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell. But no matter what happens with MyTurn.com,
Turner is not giving up his quest to make a name for himself apart
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you move down the river of life, you bounce off the
edges,'' says Turner, ever the sailor. ``You know where you are
going but not necessarily where you are going to land.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Julia Child was lunching at Oceana a couple of weeks
ago, and as it came time to order, she insisted that everyone at
her table have the same thing. Because it was Julia Child, they
obeyed, and went on to enjoy a rare meal with no ``Oh, can I try
one of your Florida stone crab claws?'' or ``Here, have some
pan-seared dorade!'' And absolutely no plate-passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I  &UR; hate  &LR; all this sharing,'' Mrs. Child explained by phone
from Boston the following week. ``Everybody takes everything. If
you like what you're eating, you don't want to have to give it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, somebody has said it:  &UR; Enough with the sharing
already! &LR;  Even Mrs. Child has had enough of the elaborate
taste-testing ritual that goes on any time anyone eats out
nowadays. The friend next to you at dinner steals a prize chunk of
your miso-encrusted salmon before you've even taken a bite.
</P>
<P>
   Your party of six starts sending the plates around, and by the
time your carefully selected appetizer or entree gets back to you,
there's hardly anything left. You're offered a piece of some dish
you would have ordered if you'd wanted it and feel peer-pressured
into a phony ``I'd love some!''
</P>
<P>
   There are 7.5 million appetites in this city, and they all want
your truffle ravioli. Mrs. Child could become the spiritual leader
of the anti-sharing backlash building among diners fed up with this
rampant disrespect for food boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-so-old days, a restaurateur knew he had a reviewer in
the house when he spotted a group of suspiciously ravenous
customers playing musical plates. Now, everyone's a food snob, and
every table is a virtual lazy susan. No one's meal is safe. Many
restaurants have started pushing ``family style'' dining on larger
parties. Suddenly, it's Chinatown all over town.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Zagat, of the restaurant guidebooks, has just the utensil to
help satisfy all these hungry eyes. It's his special ``tasting
fork.'' No ordinary cutlery item, the fork has a telescoping handle
that increases the user's reach by a full 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're good at it, you can reach anything on anyone's
plate,'' said Zagat, who had the forks custom-made ever since the
company he used to get them from went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you handle it right, it's very funny,'' he said, adding
that the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, requested 100
extendo-forks after Zagat's wife, Nina, whipped hers out during a
recent Relais &AMP; Chateaux conference in Bordeaux. ``The French fall
off their seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because, in France, forking into someone else's
chateaubriand is still considered gauche. Andrew Friedman, who has
written two cookbooks with Alfred Portale of Gotham Bar &AMP; Grill,
recalled a dinner in Cognac when ``three of us started playing food
Twister, and there was a guy from Paris who was with us, and he was
horrified.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans now seem to feel no such horreur. ``I've gotten so
used to it in the last couple of years,'' said Friedman, who was
brought up to believe that sticking your fork into someone else's
food was bad manners. ``When I first started seeing it, I was,
like, `Can we do that? Is it OK?' I was almost ashamed, especially
in the nicer restaurants. Then you realize there's almost no
ceiling. People who do it do it in four-star places.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents, who live in Miami, still don't buy it, Friedman
said. ``They say: `This what they're teaching you in New York? Is
this what those chefs teach you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Why not just put all your elbows on the table, too? But that
rule has gone away with all the others, laments Letitia Baldrige,
the etiquette expert. Sharing food is a pet peeve of hers. People
ask her about it when she lectures, she said, especially young
executive types.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a regression of manners back to cave man days, and it
just breaks my heart,'' she said. ``You're passing food around and
dropping it. It's exceedingly unappetizing.'' Not to mention
``sloppy and slovenly and ungracious,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Strange that in today's hyper-hygienic culture, food sharers
think nothing of engaging in the equivalent of what ``Seinfeld''
memorably identified as ``double dipping'' _ taking a bite out of a
chip, or whatever, at a party, then sticking it back into the dip,
germs and all.
</P>
<P>
   The whole business still makes Andrew Davidson, a computer
consultant, a little squeamish. ``It's that kid thing where once
it's shared, it feels broken,'' he said. ``You don't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's wife is a food writer, so he's been on his share of
restaurant outings. But he's never quite gotten used to the
group-grope approach to eating. ``The more expensive the
restaurant, the smaller the portions,'' he said, and ``the more of
a drag it is to share your food.'' You order something specific,
and you've got your mind set on it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst is when people offer you something when what they're
really trying to do is get a bite of what you're eating,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   For New Yorkers, dining out is yet another arena for
competition. Whoever dies with the most entrees under his belt,
wins. ``It's sort of a badge of honor to taste something new,''
said Friedman, the cookbook author. ``If people try six different
things, it's a feeling of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurateurs are eager to oblige. At Thalia, a month-old
arrival in the theater district, the executive chef, Michael
Otsuka, said his waiters are instructed that ``if people are
sharing food, it's something we want to know about.'' If it's soup,
``we get a bunch of soup spoons over,'' he said. For a sashimi dish
served with bamboo chopsticks on the plate, ``we bring out extra
pairs.'' Asian menus often encourage sharing, but Thalia takes it
to a new level by offering diners 8-inch ``share plates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cat, a bistro on 10th Avenue at 24th Street, pushes
family-style dining for reasons of convenience _ the restaurant's
as much as the diner's. Jimmy Bradley, an owner, said, ``We didn't
necessarily like having eight plates of food on table for six
people. It's hard to service a table with too much stuff on it.''
Sometimes, Bradley said, ``we just hand you a platter of food, and
you pass it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the top French restaurants have adjusted to this very
American custom. La Caravelle, on West 55th Street, now sends
around an hors d'oeuvres cart that caters to the diners' desire to
mix and match. Rita Jammet, the restaurant's co-owner, agreed that
in France sharing is frowned upon, but she contended that ``it adds
congeniality'' to a meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for people who want to try several things without
ordering a tasting menu,'' she said. Though she acknowledged that
when customers start mixing your sweetbreads with white truffle and
parsnip emulsion with roasted sea scallops, ``you might not control
the progression of tastes because something strong first might make
the second dish appear bland.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a cheapskate's version of a tasting menu, sharing
raises all kinds of political and psychological issues. Only
children are often reluctant sharers, though growing up with
predatory siblings can have the same effect. Friedman said he had
noticed that ``with some couples, especially with a guy who is not
quite minding his manners, if he's paying for the woman, he'll
demand a bite of what she's having.'' Likewise with bosses and
employees. He who pays the piper gets a piece of your cote de veau.
</P>
<P>
   For those who get a little ruffled in these situations or who
feel the urge to exclaim ``Boundaries!'' when some fast-forked
foodie reaches over and skewers another scallop, Mrs. Child can
always be invoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Announce it at the beginning of the meal,'' she counsels.
``Say, `This time, let's not share.'''

   BERLIN-WALL (Berlin) _ At a ceremony marking the 10th
anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder on Tuesday made very clear which Germans deserve special
praise, saying: ``The wall fell from east to west, pushed down by
brave and fearless East Germans.'' Schroeder, addressing Parliament
in the presence of former President George Bush, seemed at pains to
assuage the feelings of bitterness felt by some eastern Germans
over the alienation and high unemployment that have accompanied
unification. But the Rev. Joachim Gauck, a leading protester in
1989 who was hurriedly added to the ceremony after complaints that
former East Germans had been excluded, had a grimmer view. ``After
reunification, many of us felt like strangers in our own country,''
he said. ``We dreamed of paradise and woke up in North-Rhine
Westphalia.'' By Roger Cohen.

Since its founding in 1930, it has risen from a small, persecuted

 &HT;    CLINTON SOCIAL SECURITY PLANS GET MIXED REVIEWS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's plan to shore up Social
Security came under fire from two congressional reports Tuesday,
while Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers called it a ``crucial
foundation'' for long-term economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan to use future Social Security surpluses to reduce
the federal debt _ as well as interest savings from the reduced
debt _ would extend the program's lifetime by 16 years to 2050,
said the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget
Office, both non-partisan congressional agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But David M. Walker, head of the GAO, and Dan L. Crippen,
director of the CBO, told the House Ways and Means Committee that
Clinton's plan did nothing to resolve Social Security's structural
problems. Without those changes, the program will not acheive the
75-year solvency used as a benchmark for determining the program's
health.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Walker and Crippen warned, Clinton's plan could cause the
public to become complacent about the extent of the Social Security
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Summers told the committee that Clinton's plan was the most
reasonable approach to safeguard the nation's fiscal security.
Reducing the publicly held debt would make it easier for the
federal government to borrow money in the future to meet future
demands for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay down the debt. Use the savings for Social Security. Fix
the roof while the sun is shining,'' Summers said. ``Use the
surplus that we have today to meet the obligations that we have
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., chairman of the Ways and
Means Social Security subcommittee, argued that Clinton's plan
would merely increase the government-held debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you write yourself an IOU, it's not a real economic asset.
Treasury bills are not real economic assets,'' Shaw said. ``Those
notes are going to be paid off out of the hides of future
taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who is drafting a bill with Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said his proposal would be
introduced soon. The Archer-Shaw bill would give taxpayers a 2
percent tax credit to privately invest in a retirement fund. The
authors said it would preserve Social Security beyond the 75-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw and Archer chided Clinton for not working with Congress to
draft a Social Security reform plan that could achieve bipartisan
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to sit down and go to work,'' Shaw said. ``We're
prepared to meet with the president anytime, anywhere to meet these
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., said Republicans have been
dragging their feet on Social Security reform because they also
want a major tax cut. Levin said if the Republican majority in
Congress really supported Shaw and Archer's proposal, it would have
passed it by now.

<P>
   When you are served carrot puree at Eleven Madison Park, you
remember it. It tastes lovely, but there's also something beguiling
about the texture. It's as smooth as velvet, as decadent as cream.
Kerry Heffernan, the chef, uses great ingredients, of course, but
that's not his secret.
</P>
<P>
   It's the machine he uses to make the puree, and it's not that
miracle worker of the restaurant kitchen, the food processor.
</P>
<P>
   It's the home cook's old standby, the blender. Like many other
chefs, Heffernan has discovered that after years of depending on
the food processor, there are many tasks, like blending soups,
pureeing vegetables and emulsifying sauces, that the blender does
better.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, however, the same slow, weak appliance that lost
out to the food processor 20 years ago. Blenders used to have a lot
of buttons and small motors that could barely break up ice and
choked on vegetables. But in the last decade, manufacturers have
improved the design and souped up the motor.
</P>
<P>
   The blender is what keeps Heffernan's herb oils grass green, his
emulsified sauces feather light and his soups as fine as silk.
</P>
<P>
   It's also what makes a leek sauce at Colina seem so rich and
refined. John DeLucie, the chef, places a leek broth into a blender
and with the motor running, drizzles in olive oil. The sauce
thickens and aerates, creating an illusion of richness without a
lot of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Brennan, the chef at Picholine, relies on his blender,
too, reducing things like cauliflower and truffles into an ethereal
puree. ``With a blender, you have all the weight and liquid forcing
the product into a very small space, so you tend to get real
emulsion and more cutting going on,'' Heffernan said. On the other
hand, he said, a food processor tends to beat up foods, rather than
cut them, which is why he has just two of them in the kitchen but
four blenders.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the food processor is useless. Its strengths are
in chopping dry foods like nuts and bread crumbs, for pulsing
together pastry dough and for making coarse purees. A blender can
do none of this.
</P>
<P>
   The blender's strength is with more liquid ingredients,
emulsifying and giving them a buoyant texture.
</P>
<P>
   That buoyancy makes an enormous difference on the palate. A
parsnip puree made in a food processor may be smooth, but it won't
be nearly so light as one whirled in the blender. A blender has two
more blades than a food processor. The cutting area is much
smaller, just three or four inches, compared with six to eight, and
some models have blades that spin much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Blender manufacturers offer you little information about the the
power of their appliances, but those made for commercial use are
usually the most powerful.
</P>
<P>
   As a blender pulverizes a parsnip, the power of the blades will
send the bits upward, forcing them to fall over the blades again
and again and filling the puree with air each time. Every cell of
the parsnip gets split open and the resulting puree will be silky,
buttery and impossibly light.
</P>
<P>
   The two propeller-like blades on a food processor work much
differently. They are slower and fling food to the sides of a wider
bowl. The bits don't fall down over the blades as much, and less
air is incorporated. That same parsnip puree will be soft in the
mouth, but not uniformly smooth and not as light.
</P>
<P>
   With something as delicate as an herb oil, the food processor
will take longer to shred the herb. It will get hotter and possibly
turn the herb brown.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when food processors became a staple in the
home kitchen, their success was overwhelming. They had a large
capacity, a single speed and a panoply of attachments for
shredding, slicing and grinding. Suddenly the blender with its 12
speeds and small blade seemed old fashioned. Then came this new
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven models I tried, four stood out. They shared a few
important design features: a solid heavy base that doesn't dance
across the counter when running on high, a fast blade speed, and
sturdy, sharp blades. The blenders were also designed so that they
drew in ingredients and controlled the entire blade area.
</P>
<P>
   Many poorly designed blenders _ ones with overly narrow bases
below the blade and short blades _ will only pulverize what is in
the bottom inch or so of the container and become jammed quickly,
so you must constantly stop and push ingredients down with a
spatula.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I opened the commercial Waring MegaPro blender, I
understood why it is referred to as the Stanley Cup at Eleven
Madison Park. It has a gunmetal gray base with a heavy glass top _
it will go with nothing on your counter.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't just look like a beast. Flip the single switch
and it growls like one, too. I made a battida with ice, milk and
papaya. It crushed and gurgled so loudly I worried my neighbors
might knock on the door, but seconds later I had a battida without
a trace of ice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carrots with a little cream and cooking liquid were put through
the same rigors. As they pureed, I could see the carrots change
color, becoming first lightened by the cream, then lighter again as
air was drawn into them.
</P>
<P>
   A chive oil made in my food processor, turned out flecked with
fine strands of the herb. In this blender it was more like a paste.
The chives were imperceptible. It's $210.00 at Broadway Panhandler,
477 Broome Street (Wooster Street), (212)966-3434.
</P>
<P>
   Even more fierce was the Vita-Mix Turbo Blend 4500, a square,
bland-looking object with a single high/low switch and two
horsepower motor. This blender, the home model of a professional
line, is so powerful that, said Heffernan, ``it will power your
boat in the lake if you want.'' I believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the carrots were smoother, the chives sheered to
nothing, and the battida felt like foam on my tongue. In it, I also
made a coriander dressing emulsified with egg. Pouring oil through
an opening in the lid, it thickened within seconds and held without
breaking _ much easier than whisking by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Its motor engages slowly, so that liquids do not shoot up
violently as it takes off and the blade and container are in one
piece, making leaks a non-issue and cleaning an easy endeavor. Its
price, however, is as high as its performance _ $399.99 at Chef
Central, 240 Route 17N, Paramus, (201)576-0100.
</P>
<P>
   Much different in terms of design was the Kitchen Aid 5-speed
Ultra Power Blender. Made for the home, it is attractive and easy
to clean with a flat plastic control panel and parts that filter
any leaks down to the counter, not into crevices.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the others, it has an unusually wide base and blade
wrapped over a high hump in the base of the blender. It is
intentionally a compromise between a blender and a food processor,
said Brian Maynard, the director of public relations at Kitchen
Aid.
</P>
<P>
   The company came up with the design in 1992. In a study, they
found that Americans use their blenders primarily to make smoothies
or drinks. So they focused on a design, said Maynard, that crushed
ice well and kept food moving rapidly around the base.
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded. It did crushed ice well, it blended sauce well,
and it pureed well. And for home equipment, it is exceptionally
sturdy. One particularly nice feature is a pulse button which helps
jump start any ingredients that get stuck.
</P>
<P>
   There are other speeds, too _ something you won't find on a
professional machine and something professionals simply don't
understand. ``There's no way I know from frappe,'' said Chris
Beisher, the chef at JoJo. ``I don't even know what frappe means.''
</P>
<P>
   The speeds are a relic from the past and they do seem silly, but
I found that a range can be handy. If you start a blender on high,
it is likely to jam. Beginning on low and working up to high allows
the ingredients to start circulating through the blade, up the
sides and around to the blade again.
</P>
<P>
   So you can start at mix and work up to frappe, regardless of
whether you are frapping or crushing. Kitchen Aid will soon be
coming out with a new generation of this blender. For now, this
model is $89.95 at Broadway Panhandler.
</P>
<P>
   One more blender worth considering is the Oster Designer
12-speed. It is by far, the least expensive of the four _ just
$44.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway (80th Street), (212)787-2000 _ and
performed well all around, on the puree, the herb oil, the dressing
and the fruit shake. Each task took a little longer and achieved
textures a touch less refined, but just slightly.
</P>
<P>
   It looks harmless compared to the Waring and Vitamix. But that
is, perhaps, what I liked least about it. If I'm going to add
another machine on my counter, I want something fierce. &QL;

Glenn C. Altschuler is both the dean of the School of Continuing
Education and Summer Sessions and the Thomas and Dorothy Litwin
Professor of American Studies at Cornell University.

<P>
   Consultants charge up to $300 an hour to help prepare and polish
it, and $60 for a quick appraisal. Prep schools offer a weekly
class throughout the fall to conceive, draft, rewrite, revise and
edit it. Parents ghostwrite it and get secretaries to type the
final version, spell-checked and grammatically correct, on 24-pound
bond paper. Students who write it without assistance experience
what William Hiss, the former dean of admissions at Bates College,
calls myopic paranoia: ``I don't know why they are asking that
question, but I know they are out to get me.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does the personal-essay portion of the application to
college cause so much angst and expense? Because a lot is at stake.
Since many institutions have eliminated the personal interview, the
essay is now the one opportunity for students to exercise control
and provide a glimpse of how they think and write, and to convey
what is important to them. In the most competitive colleges, where
there are more applicants with glorious grade-point averages and
terrific test scores than there are spaces in the freshman class,
selection committees often turn to the personal essay to indulge
their subjective instincts in deciding who gets in, who doesn't and
who must languish in higher education's torture chamber, the wait
list.
</P>
<P>
   To separate the sheep from the goats, a few institutions provide
specific topics for applicants to address. In its list of possible
essay subjects, Bennington College has asked aspiring students to
design and describe ``an experiment that attempts to determine
whether toads can hear.'' In the tradition of the ``school of
improvisation and its offshoot, the Second City comedy troupe,''
the University of Chicago is currently looking for, among other
possibilities, a television pilot set on a college campus. It is to
include Enrico Fermi's personal trainer, a starving investment
banker, Godot or an evil clown as a character, and must have as a
prominent prop Cliff Notes on ``Finnegans Wake,'' van Gogh's ear, a
proton accelerator or Muddy Waters' guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Better to ``err on the side of intellectual pretension than on
the side of pure silliness,'' the admissions staff advises in the
directions to the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps anticipating that the courts will ban such assignments
as cruel and unusual punishment, most colleges now invite
applicants to write about a personal, local or international issue
that is meaningful to them; a book that has changed their
understanding of the world, other people or themselves; or anything
else that interests them. Vague or open-ended questions, of course,
provide their own kind of terror: ``What topic will light up my
application and impress the Inquisitionally inclined panel of
experts?''
</P>
<P>
   Like pornography, good essays are easier to recognize than
define. In 10 years of serving on admissions committees at Cornell
University, I almost never disagreed with my colleagues in
evaluating essays. A good one catches the applicant in the act of
thinking; it establishes and maintains a distinctive voice,
personality and perspective. With these characteristics in mind,
then, and in a modest attempt to put the consultants out of
business, here is some advice for the applicant on what you should
write about and how you can make the personal essay enhance your
application:
</P>
<P>
   Essays about national, global and cosmic issues seem as if they
have been written by Applicant Anonymous. If what you know about
the crisis in East Timor comes from Time magazine or from Tom
Brokaw, you will probably conclude, as have the thousands of other
applicants who have written on the same topic, that ethnic and
religious repression are reprehensible and peace desirable. And
you'll sound like a teen-ager trying to sound like an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Write about your world and your experiences. Seventeen-year-olds
inhabit a foreign country, and adults who work in colleges and
universities are curious about what it's like to live within its
borders. Essays about a friendship that was forged or one that
failed, buying a pair of sneakers, an afternoon working at Dunkin'
Donuts, the first trip to the museum without Mom or Dad, or getting
robbed on the subway can provide glimpses of your ideas, values and
passions.
</P>
<P>
   Describe. Don't characterize. Eliminate all adjectives and
adverbs. ``The Coach Who Changed My Life'' may be healthy, wealthy
and wise, but these qualities can best be conveyed in a narrative
of what he actually said and did. In ``Ode to Dad,'' a Cornell
applicant explained her father's values by describing his hands,
encrusted with dirt from a career as a truck farmer. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Resist the temptation to let others speak for you. A quotation
from a philosopher, poet or politician may appear to be the perfect
opportunity to parade your erudition. More often than not, you will
impress no one while you hijack the personal essay to a place you
have never been. This year, a young woman concluded an essay about
her embarrassment over her parents' Old World values and foreign
accents, her desire for the approval of her peers and a tear-filled
confrontation with her father by invoking Ralph Waldo Emerson. We
never got a glimpse of the aftermath of ``The Conversation That
Changed My Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Academics tend to see through a glass darkly. They value
ambiguity, uncertainty and irony. For these reasons, and not
because they have an antireligious agenda, selection committees
invariably prefer ``How I Lost My Faith'' to ``God Is the Center of
My Life.'' But above all, writers should establish distance from
their subjects, including themselves. Distance discourages
essayists from drawing the cliched moral. Every semester I yearn
for the applicant who will declare that organized sports are not a
metaphor for life, that coaches are often wrong or a little crazy,
that the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong. Years ago we admitted a student whose essay, ``Riding the
Pine,'' found that no enduring truths came from sitting on the
bench for an entire baseball season. It's OK to be just a bit
confused, to find the meaning of life elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Selection committee members are pretty savvy. They have learned
to look for authenticity, not profundity. But knowing yourself, on
paper, takes imagination, reflection and time. Start early, let
parents and friends read it, and then revise: the voice you find
may be your own.

   INNOVATIONS: Made in the U's of A: Designs for Real Life
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Allen Taflove, who teaches in the Engineering,
Design and Communication Program at Northwestern University, posed
this problem to his students: You're alone in the desert, you break
a leg and you can't get any reception on your cell phone. So what
do you do? The freshmen responded by designing an antenna that
boosts reception in remote places.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was a surprise to everyone. ``Most people don't
expect freshmen to come up with anything viable,'' Taflove said.
But they do. Dozens of colleges and universities are now offering
programs in which undergraduates design functional products on
their own or with local entrepreneurs or major corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In Lehigh University's Integrated Product Development Program,
students work with companies like Black &AMP; Decker and Lutron
Electronics to develop or to improve products. The companies are
charged $10,000. In return, they get access to university resources
and bright young minds; students get experience and academic
credit, and the college gets a stake in potentially lucrative
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, business leaders and recruiters have said that
college students have the technical skills but are not used to
working in teams and communicating in a cross-disciplinary
manner,'' said Todd Watkins, an associate professor of economics at
Lehigh who helps coordinate its projects. ``These programs engage
teams of undergraduates in collaborative, project-based
problem-solving and decision-making for real products that in many
cases do end up in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the tricky issue of ownership. Most institutions
have patent policies for faculty and graduate students, and
generally, if the inventor uses the university's labs and
resources, it has some intellectual-property claim. Disputes,
however, do erupt. For the past year, Vanu Bose, son of the founder
of Bose sound systems, has been fighting the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology over a wireless software radio he developed
as a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of ownership becomes even murkier when it involves
outside companies and undergraduates. ``It's a new area,''
Professor Watkins said. ``There's no well-established procedure.
Right now it's a one-on-one discussion with each company we work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now being debated at Northwestern is: Who owns the
antenna-for-the-desert?
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Professor Taflove and Northwestern will own the
patent, and the students will get royalties if anyone chooses to
manufacture it,'' said Prith Banerjee, the chairman of the
electrical and computer engineering department at Northwestern,
which oversees the program. ``But we're still not sure.''

   MARKETING: Learning Guaranteed, Or Your Money Back
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is talking about giving away toasters or cell phones yet,
but some community colleges seem headed in that direction. A number
of them are issuing guarantees that their diplomas are worth more
than the paper they're printed on, offering to retrain graduates
whom companies find lacking in job skills, or providing
tuition-free classes if a four-year college refuses credits for
certain courses. The trend has taken hold in the last 10 years at
dozens of colleges, including the entire 48-campus Illinois
community college system, said David Pierce, the executive director
of the American Association of Community Colleges, who finds no
harm in guarantees as long as colleges follow through.
</P>
<P>
   The shades of commercialism are no accident. They are further
evidence of academia's growing service-oriented approach to
clients, better known as students, who increasingly demand a return
on their investment, otherwise known as tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something put out for the public to ensure we are
accountable,'' explained Steve Morse, a spokesman for the Illinois
system, which includes the oldest community college, at Joliet,
founded in 1901. ``Government is talking about the population as
customers in whatever services it offers, and this is one of those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Morse said only a couple of students out of the one million
enrolled annually have redeemed the guarantee, a pattern seen at
other colleges that have made the gesture. The idea is seen more as
a marketing ploy, since most colleges that have adopted the
practice boast of job placement rates of 80 to 90 percent and
transfer rates to four-year institutions of 60 percent or better.
</P>
<P>
   Edna V. Baehre, the president of Harrisburg Area Community
College in Pennsylvania, which adopted a guarantee policy in April
for its 11,000 credit-earning students, said that she hoped it
would help improve ties to local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a pitch fit for a car dealer, she added, ``Not only do we
have a quality education, but we stand by it.''

   COPING, PARTS I AND II: Part I: Relax the Inner Child
</P>
<P>
   California livin' is not necessarily stress-free. Tim Healey, a
physical therapist in Santa Ana, says that stress-related behavior
and learning problems have dominated his practice over the last
five years. Having researched the physiological effects of stress
on infants with Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, a professor emeritus of
pediatrics at Harvard University Medical School, Healey holds about
50 seminars a year, mostly in California, on how elementary school
teachers can reduce stress in the classroom. He believes that
exasperating student behavior like averting the eyes, slouching and
twirling hair repetitively can often be attributed to an
overstimulating environment.
</P>
<P>
   To create a more relaxed atmosphere, he advises teachers to turn
off the lights and play soft music. To calm their nervous systems,
children should put their heads on their desks and stroke their own
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Stress relief is particularly useful when standardized tests are
administered, and more children than usual describe feeling sick,
says Charlotte R. Hawkins, a first-grade teacher at Mariners
Christian School in Costa Mesa. Between activities, her first
graders de-stress by tightening and releasing their facial muscles
and fists, stretching and crossing their arms and counting to 10.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Vick, a fourth-grade teacher at El Morro Elementary School
in Laguna Beach, also applies Healy's principles. Despite most
teacher training, which advises a hands-off stance toward children,
Ms. Vick touches students on the shoulder when she talks to them.
``You get on their eye level,'' she says. ``Some kids cringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, they find the approach comforting. ``It's like a
chemical reaction,'' she says. ``The chemistry of touch is
soothing.''

   BLACKBOARD: COPING PARTS I and II: Part II: Whisper
</P>
<P>
   Monty Roberts, the author of the best-selling memoir ``The Man
Who Listens to Horses,'' has spent five decades working with wild,
unruly steeds. Now he is applying his methods to other
hard-to-control charges: schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``For centuries, humans have said to horses, `You do what I tell
you or I'll hurt you,' ''he says. ``A horse will give you his
cooperation either through fear or trust. However, if you gain his
support through fear or punishment, you will never completely
achieve the highest levels of performance. Horses respond better to
kindness. So do humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who lives in Solvang, Calif., is a so-called horse
whisperer (``a title bestowed upon people who got along with horses
way back in the 1700's,'' he says). He and M. B. Flippen, a teacher
and psychotherapist in Austin, Tex., who works with troubled youth,
have developed a relationship-building curriculum that is used in
about 600 schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build a relationship, then you have created an
environment where the child is ready to learn from you,'' Flippen
says. ``This parallels Monty's work with horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Flippen suggests that teachers shake students' hands every
morning and have them write down rules they want to abide by, and
name appropriate rewards for following them and punishments for
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Both humans and equines carry ``psychological baggage,'' he
says. When a horse responds to a raised arm by flaring its nostrils
or throwing its head up, it is a sign it has been hit in the head
in the past. Human baggage is not so obvious. Teachers, in turn,
must work harder to understand students' emotional histories.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who occasionally mixes up humans and horses, explains:
``By asking open-ended questions _ What made you this way?' `What
do you want?' `Where do you want to go?' _ or testing the horse's
response to nonviolent stimuli, trainers are able to explore
students' problems and determine their needs.''

FINANCIAL AID FOR THE BOURGEOISIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Cornish has a solid annual income of $140,000 from his own
software business. He and his wife, Sandra, own three cars,
including a Jeep Grand Cherokee, and live in a four-bedroom house
in New Canaan, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornishes do not sound like naturals for financial aid.
Nonetheless, their daughter Jordana, a sophomore at Vanderbilt
University, got $22,150 in aid this semester in the form of a
$13,950 grant and several low-interest loans. Their daughter
Charissa, who took time off before entering her sophomore year at
William and Mary College, received a $23,000 aid package, mostly in
low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled we were able to get what we got and talk about
it,'' said Sandra Cornish, referring to the stigma financial aid
would once have had in her prosperous community. ``I'm not sure it
would always have been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial aid is no longer strictly for paupers, at least not
paupers by traditional standards. As the cost of higher education
hovers between $20,000 and $30,000 a year at private institutions
and $8,000 at public ones, even affluent families are finding their
wallets too thin.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials say that some families receiving help this fall
have incomes over $200,000, and some have assets that hit seven
figures. About 14 percent of students from families with incomes of
$100,000 or more received federal aid in the 1995-96 school year,
according to the Department of Education's latest accounting. For
those attending private colleges or universities, the figure was 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more people at higher levels of income getting
financial aid,'' said Thomas C. Keane, the director of financial
aid and student employment at Cornell University, where 508
families with incomes over $100,000, 79 of them earning more than
$150,000, received need-based grants last year. At Princeton
University, 126 freshmen were eligible last year despite household
incomes in excess of $105,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs are going up faster than families' income is going
up,'' Keane said. ``Now there are programs so that anybody can get
money, at the very least through a loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrators advise that even families with seemingly little
need should apply, since they may qualify for some help. Special
considerations might include many dependents, more than one child
in college, certain large debts or high medical expenses. Aid
officers know that tending to a sick or an elderly parent can drain
resources.
</P>
<P>
   The most salient feature of the Cornishes' application was the
fact that they support five young children in addition to their two
college-age daughters; they also have a growing business with debt.
Still, the Cornishes paid $1,400 for the services of a consultant
to help both daughters enhance their financial aid eligibility as
well as find the best deals.
</P>
<P>
   Many private colleges are sweetening their financial aid
packages not only because their endowments are swelling in a boom
economy, but also to attract students with the grades, demographic
profiles or special skills to balance their student bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many ways to be eligible for aid these days,''
said Monique Thomas, the founder of Collegiate Financial Aid
Services in Darien, Conn. She believes that qualifying for aid is
as much an art as it is a science _ a philosophy that has spawned
an industry of financial aid helpmates and, for those seeking lower
sticker prices, shelves of self-help books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go through a 72-point system, where I look through tax
returns and examine income and assets,'' said Ms. Thomas, who
recently helped a family with three children in college obtain
about $55,000 a year in mostly grants and scholarships, despite
their having assets close to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman A. Chany, the founder and president of Campus
Consultants, in New York City, says that many potentially eligible
families don't apply. ``There are a significant number of
households that could be eligible but just don't bother, or they're
too intimidated by the process and throw up their hands in
disgust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Internal Revenue Service allows certain deductions
to be taken to lower one's tax bite, there are legal ways to lower
a family's tuition bill by increasing its eligibility for financial
aid. And the arguments for using loopholes are similar in both
circumstances. ``You should be able to get what you're entitled
to,'' Chany insisted. ``Parents don't create the formulas.''
</P>
<P>
   Saving for the long term, of course, is the best way to ensure
that there will be enough money to pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``A poor family without the means to pay for college will find
concerned financial aid officers ready to look in every corner of
their coffers to come up with the aid necessary to send that
family's child to college,'' writes Chany in his Princeton Review
guide, ``Paying for College Without Going Broke,'' whose year 2000
edition came out last month. Not so, he adds, for well-to-do
families just looking for the college to pick up the bill. ``An
honest attempt to save money, and a willingness to make sacrifices,
can make a large impression,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, here are short-term strategies that can
maximize a family's chances for aid.
</P>
<P>
   Aid packages usually consist of a combination of grants,
work-study programs and, most often, low-interest loans. The
college's financial aid officers, who have considerable discretion
in allotting aid, can arrange a package using the institution's own
money and funds from numerous state and federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most well-known federal grant is the Pell, a gift of
up to $3,125 a year per student. But households with incomes over
$40,000 rarely qualify. The Perkins loan, which at 5 percent
currently carries the lowest interest rate of any higher education
loan, is also designed for the most needy.
</P>
<P>
   For stretched middle- and upper-income families, the most
accessible federal loan is the Stafford. This loan is either
subsidized or unsubsidized. Families that can demonstrate need and
qualify for the former don't pay interest while the student is in
college. The unsubsidized version is available to virtually anyone,
no matter what the household income. Because of the low interest
rate, which cannot go above 8.25 percent, some families have even
been known to take the loan just to invest the money. (The current
rate is 6.32 percent while the student is enrolled, after which it
rises slightly.)
</P>
<P>
   Colleges' methods for determining a family's need can be
subjective and confusing, especially for institutions doling out
their own money. ``There are a lot of different ways to view a
family's income and assets,'' Keane conceded. Even if you do not
receive government money, you may be eligible for thousands of
dollars in grants from the school itself.
</P>
<P>
   The formulas that are used to ascertain what is called the
Expected Family Contribution, or EFC, are indeed long, complicated
exercises. Applicants can get help with the federal formula at
www.ifap.ed.gov, the Department of Education's Web site for
financial aid professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive calculators for both the federal formula and the
Institutional Methodology, a different formula used by many private
colleges and some state universities, are available at
www.collegeboard.org.
</P>
<P>
   The formulas consider parent and student incomes and assets, as
well as the number of dependents and other family circumstances.
Financial aid officers at a student's chosen college compute the
cost of attendance, including tuition and fees, room and board and
allowances for books, transportation and personal expenses. That
number, minus the EFC, is a family's need _ the amount of money the
student is eligible to receive from the government and the college.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Say, for example, that a family of four has an annual household
income of $85,000. Not considering assets or any other
circumstances, such a family might be expected to contribute
$13,508 toward a child's education, which would amount to 15.9
percent of its gross annual income. At a state university, $13,508
could cover the entire cost for a year. At a private university, it
might cover only half the year's tuition. But the college could
arrange a package of government grants and loans or its own aid to
cover the balance.
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, Chany writes, ``Depending on how badly the
college wants the student, parents won't pay a penny more for an
exclusive private college than they would for a state school.'' In
some cases, they may even pay less, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   But families must first fit their financial picture into the
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``The EFC is the key number,'' said Greg Phillips, the president
of Phillips Financial Aid Services, a financial aid consulting
company in Pittsburgh. ``That's where income and asset planning
comes into play to get that number as low as you can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Juggling assets and income can be risky, so it's important to
talk to an accountant before making any big changes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``the process has to start early, not in December
of a child's senior year when these high schools have their
Financial Aid Nights,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``It's just too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that eligibility for aid is based on the family's
income from the tax year that began in January of the student's
junior year. By December, parents will want to have minimized their
discretionary income for that year's tax return by, say, avoiding
capital gains, profits on stock sales or premature withdrawals from
IRA's.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants also tell families with modest incomes and
substantial assets to file the short forms 1040A or 1040EZ, if they
can. When adjusted gross income falls below $50,000, assets are not
considered, no matter what their worth, when the data on the
federal form, the Free Application for Federal Aid, is analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, for instance, has clients with more than $1.5 million
in assets but a household income of $40,000. Because they could
file a 1040A, the clients ended up with a Pell grant and a Perkins
loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's crazy!'' Keane said. ``With a million dollars in
assets, it is likely they would not have received any need-based
aid from Cornell. That's why we use Profile.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the College Scholarship Service's Profile
form, which many private colleges require in addition to the
federal application and sometimes their own forms. Profile is far
more inquisitive, demanding more information on assets and income.
</P>
<P>
   But Keane adds that he would still have been required to provide
government money to Phillips' clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not allowed to deny somebody money when they prove
eligibility through the federal formula,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants often suggest that parents put money in children's
names because of the many tax benefits while the child is growing
up. But that move works against applicants who are filing for aid.
That's because in determining EFC, administrators using the federal
formula figure that the student will pay 35 percent of his or her
assets (25 percent according to the Institutional Methodology), and
parents 5.65 percent of theirs (5 percent in the Institutional
Methodology).
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think they should move that money back into the parents'
name before the kid applies for college?'' Keane said. ``Yeah, I
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really isn't the kids' money,'' he added. ``The students
never earned that money. But if a parent is putting money away for
their child, taking advantage of the tax law while the child is
growing up, they should be able to move that money back to where it
benefits them most for financial aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Families can have an exceptional financial year.
</P>
<P>
   Nice as that is, it distorts the picture when it comes to aid.
If a given year's income is extraordinary, consultants recommend
writing a letter of explanation to the college's financial aid
office, and including a tax return from the previous year to
demonstrate the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to hit them over the head with your special
circumstance,'' Chany said. ``You have to be short and brief,
because they are overworked. Tell them your income just went up, or
it's about to go way down. You have to give them real numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial aid officers sympathize with big medical expenses. And
if a special circumstance exists _ say, the parents are divorced,
and the father has stopped making his child-support payments _
officers can consider that, too.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the financial situation, the key to getting aid
is being a good student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grades, SAT's, the quality of the student and what they bring
to the table is going to make a difference,'' Ms. Thomas said.
``The admissions office is going to be a heck of a lot more
generous with a kid who has done really well than with Johnny over
there, who is just a C student, even though need-for-need, they may
be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher education may be hopelessly expensive, but there's at
least one source of aid that's often free: advice. The SLM Holding
Corp., better known as Sallie Mae, the nation's largest financer of
student loans, offers the following options for angst-filled (and
debt-ridden) parents.
</P>
<P>
   _ College Answer Service, (800) 891-4599. Financial-aid

scholarships, work-study programs and application procedures. You

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEISTON, England _ In a damp and windy corner of eastern
England, a large run-down Victorian mansion stands as an unlikely
monument to a revolutionary idea in education. It was here in the
1920s that a Scottish teacher founded Summerhill as the first
modern ``free school,'' where classes were not compulsory and key
decisions were made by an assembly of pupils and teachers. The
objective was even more unorthodox: that children should be happy
at school.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a powerful idea that challenged the
authoritarian tradition of British schooling and appealed to
anti-establishment intellectuals. In the 1960s, Summerhill became a
role model for alternative education in the United States, and to
this day, the prolific and passionate writings of its founder, A.
S. Neill, are studied widely by progressive educators.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, 26 years after Neill's death, the school is largely
forgotten in Britain. Or, rather, it was until last spring, when
the British government threaten-ed to close it after inspectors
from the Office for Standards in Education, or Ofsted, concluded
that ``Summerhill is not providing an adequate education for its
pupils.'' Suddenly it was back in the news. It had last been
featured in London tabloids in 1992, when a television documentary
showed teachers and pupils swimming naked together. This year,
newspapers have had fun with headlines like ``Kool Skools Rool
OK?'' and references to ``Lord of the Flies'' aplenty.
</P>
<P>
   But if Summerhill is used to controversy, the recent Ofsted
report was cause for particular alarm, because it attacked the
school's defining policy of allowing children to decide whether
they wanted an education. ``The school has drifted into confusing
educational freedom with the negative right not to be taught,'' the
report said. ``As a result, many pupils have been allowed to
mistake the pursuit of idleness for the exercise of personal
liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   This verdict did not come out of the blue. Ofsted inspectors
have been dissatisfied since at least 1990. Traditionally, British
schools have been reviewed every five years or so, but inspections
as a whole have become tougher and more frequent since 1997, when
Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government took office, pledging
to raise educational standards across Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Britain's Department for Education and
Employment said that the secretary of state, David Blunkett, had a
duty to ensure that children were safe and being educated. She
added, ``He has said that he cannot allow what is happening at
Summerhill to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Summerhill is fighting for its life under the command of Zo
Readhead, Neill's daughter, a lanky farmer's wife of 53 who
attended Summerhill in her father's day. Ms. Readhead has turned
her modest office at the school into battle headquarters, where she
sells T-shirts and coffee mugs to raise money for the cause, and
lobbies parents, alumni and politicians for support. She has
appealed three of the government's six complaints to an autonomous
government agency, the Independent Schools Tribunal, which is to
meet in February. If she loses, she plans to carry the fight to
England's courts. If frustrated again, she says she will turn to
the European Commission for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The perils of defying the government are very real. A formal
letter from the Registrar of Independent Schools addressed to Ms.
Readhead as the proprietor warned that Summerhill might be struck
off the official register if her appeal is rejected and she fails
to carry out the ``remedies'' _ improved accommodation and
``efficient and suitable instruction'' _ that have been demanded by
the government. ``The penalties for conducting an independent
school which is not on the register,'' the letter added darkly,
``are set out in Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the moment, daily school life seems largely
unaffected. One drizzly morning in late September, the pupils, in
their baggy jeans and loose sweaters, were doing what they normally
did: hammering in the woodworking room, playing with computers,
even going to class. Set in four acres of woodland a few miles from
the North Sea, the school has a main building surrounded by cabins
and one mobile home, which are used as classrooms and sleeping
quarters, and which the inspectors complained were ``very basic.''
(The report also noted that sharing toilets by boys, girls and
staff members contravened government regulations, and that some
floors had ``dangerous'' holes in them. The holes, it turned out,
were not too large.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the somewhat crude conditions, the children seemed
cheerful enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated state school,'' said Alexander Coad, a boisterous
14-year-old whose home is in Ipswich nearby. ``At first, I was
really scared here. But once you get settled, it's very friendly.''
His sentiment was echoed by John Benneworth, 11, who came here last
year after he received a diagnosis of dyslexia. ``In primary
school, they did things I didn't want to do, like tests,'' he said
softly. ``Here they don't make you do things. I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children seem remarkably self-assured perhaps
because of the twice-weekly gatherings of students and teachers _
one a democratic assembly, the other a ``tribunal'' to deal with
disciplinary questions _ where they learn to speak up. At one
recent hourlong assembly, sternly presided over by Daniel Kaburger,
a 14-year-old German student, debates were followed repeatedly by
votes _ on whether machetes could be carried around the school, on
whether a classroom and teacher should be assigned for late-evening
homework, on whether everyone should be obliged to see an
antismoking video. Young Daniel even chastised a teacher for being
late.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its fame, the school seems small, with just 59 boys
and girls ranging in age from 6 to 17, all but 11 boarders _ well
below what Ms. Readhead considers the ideal: 75. But Summerhill may
well be Britain's most international school: there are 18 British
pupils, 14 Germans, 10 Japanese, 6 Taiwanese, 4 Koreans, 3
Americans, 2 Swiss, 1 French and 1 Israeli. A Japanese edition of
Neill's most influential book, ``Summerhill School: A New View of
Childhood,'' and at least four Summerhill-inspired schools in Japan
explain why, at one time, half the pupils came from there. Although
Summerhill has a Japanese teacher and offers classes in French and
German, English is the lingua franca.
</P>
<P>
   The school's nationality breakdown clearly underlines the lack
of interest in alternative education in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   That is not surprising. When Neill founded Summerhill in 1921,
teaching in Britain was infamously repressive. In fact, it was
Neill's own unhappy childhood and early teaching experience in
Scotland _ under the tutelage of his father, a stern, puritanical
schoolmaster in the village of Forfar _ that inspired him to find a
way of ``liberating'' children. But today, Neill's philosophy is
overpowered by the marketplace, in which the aim is to raise
standards by stimulating competition among schools. To do so, the
government issues school performance tables based on results in
annual nationwide examinations, which newspapers publish in order
of excellence. All of which leads to the prevailing equation: good
results equal good colleges equal good jobs. Few parents, it seems,
are ready to experiment with their children's education.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, alternative education has always stirred interest
in the United States, where there has been a sharp increase in home
schooling and even ``unschooling,'' in which home-schooled children
can choose their own curriculum. Dozens of ``free schools,'' like
the Sudbury Valley School in Framingham, Mass., have adapted
Neill's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The British have always been the least interested in
Summerhill,'' said Ms. Readhead, who took over the school when her
mother, Ena, retired in 1985. (Her father died in 1973.) ``I think
the ideal for many people is a school with Summerhill's philosophy
but one where kids have to attend classes. But this is the raw edge
of our approach. You have to be prepared to stand back and watch a
kid take another path.''
</P>
<P>
   Neill himself set little store in formal education.
``Personally, I do not know what type of teaching is carried on,
for I never visit lessons, and have no interest in how children
learn,'' he wrote in a typically provocative vein. The freedom to
skip classes, though, was a consequence of his fundamental view
that, left to their own devices, children find their own ways of
learning, and eventually derive pleasure from doing so. It is that
view that Ms. Readhead is unwilling to abandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're free to do as you like as long as it doesn't interfere
with anyone else's freedom,'' she said. ``Neill's basic idea was
that kids should be treated as human beings, that their emotional
and social life was as important as their education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ofsted report, which was based on a five-day visit in March
by eight of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools, nonetheless zeroed
in on the lack of regular class attendance. ``Whether the pupils
make sufficient progress and achieve the standards of which they
are capable is left to each child's inclination,'' the report
stated. ``As a result, those willing to work achieve satisfactory
or even good standards, while the rest are allowed to drift and
fall behind.'' But the remarks follow a disclaimer: ``This report
cannot and does not pass judgment on the unique philosophy on which
Summerhill is founded.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in response to protest letters about the threat to
Summerhill from the school's defenders, Blunkett, the secretary of
state, has stated that ``we are not requiring Summerhill to abandon
its educational philosophy and force children to attend all lessons
and follow particular educational courses.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Ms. Readhead and her supporters, this is precisely the
government's objective. In a heated response, which was posted on
the school's Web site and will serve as the basis of the appeal in
February, Ms. Readhead called the report's style and language
``emotive and unprofessional'' and its contents ``biased and
prejudicial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ofsted has its role and place in the educational system,'' she
wrote. ``It should not be allowed to bully those who do not agree
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonattendance, she said, generally occurs at what Neill called
``the gang stage'' of early adolescence, when children tend to
rebel. But as the children's interests become more defined, she
noted, they are eager to sign up for classes. ``At Summerhill, we
have been observing this process for 78 years and find that
students do return to learning with fresh interest and enthusiasm
as they get older and mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerhill charges about $10,500 a year, far less than the
average $24,000 other private boarding schools in Britain charge.
One side effect of its lower fees, however, is high staff turnover
because teachers are paid poorly _ about $15,000 a year, as well as
board and lodging. Those who stay on, on the other hand, are true
believers in the school's philosophy of social and emotional
development over formal education, and the report found that 75
percent of the teachers were ``satisfactory or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the school follows a traditional
government-approved curriculum. ``We have no new methods of
teaching,'' Neill wrote in a book, ``because we do not think that
teaching very much matters.'' Thus, students at a school built
around the notion of personal freedom, even to the detriment of
learning, must sit for the same examinations as students in more
conventional schools. It is by these results that Summerhill is
judged by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The school does not prepare pupils for college entry, which in
Britain usually requires 18-year-olds to take the so-called ``A''
level examinations in at least three subjects. Rather, the
curriculum here ends with the General Certificate of Secondary
Education exams, taken by everyone at age 16 and, in the best
schools, involving 9 or 10 subjects. At Summerhill, since students
are usually drawn only to the subjects they enjoy, they are more
likely to test in only three or four subjects. Thus, if they
continue studying with a view to attending college, they have to
try to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   It is therefore not surprising that Summerhill does not feature
in the performance tables,which tend to list the 500 to 1,000
schools with the best results. Because of insufficient data from
the school, the government says it cannot compare Summerhill test
scores with the national average, but in 1998, 75 percent of the
students who took certificate-qualification exams passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pay attention to the league tables,'' Ms. Readhead
said. ``Everyone recognizes that in a school of 60 children, they
don't tell you anything. Also, in a school where only one-third of
students are British, two-thirds are sitting exams in their second
language.''
</P>
<P>
   More important to Summerhill, when pupils pursue further studies
it is because they are motivated to do so, and therefore have an
advantage over their peers. The evidence supporting this is mostly
anecdotal. But, with a view to answering Ofsted's criticism, the
school is now collecting information on the activities of alumni
who have left Summerhill in the last 12 years. Ms. Readhead herself
seems to give little importance to higher education: she dropped
out of art school and became a horseback-riding instructor before
returning to Summerhill. Despite her title as head teacher, she
does not teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, what's important is who you are, how you feel about
yourself, how you feel about your fellow man,'' she said. ``I can
put you in touch with a doctor who was here who is no happier than
another man doing a part-time job and playing music.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet there appears to be no shortage of former Summerhillians
who have successful careers, from the actress Rebecca De Mornay to
John Burningham, the children's book author and illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ruehle, a 29-year-old equity analyst for a hedge fund in
New York, was sent to Summerhill at age 9 by his German diplomat
parents, who worked in Paris then. ``The school in Paris was so
strict that I no longer wanted to go,'' he recalled. ``Once I got
to Summerhill, I definitely enjoyed it. You have a real sense of
freedom to develop what you want.'' He left with only two
general-certificate qualifications, but he promptly collected five
more and passed four A-level exams. ``I was very motivated, much
more than the others,'' he said. He then attended the University of
Sussex and completed an MBA at Baruch College of the City
University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   When Martha Neighbor, 39, returned to the United States at age
14 after five years at Summerhill, she had difficulty adjusting to
more orthodox schooling, and even dropped out after two years at
the University of Arizona. But she has no regrets. ``I think
academically Neill's theories were right,'' she said. ``Once I
found my motivation, I finished well and was very disciplined.''
Today, with a degree from Hunter College in New York and a master's
in art history and museum studies from the University of Southern
California, in Los Angeles, she is the managing director of Risa
Jaroslow and Dancers, a modern dance troupe in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experience of these and other alumni may not be
considered relevant when the Independent Schools Tribunal hears
Summerhill's appeal. By demanding that ``the school ensure that all
pupils engage regularly in learning,'' the government seems more
intent on attacking the very idea behind Summerhill. Perhaps the
only real surprise is the timing of the attack. Summerhill survived
the conservative orthodoxy of Margaret Thatcher's long rule. Now,
under a Labor government, its days may be numbered.

   Mary Daly reclined on the lawn of her lakeside condominium and
pondered what a tree might reveal about ``radical elemental
feminism.'' Professor Daly, a 70-year-old pioneer of the women's
movement, was explaining how that term, which appears in the
subtitle of her seventh and most recent book, ``Quintessence,''
differs from ``essentialism,'' the label critics have long used to
describe what they view as simple-minded woman worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know meanings for `essence' from Aristotelian philosophy
that are interesting to me,'' said Professor Daly, who holds
doctorates in philosophy and sacred theology. ``Like, what is the
essence of a tree? But that's not what they're saying,'' she said
of radical feminism's opponents. ``They're saying, if you want to
name anything specific about women, especially positive, then
you're falling into this mysterious thing that is bad.''
Essentialism, she concluded, is an empty epithet denying the
commonalities women feel with one another and with the organic
world.
</P>
<P>
   With that, she ended her consideration of the term, dismissing
it as boring, as she often does with ideas that distract from hers.
She would rather delve into her own elaborate cosmology, which
stresses the life force she calls elemental.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elemental, to me, whoo! _ it's so wild and so transgressive of
boundaries,'' she continued. ``Like, that tree is elemental. It has
a life of its own. It really has, it's beautiful. And so is the
sky, the water, grass. There are elemental sounds of the alphabet.
Like, `Aaah!' ''She sang robustly, a deep note. ``It's rough, raw,
natural. It is not fabricated, foreground. It's about motion and
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Professor Daly said ``e-Motion,'' a word of her own
conjuring that means ``elemental passion which moves women out/away
from the fixed/framed state of stagnation; pyrogenetic passion that
fires deep knowing and willing, stirring metamemory, propelling
wild women on the otherworld journey.'' She coined the term in
``Pure Lust,'' her 1984 treatise on elemental feminist philosophy,
and defined it in ``Websters' First New Intergalactic Wickedary of
the English Language,'' a feminist dictionary she started writing
with Jane Caputi the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Another word in Professor Daly's lexicon is ``foreground,''
which she defines as the illusory reality established over the
centuries within a male-dominated, hierarchical culture bent on
destroying women, animals and the earth. Its antonym,
``background,'' is what she has spent her life trying to reach: a
primeval, female-oriented consciousness that would replace conquest
with interaction and the hunger to own with the lust to create.
(Paradoxically, when the college was male-only, she taught feminism
to men.) But in the fall of 1998, a student named Duane Naquin
threatened a lawsuit when barred from her ``Feminist Ethics''
class.
</P>
<P>
   Naquin was hardly the first male to challenge Professor Daly's
policy. Her difficulties with the college had reached a boiling
point at least once a decade, and usually she would take a leave,
let things cool, and return. But Naquin was financed by the
right-wing organization Center for Independent Research, and the
crisis had come at a time when feminist spirit was at a remarkable
low, on campus and off. Boston College administrators used his case
to push Professor Daly toward retirement.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of complicated moves, the college contended that
Professor Daly had agreed to retire last January, although she had
never signed any papers to that effect. Supported by a small
defense fund organized by former students, and with savings drawn
from her annual salary of $43,275, Professor Daly is not only
fighting for her job but also for her base as a public
intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Boston College tried to fire Professor Daly was
in 1969. The bugaboo then was the widespread success of ``The
Church and the Second Sex,'' her scathing critique of Roman
Catholic sexism. About 2,500 students, fired by the youth movements
on campuses nationwide, signed a petition demanding her tenure,
which she received. In 1975, when she was denied full professorship
(her title is still associate professor), forces coalesced again.
Feminists gathered in protest at a campus gymnasium. ``Sisters,''
declared the poet Robin Morgan, ``we meet on bloody Jesuit
ground!''
</P>
<P>
   That same ground is eerily quiet as Professor Daly struggles
today. There have been no major campus protests. The Harvard
theologian Harvey Cox wrote an editorial praising her in The Boston
Globe, but in that same newspaper, the columnist Adrian Walter
called her an ``intellectual crackpot.'' Laura Flanders reported
sympathetically on her plight in The Nation, which prompted a star
columnist, Katha Pollitt, to criticize same-sex education in
general and Professor Daly in particular. Most prominent feminists
have been silent on the subject of Mary Daly, although Eleanor
Smeal and Gloria Steinem have voiced support. While Professor
Daly's work is still taught in many women's studies courses and has
popular readership, her radicalism has lost its context.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been cruel to her because she's not hip,'' said
Debra Campbell, who teaches a seminar on Professor Daly's work at
Colby College, in Waterville, Maine. ``Mary doesn't go along with
the current; she didn't when she started out. She never quite fit
in.''
</P>
<P>
   In describing her tactics as a lesbian feminist battling
patriarchy from within a Jesuit institution, Professor Daly says,
``I have a theory of living on the boundary, on the boundary of
patriarchy, and the boundary of different dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Professor Daly's writing has grown more
experimental, while retaining its insight and fleshy vitality. In
her last two books, she has explored a version of psychic time
tr`Quintessence,'' published last year by Beacon Press,
alternates between chapters that deplore her latest subjects of
scorn, most prominently biotechnology and genetic engineering, and
``cosmic comments'' by a woman named Anonyma, who lives in the year
2048 and receives magical visits from the author. The segments give
the book a science-fiction sheen, and propose that feminists need
to harness visionary power to survive. The Lost and Found
Continent, where Anonyma lives, is a futuristic rendering of the
archaic gynocentric culture radical feminists have long sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get to a deep future, but in order to get to a
deep future, I had to think about the deep past,'' Professor Daly
explained. ``Coming now at the edge of the millennium, it's a
desperate idea.'' It is also the perspective of a quick-thinking
woman who realizes that the present has let her down.

</P>
<P>
   No one questions Professor Daly's role as a paradigm shifter.
Her critique of patriarchal mythologies, from Dionysius' to
Christ's, and the female-oriented ``be-ing and be-speaking'' that
she presents as an alternative, are the groundwork of feminist
spiritual inquiry. The goddess-oriented movements with which Ms.
Daly is often linked have been influential within therapeutic and
New Age circles, and the same-sex education she advocates has had a
recent resurgence in lower schools as well as colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that there is a feminist movement, it has to be
a pretty big tent,'' Katha Pollitt said. ``I would never say Mary
Daly didn't have a place.'' But, like many a feminist shaping
today's debates, Ms. Pollitt thinks the movement's focus should be
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention Professor Daly has received ``confirms a
certain stereotype about feminists, which is lesbian separatism,''
she added. ``It implies that feminism is not about a more humane
life for everybody, it's about women having power to exclude and
punish men. That idea is not popular, because the deepest current
of American thinking about this is the idea of simple fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatists like Ms. Pollitt believe in working within society,
since that's the material at hand. Her levelheadedness is far more
representative of feminism now than Professor Daly's prophetic
stance. In the '70s, when discussion ran hot in
consciousness-raising groups and at rallies across the country,
writers like Kate Millett, Robin Morgan and Andrea Dworkin gained
large audiences denouncing misogyny and celebrating sisterhood in
broad, incendiary terms. Now, such bold voices have been
overshadowed by those of common-sense women working in academia or
in the public sphere. Fighting a backlash that has many women
rejecting the ``feminism'' word altogether, today's influential
feminists have become expert at winning difficult arguments, and
among those with whom they are willing to argue are those earlier
rabble-rousers.
</P>
<P>
   Such divisions have deep roots. Many feminists who followed the
wave exemplified by Professor Daly have now rejected it as extreme.
Women of color have often felt excluded from these dialogues, while
pro-sex feminists found some radicals' attitudes toward pornography
restrictive. And theorists found their writing unprofessional. In
turn, many older feminist thinkers have grown even more hostile.
Lines have been drawn, angry words hurled. Communication among the
various camps has basically stopped.
</P>
<P>
   For Professor Daly, this has meant further isolation. Like many
of her peers, she has been labeled a ``victim feminist,'' although
a quick browse through her books reveals that gleeful fury, not
self-pity, is the dominant tone. She considers this a symptom of
``reversal,'' the patriarchal condition of women's truths being
deeply buried or distorted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a reversal society, it's like Orwell's `1984,' ''she said.
``Like, the Ministry of Love is where they torture people, the
Ministry of Truth is propaganda. Reversal is a mental trick behind
all that. It would make sense, then, that they would call the
person who least wants to be a victim, who wants to kill off
victimism, self-victimizing. The reversal is to be expected. That
doesn't make it easier to take when it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Daly's vision, however, still resonates within feminist
debate. The academic philosophers Marilyn Frye and Sarah Lucia
Hoagland are editing an anthology of critical responses to her
work, to be published as part of the ``Rereading the Canon'' series
by Pennsylvania State University Press in the winter of 2000. The
series also includes thinkers like Plato, Descartes, Mary
Wollstonecraft and Ayn Rand.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe the book, Professors Frye and Hoagland
responded by e-mail. Their statement challenged those who would
argue Professor Daly's obsolescence. ``We are disrupting a
developmental narrative that has grown up among some feminist
theorists,'' they wrote. ``That is a narrative that casts Mary Daly
and other early Second Wave thinkers as juvenile, and later
developments as a maturation: the daughters reversing her story and
casting the mothers as children and themselves as the mothers.
Women inventing that tale may soon be shocked to find themselves
cast as obsolete by others in the next generation, whose political
and cognitive possibilities were (like their own) shaped by Daly's
interventions.''
</P>
<P>
   These confrontational words echo Professor Daly's. In
``Quintessence,'' she declares that French postmodernists like Luce
Irigaray, not to mention potential allies like Alice Jardine of
Harvard University, are not feminists at all but puppets of dead
white males like Michel Foucault. ``I'm pretty vitriolic about
it,'' Professor Daly said of her derision of high theory. ``I'm
very angry that it sucks up so much energy from young women,
working and working and working to figure out these texts and then
to reproduce them, producing thousands of pages of what to me is
blather.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Jardine admitted that she had not read
``Quintessence.'' She judges such spats within the larger context
of America's waning intellectual life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis in education, in the humanities, it's huge,'' she
said. ``There is a pervasive sadness about the loss of community
and influence. Whenever that happens, people turn on each other.
It's the old divide and conquer.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``The thing that makes me sad is that there isn't
more dialogue. At the Harvard Divinity School they're reading Mary
Daly and Luce Irigaray, and having amazing conversations about
angels and saints and faith and wisdom that are often quite
radically feminist. There's no reason in the world that you can't
read both without getting into a war about who's right and who's
wrong.''

</P>
<P>
   Mary Daly is a prickly person as well as an intellectual
iconoclast. Interviewing her is like sitting down for an office
hour with your most intimidating teacher; she throws questions back
at you, seeks out opinions you don't necessarily want to share and
leaves you wondering if you impressed or disgusted her. But she
also has a sneaky sense of humor and an obvious love of life, which
surfaces in her enthusiastically rambling stories and through a
personal presence that still comes off as rakish.
</P>
<P>
   Like many visionaries, she is narcissistic. She footnotes
herself incessantly and describes personal events, like the lives
of her various cats, in epic terms. Yet, is it fair to call her
more self-absorbed than a male writer like Harold Bloom or the late
Alfred Kazin? Consciousness is the realm she examines, and she has
better access to her own inner life than anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathizers conjecture that Professor Daly might have evolved
into a feminist emerita instead of a self-described ``revolting
hag'' if Boston College had not treated her so harshly throughout
her career. Yet it is difficult to imagine her as an ambitious
academic, donning fashionable suits instead of her rugged hiking
clothes, and attending tedious faculty meetings. She calls herself
a pirate, rescuing plundered female wisdom and smuggling it back to
her students. These young women, more than distant friends like Ms.
Dworkin or Ms. Morgan, are her true collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite an intimate connection in the classroom: boom,
boom, boom!'' she said. ``So, in that room, and in audiences where
I've spoken, there's a circulating energy that's extremely exciting
and is felt by everybody, that somehow puts me in touch with
something real in women.''
</P>
<P>
   She hoarded that energy, making sure not to waste any on the
undeserving. That meant most of the faculty at Boston College,
including those female professors who persuaded the administration
to establish a women's studies minor in 1983. About 20 students
graduate with that minor each year, while 50 to 70 take the
``Introduction to Feminisms'' class each semester. It is striking
that no contact seems to occur between the feminists who are
teaching on this fairly conservative campus and their most famous
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   For many students, Professor Daly has been more legend than
reality. She has often taken leaves to write or to avoid the
university's latest attempt to make her integrate her classroom.
``She is an enduring name and mystery, an absent presence,'' said
Judith Wilt, who teaches in the English department and was the
first faculty adviser in the women's studies minor. ``She hasn't
come to any of our programs. She has been willing to talk to women
faculty who want to talk to her, but not much about what they're
doing. So it's easy to lose everything except the memory of the key
radical propositions she put forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Daly has formed strong bonds with her students. Emily
Mann is one such acolyte. She took two Daly classes before
graduating in 1998, and the encounter led her to pursue a master's
degree in women's studies from University College in Dublin, which
she recently completed. ``It was one of the most valuable learning
experiences I ever had,'' Ms. Mann said. ``She's amazing, and
because what she does is not part of the mainstream, she doesn't
get recognized. She's incredibly creative and dynamic, and the
university needs people like her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mann is backing up her words with actions, working to
organize the defense fund for Professor Daly. Most of its support
is coming from former students who are scattered around the
country, not ones currently at the Boston College campus. ``There
was a button campaign in the spring, but the sentiment coming out
of the student body, it's not very positive,'' Ms. Mann noted.
</P>
<P>
   The campus weekly paper, called The Heights, has published only
two articles on Professor Daly's plight, one in February 1998 and
one in mid-October. Carolyn Brancatella, a sophomore who wrote the
second article with another student, Kim Aime, said that few
students she interviewed knew who Mary Daly was.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the school cafeteria the day after the second article
was printed, Ms. Brancatella and her editor, Laure Rakvic,
expressed mixed feelings about the Daly case. Both women attended
Roman Catholic girls' high schools, and saw the value in single-sex
education. But they felt that even one such class at Boston College
violated the university's code.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up Pandora's box,'' said Ms. Brancatella, echoing the
administration's often-aired opinion. ``Before you know it, you'll
be saying we can have classes of all this group or all that group.
And we've done that. There's really no need to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rakvic expressed similar reservations about feminism in
general. ``We need to know about oppression, about women's
psychology, and be aware of how different things affect us,'' she
said. ``But I think anger is associated with feminism a lot. And I
don't want the guys I know to be, like, oh, she's angry, nasty.
That's not going to get me anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   With such sentiments coming from a chief editor of the campus
newspaper, a woman who plans to earn her law degree in the next
five years, it's no wonder that Boston College has not rallied
behind Professor Daly. A comment that Professor Wilt made further
suggested that the feminism practiced on the campus was a very
different kind from the rageful joy radical feminists embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of young women, one crucial part of the journey is
finding a male peer who understands feminist language, or has had
feminist experience, or is willing to hear them talk about that,''
she said. ``If they're really on a journey from nothing, that's a
key experience. Which is one of the reasons why it's really
important to educate men about feminism.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent crisp autumn afternoon at Mount Holyoke College in
South Hadley, Mass., Jane Crosthwaite, a theology professor,
gathered a group of her students to discuss Mary Daly and the state
of feminist discourse. These women were forthright, unapologetic
and strong, just the kind of inheritors Professor Daly would want
to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I'd read her first,'' said Erica Dyson. ``There are
other classes in which I've read a lot of theoretical stuff, and
some of her ideas would have nailed the underlying stuff down first
for me, so I would not have had to do so much wading through.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Claire Mackey did read Professor Daly in her first women's
studies class at Mount Holyoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beyond what I thought was radical,'' she said
approvingly. ``The one thing that stuck out in my mind was her
notion of God as a verb. That pretty much blew my mind. I'd always
had problems thinking of God as a male or a female, so God the verb
really answered my prayers, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cassidy was not eager to discover a voice like Professor
Daly's. But it hit her nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I was a person who came in and said, `I don't want to
be involved in any of that radical feminist stuff.' Whose side am I
on? I'm on my side,'' she said. ``But there is an enlightenment in
hearing about it, in opening up to the possibilities. And I don't
think by any means that the work is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Mount Holyoke students expressed problems with
Professor Daly's language; Ms. Dyson said her talk of crones and
witches reminded her too much of her own hippie parents. But they
all agreed that the message she offered was relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is our Moses,'' Professor Crosthwaite said. ``She's
standing at the mountain, looking down into the Promised Land.''
It's far too patriarchal an analogy for Mary Daly to embrace. But
its grandeur, and its oddness, hit the mark.

<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ It's called beer pong, and at Dartmouth College
a place where traditions die hard _ it has been part of fraternity
life for at least 40 years, as hallowed as rush or Winter Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   The basic rules are blindingly simple: lots of cups of beer are
placed on both ends of a Ping-Pong table. Opponents try to knock
the ball into the cups, and when one lands in a beer at your end of
the table, you drink it. The game is over when the beer is gone or
when the opponents are too drunk to see the ball anymore.
</P>
<P>
   On a crisp late September evening, Nathaniel Taylor, a 1998
Dartmouth graduate, was back in his old fraternity uniform _ khaki
shorts, white T-shirt, cap with a crimped bill _ playing doubles
with three fraternity brothers behind the forest-green Alpha Chi
Alpha house. Many cups of beer had been consumed, and 25 more
remained, spread out across the table.
</P>
<P>
   The ball plunked into one of Taylor's beers, and after chugging
it, he elucidated the virtues of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beautiful thing about this game,'' he announced, ``is that
you really can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The observation drew a big laugh from the crowd gathering for
Alpha Chi's first keg party of the fall term. But hanging over the
high spirits that night along Webster Avenue, a street of rambling,
ragged houses known as frat row, there was an unmistakable whiff of
impending defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The previous February _ in a proclamation that seemed ominously
millennial _ Dartmouth's governing board and its new president,
James Wright, declared that the college would begin a fundamental
rethinking of how its 4,300 undergraduate students live and
socialize.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement mentioned fraternities and sororities only
once, in passing. It focused on the college's plans to improve
crowded residence halls, its dining rooms and its social spaces, to
give students more opportunities to meet, learn from and maybe
learn to like ``others who have different backgrounds, experiences
and expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But to most of the students who read the statement that icy day,
and read about it again in national newspapers, it was about just
one thing: ending the extraordinary dominance that the Greek houses
have exercised over Dartmouth's social life for most of this
century.
</P>
<P>
   No one had to read between the lines. Among the college's main
goals were to end alcohol abuse and create a new social system that
would be ``substantially coeducational'' _ a direct shot to the
heart of fraternity life.
</P>
<P>
   The national attention that has descended on the campus since
that day has come mostly for two reasons. The one that still makes
administrators cringe is Dartmouth's enduring link to the 1978
movie ``Animal House,'' based partly on the excesses of one
fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi, in the early 1960s. Deserved or not,
the ``Animal House'' image, one of drunken abandon and wanton
chauvinism, still clings to its fraternities.
</P>
<P>
   But a more important reason is that the college's plans
represent an important test case in a small but growing movement,
mostly in the Northeast. Worried about alcohol-related deaths,
sexual assaults and hazing, but mostly by deep divisions within
their student bodies, more than a dozen colleges have either banned
fraternal organizations from campus or forced them to become
coeducational, and hundreds of fraternity and sorority chapters
have either prohibited or pledged to prohibit alcohol at their
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth is being watched especially closely because of the
size and seemingly sturdy popularity of the world it is trying to
change. As of last fall, just over half of the eligible students
were members of fraternities or sororities. (Freshmen cannot join.)
This is partly because in Hanover, the woodsy, isolated, almost
tavernless New Hampshire village where the college was founded in
1769, frats have long been the only game in town for students who
want to socialize over alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternities also provide a sought-after haven for men who
still want at least one setting without women. And if anything, the
draw of sororities, at a college some women still perceive as
male-dominated, has been even stronger. This fall's sorority rush
attracted a record number of pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its size, Dartmouth has become a magnifying glass for
the problems that have long plagued the Greek system, at least
according to many faculty members, administrators and trustees.
They complain that it keeps the small school badly balkanized _
members are overwhelmingly white and from higher-income families.
They say it perpetuates a dangerous, deeply engrained Dartmouth
ethic: ``work hard, play hard.'' (``These are competitive kids,''
one faculty member says. ``That applies to drinking, too.'')
</P>
<P>
   At its worst, college officials say, the system is the
antithesis of a modern liberal education, which should prepare
students to cope in an increasingly diverse world.
</P>
<P>
   Its influences have even begun to reach into the operations of
the college itself: professors complain of the near impossibility
of scheduling Thursday morning classes because Wednesday night is
now party night, a kind of symbolic start of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dentzer, a 1977 graduate who is now a trustee, asked
students at a recent forum whether they saw any point to their
parents' and the university's investing tens of thousands of
dollars in their education ``when you can't get people to get up on
Thursday morning to go to class for the reason they're ostensibly
here in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that make any sense?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The guys gathered behind the Alpha Chi house will concede that,
in principle, it does not make much sense. But they seem to have no
more idea than the trustees of how to change the fraternity
culture, short of destroying it.
</P>
<P>
   The debate about Greek houses is ultimately about much more than
beer drinking. It is about basic questions of the culture of
college campuses at the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Is there still a place in higher education for single-sex
organizations, long under siege in other parts of society? Do
fraternities and sororities enforce divisions of race and income
that college officials have been trying for years to eliminate, as
diversity on campuses increases?
</P>
<P>
   At large institutions, where a smaller percentage of the student
body is involved in fraternities and sororities, these questions
have been less critical. But at many small colleges, the questions
are being answered.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 years, Colby, Amherst, Bowdoin and Middlebury
College have _ as Williams did a generation earlier _ either closed
or begun the process of phasing out traditional fraternities and
sororities. They are usually replaced by a system of college
``houses,'' modeled largely after Yale's and Harvard's _ basically
dormitories that are intended to be student centers for dining,
intramural sports and parties. Administrators assign students to
the houses, creating a social mix to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton College, in Clinton, N.Y., following the same path,
recently began requiring all students to live on campus,
effectively shutting down the Greek houses. Trinity College in
Hartford has ordered all fraternal groups to go coed. A handful of
colleges and universities around the country, and as many as 11
national fraternity organizations, are trying to tame the party
culture, at least, by banning alcohol at fraternity and sorority
houses.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes have raised another important question: How much
power should colleges have to stage-manage the lives of students
outside the classroom?
</P>
<P>
   Many students in the Greek system and even outside of it object
to the very premise of changes being imposed on student social life
_ the kind of paternalism they thought they left behind in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   At a Dartmouth ``town meeting'' on Sept. 21 at which students
got a chance to talk to trustees, Patrick Granfield, a freshman,
summed up the sentiment: ``All of us here today are smart enough to
be here. We've earned the right to be here. Why not give us the
choice to decide which programs we want to pursue, whether or not
they're your programs or inside the fraternity system?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dentzer, the trustee, who is also a senior correspondent for
``The News Hour With Jim Lehrer'' on public television, assured him
that ``we do strongly believe in free choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she added, ``we want those choices to be very
structured kinds of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   She barely finished the sentence before she was drowned out by
laughter and boos from students.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, though, is clearly one the trustees have spent a lot
of time thinking about. And they seem to have sided with a growing
number of college administrators who see a need to provide more
guidance over students' extracurricular lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult balance,'' said Peter M. Fahey, another
trustee and a senior director at Goldman Sachs. ``Because it's
clear that if you leave college-age students to themselves, they're
going to come up with a system, yes. But it's not necessarily going
to be one that's best for their development.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Dartmouth's Greek system has given college
officials a lot of reason to think this is true. Last year, a
fraternity and a sorority sponsored a ``ghetto party,'' in which
the floor was decorated with chalk outlines of bodies, and
students, mostly white, dressed up in Afros and baggy jeans, some
carrying toy guns. Admissions officials said publicity about the
party damaged efforts to recruit African-American students.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to create a social structure that would end such
abuses, while retaining the best aspects of Greek tradition,
Dartmouth is facing a huge hurdle: it isn't easy making fun-loving,
newly independent students participate in a social life that is
supposed to be good for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating that there's such a divide between our
academic life and our social life here, but that's a hard thing to
squash,'' said Janelle Ruley, a history major pursuing a research
project on the student life changes. ``I mean, how do you change
the buzz on a campus?''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Errik Anderson, a brother at Psi Upsilon, puts it: ``No
one's going to want to go to the party James Wright is throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sentiment Wright is well aware of. ``I'm not going to
spend my time trying to plan Saturday nights for the students,'' he
insisted. ``I don't imagine that I have many ideas that would be of
great interest to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the trustees need only look to the schools close by to
see how difficult it is to make fraternities seem less attractive,
as well as to impose diversity.
</P>
<P>
   At Williams, which was the first to phase out fraternities,
beginning in 1962, in favor of the Yale system, the college houses
have gradually fallen out of favor as the focus of social
activities. Instead, students have once again begun to socialize
according to their commonalities _ jocks with jocks, minority
students with other minority students. While the divisions are
nothing like those created by fraternities, ``there is some
self-selecting going on,'' said Jim Kolesar, a college spokesman.
``It just seems to be human nature that people select people like
them and keep people out who aren't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Middlebury and Colby, which voted to ban single-sex
organizations, an underground Greek system has sprung up. The
fraternities have no houses, and their members risk expulsion if
found out, but they meet and hold parties in secret, avoiding
conversations about frat activities on campus phones. Fraternities
have also been growing at Yale, where the residential college
system had long made many dormant, and at Princeton, where they
have never been officially recognized.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of Dartmouth's new system will not be announced
until the end of the year, when the trustees will vote on
recommendations made by a task force. But it could end up looking
something like the one at Trinity. When that school ordered
fraternities to go coed, some houses made the leap, but others shut
down, protesting that a coed fraternity was a contradiction of
everything fraternities stood for.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Gittelman, executive director of Delta Phi, a 172-year-old
fraternity with a Trinity chapter, said that while three of his
chapters have now officially admitted women _ because the college
mandated it or because members wanted it _ the idea is not one that
students or traditional fraternities support. Fraternity leaders
say coed houses often struggle to recruit members, and problems
with alcohol are almost never diminished by introducing women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a different dynamic to being in a coed fraternity,''
he said. ``Some people will thrive in that setting, and some will
not. It's not anything most college students are rushing out to
join.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraternity brothers defend the traditional Greek system as an
irreplaceable way to keep campus traditions alive and teach
students about loyalty and leadership, skills they will need in the
business world. Dartmouth fraternity leaders point out that they
provide another valuable asset: a setting for the entire campus to
socialize together, at open parties where any student with a
college identification card is allowed in. ``The burden of it is a
little bit of a bummer,'' said Teddy Rice, president of Psi
Upsilon. ``But we look at it as a gift to our campus.''

   Wright recalls that up through the late 1960s, even after the
beer-fueled excesses that inspired ``Animal House,'' frats still
had a more refined side. ``When I first came here as a young
faculty member,'' he said, ``the Greek system was a place where
many faculty would be invited by their students to come over on a
Friday afternoon and have a cocktail party. It was just a different
sort of environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the late 1970s, with membership growing rapidly, it was
more common for fraternity men to invite themselves over to the
president's stately residence, near the end of Webster Avenue. Not
for cocktails, but to ``boot'' (vomit) on his yard in the middle of
the night, a fraternity rite of passage. Wright says the tradition,
thankfully, seems to have faded.
</P>
<P>
   Problems grew so bad that in 1978, James Epperson, an English
professor, led a movement to ban fraternities, accusing them of
nothing less than ``general barbarism.'' His movement failed, but
it led to a long, and only intermittently successful, effort to
rein in behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the red tape created to strangle that culture
has become thick enough to stun anyone who still thinks of
fraternity parties as ``Animal House'' free-for-alls.
</P>
<P>
   A Dartmouth party must be registered with college officials
several days in advance and classified into ``tiers,'' according to
the number of guests _ tier 2 parties must have a guest list and no
more than 400 people; tier 3 parties have open admission, usually
with a live band and more than 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Metal identification tags must be affixed to beer kegs, and only
24 are supposed to be in use on campus during any one night
(meaning, if there are five social events, one might end up being
allowed the buzz-killing sum of just four kegs). A campus security
guard must also be allowed inside twice a night, to inspect keg
tags and make sure students are posted at doors to check students'
ID's.
</P>
<P>
   The keg party at Alpha Chi _ a tier-3 event with five official
kegs _ began to crank to life about 11 p.m. The fraternity's
president, Sebastian Barreveld, a brooding, quietly confident
senior, posted himself by the front door with a squad of brothers.
And for at least the first few hours, they consistently checked
students' ID's, marking the hands of those not old enough to drink
and turning away first-term freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity, which nurtures a campus reputation as fairly
mild, does view under-age drinkers as a huge practical and legal
headache. ``They have the average attention span of puppies,'' said
Barreveld wearily, turning away one group of visibly drunk freshmen
women, who pouted and then tried to flirt their way in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will keep coming back,'' he said. And as the night wore
on, some of them did, easily slipping in as the monitors' attention
wandered, and the crowds built.
</P>
<P>
   The security guard, Robert Young, a genial, smiling man with a
crew cut and clipboard, arrived at 11:45 p.m. He took the
signatures of the door monitors and trooped quickly through the
house, spending most of his time where the party was concentrated:
in the basement, with the kegs. The basement fully lived up to the
frat-party stereotype: dim, crowded, smelly, the wooden walls
carved with graffiti and the floor already fouled with pools of
what partygoers call mung _ a black slush made of beer, grime and
probably urine.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the sounds of techno throbbed from a darkened dance
hall, but the room was nearly empty. The free beer was the main
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the basement, Young made sure that the most
ridiculed college party rule _ Regulation 3.2.7 of the Coed,
Fraternity and Sorority Social Events Policy _ was being followed.
It mandates that, for those students who choose not to drink or
those who need food to soak up the beer, ``nonsalty food and
nonalcoholic beverages must be available for the duration of a
registered social event.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: a pack of Nutter Butter cookies and a couple liters
of Coke that had hardly been touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking good, looking good,'' Young announced, glancing around
at a hundred or so students, all mildly drunk and glaring at him.
</P>
<P>
   He was mostly trying to make sure that there was no overcrowding
and nobody sick on the floor, though, he added, ``we are definitely
strict about the amount of alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   After he left, Barreveld described him as ``basically a pretty
cool guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all show,'' he said. ``He knows that, and we know
that. It's easy to change the tags on the kegs. I mean, we've got
12 more kegs downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   As college officials and trustees continue their search for a
new social paradigm, there are many who would probably be happy if
it looked like Phi Tau, one of three coeducational fraternities on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   The night after the Alpha Chi keg party, Phi Tau held its first
mixer of the fall term _ called, no irony intended, a ``Milque and
Cookies'' party. The only refreshments served were, in fact,
cookies and gallons of milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, welcome,'' said Christine Chung, a senior psychology
major from Honolulu, to a group of students who wandered into the
doorway of Phi Tau, looking confused. ``This way to the milk and
cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chung showed them to Josh Breedlove, a house member dressed
in American Indian garb (he is half Choctaw) who was passing out
Pecan Sandies and chocolate squares on a platter.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity, with 25 members and a rough balance between men
and women, does not prohibit alcohol, but the members do not buy it
for parties. Some members say they drink occasionally. Others say
they abhor the thought of it and joined to be part of a house in
which they never felt pressured to drink.
</P>
<P>
   The members are proud _ almost piously so _ of their house. And
they do not bother to hide their disdain for traditional
fraternities. ``I don't like random drunk people,'' said Ms. Chung.
(The feeling is mutual. At the Alpha Chi party, a member warned:
``If you're going to the milk and cookies party, be careful, man.
Somebody might try to get you into a game of Dungeons and
Dragons.'')
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, in the tattered halls of Phi Tau's house, are pictures
of the fraternity's racially diverse alumni. The current members
can remember only one student who ever rushed the fraternity being
turned down _ and that was because everyone was scared of him.
</P>
<P>
   There are common bathrooms, with stalls, not urinals. Men room
with men and women with women, and while relationships do flower,
sex in the house is frowned upon, said Virginia DeJesus-Rueff, the
president. ``Of course, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen,'' she
said. ``But you'd be surprised how much everybody gets along around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I don't quite understand why people think of a coed
house as so revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, instead of a beer basement and mung, there is a
neatly kept game room with a pool table and a soda fountain. And
next door is a video room decorated with ``Star Trek'' posters and
a no-smoking sign, where the fraternity holds its ``Friday Night
Flix'' parties. (Phi Tau's Web site describes them as ``great
company and a truly unique selection of movies _ anything from `The
Princess Bride' to `The Silence of the Lambs.' '')
</P>
<P>
   The night before, the Alpha Chi party had lurched on until 3
a.m. The Phi Tau party ran out of energy and guests by about 11:30
p.m. As the party wound down, the members piled onto couches in the
video room, every one of them sober and sated with cookies. They
considered the night a great success. But they were the first to
admit that their brand of fun might not be for everyone _ and that
imposing Phi Tau's on the rest of campus was not the answer,
either.

 &HT;    HOUSE PANEL TOLD TO CUT TROOPS, NOT AID TO HAITI
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Plans to reduce the number of American military
troops in Haiti should not interfere with efforts to foster
economic growth and democracy there, federal lawmakers told a House
panel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., suggested that the United States retain
a small military presence in Haiti to assist the government in
building schools and roads. Graham added that international
observers and possibly a U.S. congressional delegation should be
positioned in Haiti to supervise next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning our back on Haiti is not an option,'' Graham said at a
hearing of the House Committee on International Relations Tuesday.
``We would be the beneficiaries of Haiti's improved health.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham noted that Haiti's economic and politcal stability are
crucial to Florida, in particular, which has experienced waves of
Haitian refugees during periods of turmoil on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Graham urged the House to follow the Senate's lead in passing an
expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative to give countries in
Latin America and the Caribbean trade status similar to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said, ``We can't ignore Haiti. Our
nation can still play a constructive role in partnership with the
Haitian people to ensure that the money troubles inflicting this
small island do not pass a point where they can't be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton dispatched 20,000 American troops to restore
democracy to Haiti in 1994. The administration expects to remove
those troops by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Local elections in Haiti, which were scheduled to occur in
December, have been postponed until March and its presidential
elections are planned for November 2000. DeWine said that elections
have been rescheduled three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent a stable and democratic government in place, Haiti has
no hope of achieving real and lasting economic, political, and
judicial reforms,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Haiti abolished its military forces and created
a national police force.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., said the United States has spent more
than $75 million training and building the police force but it has
only 5,000 members to patrol the entire country. Haiti is about the
size of New York City which has about 45,000 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the Haitian national police are up to the task of of
ensuring an adequate security environment for next year's elections
is a justifiable concern,'' Goss said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Romero, acting assistant Secretary of State for Western
Hemisphere Affairs, told the panel that the United States has
invested $16 million in the upcoming election process, $2 million
of which will be used to strengthen the police force.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine urged that until a more democratic government is
established in Haiti, U.S. financial aid should be sent through
private organizations _ rather than the government _ in order to
guarantee that the money is used for the welfare of the people.

   BOXING
</P>
<P>
   BOX-HOLYFIELD _ ATLANTA _ Jim Thomas has been Evander
Holyfield's manager for most of his career, and he's become more
than an adviser to the fighter _ he's also become a close friend.
They agree on most issues, but there's one where they are miles
apart _ the length of Holyfield's career. Thomas would like
Holyfield to retire within the next year, while the 37-year-old
Holyfield wants to keep fighting as long as he feels fit.
Retirement is inevitable for Holyfield, but how long will he
continue to fight before officially calling it quits? (Bunn,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   BOX-LENNOX _ ATLANTA _ How has the life of Lennox Lewis changed
since his heavyweight fight with Evander Holyfield last March? In
some ways, it hasn't changed at all _ he hasn't earned much respect
in the United States while he's still viewed as champion in Great
Britian, his home country. In other ways, his life has changed
tremendously _ he's become the sentimental favorite in the boxing
community after the controversial draw nearly eight months ago. A
profile of Lewis heading into Saturday's heavyweight rematch
against Holyfield. (Bunn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

DOES THE BIBLE TEACH MEAT-EATING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    My 2-year-old daughter is a vegetarian. Except for the rare
Chicken McNugget, she responds to meat saying, ``No, mommy. No
meat.''
 &HT;    I admire her determination. For years, I've been a wannabe
vegetarian. At times the thought of eating a murdered animal makes
me ill. Lacking discipline, however, I have never been able to
sustain vegetarianism.
 &HT;    Instead, I have opted to buy humanely farmed animal products
whenever possible. At the very least, animals should be happy
before they die.
 &HT;    Over the last decade, many of my friends have become
vegetarians. Their choice reflects ethical or religious
commitments.
 &HT;    The ethical rationales for vegetarianism fall into two
categories:
 &HT;    --moral opposition to killing
 &HT;    --a concern for environmental issues.
 &HT;    Often, moral vegetarians also oppose war and the death penalty
as part of a holistic life ethic. Environmental vegetarians argue
that intensive farming methods -- including the use of pesticides
and antibiotics -- ruin the planet.
 &HT;    The religious dimensions of vegetarianism are not quite as
obvious. Although some eastern religions prescribe vegetarianism,
the western religious traditions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam)
of most Americans do not.
 &HT;    Indeed, raise the question of vegetarianism with a Baptist
neighbor and he will probably quote Genesis in response: ``And God
said, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it;
and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of
the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.''
 &HT;    The Bible, it appears, teaches meat-eating. Vegetarianism seems
oddly sacrilegious.
 &HT;    Bible readers -- particularly Christians -- often use the
Genesis ``dominion'' passage to justify human abuse of the earth.
In 1967, ULCA history professor Lynn White charged in a widely
influential article that ``Christianity made it possible to exploit
nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of natural
objects.'' Christian concern for animals? Biblical concern for
animals? Impossible.
 &HT;    Last month, PBS aired ``Reason for Hope,'' the spiritual
autobiography of naturalist Jane Goodall (based on her recent book
of the same name). Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about
Goodall's life story is how her Christianity led her to have
compassion for nonhuman animals.
 &HT;    The minister of Goodall's childhood Congregational church played
a major role in her life. ``The Christian religion came alive as I
listened to his sermons -- I felt very close to Jesus, and I prayed
to Him a good deal.'' She read and memorized the Bible. Even after
exploring other religions she insists, ``My deep love of Jesus
remained -- I felt that I had a personal relationship with Jesus.''
 &HT;    Goodall's ``personal relationship'' did not make her into a
biblical fundamentalist. Instead, it filled her with wonder about
creation and fuelled her interest in science -- especially
evolution and the relationship between humans and chimpanzees.
 &HT;    Science enhanced her religious experience. She articulates an
``animal rights'' position -- including being a vegetarian --
consonant with Christian theology. ``Reason for Hope'' presents the
astonishing sweep of her spirituality -- biblically informed,
inclusive Christianity based on love for all living things.
 &HT;    Goodall is neither the first or only Christian to conclude that
a faithful reading of the Bible leads to compassion for nonhuman
animals. In 1923, the German theologian and medical doctor, Albert
Schweitzer, argued for a similar ethic of ``reverence for life.''
He proposed that ``It is good to maintain and cherish life; it is
evil to destroy and to check life.''
 &HT;    This ethic came from two sources: Schweitzer's own Christian
faith and his commitment to science, especially evolutionary
theory. Both faith and science taught the fundamental unity of
creation. To destroy any life was to undermine the eternal -- and
ongoing -- work of God.
 &HT;    Schweitzer believed that animals suffer. Although he thought it
necessary (as does Goodall) to do limited animal research for
medical purposes, he chastised callous medical researchers: ``Those
who test operations or drugs on animal -- sought never to rest
satisfied with the general idea that their dreadful doings are
performed in the pursuit of a worthy aim.'' Instead, he called on
researchers to be compassionate: ``No one ought to permit, in so
far as he can prevent it, pain or suffering for which he will not
take responsibility.''
 &HT;    Compassionate toward nonhuman animals is part of a biblical
worldview. As the author of Proverbs wrote, ``A righteous man
regardeth the life of his beast.'' And as Jesus stated, ``Blessed
are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.''
 &HT;    For far too long the biblical call to ``reverence for life'' has
been obscured by a literalistic, unscientific fundamentalism. It is
time for people of biblical faiths to pay attention to their Gods
call to love all of creation.

A POLITICAL MUDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reading the political tea leaves this year is a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   What do voters want?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in the polls and in early election returns, is a
muddle.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore retain huge
leads over their party rivals, and Bush regularly trounces Gore in
the trial heats. But at this early stage, that doesn't necessarily
mean much. The political wheel will not stop turning the next 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are pursued by formidable alternative candidates for
the nomination, and neither frontrunner is as well-known as the
pundits seem to think.
</P>
<P>
   Local elections last week produced mixed results, sending no
clear signal about the national mood. Conservative, moderate or
liberal? Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans swept Virginia, winning a majority in the state
legislature for the first time in more than a century and
threatening Democratic Sen. Charles Robb's re-election. It was
truly a historic triumph.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats won the mayor's office in conservative
Indianapolis for the first time in 36 years, the mayor's office in
conservative Columbus, Ohio, for the first time in 20 years and
retained the mayor's office in liberal Philadelphia largely with
campaign help from that political pariah President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   So go figure.
</P>
<P>
   In-depth issues surveys by CNN/USA Today, the Washington Post
and other organizations add more confusion than clarification.
</P>
<P>
   They show, for instance, that Clinton's job-performance ratings
are still respectably high, the Republican-controlled Congress is
disliked and issues that favor the Democrats are popular. But
voters also tell the pollsters they like Bush best, even though
they don't really know very much yet about him or Gore or former
Sen. Bill Bradley or Sen. John McCain. They are looking for a
change, but not very eagerly.
</P>
<P>
   The public anger that fueled the GOP congressional upset of five
years ago, we are told, has evaporated. The country is prosperous
and at peace. Voters are more interested in personalities than in
policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters conclude that voters want Clinton without the
baggage. They want authenticity, a code word for no more
clandestine sexual hanky-panky or hypocritical morality stands of
the do-what-I-say but overlook-how-I-myself-behave variety.
</P>
<P>
   They want the ``vision thing'' that eluded President Bush and so
far is escaping his son. Gore could make some headway here with his
own steady vision of the future, but so far his thinking is a bit
murky for most voters. Besides, policy wonkdom reminds them of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They want a strong leader _ a guy with backbone and integrity.
But where is he to lead, and how? And must he wear earth-tone
clothes and cowboy boots, love foreign policy details and control
his temper?
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters tell the pollsters that their idea of a
strong leader does not necessarily include a military background or
devoted church attendance, which used to be important in character
evaluation. Only 37 percent said in this week's CNN-USA Today poll
that attending religious services regularly was important, and only
23 percent said serving in the military was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good moral character,'' however, was important to 80 percent,
not quite as high as ``vision,'' mentioned by 92 percent, but a
powerful indication of Gore's problem with the Clinton undertow
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy provides such a stable base that a Pew
Research Center survey found recently it is no longer the major
issue motivating voters this year. Many people have the luxury of
worrying about other things.
</P>
<P>
   The basic campaign issues are familiar and on a grand scale _
better education, better and more affordable health care,
protection of Social Security, less violence, drugs and crime. But
they are not central to the voters' decision-making process as it
seems to be evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, some way, voters aim to resolve this election
instinctively. They want a president they can like and admire. They
like Clinton but cannot look up to a man of his sexual habits. They
liked Ronald Reagan, although not all of his policies. They didn't
much like bland daddy Bush or the wimpy Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The policies come later. Forget those details. In a campaign, it
is the accumulated impressions of personalities that count. And
next year sunny smiles and quick quips may count more than usual.
Oh, dear. This has the makings of a mess.

 &HT;    'E-GOVERNMENT' IS COMING OF AGE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Can Internet users look forward to having easy
access to government services, much as they might buy a book on
line?
</P>
<P>
   More and more, the answer seems to be yes. Just like e-commerce,
the virtual portals of e-government are open 24 hours a day, 365
days a year at all levels _ federal, state and local.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, Americans still cannot vote or enlist in the
military via their computer desktops. But ever larger numbers are
able, with a click of a mouse, to pay their taxes or parking fines,
buy stamps or download a wealth of searchable official data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put government at the fingertips of every U.S.
citizen,'' Brian Munday said at the launch Tuesday of a Web site
called ezgov.com, which bills itself as the first to offer direct
online links to comprehensive government information while also
letting citizens do government business on line.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, government agencies that want a cyberspace
presence without dunning taxpayers for the cost are increasingly
taking advantage of the private firms' capital and Web-savvy labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ezgov.com is not alone in seeking to build a virtual business on
user-paid processing fees, usually $2 to $3 per transaction. The
Atlanta-based company offers political units interfaces that
support such everyday services as drivers' license and auto tag
renewals. Georgia residents can buy hunting, fishing and boating
licenses on line, and residents of DeKalb County, Ga., can pay
their property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   An ezgov.com rival, the National Information Consortium, also
plugs governments into the Internet by designing, building, and
operating Web-based portals. It's motto: ``Get on line, not in
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, ezgov.com has drafted its mission statement
by borrowing freely from the 1776 Declaration of Independence:
</P>
<P>
   ``When in the course of technological progress, it becomes
necessary to break the shackles of tape and long lines associated
with traditional government services, a true solution can only be
born from innovative and experienced minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia is a hot spot right now for a number of high-tech
companies,'' noted former Gov. Zell Miller, who has joined the
ezgov.com board. ``This is one of them. I'm very impressed with
their vision and also the practicality of what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Miller, the corporate board includes such
well-known figures as former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, Jack
Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice-presidential nominee, and former
Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., who heads the United Negro College Fund.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The e-government concept shows every prospect of taking off
because elected and appointed officials from President Clinton on
down are being won over by the latest Internet technologies such as
forgery-proof digital signatures and systems that let large
financial transfers be conducted securely.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Sources Inc., a market research firm based in northern
Virginia, estimates that the federal e-gov market will double from
its current size to nearly $3 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Payton Smith, an analyst at Federal Sources, noted that the
state and local government market is potentially even larger
because they have more inherent opportunities to provide direct
services to Web-enabled citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In adapting e-commerce techniques to their needs, governments
stand to benefit from lower operating expenses and more efficient
communication.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``netizens'' can, at any hour they choose, access
government services or huge amounts of official data.
</P>
<P>
   To cite just one important example, the Internal Revenue Service
now offers the ability to prepare and file federal taxes online,
downloadable federal and state tax forms, and access to a federal
income tax estimator for filers who want to know about how much
money they'll owe before the April 15, 2000 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   While most federal departments have robust Internet sites, few
states, counties and cities have jumped onto the e-gov bandwagon
until quite recently.
</P>
<P>
   Industry players have blamed the relatively slow growth of
e-gov, in comparison to the e-commerce boom, on union-led
constraints and on a phobia against the technology on the part
officialdom, grounded in their security and privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The initial converts often have been state motor vehicle
departments. SDR Technologies, a California-based firm, has
designed and implemented an online car and boat registration system
for the state of Michigan that has renewed 75,000 licenses since
October 1998. Fees are paid by credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Gurk, Internet administrator for the Michigan Department
of Motor Vehicles, noted that some drivers renew in the middle of
the night or on weekends when they have lots of spare time. That,
in turn, eliminates the need to hire more counter clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Cost savings are the primary selling pitch for e-gov vendors.
Todd Ramsey, general manager of global government industries for
IBM, says the online drivers' license renewal system his company
maintains for the state of Arizona costs $1 per transaction,
against traditional over-the-counter costs of $7.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet ties it all together, enabling, for example,
Arizona residents to easily reach the IBM-built licensing site via
ezgov.com.

`THE CODE BOOK': CRACK A COMMUNIQUE, SHATTER AN ASSUMPTION 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   V D G V V D D V D D G X D D F D A A D D F D X G. That is a line
of code and if you can break it, which is possible but unlikely,
you probably don't need to read ``The Code Book,'' Simon Singh's
entertaining and edifying survey of the science of secret writing.
</P>
<P>
   The code used in the message above (which, just in case you
couldn't break it, means ``attack at 10 p.m.'') is known as the
ADFGVX Cipher and is one of many codes and ciphers that Singh
elucidates, almost always in language that an innumerate like
myself can understand. Singh is good at explaining concepts rooted
in mathematics. His previous book, ``Fermat's Enigma,'' was a
lively account of the effort to prove what was perhaps the most
famous unsolved problem in number theory. This new book on codes
and code breaking is similarly engaging.
</P>
<P>
   A former producer for the BBC who has a Ph.D. in physics from
Cambridge University, Singh knows his subject, and he is a skillful
popularizer of it. It would be harder to imagine a clearer or more
fascinating presentation of cryptology and decryptology than
nonspecialists will get in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Code making and code breaking, as Singh makes clear, have always
been with us, even if their importance has not been recognized. He
begins this book with the 16th-century trial of Mary, Queen of
Scots, who was partly done in by a cryptanalyst named Thomas
Phelippes who deciphered coded messages between Mary and her
supporters in a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I.
</P>
<P>
   Moving ahead a few centuries, Singh provides a knowing history
of the effort by the Poles and the British to break the German
Enigma code, which was considered impenetrable. He ends with a
prediction that the long war between code makers and code breakers,
which has generally been won by the code breakers, is likely to
end. The latest technique of ensuring the secrecy of
communications, quantum cryptography, Singh writes, ``is not just
effectively unbreakable, it is absolutely unbreakable.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Singh recounts the making and breaking of codes
that were once considered ironclad. He gives a history of the
scholarly cracking of hieroglyphics and Linear B, the mysterious
writing on 3,500-year-old clay tablets excavated in Crete and
belonging to the Minoan civilization.
</P>
<P>
   He writes about the efforts to encrypt electronic
communications, including the creation of ``the greatest
cryptographic achievement since the invention of the monoalphabetic
cipher, over 2,000 years ago.'' This was the diabolically clever
invention of RSA (named for its inventors, Ronald Rivest, Adi
Shamir and Leonard Adleman), which is what enables you to give your
credit card number to an online merchant without disclosing that
information to a third party who may be monitoring your computer
communication.
</P>
<P>
   All along Singh explains the technical matters involved, using
graphs and diagrams and analogies to great effect. By the end
normally attentive readers might not be able to decipher the line
of code above, but they should be able to understand the principles
that have governed cryptography through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   This begins with relatively easy substitution ciphers and
progresses to more difficult matters, like the Vigenere cipher,
named after its 16th-century inventor, Blaise de Vigenere, which
was believed to be unbreakable until the 19th-century British
genius Charles Babbage figured it out.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the dramatic high point of Singh's history is his
account of the cracking of the German Enigma code, made possible by
the stunningly original, counterintuitive work of a shy Polish
mathematician named Marian Rejewski and the English mathematician
Alan Turing, who is often considered the father of the modern
computer. The underlying theme of the work of people like Rejewski,
Turing, Rivest, Shamir, Adleman and others whom Singh introduces is
the triumph of human ingenuity against great odds.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement of ``The Code Book'' is not just in how it makes
difficult concepts comprehensible. It is even more in its
explication of seemingly impossible feats of the mind. When, for
example, Rejewski began his solitary attempt to break the German
code, most experts believed it impregnable. It was, after all,
created by a machine that changed the key to its code every day,
and there were 10,000,000,000,000,000 possible day keys. The code
that Turing cracked, by refining the technique invented by
Rejewski, had been made vastly more complicated by the Germans as
World War II approached.
</P>
<P>
   Singh does not ignore the fantastic paradox, which has been
explored in plays and other books, involved in Turing's life. If
Turing didn't actually win World War II, he certainly shortened it
considerably. But for national security reasons his work had to
remain secret for years afterward, so he received no public
recognition. In 1952 he was arrested for ``gross indecency,''
deprived of his security clearance and forced to undergo hormone
treatments that made him impotent and obese. He committed suicide
in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   With stories like that, Singh gives cryptography not only its
historical dimension but its human one. In 1900 the famed British
archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans excavated the Cretan tablets on
which the inscriptions given the name Linear B were found. Evans
staked his reputation on the assertion that the language of the
inscriptions, which he could not understand, was native to the
Minoans and was unrelated to ancient Greek. When another
archaeologist hypothesized that the tablets were a form of Greek,
Evans barred him from the excavations. Evans died in 1941 convinced
that he was right. It was only in the 1950s, after several
generations of code breakers had miraculously cracked the Minoan
code, that the arrogant Sir Arthur was proved entirely wrong.

DIVIDED JUSTICES WEIGH MANDATORY STUDENT FEES 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, delving into the issue of free
speech, considered Tuesday whether state universities can require
students to pay dues toward campus groups they oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Several conservative University of Wisconsin law students
challenged the school's mandatory $331.50 activity fee, which helps
support all campus organizations. The students said that requiring
them to help underwrite organizations they find repulsive, such as
abortion and gay-rights groups, violated their constitutional First
Amendment right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   During an hourlong argument at the high court, the justices
appeared to be divided.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices indicated strong support for the students'
unwillingness, on free-speech grounds, to pay the fee. But others
said universities should be idyllic settings for the unhindered
flow of ideas and that schools should be able to collect money from
students to support that mission.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All Texas state universities have mandatory student activity
fees, similar to Wisconsin's, that go toward funding campus
organizations without regard to the opinions they espouse. Many
campus voices would be silenced if students were free to select the
groups to which their money goes, university leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Assistant Attorney General Susan Ullman, defending the
mandatory student fee, said the surcharge does not violate the
Constitution because the university distributes the money to all
student groups, regardless of their views. The university's effort
not to discriminate on the basis of a group's views also ensures
that minority opinions are heard, she argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Ullman ran afoul of Justice David H. Souter when she tried
to defend the university's policy of not funding groups that engage
in partisan political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Souter, calling the freedom to speak on political issues the
``core'' of the First Amendment, said the university might be in
violation of the Constitution because of its refusal to put student
money toward party politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman responded that the university distributes student money
in a constitutionally valid, ``viewpoint neutral'' manner by
withholding funds from all political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Souter also questioned whether the university even needs to
collect student fees, noting that many groups have alternative
methods of getting money, such as membership dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of organizations invite us (justices) to speak and they
come up with their own honorariums,'' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Ullman said the student money enables the panoply
of groups, not just those with large membership rolls, to have
speakers come to campus.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman, however, incurred the wrath of some justices in
defending the university's practice of allowing students to vote on
whether to fund ``service'' groups, which aim to protect the health
or safety of students or provide them with academic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the university's
definition of service group is so broad it could include
organizations that espouse liberal views, which conservative
students might find offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer added that allowing a majority vote of
students to determine if a group remains on campus contradicts the
argument that the university welcomes minority opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment is (there) to protect views that are
unpopular,'' Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   One controversial group that survived a student referendum was
the Wisconsin Public Interest Research Group, which provides the
``service'' of student internships but also supports liberal
environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said the group is interested in spreading its views.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jordan Lorence, representing the students challenging
the fee, assailed the surcharge as the ``compelled funding of
political and ideological speech'' in violation of the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students have a First Amendment right not to speak (and)
not to espouse a position,'' argued Lorence of Fairfax, Va. The
university has ``a constitutional duty to respect the conscience of
the students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said universities have
historically been places that encourage a diversity of views as an
essential part of their educational mission.
</P>
<P>
   Souter, who had earlier questioned the wisdom of the fees,
nevertheless told Lorence that ``a gaggle of voices is a very good
thing'' to have on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Lorence said universities are free to welcome
diverse opinions to campus. However, the schools may not require
students who disagree to pay for those views, he added in an
argument Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just wondering if universities are going to crumble if
they can't do this sort of thing,'' Scalia said, referring to the
collection of student fees.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts that have heard the case so far have sided with
the students. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago,
agreeing with the decision of the U.S. District Court for Western
Wisconsin, ruled last year that the surcharge violates the
students' First Amendment right to refrain from financing groups
that espouse views they find repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to render its decision in the
case, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin vs.
Southworth, by July.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shish kebab from a street vendor in Istanbul had a
powerful effect on Laurent Gras, the French chef at Peacock Alley
in the Waldorf-Astoria. The cubes of lamb had been marinated
overnight in pomegranate juice, skewered and grilled over aromatic
charcoal. It was street food, but refined. The vendor was obviously
concerned with every detail.
</P>
<P>
   The chef was so impressed that he put his own version of the
succulent dish on his menu this fall. Two medallions of lamb are
pickled in tartly sweet pomegranate juice with lemon peel and basil
and then served handsomely charred.
</P>
<P>
   Gras is not the only high-end chef to visit Turkey, taste the
balance of flavors _ sweet, tart, salty, hot _ and come home with
new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite political and environmental problems, Turkey is becoming
an important destination for culinary explorers in search of
novelty. It is exerting an influence on menus in the United States,
where Mediterranean cooking has long been the cuisine du jour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food is tasty, it's easy because everything is grilled,
and it's fun,'' said Jean-Louis Palladin, who visited Turkey this
year. He is making a version of another street specialty, lahmajun,
flatbread baked with spicy minced lamb, at Napa, his restaurant in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Wieler, the new chef at Layla, plans an eating tour of
Turkey early next year. Bobby Flay, the chef and an owner of Mesa
Grill, stopped near the ancient city of Ephesu on a cruise and is
eager to return to sample more of what the Turks do with fish and
flatbreads.
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs who have been to Turkey, like Matthew Kenney of
Matthew's and Stephen Kalt of Spartina and Spazzia, are also
adopting elements of the Turkish culinary mosaic, ranging from
snacks on cacophonous streets to elaborate Ottoman creations in
hotel dining rooms. Already, appetizers labeled meze _ Turkish
tapas, in essence _ are served with Cosmopolitans in American
restaurants, bars and lounges.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs are experimenting with sweet-sour sumac, the ruddy ground
spice that looks as if it should be peppery but tastes shockingly
of lemon. They are using mouth-puckering pomegranate juice in
marinades or sauces. They are working with pekmez, a concentrated
pomegranate or grape molasses that can be diluted to make a drink
or used in sauces or desserts. Kenney glazes venison with it for
grilling. They are exploring kirmizi bibir, the richly oiled chili
powder that gives Turkish cooking its singular kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who know Turkish food are incredibly particular,''
Kenney said. ``The food is really very simple, but all the
ingredients have to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the street vendors take exacting care, elevating simple
foods like fried mussels with tarator, a piquant lemon-garlic puree
thickened with ground walnuts. The results taste exotic but oddly
familiar, as I discovered this fall on my own expedition to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dishes Americans associate with other cuisines have
roots in Turkish kitchens, a result of more than six centuries of
Ottoman rule from Egypt to Central Asia: grape-leaf dolma from
Greece, hummus with pita bread from the Arab world, manti dumplings
in yogurt and garlic sauce from Uzbekistan, bagel-like simit rolls
dusted with sesame seeds from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkish food has had a great impact, but people don't realize
it's Turkish,'' said Paula Wolfert, the author of ``The Cooking of
the Eastern Mediterranean'' (HarperCollins, 1994). ``People think
of a lot of the food as Greek or Middle Eastern and don't connect
it with Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   The buzz about Turkey may have begun in 1993, when a group of
food editors and writers visited Turkey on an international
symposium organized by Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust, a
nonprofit culinary group. They were excited about the food. ``When
people go to Turkey, they are blown away,'' said Joyce Goldstein, a
restaurant consultant who was on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Most Turkish meals begin with meze: garlicky white bean salad,
roasted peppers, stuffed mussels, marinated grilled octopus with
lemon, smoky eggplant puree or vegetables drenched in yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   All of those could be at home on an American menu, but in Turkey
the flavors are more forthright, not just because of the liberal
hand with garlic and chili.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spices are different and more intense, so the flavors
burst in your mouth,'' said Mina Newman, who has visited Turkey and
has left Layla to be the chef at Avra, a restaurant opening soon in
Manhattan. ``They use more spices in Turkey than in Greece, and
even though this will be a Greek restaurant, that's where my
cooking is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Turkish food say it is also changing, moving from
the subtle and voluptuous intricacy of the Ottoman kitchen, which
put the bechamel on the moussaka and rose water in the dessert
syrup. It's embracing more robust flavors, like the forcefully
seasoned lahmajun of the Anatolian hinterland and the spicy
minced-meat Adana kebab of the eastern Mediterranean coast. These
are the dishes that have captured the palates of Americans,
especially the chefs, who have traveled to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Though Anatolia, as the part of the country in Asia Minor is
called, represents 97 percent of Turkey's land mass, its food until
recently was underappreciated, especially in Istanbul, which is
mostly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Turks have a false idea of themselves,'' said Ferda
Erdinc, who has lived in the United States and owns Zencifil, a
cafe in Istanbul that puts a modern spin on traditional Turkish
food. ``They see themselves through the eyes of foreigners and
think that the only impressive food is Ottoman-style. They think
onions and garlic are for peasants.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are small restaurants in the center of the city where
Anatolian peasant women sit in windows, rolling dough for
flatbreads, like gozleme and lahmajun, and for manti dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was poor people's food, but it's now acceptable as
high-class,'' F. Muhtar Katircioglu, a passionate gastronome from
Istanbul, said over lunch at Develi, which specializes in
flatbreads and kebabs.
</P>
<P>
   The vibrancy of Turkish cuisine begins in the markets, which are
nothing short of dazzling, piled high with ripe tomatoes, fresh
herbs, glossy eggplants and lush figs. The melons are uncommonly
sweet. They have to be: they're served as a rich, juicy foil for
peynir, salty white fetalike cheese, at the beginning of many
meals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the gleaming fish in the impeccable seafood markets are
also seasonal varieties, caught in native waters. In Istanbul, the
arrival of lufer, a bluefish, and palamut, or bonito, are
harbingers of fall. Typically, fresh fish is brought to the table
for the diner to select for grilling.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Turkey was one of a few countries that produced
all its own food. Today, agricultural products _ meat, wheat,
sugar, sunflowers and rice _ account for 11 percent of its imports.
The Turks are pushing the envelope with greenhouses, especially for
tomatoes and eggplant, along its coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still go by the seasons and by certain locales,'' Ms.
Erdinc said. ``Things taste best where they're grown.''

WHY HE'S NOT RUNNING
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm often asked how it feels to be the only man in America who
is not exploring the possibility of running for president.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the short answer would be: Liberating.
</P>
<P>
   But scary, too. Scary and liberating. Like when the doctor calls
you into his office and tells you the test results were negative.
</P>
<P>
   The disease analogy is a good one. It's like being the only man
in America who hasn't got the measles or the plague or some other
awful thing for which there's no known cure.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I the only man in America who is not exploring the
possibility of running for president? I wish I knew. It's certainly
not the result of a healthy lifestyle. My diet-and-exercise plan
consists of waddling to the refrigerator for more butter. Sometimes
I'm stiff and sore the next day from watching too much golf on TV.
</P>
<P>
   It's not because I'm afraid of looking like a fool. Heck, if I
was afraid of that, I'd never leave the house. Wait. Come to think
of it, I don't leave the house much anymore. Still, I don't think
that's the reason.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not like I think exploring the possibility of running
for president is beneath my dignity. Heck, these guys look like
they're having a blast. Donald Trump giving interviews from the
back seat of his limo. Jesse Ventura hanging out with the Playboy
bunnies. Plus, you get to visit Iowa, which I hear is very cool.
</P>
<P>
   The money thing was a factor, of course. George W. has collected
something like $56 million already, whereas my ``war chest'' would
consist of whatever spare change I could fish out from underneath
the sofa cushions. This would make it hard for me to get my
``message'' out, assuming I had a message to get out, which last
time I looked, I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, in modern American politics, having a message is not
nearly as important as having the means to get the message out. For
example, the only message we've gotten from George W. is that he
doesn't like being asked about reports of past drug use, which
seems like the kind of message one could finance with spare change
fished out from underneath the sofa cushions, let alone $56
million. This is just one example of why Americans are so confused
on the subject of campaign-finance reform.)
</P>
<P>
   People who want to explore the possibility of running for
president always form a committee first. This is another thing that
has held me back from jumping (lurching?) into the ring. I have
never formed a committee in my life and wouldn't have the faintest
idea how to go about it. Do you just make random calls to strangers
at supper time, like the telemarketers do? Do you put an ad in the
paper? Wanted: People to comprise an exploratory committee for the
purpose of exploring the possibility of a certain individual maybe
or maybe not running for president of the United States depending
on how many quarters he can fish from under his sofa cushions. Must
be able to get the message out. Message suggestions appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Would the committee know what to do or would it look to me for
leadership? I can't think of anything to tell the committee, other
than to make it clear to the press that I'm not interested in
answering any questions about my past drug use.
</P>
<P>
   (But, then again, you know the press. You tell it something like
that and the only questions you'll be asked between now and the
election will be about your past drug use. You'd probably be better
off telling the press that you enjoy answering questions about your
past drug use. Maybe smoke a little crack right up there on the
podium, just to show them you're sincere. Of course, then you run
the risk of getting thrown in jail, which could mess up your plans
to visit Iowa, which I hear is very cool. So maybe that's not such
a great idea after all.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's sort of lonely (as well as liberating and scary) being
the only man in America who is not exploring the possibility of
running for president, but I think I've made the right decision.

ABC SCORES WITH `ANNIE' AND `MILLIONAIRE'; MORNING TALK-SHOW
BATTLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   `Annie' Makes November Sing for ABC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's spectacular ratings performance by ABC's new version of
the musical ``Annie'' has opened the door for an annual November
musical event on the network. And if ABC manages to fulfill its
pie-in-the-sky wish, next November's production will be a new
version of the musical ``Mame'' starring Barbra Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   All the stars, literally and figuratively, seem to be coming
into alignment for ABC, the Sunday night ``Wonderful World of
Disney'' franchise and producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who
have now scored twice in three years with enormous musical hits on
a Sunday night in November. In 1997 their new version of
``Cinderella'' was the event of the fall television season for ABC,
and Sunday's edition of ``Annie'' approached the same level of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has noticed. ``What's happened is that Disney and ABC have
said to us: `You have the first Sunday in November every year,'''
Zadan said. ``That's our slot. It's our goal to get a new musical
ready every summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers have already acquired the rights to, among others,
``Mame'' and ``The Music Man,'' either one of which could be
mounted for next season. Ms. Streisand is already attached to the
``Mame'' project as another executive producer. Nobody from the
network is saying out loud yet what is obviously the dream casting
for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbra is a producer at this point,'' Meron said. ``We haven't
done casting yet. That will depend on the script.''
</P>
<P>
   But they have taken the unusual step of hiring the prominent
film writing team Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (``Parenthood,''
``City Slickers'') to write the ``Mame'' script, which Zadan called
great.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even without a star of the magnitude of Ms. Streisand,
Zadan and Meron have proved that television audiences will flock to
the right musical. Meron pointed out that ``Cinderella'' was filled
with recognizable stars like Whitney Houston, Whoopi Goldberg,
Jason Alexander and Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie'' relied on just one big-name star, Kathy Bates, and
filled the other roles with performers big on Broadway, not
television. Those included Alan Cumming of ``Cabaret,'' Kristin
Chenoweth, fresh from her Tony Award for ``You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown,'' Audra MacDonald, now starring in ``Marie
Christine,'' and longtime Broadway musical star Victor Garber.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bates was the key, Zadan said, and she was cast after Garber
enthusiastically endorsed her singing voice, an unknown commodity
to the producers.
</P>
<P>
   They said they had had some concerns about attracting viewers
because of possible association with the disappointing 1982 film
version of ``Annie.'' But they went to considerable lengths to
distinguish this production, giving it a more theatrical feel, with
lavish sets and dance numbers. The producers gave credit to the
director Rob Marshall. He had never directed anything on camera
before, having made his name on Broadway as a choreographer and
director.
</P>
<P>
   But as Meron put it, ``The combination of Disney and `Annie' was
perfect.'' About 40 million viewers tuned into ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-Budget Wealth
</P>
<P>
   Sunday proved to be one of the biggest overall nights for ABC in
years when the network followed ``Annie'' with the return of its
game show phenomenon ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' which
managed to top even its best ratings from the summer. Then the show
popped up again on Monday night and pulled ABC to its highest
rating on that night in several years.
</P>
<P>
   ABC Entertainment chairman Stu Bloomberg said Tuesday that the
network had consciously paired the return of ``Millionaire'' with
``Annie'' as ``the richest night of television'' in a promotion
campaign that obviously paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has also thus revived two venerable entertainment formats,
the musical and the game show, which in turn are helping revive the
network after a struggle in the ratings this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The decidedly low-budget ``Millionaire'' was so potent an
audience draw Sunday that it buried two highly promoted _ and
highly expensive _ mini-series, ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' on CBS
and ``Leprechauns'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The question for ABC will be what to do if the ``Millionaire''
franchise continues to build in its second tournament-style
exposure this month. ABC is already contending with a copycat game
show, ``Greed'' on Fox, a show that borrows elements of
``Millionaire'' with no holds barred .
</P>
<P>
   In its first outing, ``Greed'' pulled in ratings only about a
third as high as those of ``Millionaire.'' Still, that was good
enough to improve Fox's showing on Thursday night by as much as 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fox announced Tuesday that it would squeeze in two more editions
of ``Greed'' in the coming weeks, on Nov. 24 and Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Morning Battle
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for morning supremacy, the first week of
confrontation produced mainly more of the same. Despite the
addition of Bryant Gumbel's new ``Early Show'' on CBS, that network
did not add as many additional viewers in its first week as ABC's
``Good Morning, America,'' or ``NBC's ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' in fact increased its morning dominance with a 5.5
rating for the week, up from 5 the previous week. (Each rating
point represents just over one million homes.) ABC gained a little
less, reaching a 3.8 rating from 3.5 the previous week. CBS,
meanwhile, did show some growth, reaching a 2.7 rating from 2.5 the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives had expected CBS to do much better in
its first highly publicized week. But Steve Friedman, the senior
executive producer of ``The Early Show,'' cited some unusual
factors last week, including the Egypt Air crash, which helped all
three shows add viewers. But that coverage may have hurt CBS
somewhat, he added, because when major news breaks, viewers are
less likely to sample a competing morning program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' may also have staved off sampling of competitors by
loading up on prominent guests all week. Friedman conceded, ``The
booking is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise he expressed satisfaction, if not elation, over
getting the show up and running without many bumps. ``The goal is
to get on the field and survive,'' he said. ``Everybody here knows
how tough this game is going to be.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Very warm weather will last one more day across the Northeast on
Wednesday as breezes from the southwest usher in unseasonably mild
air ahead of a cold front. In the warm, rather moist air, there
could even be some isolated afternoon thunderstorms in the
mountains of northern Pennsylvania and southern New York. Farther
north, behind the front, northern New England and the Adirondacks
of New York will be rather cloudy and much cooler, with showers
developing.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Middle Atlantic coast, temperatures will be
summer-like, as readings will approach 80 degrees in many
locations. Ample sunshine will combine with strong winds from the
west that descend the Appalachians and warm, thus providing this
unusual heat. Farther south, sunshine and very warm readings will
persist across much of the Atlantic coast, however, some cumulus
clouds will develop in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the Great Lakes, a weak low pressure wave will promote clouds
and showers. Meanwhile, a strengthening ridge of high pressure from
the western Plains into the Rockies will bring sunshine and
continued warm readings. Farther south, a mixture of clouds and
sunshine will develop along most of the Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific Northwest, a disorganized area of low pressure
will approach the coast, bringing periods of rain and cloudy skies
to the region. Temperatures will remain near to slightly above
seasonal levels. Farther south, clouds will thicken over northern
California, while southern California will remain mostly sunny.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Sky Mysteries &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an unusual object in the sky over eastern Iowa was
identified by the National Weather Service as a hot air balloon
traveling east at an altitude of 15,000 feet. Meteorologists are
often asked to help identify mysterious phenomena in the heavens
since many turn out to have meteorological explanations. Indeed,
the term ``flying saucer'' is derived from an airline pilot's
description of a smooth, luminous object near Mount Rainier,
Washington, more than 50 years ago. It is likely that the pilot saw
a lenticular cloud, a saucer-shaped cloud that sometimes forms
downwind of mountains.

`LIFE BEYOND EARTH': ARE THEY OUT THERE? WILL WE HEAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't conclude from Timothy Ferris' skepticism about
unverifiable sightings of unidentified flying objects that he
harbors many doubts about the existence of other forms of life in
the cosmos. Quite the contrary. ``Life Beyond Earth,'' his new
two-hour PBS program, makes a cogent case for the existence of
extraterrestrial intelligences even as it concedes the difficulty
of identifying them.
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of this science writer's 1985 film, ``The Creation of
the Universe,'' should again be engaged by the sweep of his
argument, which draws on everything from astrophysics to
microbiology to science fiction, and by the visual inventiveness
that his producers have brought to their evocations of planets and
galaxies, volcanoes and ice-bound wastes.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of his investigation, ``Are We Alone?,'' begins
with three ingredients of the sources of life: energy, water and
the organic molecules that scientists are finding throughout the
universe. ``There's plenty of energy out there,'' he reports, among
the billion trillion stars that resemble our sun.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have detected evidence of water and organic material
in the solar system and beyond, be it Mercury, Mars, the Moon or
the Orion nebula, 1,500 light years from the solar system and a
prolific creator of new planets. Ferris' often spacious imagery
becomes intimate: ``The iron in our blood and the calcium in our
bones were made inside stars.'' He envisions terrestrial life as
``embedded in a cosmic web'' and concludes, ``It seems reasonable
to speculate that life is cosmically commonplace.'' The fact that
it is not conspicuous, Ferris admonishes doubters, does not mean it
is not there.
</P>
<P>
   Recent discoveries suggest that life can thrive, he says, ``in
icy cold and hellish heat,'' that the hospitable area for living
things might be larger than investigators have believed, perhaps
extending to the satellites of distant Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris allows his hopes free rein: ``There could be more life
out there than we've ever imagined, for if the universe has taught
us anything, it is that reality is richer and more resourceful than
our wildest dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   But if so, what then? ``Is Anybody Listening?,'' the second half
of ``Life Beyond Earth,'' finds the task of communicating with
intelligent beings, if such exist out among the stars, daunting
even for the welcoming Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the stars are far away, and interstellar
space flight is slow as well as expensive. The Voyager probes that
were launched in 1977 will take 70,000 years to reach another star.
</P>
<P>
   Are other means of communication feasible? Ferris holds out the
wonder of radio telescopes, which can ``record the murmur of
interstellar gas clouds, the pulses of rapidly spinning neutron
stars and the screams of colliding galaxies.'' So listeners on
Earth might hear something significant. Or perhaps an audience
within the range of broadcasts from Earth could intercept them,
even though the news reaching distant creatures might be eons old
because the farther they are from Earth, the longer the
transmission would take.
</P>
<P>
   And suppose that somebody out there eventually hears us and
tries to answer, would we recognize the signals by which they might
respond? Ferris speeds through the findings of Galileo, Kepler,
Newton, Einstein and Hubble to conclude that, in theory, life could
exist all over the universe. But if extraterrestrials tried to
communicate, they would have to be able to manipulate symbolic
language of the sort that Earthlings use: ``If they don't have
language, they may be smart, but we're not apt to hear from them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his proposed greetings to other intelligences, Ferris, by
turns optimistic and confounded, reports, ``We've learned that we
have a lot to learn.'' No one out there may ever hear his words,
but never mind: it's really a message directed at the earthly
audience for this stimulating exploration.

   AUBURNDALE, Fla. _ Sitting on her screened porch, 56-year-old
Rosalie Bradford pours out her life _ one pound at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Her story has been fodder for the talk-show circuit _ from
Geraldo to Montel _ but it hasn't made the answers come any more
quickly. She didn't grow to more than 1,200 pounds and become the
Guinness Book of World Records' heaviest woman overnight. It took
almost as long to lose the 900 pounds that could represent a second
title: the one for the greatest weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 years later _ her heaviest-woman record still
intact _ Ms. Bradford has turned her roller-coaster ride on the
weight scales into an inspirational message.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, her large future began to take shape as early as
the first grade. She was the chubby kid from foster care, the child
who would feed the pain of abandonment and loss with food.
</P>
<P>
   When she met Bob, her husband of 26 years, he was running a
Ferris wheel, and she was 250 pounds. They married in 1973. By the
next year when she gave birth to son, Rob, Ms. Bradford was 374
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that as a stay-at-home mom she had the time and
opportunity to eat. She rationalized that if she ate a hamburger
without a roll it was OK. Sandwiches were loaded with butter. The
pizza grease would run down her rapidly growing arms.
</P>
<P>
   She consumed at least 10,000 calories a day _ five times more
than the recommended intake for an average woman.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred pounds became 450, and 450 became 500. Rob's
nursery school graduation arrived. Arrangements were made so she
could enter through a side door to avoid the stares.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-ton mark marked her retreat to the confines of their
Pennsylvania home. ``I started staying in bed,'' she says. ``It was
the only place I felt comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   She had tried surgery to help with her weight, but a 1970
intestinal bypass caused its own set of life-threatening problems
and had to be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   It was another medical setback, though, that propelled her
weight to the world record.
</P>
<P>
   A blood infection caused her leg to swell and turn blue-green.
Her temperature soared above 105 degrees. She had to be
hospitalized, and that meant the shock of entering a room where two
beds had been chained together to support her.
</P>
<P>
   Her leg basically exploded, leaving a hole big enough to hold a
coffee mug and requiring 12 surgeries to help heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home to bed and what began an eight-year nap,'' Ms.
Bradford says.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bradford quit his job to stay home and care for her. She no
longer just wanted food. She had to have it. And she had a way of
berating those around her until she got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just like an addict _ lie, cheat, steal, whatever to get
my drug of choice,'' Ms. Bradford says. ``And my drug of choice was
food.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Bob Bradford worried but still gave in to her
cravings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard,'' he says. ``I prayed a lot. I just felt
when you got married that you were married to that person `death do
you part.' I took my vows very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1988, Ms. Bradford weighed more than 1,200 pounds, and her
8-foot-wide girth couldn't fit in the hallway of a single-wide
mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   Life became a series of ordeals and indignities. Her days
included a 1 1/2-hour bathing ritual _ ``there was a lot of body to
wash'' _ and a catheter. And, of course, the constant companion of
high-fat potato chips, pretzels and cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   She became an expert on diets and weight-loss fads that always
had to start on a Monday and always failed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a friend wrote to diet guru Richard Simmons about Ms.
Bradford and her plight. Simmons responded with a package
containing his diet plan. Then he followed it up with constant
nagging. ``He was a pain in the butt,'' Ms. Bradford says.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, who was unavailable for comment, walked Ms. Bradford
through his weight-loss system almost every day for about 1 1/2
years.
</P>
<P>
   Then he told her to exercise _ something she thought was all but
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Find something on you that moves besides your mouth
and move it,' '' Ms. Bradford remembers. The battle wasn't over,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Still struggling with rebounding pounds, she invited a Christian
psychologist _ ``the skinniest guy I've ever seen in my life'' _ to
counsel her. When he left, he gave her instructions to fluff up her
bedroom pillow and talk to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bradford decided to give control of her problems to God. She
quit thinking of goals in terms of the future and concentrated on
today. She was ready to re-enter the world.
</P>
<P>
   So after being a ``prisoner of fat'' for almost 10 years, Ms.
Bradford walked out on the porch outside her bedroom. She stayed as
the warm day turned into a cool night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the stars,'' Ms. Bradford says. ``I could see the
top of the trees and didn't have to look out a window.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Ms. Bradford moved to Auburndale. She weighs 304
pounds now and strives to be consistent with a balanced diet. She
credits God with helping her recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``God did for me what I couldn't do for myself,'' she says. ``He
made me aware of my responsibility. I'm responsible for what I
eat.''

HOW DANCES DEFIED DEATH IN CAMBODIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRETIGNY-SUR-ORGE, France _ Given the legions of scholars,
intellectuals and artists who were killed during the Khmer Rouge's
genocidal rule of Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, it is hard to argue
that classical dancers were singled out for murder. Seemingly any
association with enlightenment, independent thought or tradition
sufficed to merit a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when a call went out for all surviving dancers to appear at
a festival in Phnom Penh in 1981, the low turnout told a
particularly chilling story. ``After that, we concluded that 90
percent of the dancers had been killed, that only 10 percent had
survived,'' said Proeung Chhien, 50, a former dancer and teacher at
the Cambodian Royal Ballet. ``Some of the missing were refugees,
but for us they had also disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The two dozen survivors, though, sustained by the conviction
that classical dance was inseparable from the country's identity,
refused to allow a centuries-old tradition to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years after Vietnamese troops ousted the Khmer Rouge, a
two-month tour of France, Switzerland, Italy and Belgium by the
Cambodian Royal Ballet is testimony to how much they have achieved
under the direst of circumstances. As the troupe's 45 dancers and 9
musicians performed before a packed and appreciative house recently
at a cultural center outside Paris, the Khmer Rouge were in a sense
again defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in gilded and brocaded costumes and sarongs, many
wearing spired headdresses reminiscent of the bas-reliefs of Angkor
Wat, the dancers first presented an excerpt from ``Reamker,'' the
Cambodian version of the Indian epic ``Ramayana.'' In the second
half of the program, accompanied by musicians playing a xylophone,
drums, cymbals and a high-pitched wind instrument called the
sralay, they performed five shorter traditional dances.
</P>
<P>
   Yet invisible scars of the past remain. When a French television
crew showed clips from the Royal Ballet's tour here 30 years ago,
Proeung Chhien was deeply moved to see not only his younger self,
but also many colleagues who were among the estimated one million
people who died under the Khmer Rouge. A few dancers brought into
the reborn dance company as orphans in the early 1980s even saw the
faces of dead relatives on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The images also served as a reminder of what has yet to be
recovered. Until 1975, the classical dances had been preserved
through living memory: court dancers became teachers who passed
along their experience to new generations of dancers who in turn
became teachers. When it came to rebuilding the tradition after
1979, everything depended on the traumatized memories of the 20 or
so dancers and 5 teachers who had survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd remember something; someone else would remember something
else,'' recalled Proeung Chhien, who is dean of dance at the Royal
University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh. ``We also found some films
and recordings from abroad, and we'd remember more. But there is
still a lot missing: in some we have 50 percent, some 70 percent,
with a few we now have the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on reconstruction began slowly in the 1980s, with almost no
money available for culture. The political situation was also
chaotic, with both the Khmer Rouge and rebels loyal to the exiled
King Norodom Sihanouk trying to oust the Vietnamese-backed
government of Hun Sen. By 1990, under Proeung Chhien's direction,
the so-called Cambodian Classical Dance Company was able to tour
the United States, but media attention focused as much on four
dancers who defected.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 Paris peace accords led to promulgation two years later
of a new constitution restoring the Cambodian monarchy; the
classical dance company again became the Cambodian Royal Ballet.
There was a setback in 1994 when Phnom Penh's largest theater, the
Bassac, burned down. New unrest erupted in 1997 when Hun Sen ousted
King Sihanouk's son, Prince Ranariddh, as his co-Prime Minister.
Finally, a compromise was worked out, and a new government under
Hun Sen took office in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For Cambodian dance, the key appointment was King Sihanouk's
eldest daughter, Princess Buppha Devi, as culture minister. In her
youth, the princess was one of the Royal Ballet's top dancers,
brought into the company at age 6 by her grandmother, Queen Preah
Maha Kshatriyani Kossamak, who played a central role in reviving
Cambodian classical dance after an earlier decline. Returning from
exile with her father in 1991, the princess, now 56, immediately
resumed her teaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I returned, it was a shock to find these dancers who were
in the troupe that I was in,'' she said in an interview after
arriving in France to attend a gala evening at the Chateau de
Versailles to raise funds to build a new theater. ``I also learned
of the many who were no longer alive, so it was both joy and
sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Princess Buppha Devi, whose name means Goddess of
Flowers, has responsibilities that go far beyond dance (her
ministry is also in charge of caring for 1,600 temples, though not
the complex of Angkor Wat), but she remains close to the troupe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the dancers and musicians the other day as they
prepared for the evening performance, she immediately had them
re-rehearsing critical moments of their highly stylized routines.
</P>
<P>
   As two musicians joined the dancers with a drum and a xylophone,
the young women _ the youngest was 15 _ practiced the complex sign
language of their hand movements, which to the uninitiated resemble
flying butterflies and wriggling spiders. With the princess
occasionally interrupting them to correct a position, the
traditional link between Cambodian classical dance and the royal
court seemed stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ballet now has 460 students from age 7 to 18 who spend
every morning learning to dance and every afternoon attending
ordinary school classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a minimum of nine years to become a complete
dancer,'' the princess said. ``When we finish school, we
automatically become employees of the state. You have to work hard
to serve the country and to serve dance.''
</P>
<P>
   To survive, though, the Royal Ballet is also having to change.
Traditionally it had a set repertory, one that teachers could
assert, with a touch of poetic license, had been handed down
through the centuries. Now, it is adding folkloric dances as well
as new choreography in the classical style. In the program here,
for instance, was ``Tchum Poh,'' Princess Buppha Devi's own
choreography of a traditional dance of welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly we continue the dances of our ancestors, which are
built around myths and legends,'' Proeung Chhien explained, ``but
we can create new ones. We also renovate. One scene in `Reamker' is
a new creation. We have the meaning in our gestures so we can tell
every story.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Royal Ballet, which traditionally performed only
for the royal family and on state occasions, is now dancing for the
public twice a week in a 600-seat theater in Phnom Penh, although
Cambodia's economic crisis means it can charge only about $1 a
ticket. Foreign tours, quite frequent in Asia and now in Europe,
are therefore crucial to the company's finances and its morale.
</P>
<P>
   The current tour, put together by Didier Vuillecot, a young
French producer who fell in love with Cambodia three years ago, is
one of its most ambitious ever, with performances in 32 cities
through Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   In its travels abroad, the Royal Ballet is coming in touch with
the Cambodian diaspora: some 80,000 Cambodians live in the Paris
region alone, most of them refugees from the Khmer Rouge and the
successor Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   One young Cambodian woman in the audience here was herself a
former dancer who defected during a shorter European tour in 1997.
Now being trained as a computer programmer, she excitedly met up
with old friends and then watched them perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember all the movements,'' she whispered. ``I wish I
was onstage with them.''

 &HT;    How one Atlantan gets the most from his small garden _ and you
can, too
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 11.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Dan Cleveland says he prefers the ``layered''
look, he's not talking clothes.
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to the many means to which he'll resort to cram
as many plants as possible into his tiny Atlanta garden. When it
comes to having year-round color, this blooming plantaholic doesn't
know when to stop.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleveland also has a practical reason for filling his narrow
space with window boxes, foundation planters, raised beds and
container gardens that bulge at the seams _ drainage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept here was to stagger everything because of
the small space and the problem with water,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a technicolor cottage garden that explodes with
charm throughout every season _ one that in a short time has proved
quite the inspiration for neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's canvas is painted by a self-taught gardener. And to
think his plot was nothing more than a bare lot three years ago
when he and Jeffrey Rogerson bought the 75-year-old house in
Berkeley Park, a steel mill community off Howell Mill Road in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in the yard _ nothing,'' Cleveland recalls,
grinning with mischievous pride.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the challenge was fitting the hundreds of perennials
and shrubs he'd grown while renting a house on 100 acres in
Alpharetta, Ga., into the 50-by-145-foot yard in town. Many had
sentimental value because Cleveland, 40, had grown them from seed
or cuttings from his grandparents while growing up in the North
Georgia town of Lyerly.
</P>
<P>
   It was there on his family's farm that he first fell in love
with plants. ``We grew everything we ate, but my parents always had
flowers as well. My grandmother always said, `Flowers make you
smile,' and it's true,'' he says. ``The older I got, the more I
grew.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until after earning a degree in business and
moving to Seattle that his interest grew. ``The plants in that
climate are so unbelievable,'' he recalls. ``But it was also
frustrating because I didn't know a lot of plant names.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, he moved to Atlanta to manage a store,
first for Gap and then Eddie Bauer, and after helping a friend
landscape a yard he became hooked. He took a part-time job with
Boxwoods Gardens &AMP; Gifts in Atlanta, where he now works full time.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland learned to garden like most green thumbs _ by doing it
_ and credits his fashion merchandising background for his eye for
color and scale. He also read books, took courses, joined plant
societies and toured as many gardens as possible. ``I go along with
different gardeners on the tours to hear what they think and
know,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, he says, is nothing more than trial and error. In his
garden, plants come and go as quickly as visitors to Oz.
</P>
<P>
   When he and Rogerson bought the Verner Street house, the first
thing Cleveland did _ before even closing on the property _ was to
place two huge planters full of plants on the front porch. ``That's
when the neighbors knew something was up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His first step was to have the soil tested, and despite a yard
that hadn't been worked in years, ``it was wonderful,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Old broken granite covering the driveway extended all the way to
the house, so Cleveland removed it, chunk by chunk, to create space
for planters and a softer surface of pea gravel. A consummate
recycler, he moved the granite to the other side of the house to
help counter drainage problems.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he surrounded the entire foundation with raised beds of
stacked Tennessee fieldstone, something he highly recommends for
newcomers to Georgia's hard clay soil, then anchored them with
camellias, hollies, boxwood and other shrubs. The beds also serve
to divert water from the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first mistake was planting azaleas,'' Cleveland says.
``They got too big for the drive so I had to move them.''
</P>
<P>
   That freed up room for plants that would yield color _ begonias
and hostas in summer, violas and pansies in fall, daphne and
hellebores in winter, jonquils and hyacinths in spring. Among them
are several pots containing small trees and shrubs that lend scale
where it's most needed. ``Pots let you move a garden around,''
Cleveland says. ``Plus, you can take them out when something
doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Above the beds he hung window boxes and hayracks that in summer
spill with so many annuals _ herbs, geraniums, coleus, lantana,
caladiums, even tall purple fountain grass _ it's next to
impossible to tell where the house leaves off and the garden
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Forget color schemes; this is the kind of fun that comes from
finger painting _ with a result that looks like a carefully
conceived work of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew enough about the rules of design, about mixing things
like red and pink, but I meant I was going to have color in this
garden regardless,'' he says. ``This is a cottage, and it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   To set off that rainbow, he and Rogerson changed the exterior
paint from taupe to a grayish olive green.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland also painted the back yard's privacy fence that shade
and in front built another raised bed, this one from granite
salvaged from a parking lot construction project. ``I hauled it all
from the Ansley Mall curb in my little Toyota pickup,'' he says,
recalling another recycling fete.
</P>
<P>
   He then broke up the long back yard into a series of ``garden
rooms,'' each dedicated to a specific purpose. A friend was getting
rid of an old picket fence, so the inventive gardener grabbed it.
It now separates a small lawn _ encircled with boxwoods grown from
a great-uncle's cuttings, liriope and ostrich ferns _ from a tiny
rose garden.
</P>
<P>
   To give the roses the necessary sunlight, Cleveland borrowed a
painter's extension ladder, climbed to the crown of an old elm
shading the back yard and gave its branches a topiary-style
haircut.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the house, an alley several feet wide was
transformed into a cutting and trial garden where swamp sunflowers,
cannas and poppies flourish, thanks to afternoon sun _ the same
exposure that in summer bakes the indoors. To help shade the
interior while maintaining the sunny garden, Cleveland espaliered
fig trees against the siding. The effect is to shroud the windows
while leaving the beds exposed.
</P>
<P>
   And on the front, raised beds, a window box and hanging porch
baskets pack such a powerful punch of color that passing motorists
slow to stare as if the house were coated in a November blaze of
Christmas lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treated this like a huge container and just layered
everything,'' Cleveland says of the stacked-stone bed.
</P>
<P>
   Boxwoods form a backdrop in winter, when trailing yellow violas
and bright green parsley do their part until 500 bright red tulips,
golden-yellow daffodils and purple and pink foxgloves rise above
them to salute spring. In summer, dependable perennials such as
phlox, daylilies, purple heart and cannas get assists from splashy
annuals including marigolds, coleus, zinnias and petunias.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden behind this container meadow is a window box ``as large
as a coffin,'' Cleveland says, for holding three topiary shrubs and
yet another bounty of billowing annuals.
</P>
<P>
   And in the midst of it all, a prolific moon vine reaches up,
with its saucer-size blooms, and grabs one of two hanging baskets
planted with shade-loving annuals on the porch side, sun ones on
front.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, amazed by how much Cleveland has been able to squeeze
into the little lot, have begun seeing plenty of possibilities for
their own little yards.
</P>
<P>
   Verona Cannon, whose yard next door consists of a few shrubs and
neatly trimmed lawn, can't help but feel a little overwhelmed by
Cleveland's talents. ``But we think it's wonderful because we get
all the benefits of it,'' she says. ``When our friends are sick, he
shares bouquets of flowers with them. Plus, he just inspires
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood president Richard Arnold can vouch for that, having
witnessed a surge in property values he attributes to the pride
residents like Cleveland and Rogerson are taking in their homes and
yards. ``You hear nothing but 'Awesome!' and 'Wish my yard looked
like that,' '' he says of their garden.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's advice to them? Think big _ regardless of what
you're given.
</P>
<P>
   8 WAYS TO THINK BIG
</P>
<P>
   When faced with limited outdoor space, Atlanta gardener Dan
Cleveland recommends:
</P>
<P>
   Building raised beds along fences and around foundations using
stacked stone, brick, cinder blocks or timbers.
</P>
<P>
   Layering plants in beds so that the tallest, such as shrubs and
ornamental grasses, are in the back, medium-size ones in the
middle, and low and cascading types in the front.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the garden indoors by hanging window boxes and hay
racks. To conserve moisture, place a heavy plastic trash bag,
punched with holes, inside the container's coco liner.
</P>
<P>
   Using potted shrubs and small trees to give beds height or to
fill a gap and taking advantage of porches, decks and patios for
displaying container gardens and hanging baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the paint color on a house and fence to downplay the
structures and highlight the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Defining areas, or ``rooms,'' with evergreen shrubs such as
boxwoods. To accelerate their growth, Cleveland feeds his a
10-10-10 fertilizer in March and May and applies lime in February
and April.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a focal point in each area with a garden ornament,
structure or specimen plant, while providing the ``breathing
space'' of a small lawn or ground cover for taking it all in.
</P>
<P>
   Using bloom color to expand or shrink space. Bold, hot colors,
such as reds and oranges, make plants appear closer; subtle, cool
hues of blue and purple make them seem more distant.

 &HT;    Don't go bananas over moving tropicals
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 11.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's only a matter of time before one cold night wipes out
what's left of those lush tropicals you planted last summer _ and
just when they had grown to a size that had you thinking you'd
escaped to the Caribbean. Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   Banana trees and most other tropicals aren't hardy for
withstanding Atlanta's winters, but that doesn't mean you have to
start over next spring with new, small plants. Many area gardeners
successfully overwinter their tropicals by digging them up before
the first freeze and storing them in basements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is managing to get an entire tree indoors,'' said
Walter Reeves, the Georgia Extension Service's horticulure educator
and TV-radio-newspaper gardening guru.
</P>
<P>
   Each fall, Reeves moves his banana trees into his DeKalb County
basement by trussing them into a neat space-saving bundle. The
project involves using a plastic ring as a sleeve for sliding the
wide leaves to the top of the plant and tying them along the way.
</P>
<P>
   One side benefit of bundling the plant is that the compressed
leaves protect the growing tip, where fruit is produced, from
freezing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you replant the tree next spring, you just cut off the
dead leaves,'' Reeves said, and an already mature tree is ready for
yet another growing season.
</P>
<P>
   STEP ONE: Remove the bottom from a plastic pot and cut the side
until the pot is open.
</P>
<P>
   STEP TWO: Wrap the pot around the base of the tree's trunk. Then
tape the sides of the pot back together to form a sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   STEP THREE: Gradually slide the sleeve up the tree just past the
point at which leaves emerge. Just below that point, tie string
around the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   STEP FOUR: As the sleeve compresses the foliage, wrap the string
around the leaves to form a tight cylindrical bundle.
</P>
<P>
   STEP FIVE: After reaching the tip, remove the sleeve and tie the
leaves into place. Dig up and pot the plant, then move it indoors.
Tropicals contain so much moisture that Reeves usually waters his
only once during winter.

 By CHARLES BUTLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sally Poliak will never forget her political victories. She also
never wants to relive them.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 14 years, starting shortly after graduating from
college in 1983, Ms. Poliak was a top Republican Party consultant
in Washington State. From her Seattle headquarters, she ran
campaigns for offices ranging from county commissioner to member of
Congress. She also organized fund-raising events, including several
for former President George W. Bush. Her political high point came
in November 1994 when she won $200 in the Hacks and Flacks pool, an
election-day wager among political consultants and reporters in the
Seattle area, even as more than two dozen state legislative
candidates she represented won office.
</P>
<P>
   It should have been a dream job. At a young age, Ms. Poliak was
making her mark on Republican politics of a large state, quite an
accomplishment considering that she had been born into a family of
Democrats and that her father, Paul Poliak, was campaign treasurer
for Brock Adams, who was a Democratic senator from Washington.
Between campaigns, she had time to ski and travel and once took
three months off to go scuba diving in the South Pacific. Best of
all, she was her own boss. In 1993, she and a partner started a
consulting company, Polis Political Services, and it thrived.
</P>
<P>
   But by the spring of 1996, the political passions that had
burned since the early 1970s, when she and her family debated
Richard M. Nixon's policies over dinner, began to wane. The
repetitiveness of developing strategies, polling voters and
tweaking campaign messages had become a grind. So, in April 1997,
she left her business, took a pay cut and joined the legions of
marketing professionals at the Microsoft Corp., in suburban
Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had burned out of politics,'' said Ms. Poliak, now 38.
``There were no new challenges. It was like, `I have been to the
peak and I'm beginning to slide down the back slope.' I wanted to
get out before I became like a lot of my friends who hated their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Poliak, join the crowd. As the baby-boom generation ages,
the inclination of those in its ranks to strike out in different
directions is finding fertile soil in the booming economy. As
corporations downsized in the first half of the 1990s, managers and
other professionals became used to the idea of switching jobs,
albeit by way of the pink slip.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with labor shortages forcing employers to beg for help,
people with marketable skills are discovering how easy it is to
switch their working way of life. ``Because the economy is good,
people are more verbal about what stresses them and are willing to
risk making a change,'' said Harold Weinstein, a consultant with
Caliper Human Strategies Inc. in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the motive is to make more money; sometimes it is
boredom, or a longing to fulfill a childhood ambition.
</P>
<P>
   For Joe Benigno, it was a transport to his true calling. For 18
years, Benigno was a food distributor, most recently selling
gourmet fare like French jams and British teas to Manhattan
supermarkets. But sports was his love, and he was such a regular
caller to WFAN-AM, the New York all-sports radio station, that the
station's hosts dubbed him ``Joe from Saddle River,'' his New
Jersey town.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, WFAN invited him to come on air for an hour. It was a
gimmick, but he was such a hit that eight months later, he was
offered a job as host of the station's overnight show. He quit his
sales job that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a salesman, all I ever thought about was sports,''
said Benigno, 46, who makes about as much as he did in his good
years as a salesman. ``I knew that some day I had to find my way
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quitting a lifetime vocation for a new line of work was not
unheard of a decade or even a century ago, of course. But until
recently, lifetime loyalty to the employer was still the ideal, and
switching professional gears was often prompted by incompetence or
a desire to make more money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, for example, Peter Rubolotta ended an eight-year stint
as a high school teacher in New Jersey to become a stockbroker at
Merrill Lynch. Even though he got an immediate 25 percent raise, to
$15,000 from $12,000, friends thought he was making a mistake by
giving up his job tenure. ``Now everybody tells me I did the right
thing,'' said Rubolotta, 53, who still works for Merrill Lynch in
Florham Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the urge to move on to something new can be
overpowering. Ms. Poliak says her lagging interest in political
work had made her ``lethargic.'' Her enthusiasm for playing tennis
and soccer flagged, she said, and she stopped frequenting jazz
clubs that she had haunted for years.
</P>
<P>
   Then, over coffee at a Starbuck's cafe one day in April 1996,
she informed her business partner, Stan Shore, that she was going
to quit after the fall election, even though she had no idea what
she would do next.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing months, she rummaged through boxes of high school
memorabilia looking for inspiration, and even jotted down lists of
things she wanted to avoid in her next career. At the top was the
anxiety of meeting payroll and the drudgery of keeping track of
billable hours. ``That ruled out working in an agency,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in December, still with no grand aspirations, she took
a friend up on a suggestion to seek an interview at Microsoft. A
few months later, the company offered her a job, even though she
had no experience in technology.
</P>
<P>
   That very lack was almost a plus, to hear Microsoft tell it.
``She is smart, likes to learn and is a risk-taker,'' said Lisa
Kelley, her boss. ``Changing your career in midlife is risky.''
</P>
<P>
   When she started her new job in April 1997, Ms. Poliak left
behind her Rolodex of political contacts and photographs that
showed her chatting with the likes of Dan Quayle and Barbara Bush.
She did not want the relics of her old career to distract her from
learning the software acronyms and marketing strategies of her new
one.
</P>
<P>
   She proved a quick study. Soon, her colleagues were calling her
Dr. Poliak, and she developed a new direct-mail program for her
division. Eighteen months after she arrived, she was promoted to
management.
</P>
<P>
   She has discovered something else about herself: She is not a
morning person. ``Politics has 7 a.m. meetings,'' Ms. Poliak said.
``That just doesn't happen here. It is much more civilized.''

 &HT;    Beset by turmoil, Muslim emerges to lead community
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to overlook Warith Deen Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't grab the public's attention like his former rival
Louis Farrakhan or possess the scathing rhetorical brilliance of
his onetime friend Malcolm X. He hasn't sparked a religious
movement like his father, Elijah Muhammad, who founded the Nation
of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But Mohammed, Imam of the Muslim American Society, has overcome
enough drama to fill a Shakespearean tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed's father banished him in the mid-'60s from the Nation
of Islam for questioning the group's doctrine. His friend Malcolm X
was assassinated _ on orders by his father, many people believe _
for doing the same. And when Mohammed finally took over the Nation,
rejecting its theology of racial separation and embracing orthodox
Islam, Farrakhan publicly denounced the move and formed his own
group.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed's beliefs, however, have been vindicated. Today
Mohammed, 66, is widely accepted as a leader of America's Muslim
community.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first Muslim to have opened the U.S. Senate with a
prayer and has become a global ambassador for Islam. The Muslim
American Society claims 2 million members in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed is scheduled to speak at Emory University this evening
as part of the school's Islamic Awareness Week celebration.
Mohammed talked about his eventful life from his home in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the common misperceptions Americans hold about
Islam?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the African-American community, the big misconception is
that it (Islam) is the Nation of Islam. For most Americans, they
think that it's anti-Christian or anti-Semitic. They also seem to
identify the religion with Arabs. They're not aware that they
(Arabs) are a relatively small minority in the Islamic world. The
biggest populations are in Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your relationship with Farrakhan?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's a great friend of mine. He's been friends with me all my
life. I differ with him on religion, but I never stopped thinking
of him as a close fiend.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you stay alive? Your father banished you from the
Nation after you said he did not follow true Islam. And your
friend, Malcolm X, was killed after he did the same.
</P>
<P>
   A: Believe me, I was aware that I could have lost my life. But I
had faith that if I just remained honest and sincere and not hurt
anybody, I would do that. But there were times when I suffered pain
in my heart and fear. But the fear of God is greater if you believe
in God. So I could live with that fear.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did your father react to you opposing his theology?
</P>
<P>
   A: He always told me that his way is the way. When he put me out
of the Nation, he did it in a way to make me feel that he wished he
didn't have to do it. I had no bad feelings for him. He was a
leader. He had to protect his interests.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think your father was responsible for the murder of
Malcolm X?
</P>
<P>
   A: I believe that the intelligence department, the FBI, maybe
the CIA, had a job to do. And I believe they did it through the
weaknesses of the leaders in the Nation of Islam. The intelligence
departments were not making any decisions for them, but were there
to hurry it up. But the actual circumstances that made possible the
assassination, those circumstances were produced by the Nation of
Islam ministers who were attacking Malcolm, calling him Judas.
</P>
<P>
   LECTURE AT EMORY UNIVERSITY
</P>
<P>
   Imam Warith Deen Mohammed will speak at the Woodruff Health
Sciences Center Administration Building on Emory's main campus
today. The lecture is free and open to the public. For more

 &HT;    Highschool takeover isn't one for books
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the teen drama ``Light It Up,'' some students, led by
Atlanta-based recording star Usher Raymond in his first lead role,
take over a horribly overcrowded New York high school.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because their education is a terrible thing being wasted.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't enough textbooks or classroom seats to go around.
Dripping water is everywhere; big puddles fill the hallways. Broken
windows allow freezing air to whip in.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they could burn the books to keep warm? ``There's not
enough,'' one disillusioned kid mutters. The administration denies
the student council's motion to hold a career day. And when one kid
gets pushed around by overzealous adults, he shouts, ``I'm tired of
being wrong before I open my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Aren't we all.
</P>
<P>
   Opening in theaters today, ``Light It Up,'' a heavyhanded,
forgettable piece of classroom claptrap from writer/director Craig
Bolotin (``Black Rain,'' ``Straight Talk''), is not nearly as
violent and explosive as the film's trailer suggests. But it is
about as painfully earnest a movie as you're likely to see.
</P>
<P>
   The kids just want to be heard. Most of the adults are so
consumed by rules, stress and fear they just don't listen. It's as
if the school hallways constantly echo James Dean's scream:
``You're tearing me apart!''
</P>
<P>
   It all snaps one day in a series of misunderstandings, and one
sad young fellow ends up pointing a gun at the new school cop.
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour and 30 minutes six students take the cop
hostage, seize the school and make their demands. Fix the windows!
Get more books! And, once a month, we can give the teachers a test,
yeah!
</P>
<P>
   But ``Light It Up'' sounds the same tired notes over and over.
We hurt. They're mean. They need to pay for what they're doing to
us. Let's order pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Every moment of painful injustice is rendered in slo-mo. Every
cry of anguish ever-so-slowly erupts from some kid's wrenched guts.
Yet for a school with nothing but problems, it's amazing how so
many of the florescent lights work. And how, holed up in the school
library, the small band of student militants _ a demographic dream
mix of African-Americans, Latinos and whites _ take time to place
desktop lights in positions that present a more artful glow.
</P>
<P>
   At least the actors, try to make a go of it _ especially Forest
Whitaker (``The Crying Game'') as the cop hostage, Usher as the
student ringleader and Sara Gilbert (``Roseanne'') as a
disenchanted high schooler.
</P>
<P>
   They're the only fire ``Light It Up'' has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light It Up''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Usher Raymond, Forest Whitaker and Vanessa L. Williams.
Rated R for profanity and violent content. 1 hour, 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Verdict: They should have burned the script.

 &HT;    We can always hope that `Pokemon: First Movie' is the last
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe only somebody who owns more Beanie Babies than socks can
understand Pokemon. It's clear the animated ``Pokemon: The First
Movie'' reveals little behind the marketing dynamo's immense
popularity with kids.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have banned the Japanese phenomenon. ``South Park'' has
taken to ridiculing the toy unmercifully. And parents? They seem to
be on this planet only to drive SUVs to the store so kids can buy
more Pokemon cards, Pokemon video games and, now, Pokemon movie
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   A Pokemon, kind of a millennial pet rock, is an imaginary mutant
animal of sorts _ a cat, a turtle, a fish, a dragon; there are more
than 100 you can buy. Each has special powers to fight battles
against other Pokemons. And it takes a Pokemon master (like Ash
Ketchum, the movie's lead kid) to figuratively train and handle
each critter.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to ``Pokemon: The First Movie,'' opening today.
And, surprise, it brings forth a brand new Pokemon. More powerful
than all the others. More desirable to own.
</P>
<P>
   He's Mewtwo, a clone of Mew _ some ancient Pokemon kitty. And
like Frankenstein, he's one ferocious dude. A team of scientists
has infused him with psychic powers.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't long before an anguished Mewtwo, who's all hepped up
about the meaning of his own existence, pulls a full kinetic
``Carrie,'' kapows his creators and starts cloning other Pokemons
into his personal arsenal for a world takeover.
</P>
<P>
   With intentionally stilted animation, uninspired music and lame
jokes, ``Pokemon'' is basically an ultralong version of the
phenomenon's own boring TV 'toon. It justifies its violence with a
denouement brightly wrapped in tears, goodness, love and Pokemon
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is preceded by the short cartoon ``Pikachu's
Vacation,'' a nonsensical tale that finds the title Pokemon and his
pals visiting what amounts to a Pokemon amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   They butt heads, chase each other, hold speed contests, bump
chests and emit gibberish. Think Teletubbies on hallucinogens.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you long for the return of Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon:
</P>
<P>
   The First Movie''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: F
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature directed by Kunihiko Yuyama. Includes the short
cartoon ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' Rated G. 1 hour, 29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Hokey Poke.

RUSSELL CROWE'S SUDDENLY HOT AS TOBACCO WHISTLE-BLOWER IN `THE
INSIDER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things you might not know about Russell Crowe:
</P>
<P>
   Although he's best known in the United States for playing tough
detective Bud White in 1997's ``L.A. Confidential,'' the Australian
actor's latest movie _ ``The Insider,'' which opened Friday _ is
his 20th feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Now 35, he has been acting since he was 6. His stage experience
includes ``The Rocky Horror Show,'' in which he played the dual
role of Eddie (a biker played by Meat Loaf in the movie) and the
wheelchair-using Dr. Scott. He also once assumed the lead role of
Frank N. Furter, the sweet transvestite from Transsexual,
Transylvania.
</P>
<P>
   He began playing in rock bands when he was 14, and sings and
plays guitar for 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, a ``blues-based folk/rock
band'' that has recorded three albums. Its most recent gig was in
January at Los Angeles' Viper Room, owned by actor Johnny Depp.
Crowe's ``L.A. Confidential'' co-stars, Kim Basinger and Danny
DeVito, were in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Given his experience, Crowe takes in stride praise for his
performance in ``The Insider,'' directed by Michael Mann. Crowe
plays Jeffrey Wigand, a research scientist who blew the whistle in
1995 on chemical manipulation of tobacco by cigarette company Brown
&AMP; Williamson. ``The Insider'' is not so much about Wigand as it is
about ``60 Minutes'' producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and his
struggle to get Wigand's story told after CBS _ threatened with a
lawsuit by the cigarette firm _ squelched a Mike Wallace interview
with Wigand, who endured death threats and the breakup of his
marriage because of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember being aware that there was something going on
with `60 Minutes,' but I wasn't aware of the specifics at all,''
says Crowe, who has worked in the States since the 1994 western
``The Quick and the Dead.'' ``I read newspapers, but its
significance wouldn't necessarily have affected me at that time,
because it's a very intrinsically American story.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacino may have the bigger role, but Crowe's performance is the
one getting the Oscar buzz. The actor says that although this is
the first time he has played a real person, he prepared for the
role the way he normally does, researching the part by reading
various news and court reports about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't necessarily emphasize, at all, that I should meet
Jeffrey, because I didn't want to be told how the individual wanted
to be portrayed, which is always a danger,'' Crowe says in his
throaty Australian baritone during a phone interview. ``But having
met him, I realized that the thought process that I was going
through was not sufficient, because what it was missing out on was
the huge emotional impact that these real events had on a real
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For Crowe _ who's a smoker, by the way _ there was physical
impact as well. The actor is nearly 20 years younger than Wigand,
and he packed on 30 extra pounds for the role, which came between
the shoots for the hockey movie ``Mystery, Alaska'' and Ridley
Scott's upcoming ``The Gladiator,'' each of which required Crowe to
be in tiptop shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael left that choice up to me,'' Crowe says of the weight
gain. ``But I'm 35 and Jeffrey's 52, and a lot of people had told
me that during the course of these events, his diet changed
dramatically. He was drinking maybe a little bit more, and so he
gained weight, y'know? And I thought that it was very necessary for
me to carry a little bit of that, because that would help me with
the age.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe talks about acting like cops talk about police work and
reporters about journalism _ it's just a job, y'know? To him, a
praised performance isn't so much about winning awards (he's won
several in Australia) as it is about opening the door to better
work. But he says that his ``Rocky Horror'' experience was pivotal
in his career.
</P>

the truth of the character when you're sitting in a wheelchair,

</P>
<P>
   As for the band, Crowe says that his day job keeps him from
concentrating on it as much as he'd like to.

<P>
   ``There's a new song on the Internet that fans can download now
that's our kind of Christmas present, because we're not going to be
touring this year,'' he says. ``We only sat down together as a
group two or three times in the course of a year, so it's been a
bit of a barren year.'' You can find the song at

FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT RECALLS HIS DAYS OF SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In the days before Richard Nixon resigned
the presidency, Secret Service agent Joel Glenn saw the beginning
of the end, even though he didn't realize it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As Nixon spent his final weekend at Camp David, his aides were
stationed nearby and kept ferrying messages back and forth. Only
later did Glenn learn that Nixon, who stood alone on the patio for
hours between the brief exchanges with aides, was coming to the
realization that he had to resign.
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon returned to Washington, Glenn was aboard the
presidential yacht for a cruise on the Potomac as Nixon's daughter,
Julie Eisenhower, urged the president to keep fighting and not
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 57, had this fly-on-the-wall perspective through portions
of three presidencies. After retiring from the Secret Service, he
returned home to Fort Worth, where he became director of City
Center Security and a vice president in the Bass Companies.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Secret Service, Glenn tried to stay in the
background for the seven years he spent guarding three presidents.
But he's there if you look closely.
</P>
<P>
   He's the blurry image behind Nixon in a Time magazine photograph
showing the president walking from the Rose Garden to the Oval
Office hours before he left the White House on Aug. 9, 1974. He's
riding on the back of a limousine as President Ford pops out of the
sunroof and warily waves to a crowd after two assassination
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of both photographs hang in Glenn's austere office on the
32nd floor of City Center Tower I, competing with the view of the
Tarrant County Courthouse and Fort Worth's north side.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn vividly remembers the unsettling atmosphere on Nixon's
last day in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of recrimination, a lot of his supporters
saying how could this be happening to such a great man,'' Glenn
said. ``I don't think most of us in Secret Service felt that way
once it came out that he knew about Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn believed until the end that Nixon did not know of the
Watergate burglary. He learned at the same time the rest of the
nation did when transcripts were released on Aug. 5, 1974,
revealing that Nixon had ordered the FBI to abandon its
investigation six days after the 1972 break-in at Democratic
National Committee headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was personally angry, but the important thing is we did our
job. I think much of the blame goes to his staff who led him down
that path, but we're all ultimately responsible for our actions,''
Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn saw Nixon's rambling farewell to his staff, felt the
almost funereal atmosphere as the president departed. By afternoon,
the tense climate that had pervaded the White House was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden there was a new sense of hope,'' Glenn said.
``Within two hours, the atmosphere completely changed. You saw an
orderly change of power and a sense that the democratic process was
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, a graduate of Polytechnic High School in Fort Worth, also
came perilously close to an assassin's bullet, even though he was
not on presidential protection duty at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22, 1975, outside the St. Francis Hotel in San
Francisco, he was the liaison with the media. The Associated Press
photographer said he wanted a photo of Ford leaving the hotel. So
Glenn, with the AP and United Press International photographers in
tow, went closer.
</P>
<P>
   As Ford emerged from the hotel, a shot rang out, missing Glenn
by inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It whizzed right by (my) head, I saw the smoke, the gun and
reached into my coat for my gun,'' Glenn said. ``By that time,
other agents already had'' Sarah Jane Moore, who was sentenced to
life in prison for trying to assassinate the president.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn then raced with the photographers to the airport in
pursuit of the fleeing presidential motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   But those highlights were not his favorite part of the job. The
planner in him loved being on the advance teams, where he could
sweep into a city and devise a plan to keep a president safe.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he never subscribed to the ``anyone could take out a
president if they really wanted to'' theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought you make the odds work ifavor,'' Glenn
said. ``Now they have only been 51-to-49 in your favor, but I felt
you could always go in with an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who was the head of the former Secret Service agents
association, still becomes upset at the way agents were treated
during the investigation of President Clinton's involvement with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president failed the Secret Service, I think
Congress failed the Secret Service, I think the judiciary failed
the Secret Service and I think the special prosecutor failed the
Secret Service,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way they could know the significance of Lewinsky
visits or be asked months later to go back in time and determine
the significance of those visits. I think there are other ways the
special prosecutor could have obtained that information without
publicly involving the Secret Service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy, Glenn said he doesn't believe the
agents were harmed and recommends the career to anyone, as long as
they are patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be the type of person who gets a lump in his
throat when he hears The Star-Spangled Banner, who gets excited
every time he sees the Stars and Stripes,'' Glenn said. ``If you
don't, you're not cut out for the job.''

RUSSELL CROWE'S SUDDENLY HOT AS TOBACCO WHISTLE-BLOWER IN `THE
INSIDER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things you might not know about Russell Crowe:
</P>
<P>
   Although he's best known in the United States for playing tough
detective Bud White in 1997's ``L.A. Confidential,'' the Australian
actor's latest movie _ ``The Insider,'' which opened Friday _ is
his 20th feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Now 35, he has been acting since he was 6. His stage experience
includes ``The Rocky Horror Show,'' in which he played the dual
role of Eddie (a biker played by Meat Loaf in the movie) and the
wheelchair-using Dr. Scott. He also once assumed the lead role of
Frank N. Furter, the sweet transvestite from Transsexual,
Transylvania.
</P>
<P>
   He began playing in rock bands when he was 14, and sings and
plays guitar for 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, a ``blues-based folk/rock
band'' that has recorded three albums. Its most recent gig was in
January at Los Angeles' Viper Room, owned by actor Johnny Depp.
Crowe's ``L.A. Confidential'' co-stars, Kim Basinger and Danny
DeVito, were in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Given his experience, Crowe takes in stride praise for his
performance in ``The Insider,'' directed by Michael Mann. Crowe
plays Jeffrey Wigand, a research scientist who blew the whistle in
1995 on chemical manipulation of tobacco by cigarette company Brown
&AMP; Williamson. ``The Insider'' is not so much about Wigand as it is
about ``60 Minutes'' producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and his
struggle to get Wigand's story told after CBS _ threatened with a
lawsuit by the cigarette firm _ squelched a Mike Wallace interview
with Wigand, who endured death threats and the breakup of his
marriage because of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember being aware that there was something going on
with `60 Minutes,' but I wasn't aware of the specifics at all,''
says Crowe, who has worked in the States since the 1994 western
``The Quick and the Dead.'' ``I read newspapers, but its
significance wouldn't necessarily have affected me at that time,
because it's a very intrinsically American story.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacino may have the bigger role, but Crowe's performance is the
one getting the Oscar buzz. The actor says that although this is
the first time he has played a real person, he prepared for the
role the way he normally does, researching the part by reading
various news and court reports about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't necessarily emphasize, at all, that I should meet
Jeffrey, because I didn't want to be told how the individual wanted
to be portrayed, which is always a danger,'' Crowe says in his
throaty Australian baritone during a phone interview. ``But having
met him, I realized that the thought process that I was going
through was not sufficient, because what it was missing out on was
the huge emotional impact that these real events had on a real
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For Crowe _ who's a smoker, by the way _ there was physical
impact as well. The actor is nearly 20 years younger than Wigand,
and he packed on 30 extra pounds for the role, which came between
the shoots for the hockey movie ``Mystery, Alaska'' and Ridley
Scott's upcoming ``The Gladiator,'' each of which required Crowe to
be in tiptop shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael left that choice up to me,'' Crowe says of the weight
gain. ``But I'm 35 and Jeffrey's 52, and a lot of people had told
me that during the course of these events, his diet changed
dramatically. He was drinking maybe a little bit more, and so he
gained weight, y'know? And I thought that it was very necessary for
me to carry a little bit of that, because that would help me with
the age.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe talks about acting like cops talk about police work and
reporters about journalism _ it's just a job, y'know? To him, a
praised performance isn't so much about winning awards (he's won
several in Australia) as it is about opening the door to better
work. But he says that his ``Rocky Horror'' experience was pivotal
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the middle of the '80s, and I was, y'know, in two
minds about what it was I really should focus on,'' he says. ``As a
19- or a 20-year-old, being asked to play an old fellow in a
wheelchair ... What that gave me at that age was the opportunity
for character study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a musical and all that, but if you're not playing
the truth of the character when you're sitting in a wheelchair,
with all these other people around you with fishnet stockings on
and everything, you're not going to get noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the band, Crowe says that his day job keeps him from
concentrating on it as much as he'd like to.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new song on the Internet that fans can download now
that's our kind of Christmas present, because we're not going to be

group two or three times in the course of a year, so it's been a

HIGH-TECH HELPS DISABLED SKIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 14) 
(jt) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an unsteady gait, Sam Avalos trudged toward the ski lift in
Breckenridge, Colo., his crutches leaving marks outside his
footprints in the soft snow. Reaching the lift line, Avalos
replaced his crutches with a set of outriggers, short poles with a
miniature ski on the bottom, and lowered himself into a mono-ski, a
chair made of molded fiberglass, Kevlar and carbon fiber perched on
a single ski. After a short ride up the ski lift, he attacked the
hill, carving graceful turns on the bumpy slope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hear my friends talk about going skiing, and it feels
pretty good if you can go with them and do some of the same things
that they're doing,'' said Avalos, 45 years old, who is partly
paralyzed from the waist down as a result of a car accident when he
was 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the thrill and exhilaration of coming down the
slope, there's nothing like it,'' he said in describing the
attraction of skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Avalos is among the many people with disabilities who, as a
result of advances in technology, government pressure on resort
owners and rising levels of affluence and confidence, are becoming
more common on ski slopes from Stowe to Squaw Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on the increase in the number of disabled skiers are
difficult to find, but some advocates for the disabled estimate
that there are more than 60,000 skiers with some form of physical
or mental disability. Disabled Sports U.S.A., an organization in
Rockville, Md., that encourages people with disabilities to
participate in sports, says that 68 of its 84 chapters offer skiing
programs, making it by far their most popular activity.
</P>
<P>
   Skiing is one of the few sports that disabled people can enjoy
alongside friends and family. ``They don't have to do it in an
isolated environment like wheelchair basketball,'' said Kirk Bauer,
the executive director of Disabled Sports.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in disabled skiing has been fueled in part by changes
in the law. Since 1972, the United States Forest Service has
required that ski resorts operating on Forest Service land _ and
that includes nearly all of the major resorts in the West _ must be
accessible to people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Professional Ski Instructors of America, which trains the
vast bulk of ski teachers, for several years has offered courses in
teaching people with disabilities, including paralysis, multiple
sclerosis, Down syndrome and visual impairment. A number of resorts
including Breckenridge, Winter Park and Vail in Colorado; Taos,
N.M., and Park City, Utah, have ski instruction for people with
physical or mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can walk in or wheel in to our office, we can get them
on the hill,'' said Jennifer Hester, spokeswoman for the National
Sports Center for the Disabled, which is based in Winter Park,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest reason for the growth in the number of
disabled skiers, however, has been the improvements in equipment.
Years ago, the best a disabled person could hope for was going down
the hill in a sit ski, essentially a one-person toboggan that was
heavy, cumbersome and could not handle anything beyond a relatively
easy green run. Today, there are ski bras, metal braces that slip
over the tips of skis, keeping them from splaying out or crossing.
There are ski walkers, metal frames with skis on the bottom that
work just as their name implies. There are bi-skis, a seat propped
over two parabolic skis that is designed for skiers who don't have
the strength or mobility to use a mono-ski.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest breakthrough has been the mono-ski. The latest
designs are exceedingly maneuverable and so light that if skiers
tip over, they can right themselves without too much exertion.
Hydraulic shock absorbers allow it to respond to the contours of
the ski slope in much the same way other skiers' knees do. Newer
models have moved the seat to the ``boot center'' of the ski, a
point about six inches back from the ski's actual center, and the
place where bindings are generally placed. This placement allows
the skier to keep the entire ski in contact with the snow, giving
better control on turns and allowing the skier to handle more
difficult terrain, even moguls.
</P>
<P>
   Newer mono-skis also contain a mechanism that, at the flick of a
switch, raises the seat and allows the skier to get onto a ski
lift. These mechanisms are still crude and need to be improved,
manufacturers say, but the idea is to provide disabled skiers with
the ability to take part completely by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment is expensive; a mono-ski costs about $2,000 to
$3,500. But advocates say that an increasing number of resorts are
beginning to rent such equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And people like Dan and Teresa Dodge are glad they are doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge, who is from Manhattan, Kan., was for years an active
skier who looked forward to the family's yearly ski vacation.
Eleven years ago he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which
has affected his balance and forced him to walk with a cane. After
contracting the disease, he tried skiing unaided, but found it too
painful and too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago a physical therapist suggested he try skiing
again and convinced him to go to the Breckenridge Outdoor Education
Center in Breckenridge, Colo., which teaches skiing and other
activities to people with disabilities. He has mastered the bi-ski,
and is trying to learn the mono-ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to doing something and you think, `Well, maybe I can
do a little more, maybe I can do something that gives me a little
more freedom to be able to load myself onto the ski lift or ski
with my family before my kids are grown,''' he said as he rode the
lift at Breckenridge. ``Maybe I won't be able to do any of those.
Who knows? But it beats sitting in the house while they're out here
having all the fun.''Where to Learn More

</P>
<P>
   Resorts that give lessons also provide the equipment. Generally
they do not let people rent the equipment on their own because they
are not sure that people are familiar with how to use it.
</P>

   ATLANTA-Y2K _ ATLANTA _ The city's computer network probably

fired. Although the city's 911 and water systems and its airport
probably will work, other systems, including the city's police
communications and its financial network, which controls such
things as building permits and payroll, are in jeopardy. With this:
a reproduction of a memo outlining the reasons the city won't be
ready; and a short sidebar on how the memo came to be written and
the hiring and firing of the consultant who wrote it. (Gibson,

   GRANDPARENTS-ROLE _ ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Grandparents providing
primary care for grandchildren is no longer the exception. It is a
profound change in the family structure that is swiftly becoming an
epidemic. More and more mothers and fathers throughout the country
are not doing what they are supposed to be doing _ often leaving
the responsibility to grandparents. An estimated 5.5 million
children, or 7.7 percent, live in the custody of a grandparent,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It's a structure even more
common than the statistics show, and it's growing, according to Amy
Goyer, a program specialist with the Grandparent Information Center
in Washington, D.C. ``The next census is going to ask specific
questions about about raising grandchildren,'' Goyer said. ``We
think that we will get more accurate numbers once the census comes
out.'' (McGillicuddy, Rocky Mount Telegraph) MOVED.

 &HT;    GORE POKES FUN AT BUSH
 &HT;    280&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore avoided the kind of foreign
policy pop quiz that tripped up George W. Bush with a deadpan
monologue Tuesday spoofing his ``friendships'' with obscure foreign
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's ``Imus in the Morning'' radio show had prepared a quiz
for Gore, but the vice president pre-empted it with a lighthearted
parody that still succeeded in poking fun at the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day I was talking to Utkir Sultanov _ you know, the
prime minister of Uzbekistan?'' Gore told amused host Don Imus.
``And he asked me, 'Did you send a birthday card to Hamed?' That's
of course Hamed Karoui, the prime minister of Tunisia. I thought,
'God, I forgot.' I had just been talking about him with Ion Sturza,
the prime minister of Moldova. We're old friends. We actually met
through a mutual friend, Lennart Meri, the president of Estonia, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did express some sympathy with Bush's inability to name the
leaders of four world trouble spots in an interview with a Boston
television station last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing names, I think that's kind of understandable,'' he
said. ``I sympathize with those who say that that's not really a
fair test.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he repeated his criticism of Bush's comments that it
was ``good news'' that Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who seized power in
Pakistan in a coup, was bringing stability to the country and the
subcontinent of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is troubling that (Bush) didn't know it's important
to stand up for democracy and that a military coup overthrowing
democracy is not good news,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore also sidestepped questions from Imus about Naomi Wolf, the
feminist author who, until recently, had been paid $15,000 a month
a month to advise the vice president on issues related to women
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Her involvement in Gore's campaign has raised eyebrows because
of some of her more provocative writings, including advocating
teaching children about masturbation as a safe-sex alternative.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that he has not read her more controversial writings
and ``she doesn't advise me'' on such matters. But ``she's a smart
lady and a valued adviser,'' Gore said. ``She'll remain one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore fended off more questions about Wolf with a tongue-in-cheek
attempt to recruit Imus as an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incidentally, Don, I need and adviser to tell me how to
communicate to old men and I was wondering if you might have some
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, Gore's only opponent for the Democratic
nomination, also was on the receiving end from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president jokingly suggested that Bradley would agree
to debate him again on the Friday night before Christmas between
11:30 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. and again at 11:58 p.m. on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Their first joint appearance in New Hampshire this month was
broadcast on CNN opposite the fourth and final game of the World
Series between the New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves.

 &HT;    REVIEW: Pokemon stumbles as a film
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pokemon phenomenon that has driven American children into a
frenzy makes the leap from television to the movie theaters with
Pokemon: The First Movie, and parents who are baffled by the whole
Pokemon business probably will remain so.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon: The First Movie, like the top-rated Pokemon television
series on Kids' WB, is strictly for the young.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have been living under a rock, Pokemon appeared
three years ago as characters in a Japanese game for Nintendo's
hand-held Game Boy system. Players win the game by capturing
Pokemon, short for ``pocket monsters,'' and training them to fight
against Pokemon owned by other players.
</P>
<P>
   The movie and the television series are set in a world where
human Pokemon trainers compete to become top Pokemon masters. Here
on Earth, kids compete by buying and collecting as much Pokemon
merchandise as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, mysterious scientists clone a rare psychic Pokemon
called Mew to create the most powerful Pokemon of all, Mewtwo
(Mewtwo Strikes Back book, $4.99). Mewtwo, who communicates
telepathically with a British accent, refuses to serve his
creators. ``I will find my purpose and purge this planet of all who
oppose me, human and Pokemon alike,'' Mewtwo declares.
</P>
<P>
   After young Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum (tattoo kit, $3.99) wins
a match with another trainer, he gets a mysterious invitation to a
tournament featuring an unnamed trainer who is supposed to be the
best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Only the bravest and most resourceful Pokemon trainers make it
through a violent storm that blocks them from the island where the
tournament is being held. Ash and his friends Misty and Brock
(jigsaw puzzle, $2.99) get to the island only with the help of
their old rivals Team Rocket (activity book, $5.99).
</P>
<P>
   Once on the island, the heroes' Pokemon _ Pikachu (camera,
$16.99), Bulbasaur (pencil sharpener, $2.99), Charizard
(candy-filled plush toy, $4.99) and others _ must battle Mewtwo's
genetically enhanced evil Pokemon to save the world.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly (with all the fighting going on), the moral of the
story _ which is delivered with all the subtlety of a Super Bowl
halftime show _ is about the evil of fighting. It's possible the
moral was emphasized so forcefully to combat criticism that seems
to building against Pokemon, partly from people who connect Pokemon
to the occult.
</P>
<P>
   As in the television series, the animation in the Pokemon movie
is clunky though some of the background shots are impressive. The
plot has huge holes and a narrator who tosses out occasional
explanations is more annoying than enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   Before the beginning of Pokemon: The First Movie, theaters will
present Pikachu's Vacation, a film running about 20 minutes that
follows Ash's Pokemon as they take a few days off to relax with
other pocket monsters at a holiday retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Watching was slow torture, like watching pantomime by the Tin
Woodsman. Only a couple Pokemon can talk, and the narrator was at a
loss to explain half of what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Expect your children to lobby to see Pokemon: The First Movie
(matinee showing, $5.25), but they may only want to see it once.
The children at a preview showing last weekend seemed a lot less
enthusiastic leaving the theater than they were when entering.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In the days before Richard Nixon resigned
the presidency, Secret Service agent Joel Glenn saw the beginning
of the end, even though he didn't realize it at the time. As Nixon
spent his final weekend at Camp David, his aides were stationed
nearby and kept ferrying messages back and forth. Only later did
Glenn learn that Nixon, who stood alone on the patio for hours
between the brief exchanges with aides, was coming to the
realization that he had to resign. When Nixon returned to
Washington, Glenn was aboard the presidential yacht for a cruise on
the Potomac as Nixon's daughter, Julie Eisenhower, urged the
president to keep fighting and not quit. Glenn, 57, had this
fly-on-the-wall perspective through portions of three presidencies.

COURT WEIGHS DISPUTE OVER COLLEGE STUDENT ACTIVITY FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Could African-American college students be forced
to contribute to Ku Klux Klan campus groups? Should anti-abortion
students be required to support pro-choice organizations?
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard arguments over whether public
universities should be allowed to use mandatory student ``activity
fees'' to finance a variety of campus groups, including
organizations that some students find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose during the 1995-1996 school year when Scott
Southworth, a conservative law student at the University of
Wisconsin, objected to the school using a portion of his activity
fee to support groups he disagreed with.
</P>
<P>
   One group, the International Socialist Organization, advocated
the overthrow of the government. Another, the Campus Women's
Center, urged students to work against proposed anti-abortion
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Southworth tried to avoid paying the school's annual student fee
of $331.50 by writing a letter to the school's administration. But
when he received no reply, he and two other students sued, alleging
that their First Amendment rights to free speech, association and
religion had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Ullman, a Wisconsin assistant attorney general arguing
on behalf of the university, said, ``It is important to facilitate
the speech of diverse groups. She added, ``Providing for groups
with different points of view ... is a legitimate function for any
university.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Lorence, representing the students, told the court that
his clients should not _ in the name of free speech _ be
``compelled'' to support groups they find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment was set up to allow people to say what
they believe, not to force people to say things they don't believe
in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, expected by late June, could change the
way public universities and colleges collect and distribute money.
If the Wisconsin students win, state-run schools will either have
to stop giving student money to controversial campus groups or
figure out some way to give partial refunds to those students who
want them.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's arguments the justices, attempting to balance
the desire for vigorous debate on campus with the right of the
students to support only groups they agree with, grilled both
Ullman and Lorence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if there was student chapter of the Ku Klux Klan? Justice
Antonin Scalia asked Ullman. ``Would it get funding and in essence
force African-American students to support it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Ullman answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman also came under fire from Justice David Souter after
contending that the Constitution ``does not prohibit the university
from requiring students to contribute'' funds to set up a forum for
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Souter said, ``From what I understand, hundreds of student
organizations operate on campus without receiving any money from
the university. So where is this great need for more groups?'' He
added: ``It seems there is pretty good debate already.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said Lorence was asking the court
to force universities to ``scale back'' on their traditional
mission of providing a forum for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the middle ages, universities have been a place where
people have come to debate different views,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia quickly replied for Lorence: ``You're saying that since
medieval times universities have been funding student groups. I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Like students at most universities, those at Wisconsin must pay,
in addition to tuition, a fee for campus activities. The university
turns over part of the fees to the Associated Students of Madison,
the student government organization, which then allocates funds to
various groups, service organizations and university departments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in
Chicago agreed with Southworth and his two colleagues, saying that
requiring students to support student government and its funding
decisions meant that every individual student was subsidizing the
speech of every group that got funding.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the appeals court relied heavily on a 1995
Supreme Court decision that barred public universities and colleges
from creating a ``public forum'' for students and then refusing to
subsidize some groups because of their viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a university cannot discriminate in the disbursement of
funds, it is imperative that students not be compelled to fund
organizations which engage in political and ideological activities
_ that is the way to protect the individual's rights,'' the appeals
court ruled.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn Academy of Music's 17th annual Next Wave
Festival began with the usual bold mixture of experimental theater,
music and dance. There were visits from such academy favorites as
Laurie Anderson, Pina Bausch and Philip Glass and the debuts of
several international companies. A hip-hop celebration featuring
Vernon Reid and the Roots will bring the festival to a close on
Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   What is different this year is that this is the first season
under the direction of Joseph V. Melillo, the academy's new
executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   For 31 years, the institution was led by Harvey Lichtenstein,
who since 1983 has shared various artistic responsibilities with
his chief assistant, Melillo. When Lichtenstein retired, he named
Melillo his successor, and his other top aide, Karen Brooks
Hopkins, assumed his administrative duties as president. Both
choices were ratified by the academy's board.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally and physically, Lichtenstein and Melillo are a study
in contrast. As the man who took the academy to its current
eminence, Lichtenstein was a highly visible impresario of the
avant-garde. In June, at an evening saluting him at his retirement,
he revealed another flamboyant side, breaking into an extremely
energetic solo dance onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Melillo is a reserved man who has preferred to remain in the
background. He does not dance, sing or act. His talent, he has
said, is as a listener. As the producer of the festival, he has
seemingly been content to remain in Lichtenstein's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   With his flaring eyebrows and intense gaze, Lichtenstein, 70,
looks almost diabolical. With his thin-rim eyeglasses and air of
calmness, Melillo, 52, is more like a compassionate counselor or
perhaps a priest going about his duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very privileged man,'' Melillo said in an interview. In
the performing arts, ``I believe in the aesthetic moment, as Eric
Bentley said, as the intensive vocation of one's humanity. I sit as
a subjective and objective tabula rasa in the theater. I go to it
open to the experience, and the experiences that are meaningful are
the transformative ones.'' That approach has led him and
Lichtenstein to present some of the most innovative performance
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is one of the best presenters in the country,'' said David
Rousseve, a choreographer whose new work, ``Love Songs,'' will be
staged at the festival in December. He said that as a producer ``he
has a strong eye for the works of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the productions have been well received, but both
Lichtenstein and Melillo remain deeply committed to experimentation
in the arts and to the academy as a cultural institution on the
cutting edge. Together they have challenged convention as well as
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly Melillo has been grooming himself for his new position,
putting together a resume that, were he not the primary in-house
candidate, would still make him a natural choice. Where his
predecessor's background is in the world of dance, Melillo is
rooted in theater.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New Haven, Conn., he graduated from Sacred Heart
University in Bridgeport, Conn., then went to Catholic University
in Washington to study classical theater. His first job after
graduation was as an assistant at the Tyrone Guthrie Theater in
Minneapolis, where he decided he did not have the qualities to
become a director and turned his aspirations toward being a
producer.
</P>
<P>
   At the City Center of Music and Drama in New York, he worked in
the educational and community affairs department and closely
watched all the visiting companies. It was, he said, ``my doctorate
degree in live performance.'' As marketing director for the Walnut
Street Theater in Philadelphia during the bicentennial, he learned
the principles of sales and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Furthering broadening his background, he traveled around the
United States for a foundation working with nonprofit theaters.
Then he ``went back in the trenches'' as an active producer,
accepting a position as general manager of the New World Festival
of the Arts in Miami. It was his management of that festival that
brought him to the attention of Lichtenstein, who was looking for
someone to produce his first Next Wave Festival. Since then, except
for a year when he was the artistic director for Martin Segal's New
York International Festival of the Arts, he has been at the
academy.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein said that Melillo had ``grown phenomenally'' in his
years in Brooklyn. He praised his successor's collegiality and
generosity, especially to emerging artists. That generosity was
also stressed by Anne Hamburger, the founder of En Garde Arts and
the new artistic director of La Jolla Playhouse in California.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamburger began her theatrical career as an intern with the
Next Wave Festival, and from the first, she said, she was taken by
Melillo's ability to blend creative partnerships. He encouraged her
to start En Garde Arts and later joined her board. ``He is one of
the most important mentors in my creative life,'' she said. ``He
should open a career counseling office.''
</P>
<P>
   Melillo defined his previous role as taking charge of research
and development. He frequently traveled, scouting new artists and
bringing ideas and productions back to Lichtenstein. Running a
yearly festival was, he said, ``an extraordinary treadmill _ either
you learn that you love it or you run for your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men generally agreed, Melillo said, but occasionally
differed about a particular artist or production: ``I always had
the right to do that, and he always had the right to say we're
doing it anyway.'' Although he hesitated to offer specifics, he did
admit that one visit from the Zingaro performing horses would have
been enough for him. Asked how their taste differed, Lichtenstein
said, ``I'm a little further out.''
</P>
<P>
   Melillo was clear about his enthusiasms, beginning with the work
of Robert Wilson. ``I love Robert Wilson,'' he said, and considers
the reconstruction of ``Einstein on the Beach'' in 1984 as one of
the major accomplishments of his years at the academy. He said that
one could look forward to more Wilson pieces, even if that meant
``delaying the presentation of another artist.'' Also in the
Melillo pantheon are Ms. Anderson, Ms. Bausch, Glass, Mark Morris,
Peter Brook and Ariane Mnouchkine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things he and Ms. Hopkins did in their new jobs
was to sign a letter from the Cultural Institutions Group
protesting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's threat to withdraw city
support for the Brooklyn Museum of Art over ``Sensation,'' its
exhibition of recent British art. ``It's very clear that Giuliani
doesn't understand contemporary art,'' he said. ``I think what he's
doing is wrong. It's an abuse of power. BAM signed the letter,
fully ratified by the board of trustees, with not one dissenting
voice.'' The controversy, he said, ``draws the line in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought there were any barriers in art, he said:
``I'm very uncomfortable in violent situations. If I thought
violence onstage might be gratuitous, I would not choose to present
that work.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the current Next Wave Festival, Melillo said, ``Artistically
it's great _ but it's selling very well.'' Explaining the ``but,''
he noted that even at the academy, quality is not necessarily
reflected in ticket sales. He pointed with pride to one of his
latest discoveries, Denmark's Hotel Pro Form and its production of
a new version of the Orpheus myth. It played in the largest space,
the 2,100-seat Opera House, and sold out its run before it opened.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the interest partly to the graphically striking
image of the production in the festival brochure, placing it in the
Robert Wilson tradition.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Melillo is obsessed with his work. When he
has a free evening he often goes to shows or concerts not sponsored
by the academy, from the Kitchen to a new performance space in
Crown Heights. With his new job, he has even less time for reading.
Currently he is rereading ``Quo Vadis'' because a friend is
thinking of turning it into an opera.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing his future, he said: ``Harvey delivered a performing
arts center and opened the cinemas. I'm going to create a
performing, cinema and media arts center for the 21st century.'' He
said he planned to build a digital media lab and would emphasize
new media and technology, both onstage and in educational services
provided to New York schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he plans to increase his institution's global
perspective, bringing in more arts from Asia, Africa and South
America. ``I'm using this mantra, Destination BAM,'' he said. As
always, Melillo is ready to pack a suitcase, travel to see a
pioneering company and bring it back to Brooklyn.

LESLEY STAHL'S `LIVE' REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAY HANDELMAN   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lesley Stahl may have a reputation for being a tough reporter,
standing her ground against presidents and corporate executives,
but she's not above squirming, which is what indirectly led her to
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by her father, a scientist, Stahl heeded the call
during the era of Sputnik and President Eisenhower for female
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   While majoring in zoology at Columbia University, Stahl said she
came ``to realize that I was never going to be a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a comparative-anatomy class, we were wearing rubber gloves,
not like the ones doctors use today, but the kind like you use to
wash dishes. We were studying a sheep's heart and they said I had
to actually touch it. I had to take the gloves off and touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl took the gloves off, figuratively, when she turned to
journalism after a stint as a speechwriter for New York Mayor John
Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalism is tough, but you don't have to touch if you don't
want to,'' Stahl joked in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl had to be tough to make it in the competitive field of
network news, especially when she began with CBS News in Washington
in 1972. Whether she realized it at the time or not, she was a
groundbreaker, one of the ``affirmative-action babies,'' as she has
called herself and Connie Chung and Bernard Shaw, who also were new
to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story she tells in a lively fashion in her book
``Reporting Live,'' published earlier this year and due out in
paperback next month.
</P>
<P>
   When Stahl began at CBS, ``the public hadn't quite accepted
women yet,'' she said. ``At that point, we had to be sort of as
close to men as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, she was told to fix her hair and makeup, and her
mother even suggested a face lift.
</P>
<P>
   Looks are important on television, Stahl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men talk about it too, now. The gender difference is that
women don't talk about their hair and makeup so much as men do now.
The men are more gorgeous than the women today. If you look at all
three anchormen they're all unbelievably good-looking men,'' she
said, referring to Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporting Live'' focuses on the struggles Stahl and other
women faced in the years when the networks were trying desperately
to diversify, even if the attitudes of the staffs at that time were
not as welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, who turns 58 next month, details her coverage of the
Watergate scandal and Presidents Carter and Bush, her tenure as
host of ``Face the Nation'' and her current, and perhaps best, job,
as a correspondent on ``60 Minutes,'' the longest-running TV news
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   She called ``60 Minutes'' a dream job that allows her, along
with her producers and assistants, as long as six months to
research and prepare for stories before on-camera interviews are
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pick all our own stories,'' Stahl said. ``There are no
assignments. I never have to work on a story if I don't care about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are times, she said, when she misses live
reporting, the thrill of confirming information, getting a camera
in place and beaming it live across the country on the CBS Evening
News, or handling interviews live on ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the rush of that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the years of struggling and occasional pain and insults she
suffered had their payoff.
</P>
<P>
   As she writes in her book, ``The anger I had lived with, that I
thought was defining me, retired like a burned-out employee the
minute I started at `60 Minutes' on April 2, 1991. I smiled all
that day _ so much my face hurt _ and I haven't stopped yet eight
years later.''

TEXAS BAPTISTS REJECT AMENDMENT ON WIFELY SUBMISSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: see optional ending.) 
 
By RICHARD VARA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   El Paso, Texas _ Texas Baptists voted overwhelming Tuesday to
ignore a 1998 amendment to the Southern Baptist Convention's
confessional statement asking wives to submit to husbands'
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as the moderate-controlled Baptist General
Convention of Texas, which has 2.7 million members in more than
5,000 churches, concluded its annual two-day meeting at the El Paso
Civic Center. The vote by delegates supported the denomination's
1963 Baptist Faith and Message, a statement of commonly-held
beliefs, and brought criticism from national convention leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as Texas Baptist leaders continued sniping at the
conservative-controlled Southern Baptist Convention. Moderates and
conservatives have been embroiled in a 20-year dispute over the
nature and nature of Scriptures. It also comes as a national
convention committee is reviewing the Baptist Faith and Message for
updating or changes.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also approved motions for especially appointed study
committees to examine the theological positions and philosophies of
the national convention, its seminaries and mission sending
agencies, such as the International Missions Board and the North
American Missions Board.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 family amendment to the confessional statement sparked
national controversy with several churches leaving the 15.7
million-member national convention because it asked wives to submit
to husbands. Conservatives said the amendment was based on the
Bible and the apostle Paul's teachings in his letter to the
Ephesians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible doesn't teach the husband is a general and the wife
is a private,'' said Charles Wade, the state convention's
designated executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly oppose the concept that women are inferior to or
in any way subject to males in their understanding of their
priesthood before God,'' said Phil Strickland, chairman of the
Texas convention's Christian Life Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to support only the 1963 statement was made by the
Rev. Bob Newell, pastor of Houston's Memorial Drive Baptist Church.
Newell said the vote ``was a statement in favor of our traditional
Baptist consensus.``
</P>
<P>
   Newell said Paul's letter to the Ephesians included a call for
mutual submission between husbands and wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening now is the narrowing of the Baptist Faith
and Message and a misreading and misapplication of the
Scriptures,'' said the Rev. Phil Lineberger of Williams Trace
Baptist Church in Sugar Land, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Wade said the vote was sending a message to national convention
leaders that Texas Baptists ``are not pleased to hear of further
amendments.``
</P>
<P>
   Not all delegates voted in favor of Newell's motion. ``I believe
this motion was another statement of disunity with the national
convention,'' said the Rev. Tom Roberson of Longview.
</P>
<P>
   The approval brought quick reaction from national convention
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motion adopted by the BGCT is an intentional rejection of
a clear teaching of the Bible,'' said R. Albert Mohler Jr.,
president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kentucky.
``This is another lamentable sign of the determination of some
Texas Baptist leaders to alienate Texas Baptists from the Southern
Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their problem is not with the Southern Baptist Convention,''
Mohler said. ``It is with the apostle Paul.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Land, president of the national convention's Ethics and
Religious Liberty Commission, was also critical. ``The Baptist
Faith and Message article on the family is an accurate reflection
and restatement of the scriptural teaching on marriage,'' Land
said. ``The husband is always to place his wife's needs above his
own and the wife is to willingly submit to the sacrificial love of
such a godly husband.``
</P>
<P>
   The successful motion to appoint study committees of national
convention seminaries and missions agencies will provide an
opportunity to state officials to examine the views of national
leaders, Wade said.

SCHROEDER PRAISES EAST GERMANS, EAST EUROPEANS FOR AIDING
REUNIFICATION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ At a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the fall
of the Berlin wall, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Tuesday made
very clear which Germans deserve special praise, saying: ``The wall
fell from east to west, pushed down by brave and fearless East
Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, addressing Parliament in the presence of former
President George Bush, seemed at pains to assuage the feelings of
bitterness felt by some eastern Germans over the alienation and
high unemployment that have accompanied unification. He called
their ``civil courage'' a lesson to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lutheran Rev. Joachim Gauck, a leading protester in 1989
who was hurriedly added to the ceremony after complaints that
former East Germans had been excluded, had a grimmer view. ``After
reunification, many of us felt like strangers in our own country,''
he said. ``We dreamed of paradise and woke up in North-Rhine
Westphalia.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor's reference to ``zivilcourage'' was particularly
resonant on a day that also marks the 61st anniversary of the Nazi
rampage against the Jews known as ``Kristallnacht.'' Schroeder
clearly wanted to suggest that more acts of conscience and courage
such as those in East Germany a decade ago might have hindered or
halted Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The word zivilcourage has become a rallying-cry of modern German
identity, a shorthand for ``never again'' to the destruction and
burning of synagogues and Jewish stores on Nov. 9, 1938, and the
Holocaust, which followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``November 9th is a day of joy, but also a day of shame and a
time of reflection,'' Schroeder said. ``It is a day of euphoria but
also a day, in 1938, that led to an abyss of inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
   This being Germany, it was perhaps inevitable that light and
dark should so mingle a decade after Europe's division was ended
and half a continent was set free. Few public expressions of
emotion or pride, it seems, ever contrive to be altogether
unclouded by Hitler's long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, it was celebration that prevailed as the former
Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and former Chancellor Helmut Kohl
joined Bush in the refurbished Reichstag, home once again to the
German Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there had been many difficult moments in his
presidency, among them the military campaign against Iraq, but ``in
many ways no situation was as dicey as the one we all faced on Nov.
9, 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   On a television in the study next to the Oval Office, Bush
watched a decade ago what he called the ``surreal sight'' of East
Germans streaming through the breached wall. His joy, he said, was
tempered by concern over a backlash like the one that quashed the
Prague Spring democracy movement of 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our leaders on Capitol Hill suggested that I come over
here to the Berlin Wall and dance on the wall,'' Bush said,
conjuring up an altogether unlikely image. ``In my view, that would
have been an open provocation, tantamount to sticking our fingers
in the eyes of the Soviet military.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president, made an ``honorary citizen'' of Berlin on
Monday, was clearly at pains to defend his cautious initial
statement that he was ``very pleased'' by the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the path that would lead from the wall's breach to
German unification eleven months later was by no means charted.
Indeed, there was no sign that the Soviet Union was prepared to
accept the unification of Germany, particularly in such a way that
Germany remained within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl reminded the Parliament that it was not just Russia that
viewed a united Germany with suspicion a decade ago. ``Mr. Bush saw
that a free Germany, a sovereign Germany would have to be a united
Germany, and that was important because many others were very
difficult to convince,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics included Francois Mitterrand, the former French
president, who was fond of the old quip that Germany was such a
splendid place, it was a good thing there were two of them.
Margaret Thatcher was equally hesitant. The absence of a British or
French leader at Tuesday's Berlin ceremony was striking.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, looking wan after the recent death of his wife,
Raisa, recalled the intense sparring between himself, Bush and Kohl
over whether Germany should remain in NATO. He suggested that the
contribution of the east bloc, and particularly East German
politicians, to peaceful unification within NATO had been unfairly
belittled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some undercurrents in your life that I just do not
understand,'' he said. ``It is strange that right now you are
sentencing those very people from the East German leadership who
decided to make the world transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Egon Krenz, the former East German leader who ruled for six
weeks before the Berlin Wall fell, lost an appeal on Monday of a
six-and-a-half year sentence for his role in the shootings of
people who tried to escape over the wall. More than 450 people were
killed during the wall's 28-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev's criticism was met by a frosty silence in the
Reichstag building, but in general the mood was self-congratulatory
and festive as Schroeder painted a picture of ``a second chance for
Germany and Europe'' that should lead to a united continent at
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years after the fall of the wall, Europe must not be
divided by a `prosperity border' between the European Union and its
eastern neighbors,'' he said. Nor, Schroeder continued, ``can
Europe any longer accept the trampling of human rights, as the
Kosovo campaign shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor said Germany would work energetically to bring
countries like Poland into the European Union. In fact, well before
the ``civil courage'' of east Germans became manifest, it was the
Poles and their Solidarity union that set Europe on the road to
ending the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder acknowledged this, thanking Poland and other central
European countries for helping Germany out of its postwar division.
</P>
<P>
   The unification that came on Oct. 3, 1990, brought initial
euphoria, but was followed by what Gauck, who is now in charge of
analyzing and releasing the files of the East German stasi, or
secret police, called ``feelings of helplessness and
disappointment'' in the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment soared in the east, growing to more than double
western levels. Humiliated and feeling worthless, some ``Ossis''
came to see ``Wessis'' as arrogant in their wholesale takeover of
the country; ``Wessis,'' in turn, started to resent large transfers
of public money eastward.
</P>
<P>
   But alongside these resentments, a staggeringly rapid
transformation took place, bringing modern telecommunications, new
industries, new roads and new possibilities to a once decaying,
gloomy eastern landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder insisted on Tuesday that Berlin should remember these
achievements and live ``a moment of joy.'' Concerts, light shows,
parties and fireworks were among the attractions offered to express
that joy in a city still searching through light and shadow to make
itself one after a century of almost relentless trauma.

`LIGHT IT UP': A PROBLEM SCHOOL BECOMES A WAR ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the guise of being sociologically sensitive and highly hip,
``Light It Up'' turns out to be a pretentiously righteous drama
that drowns any claim to serious attention in a sea of superficial
characters.
</P>
<P>
   This tale of a half-dozen students who take over their Queens
high school after the accidental shooting of a police officer and
turn their occupation into a plea for better education, school
repairs and decent treatment smacks more of by-the-numbers
marketing creation than artistic inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   While the more recent antecedents of ``Light It Up'' appear to
be films like ``The Breakfast Club'' (1985) and ``Cooley High''
(1975), the true lineage probably tracks back to the World War II
films that constructed their drama around the diverse members of a
military squad, right down to the sensitive artist who
achieve greatness if only he can survive the impending battle.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the enemy pitted against a handful of black, white
and Hispanic children with a wounded policeman as their hostage is
a horde of heavily armed police officers and television news
broadcasters rendering one-sided accounts of the takeover until the
students use modern electronics to issue their side of the story to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   As written and directed by Craig Bolotin, whose credits include
``Black Rain'' and ``That Night,'' ``Light It Up'' is one of those
films that underscore their claim to importance with intrusive
music and blurry scenes in a shade of blue rarely seen in real
life.
</P>
<P>
   As for the action, it spins out of a morning gone wrong at
Lincoln High, where there are too many students, too few textbooks,
too little heat and a principal (Glynn Turman, an alumnus of
``Cooley High'') who is unresponsive even to Ken Knowles, the most
caring of his teachers (Judd Nelson, an alumnus of ``The Breakfast
Club'').
</P>
<P>
   To compound matters, the new arrival in school is a hulking
police officer (Forest Whitaker) of monumental insensitivity and a
determination to make his presence felt at once.
</P>
<P>
   He has already had an encounter with two of the students _ the
troubled basketball star Lester Dewitt (Usher Raymond) and Ziggy
Malone (Robert Ri'chard ), the abused pint-size Michelangelo of the
Lincoln High cockloft by the time Knowles and his students are
forced to abandon their classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The impatient principal instructs Knowles to take his class
anywhere but the hallway, and when they adjourn to a nearby
luncheonette, an attempted armed robbery subjects Knowles to
suspension for taking his charges off the school premises.
</P>
<P>
   When the students, including the good, intelligent Stephanie
Williams (Rosario Dawson), rally to his defense, matters get out of
hand, the policeman is wounded in a scuffle involving Lester and
Ziggy, and the takeover begins.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa L. Williams plays the role of a police negotiator eager
to end the standoff without violence who is pitted against yet
another of the film's one-dimensional characters, a police
lieutenant eager to send his SWAT team into action.
</P>
<P>
   By its end, ``Light It Up'' has become a film whose soft heart
lies crushed under its heavy hand.
</P>

 &HT;    White not repeating last season's numbers, not getting ball as
much
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dez White's thirst to excel is not being quenched. And
the Georgia Tech junior split end knows only one way it can be _ by
throwing him the ball more.
</P>
<P>
   But recent Yellow Jackets opponents have had other desires. They
have designed coverages to make White a secondary target, although
with only limited success. Even so, his 30 catches for 640 yards
and four touchdowns are only modest by the lofty standards White
has set for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be an All-American and improve on things I did
last year,'' White said Tuesday, ``so in that respect it has been
tough. But I realize in the long run it will help the team. It's
only frustrating when the offense is struggling; then I feel
helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's shattering, 45-38 upset loss at Virginia, White
caught only two passes for 25 yards against a secondary he burned
for three touchdowns and a Jackets record 243 yards a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Cavaliers were a bit stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they didn't go deep more,'' said Dwayne
Stukes, the Virginia cornerback White singed a season ago. Like all
other Tech foes, the Cavs were intent on subduing White.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been calling Dez's number, but the coverages have been
going over to his way,'' Jackets receivers coach Stan Hixon said,
``and Joe (Hamilton) does a great job of reading coverages.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, White broke on the scene nationally by catching 46
passes for 902 yards and nine touchdowns. White set a Tech record
for receiving yards, and his 21.2-yard average per catch was
fourth-best in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With Hamilton returning, White was considered a top contender
for the Biletnikoff Award, which goes to the college game's top
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, he will have a tough time matching his `98 stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had passes called for him, but because of the coverage,
Kelly Campbell came open,'' Hixon said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to say Campbell, the sophomore speedster who
has bust loose this season to catch 50 passes for 829 yards and
seven TDs, is taking away throws that normally would have gone
White's way. ``We're throwing the ball to the open guy,'' coach
George O'Leary said. ``(Offensive coordinator) Ralph Friedgen does
a good job of spreading the ball around. We needed another
(receiver) to stretch the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more aware of Dez ... and (are) shading coverages
to that side. When they do that, the ball has been going to where
they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   White understands, and he has not once complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dez is not like that,'' Hixon said. ``Obviously, he wishes he
had some higher numbers, but he knows our offense. He knows he
can't control what defenses are called, and we can't either.''
</P>
<P>
   A religious person, White embraces patience as a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are trying to prevent the big plays,'' he said, ``and in
certain situations, I'm maybe the last read (for Hamilton). I just
have to be able to endure these things.''

`POKEMON': CHARIZARD BEATS PSYDUCK, BUT PIKACHU'S THE CUTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the year 2015 or so, it's going to be
embarrassing. Young novelists and reporters will probably be using
terms like Charizard-like or Squirtle-like in their work and
insisting to their much older editors that everyone knows what they
mean, everyone who ate and slept Pokemon as a child, anyway, which
will be the vast majority of young adults.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, parents don't have to know the names and attributes
of all 151 monsters to understand ``Pokemon: The First Movie.'' In
fact, they don't have to know much of anything. This energetic
90-minute film is, however, an opportunity to observe many of the
pocket monsters (that's what Pokemon is short for) in action.
</P>
<P>
   Charizard is a flying, fire-breathing dragon type who, in the
film, gets his head stuck in a pipe. Psyduck, who resembles a
duckbilled platypus, looks entertainingly silly and, one adult fan
reports, has powers only when he has a headache. There's a monster
called Togepy, but adults may prefer to think of it as Starfish
Eggshell Baby, which more accurately describes its anatomy. There's
one called Marill who looks like a blue mouse with a big white
underbelly.
</P>
<P>
   There's one whose name I didn't catch that weeps projectile
tears. Of course there's Pikachu, the cutest of them all, a bright
yellow, glistening-brown-eyed cross between a Muppet (maybe Elmo's
perpetually smiling cousin from Tokyo), Winnie-the-Pooh and a bunny
rabbit wearing rouge. But when things get nasty, Pikachu shoots
electricity from his tail. This dual personality element has got to
be a big part of the Pokemon appeal to children. I may look
adorable and innocent, the child-monster seems to say, but don't
make me mad.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the magic doesn't bridge the generation gap. Whatever
else has made ``Pokemon,'' a Japanese cartoon series dubbed in
English, and all its attendant merchandising the biggest children's
pop-culture phenomenon in ages is still a secret of the grammar
school set. But the animation, with its rich colors and stylized
angles, is fun to watch and at times does seem like a psychedelic
``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's plot is a simple variation of ``Frankenstein'' with
James Bond accents. In an isolated laboratory on New Island, evil
scientists have bioengineered a new version of the rarest of all
Pokemon, Mew (which appears to be a flying cat with no mouth). What
they get is Mewtwo, ``the most powerful Pokemon of all,'' about 10
times the size of the original and 50 times as mean.
</P>
<P>
   Mewtwo is angry with its creators for bringing it into the world
with no purpose, so it crashes through a lot of glass and sets fire
to the lab and chases the humans away. Then it lures the best young
Pokemon trainers and their Pokemon to the island for a
mean-spirited showdown of clones versus originals. (Mewtwo, being a
fast learner, has cloned all the visiting Pokemon.) As children
well know, nobody actually dies in Pokemon world; a battle is won
when one monster knocks the other unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   One of the young Pokemon trainers involved is, of course, Ash,
the 12-year-old hero of the ``Pokemon'' television series on the WB
network. He and his friends Misty and Brock turn up on New Island
with Pikachu and others. Ash's Rocket team of archenemies,
consisting of a red-haired girl named Jessie, a purple-haired boy
named James and a Pokemon named Meowth who talks a lot like Top Cat
(in fact, he's the only Pokemon who can talk, I'm told) _ are not
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the Pokemon do battle and characters spout
pacifist profundities. ``A Pokemon's real strength comes from the
heart,'' says one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just proves that fighting is wrong,'' says another.
``Someone's got to take a stand. Someone's got to say no and refuse
to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   As these words of wisdom are spoken, pairs of monsters large and
small continue to punch each other silly.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has been written about the admirable lessons that Pokemon
teaches children about responsibility, teamwork and obedience. But
some unfortunate messages are being sent as well. Take the scene in
which the harbor master tells all the young trainers that the boat
to New Island has been canceled because there's a terrible storm at
sea and it's not safe. A select few of the children head into the
storm anyway and make it to the island, where they are praised as
the only true young masters. Back at the harbor, the woman in
charge is admiring, too. ``They follow their hearts,'' she tells an
employee. ``That's what sets them apart. To them it's just another
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, challenges are always character-building, but this
``Pokemon'' scene endorses a reckless prove-yourself attitude, the
kind that leads inexperienced young pilots, for instance, to fly at
night in low visibility. Parents may want to point that out.
</P>

   HOLLYWOOD _ A brief note buried in the program of the theater
production here of ``Marry Me a Little,'' with songs by Stephen
Sondheim, says, ``Permission to change gender for the production of
`Marry Me a Little' has been made with the author's prior and
express written consent.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, Sondheim has allowed the 70-seat Celebration
Theater to stage a musical that was originally written for a man
and woman to be played instead by two men. The work, which was
presented in New York in the 1980s, is a compilation of Sondheim
songs built around a story of two lonely people on a Saturday night
living in Apartments 4B and 5B in a building on Manhattan's West
Side. The songs had been cut from previous Sondheim musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim did not want to discuss why he gave the Celebration
Theater, which presents gay-oriented plays, permission to alter a
character's sex, said one of his associates. The original show,
conceived and developed by Craig Lucas and Norman Rene, has
received strong reviews in The Los Angeles Times, The Hollywood
Reporter and other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What emerges is a thoughtful, touching and charming show that
attains all of the complexities of the essential early Sondheim,''
said The Hollywood Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gideon, who performs the musical with Craig Curtis,
suggested making it a two-man show about two years ago after
thumbing through his record collection and finding the original
recording. Gideon had seen the male-female version in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of romantic love is so much a part of gay culture,
I thought, why not put two men in it,'' Gideon said. ``I never
thought Sondheim would allow us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Brenner, the director, who has staged productions in New
York, Los Angeles and Canada, said the most significant change he
made in the show had nothing to do with the characters' sex. The
original show, he said, ended on a bleak and unhappy note, with the
lonely characters never meeting although they lived only one floor
apart. The current show ends on a far more upbeat note, with the
two meeting for a split second on the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   The director said he was especially gratified that the show was
not simply appealing to gay audiences and that a hefty portion of
ticket buyers were heterosexual couples. ``There are universal
themes here of loneliness and finding a partner that touch
everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner and Gideon said that Sondheim's licensing
representatives had not allowed the team to integrate some other
unused Sondheim songs that might have been more appropriate for the
current production. The two said they hoped that Sondheim and Lucas
would see the show, or even a videotape of it, and then decide to
allow them to bring in some different songs. (Rene died in 1996.)
The show, which opened two weeks ago, is scheduled to end in early
December, but the heavy ticket demand may prolong it.
</P>
<P>
   Gideon said that some of the Sondheim songs cut from shows like
``Company,'' ``Sweeney Todd'' and ``Anyone Can Whistle'' moved
audiences in ``Marry Me.'' ``Sondheim's sentimental and jaded all
at once, and you sing these songs and audiences are so responsive
to them,'' he said.

   Scottsdale Resort Joins a Golf Mecca
</P>
<P>
   When the golfer Tom Weiskopf and the course architect Jay
Morrish opened Troon North, their desert course in Scottsdale,
Ariz., in 1990, it soon became one of the country's top-rated
courses. One round there shows why: whatever handicap a golfer
plays to, he or she will be challenged but not overwhelmed. And the
course's condition, natural setting and customer service draw
praise in golfer surveys _ even with greens fees peaking at around
$250. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the original layout (now called the Monument) was joined
by another Tom Weiskopf design, the Pinnacle course. And on Dec. 15
the landscape will get another addition with the opening of the
210-room Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the 40-acre property will have a view of Pinnacle Peak
and access to half the tee times at the Troon North course open to
public play that day (each day one course is set aside for club
members only); Four Seasons guests will know which course they can
play when they reserve. Resort guests pay the full greens fees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standard rooms _ spread out in 25 one- and two-story casitas _
will have landscaped patios, separate tub and shower, two-line
speaker phones and hookups for laptops. The patios in the 22 suites
will be outfitted with a private plunge pool, shower, and gas
fireplace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other resort amenities will include a full-service spa, four
tennis courts (two lighted for night play), a fitness center and a
pool. There will be three restaurants. Rates for standard rooms
start at $475, suites from $850. The Four Seasons is at 10600 East
Crescent Moon Drive in Scottsdale; (480) 515-5700, fax (480)
515-5599.

   In the Alps, Precautions Against Avalanches
</P>
<P>
   After avalanches last February killed dozens of skiers and
villagers in Switzerland, Austria and France, authorities in those
countries have strengthened precautions against such disasters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, the Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche
Research in Davos began a series of works in cooperation with Swiss
cantons and villages. Over the summer, the height of several
deflection dams was increased, hazard maps were redrawn in a few
Alpine towns, and 15 new early-warning stations were placed on
Alpine peaks, bringing the total to 60. A revamped Internet site
now provides up-to-date information on avalanche warnings, traffic
blocks and detours, and safe ski areas.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In France, some avalanche barriers were repaired and additional
ones built in Montroc, on the slopes of Mont Blanc, where an
avalanche took 12 lives. But Francois Sivardiere, director of the
French Association for Snow and Avalanche study in Grenoble, said
that French resorts have been maintaining and adapting their
artificial avalanche release systems and information systems for
years, and that in most French ski areas improvements this summer
were not a result of the most recent avalanches.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rudi Mair, who heads the avalanche protection system for the
Avalanche Warning Service of the Tyrol, in Innsbruck, Austria, said
that the deaths have prompted a number of improvements in the
Tyrol, where some of the worst avalanches took place.
</P>
<P>
   Above Galtur, a village at the entrance to the Paznauntal
Valley, where 38 people died on Feb. 23, an avalanche dam was built
as a barrier. Even higher above the village, construction has begun
on larger steel fencelike constructions. Three automatic weather
stations were installed, raising the total in the area to 28. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, Mair said, even a sophisticated warning system and
extensive barriers are no guarantee. ``Even with all the technology
and computers in the world,'' he said, ``it is impossible to know
exactly at which moment and in which place an avalanche will be
released.'' &QL;

   National Trust Offers A Guide to Winter Sites
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Britain have a new guide to historic sites that are
accessible in winter. Out and About with the National Trust in
Winter contains information about more than 100 National Trust
properties that will remain open from November through March, in
many cases for the first time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the London suburb of Hampstead, 2 Willow Road _
one of Britain's most important examples of Modernist architecture,
designed in 1939 and lived in by the Hungarian-born architect Erno
Goldfinger _ traditionally closes in the winter, but this year
groups of five people or more may tour the house by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 9, a guided walk of places in Hampstead linked with the
Modernist Movement plus a tour of the house will be offered.
Reservations are required; telephone (44-171) 435-6166. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Trust is also organizing what it calls ``putting to
bed'' days at over 20 sites, including the 17th-century Petworth
House 50 miles south of London on Nov. 26 (the cost is $9,
including tea) and Powis Castle in Wales on Nov. 20, 21, 27 and 28
($20, including hot punch).
</P>
<P>
   Visitors interested in the routine conservation work that goes
on in historic houses can watch housekeeping staff members
demonstrate the huge task of cleaning that goes on during the
months that the properties are closed to the public, and how a
house's contents are protected and inspected to monitor damage
caused by dust, light and humidity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Copies of ``Out and About in Winter'' and a schedule of
putting-to-bed days, as well as lists of Christmas meals, walks
during Christmas week, Winter Events, Autumn and Winter Color, and
Spring Flowers, are available free of charge from the National
Trust, Post Office Box 39, Bromley, Kent BR1 3XL; (44-181)
315-1111. More information: www.nationaltrust.org.uk.

   Newark Keeps Tibetan Artistry Alive
</P>
<P>
   As part of its 90th anniversary celebration, the Newark Museum
has put its celebrated trove of Tibetan art on lavish display. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Sacred Realm: Treasures of Tibetan Art in the
Collection of the Newark Museum,'' on view through Jan. 20,
showcases 300 artifacts from the 13th century through the 20th,
including many recent additions to its core collection. It is the
largest exhibition of secular and ritual Tibetan works ever mounted
in the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show begins in two first-floor galleries with a section
called Mountains and Valleys, Castles and Tents that presents the
jewelry, clothing and personal effects of nomads, farmers,
landowners and aristocrats in traditional settings. On one end of
the spectrum, two appliqued ``fair weather'' tents from the 1930s
demonstrate how well-to-do Tibetans shielded themselves from the
sun during festivals, and on the other end a yak-hair tent
illustrates how nomads lived. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In seven renovated second-floor galleries, a section called
Temples and Courtyards focuses on Tibetan Buddhism and features
scroll paintings; sculptures; a 19th-century regent's cape made
from peacock feather thread and adorned with pearls, sable,
turquoise and gold medallions; a 15th-century gilt-wood Ga'u, or
shrine, highlighted with metalwork, monastic furniture and medieval
ritual textiles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum's Tibetan Buddhist Altar, hand-constructed and
painted by the Tibetan artist Phuntsok Dorje in the 1980s and
consecrated by the 14th Dalai Lama in 1990, has been given a new
entrance foyer by Dorje for this exhibition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum's Tibetan collection had its genesis in a chance
meeting on a steamship between a medical missionary who lived in
Asia early this century and a museum trustee who persuaded him to
lend his art for an exhibition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum, at 49 Washington Street, is open Wednesday through
Sunday. Admission is free. Information: (973) 596-6550 or (800)
768-7386. &QL;

<P>
   FARRELL-DANCE (Undated) _ ``You see her yield completely,
fainting with a soft abandon in a supported deep back bend, and
before you see the recovery, she is already standing apart, mild
and free, as if in thought.'' The dancer was the teenage Suzanne
Farrell, in 1964. The writer was Edwin Denby, one of the great
chroniclers of the New York City Ballet, where Ms. Farrell danced.
The ballet he wrote about was ``Meditation,'' created for her by
George Balanchine, whose choosing of the young dancer as his muse
was to become a central metaphor in the lives of Ms. Farrell,
Balanchine and American ballet. Now Ms. Farrell, who retired from
the stage in 1989, has become a muse of another sort. Since 1993,
she has taught summer master classes at the Kennedy Center in
Washington. By Jennifer Dunning. Photo.

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WAR-ZONE-FILM (New York) _ The actor, Tim Roth's directorial
debut, ``The War Zone,'' is to open in the United States on Dec.
10. Based on the British writer Stuart Alexander's unsettling novel
about a father's sexual relationship with his teenage daughter, the
film is an unflinching, thoroughly wrenching adaptation of an
already disturbing story. By David Bahr.
</P>
<P>
   EMILY-WATSON-FILMS (Undated) _ Judging from her cinematic
repertory, one might think that the actress Emily Watson would be
tiny, vulnerable, an imperiled sprite of a woman. Her roles _ the
tormented young wife of a paraplegic in the 1997 film ``Breaking
the Waves''; the volcanic, terminally ill cellist Jacqueline du Pre
in ``Hilary and Jackie''; the impoverished Irish housewife in
``Angela's Ashes,'' opening Dec. 22 _ seem to call for someone
small whose intellectual and spiritual presence eventually
dominates the room. Surely, Ms. Watson must be tiny, doll-like and
fragile in real life, too. But she turns out to be a beanstalk,
more than 5-foot-9 in sneakers. By Alex Kuczynski. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SLEEPY-HOLLOW-FILM (New York) _ Tim Burton, in his suite at the
Regency Hotel here, after a day of interviews to promote his new
film, ``Sleepy Hollow,'' appears to be equal parts funeral
director, mad scientist and Swifty Lazar. He does not mind jokes
about his hair looking as if it has been combed with a Mixmaster.
He's just glad he has a head. By the end of his new film, so few
cast members do. Based on Washington Irving's classic ``The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow,'' this film is Burton's chance to make the kind
of semi-cheesy horror films produced by Hammer Films in England in
the 1950s and '60s so revered by hipsters today. By Frank DeCaro.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-FILM (New York) _ ``I feel good about the work,'' said
Denzel Washington, seated at one of the prime banquettes in Jean
Georges restaurant at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. That film is
``The Hurricane,'' based on the story of Rubin (Hurricane) Carter,
the middleweight boxer who spent 19 years in New Jersey prisons for
murders he insisted he did not commit, until a federal judge
overturned his conviction and freed him. The film will be released
by Universal Studios on Dec. 29 in New York and Los Angeles to
qualify for Academy Award consideration. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-ENDINGS (Undated) _ Movies used to end. Audiences knew
the end was near when two lovers walked into a sunset, a cowpoke
rode off into a sunset, or Gloria Swanson descended the stairs in
her mansion on Sunset Boulevard. For those who couldn't take a
hint, filmmakers invariably flashed the phrase ``THE END.'' Like a
bartender flipping the lights on after last call, ``THE END'' told
moviegoers to beat it, pal. Such endings provided a punctuation
mark, finality, what Oprah acolytes call closure. But now ``THE
END'' is in foreclosure. Movies dribble out their final moments
like an NBA point guard trying to kill the clock. By Franz Lidz and
Steve Rushin.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-MOVIES (Undated) _ Who doesn't love the holiday movies?
Who can watch ``It's a Wonderful Life'' and not feel a surge of
exultation when the friends of the desperate George Bailey pour
into his home, and we see all the good he has done in his life
abundantly repaid? Such moments leave us all aglow, reassured that
in a world of tribulation, it is possible to find good will among
men. By Jamie Malanowski.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BOULEZ-MUSIC (Undated) _ Pierre Boulez will probably never shake
off the reputation he earned in his 20s as a fearsome polemicist on
behalf of the most complex contemporary music, including his own.
He emerged from Europe in the 1950s as the leading advocate of the
post-Webern school of serialism, or 12-tone music, or _ to use the
term Boulez preferred in his theoretical writings _ dodecaphonic
music. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   SMETANA-MUSIC (Undated) _ Bedrich Smetana's music seems split
between public and private sectors. ``The Bartered Bride'' and ``Ma
Vlast'' are household names in every musical family, but how many
of us know that this 19th-century Bohemian composer wrote
two-thirds of his 300 compositions for the piano and that an awful
lot of them are polkas? More than 30 pieces are called just that,
and many more are polkas in everything but name. By Bernard
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STAN-FREBERG-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ In the symphony of famous
comic voices, Stan Freberg's is a Stradivarius. To see his rubber
mouth, off-center jaw and wild eyes in person _ and hear that
sonorous, ever-shifting voice _ is to remember hours and years of
laughter that began in his head and went straight to your ear, and
belly. Now 73, Freberg is the grand old satirist of radio and
records. He began his career in the 1950s by puncturing the
stifling conventions of the Eisenhower era and lampooning the
prevailing pop-culture effluvia of everything from ``Dragnet'' to
the wailing androgynous singer Johnnie Ray. By Todd S. Purdum.

</P>
<P>
   DR.-DRE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Andre Young, better known as Dr. Dre,
hasn't exactly been silent since he released his first solo album,
``The Chronic,'' in 1992. He produced Snoop Doggy Dogg's debut
album, Tupac Shakur's ``All Eyez on Me,'' and Eminem's ``The Slim
Shady LP,'' all multimillion sellers, while rapping on their albums
and co-starring in their video clips. But on his new album, ``Dr.
Dre 2001'' (Interscope 069490486), Dr. Dre sounds defensive, as if
he's worried that hip-hop considers him a has-been. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VAN-DYCK-ART (Undated) _ Anthony Van Dyck's portraits, which
dominate an exhibition at the Royal Academy until Dec. 10 in London
on the 400th anniversary of his birth, provide marvelous company
while delivering a bit of a millennial comeuppance. Who knew that
portraits made in the early 16th century could feel quite so
immediate and of the moment? By Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   EGYPT-IN-BOSTON (Boston) _ ``Egypt in Boston'' is what five of

 &HT;    Everything and the kitchen sink: Amazon increases offerings
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazon.com has it all this holiday season, from the
hottest best seller to quite literally, the kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the online retailer announced the addition of four more
product categories to its ever-growing list of offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, customers will be able to buy software and
video games from Amazon as well as a selection of home improvement
supplies ranging from painting supplies to hammers, drills and
welding materials. To do this it acquired the catalog business of
North Dakota-based Tool Crib of the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of the company as we've been saying tirelessly
over the years is to find and discover anything you want,'' said
Jaleh Bisharat, Amazon's marketing vice president. ``Just like
Nordstrom evolved from being just a shoe store to a major
department store.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the offline shopping experience could be vastly
improved,'' says Bisharat. ``The novice doesn't know what to do
with tools,'' she says, adding that customer information in
hardware and home improvement centers such as Home Depot or Lowe's
is often confusing for many shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go online to a place like Amazon.com, there are
customer reviews, editorial reviews and users have the ability to
click on the top selling items and read more about them,'' she
says. ``In the case of video games and software, we are licensing
product reviews. All these factors contribute to the user being
able to shop here with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise that Amazon is continuing to add categories
to their site,'' says Jupiter Communications analyst Mike May.
``They've got a core group of buyers they've paid a great deal of
money to acquire and now they've got to defray those expense across
as many product categories as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   May says that Amazon's foray into the home improvement sector
has one advantage over bricks and mortar companies such as Home
Depot, Sears or even the local hardware store. ``They don't have to
sell every item a Home Depot has to stock,'' May says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sweet spot for Amazon won't be screws or nails, but some
of the higher ticket purchases like tools, like power drills,
electric screwdrivers or wrench sets. If consumers recognize these
brands and trust Amazon as a retailer they may be likely to buy
them online.'' May says the new home improvement site isn't for the
do-it-yourselfer looking to add a deck onto his or her home. He
believes it's for the homeowner or renter that needs a power drill
or the tools to hang a wall lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where Amazon is hoping its strategy jells,'' he says.
``They want to be able to add any product line and sell it to their
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   However, selling tools, even brand name tools, will be tough.
``You can sell a book to the hammer buyer,'' he says, but it will
be much harder to sell the hammer to the book buyer.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia on Tuesday sought to cut off Chechnya from the
outside world by banning foreign trade with the breakaway republic
and suspending international flights to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the measures are
needed to stop arms smuggling and to prevent Islamic terrorists
from flocking to the north Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   But the blockade is also likely to increase the suffering of
Chechnya's civilians, who have already been subjected to air and
artillery attacks by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The new measures come a week before a summit meeting of world
leaders in Istanbul about security, organized by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The meeting is likely to
focus on Chechnya and on Russia's military buildup in the Caucasus.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin plans to attend the meeting, a
spokesman for the group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During its six-week military campaign, Russia has occupied the
northern third of Chechnya and advanced toward its capital, Grozny.
Russia's increasingly pugnacious generals have demanded that the
country's politicians give them a free hand and have said that it
is simply a matter of time before the troops move into Grozny
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions Russia imposed Tuesday are intended to isolate
Chechen militants, and the Chechen authorities, who are unable to
control them.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new controls, Russia banned the import of all foreign
goods to Chechnya. To enforce this restriction, Russia ordered that
all ships entering the Caspian Sea port of Makhachkala in Dagestan
be searched.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also suspended flights between cities in southern Russia
and nations in the Caucasus and Middle East, insisting that Chechen
sympathizers have been using the flights to smuggle arms and sneak
terrorists into the southern region. One of the rebel leaders is
thought to be from the Middle East. There has been no direct air
travel to Chechnya since Russian warplanes bombed the one airport
near Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is halting flights between southern Russia and Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey, the United Arab
Emirates, Iran, Syria, Qatar, Cyprus, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
Airlines from those nations will still be allowed to fly to Moscow,
where their passengers will be carefully checked.
</P>
<P>
   Further tightening its controls, Russia ordered that all
foreigners visiting Chechnya and the nearby republics of Dagestan,
Ingushetia and North Ossetia be scrutinized by its security
services. The number of visas granted to foreigners to visit this
region will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   But the steps Russia has presented as a sensible military
precaution, Chechens say, will only make life harder for the
Chechen people and add to the instability in the north Caucasus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Georgia and Azerbaijan have already expressed concern that
Russia is impeding the travel of their citizens to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia decreed last week that that Georgians and Azerbaijanis
who want to come to Russia will need visas, a new requirement for
the residents of the former Soviet republics. Russia imposed the
visa requirement after Georgia refused to allow Russian troops to
take up positions along the Georgia-Chechnya border.
</P>
<P>
   The tough Russian policy has been spearheaded by Putin and is
broadly supported by the Russian public. But Russia's tactics have
come under increasing criticism in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department charged Monday that Russia's attacks in
Chechnya are indiscriminate and violate the Geneva Convention,
which is designed to protect civilians. On Tuesday, President
Clinton, as he has before, urged Russia to seek a negotiated
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and the rest of the world _ the more we ask,
the more likely it is to occur at a sooner date,'' Clinton said.
``No country wants to be seen as giving in to pressure from another
country. But I think they are listening.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, few Russians seem to be listening to that
message. Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko
Party, is one of only a handful of Russian politicians who have
called for an end to the fighting and for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, for his part, has watched his popularity ratings climb as
he has rebuffed the West. Under Western pressure, he has opened the
Ingushetia-Chechnya border so that trapped civilians could leave
and agreed to allow observers from the European security
organization to visit the region.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no sign that Russia will slow its military
campaign, which began after Islamic militants from Chechnya invaded
Dagestan and were accused by Russian leaders of being behind
bombings in Moscow and other Russian cities. Russia has already
deployed 100,000 troops in and around Chechnya and is sending more.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has even said that Russia should be prepared to do without
Western money if forced to choose between receiving financial
assistance and prosecuting its war in Chechnya. That is a choice
the United States has not sought to impose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to decide for ourselves what we want: to get credits
to buy lollipops or agree to an annexation of our territory from
the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea,'' Putin told a Russian audience
recently. ``You and I live in the East, not the West.''

BUSH VOWS TO OVERHAUL VA, PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SENECA, S.C. _ George W. Bush, building his Republican
presidential campaign's firewall against the growing strength of
John McCain, toured military-heavy South Carolina on Tuesday with
promises to overhaul Veterans Affairs and protect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love America a lot. I love what our country stands for ...
I'm running out of pride of country,'' Bush told a standing-room
only crowd of about 300 at an American Legion hut. ``I'm running to
earn the confidence of the people of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   With the elderly and retired military personnel making up a
large portion of South Carolina's Republican vote, Bush has
repeatedly hit on military issues during his four campaign swings
through the state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former prisoner of war in North Vietnam, has carved
out New Hampshire and South Carolina as his battlegrounds in the
GOP race, which is beginning to shape up as a contest between the
Texas governor and the senator from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Recent public opinion polls in New Hampshire have shown McCain
making progress against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he understands why ``people like John'' and expressed
his respect. But Bush said that being a war hero alone is not
enough to sell voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans in the past have looked at great war heroes such as
George H.W. Bush and Robert Dole and made other decisions,'' Bush
said. ``The only thing I know to do is talk about what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father lost his re-election bid in 1992. Dole, the 1996
GOP presidential nominee, lost the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary has a habit of giving front-runners a
scare and contenders a boost. If McCain makes a good showing or
wins in New Hampshire, the South Carolina contest 18 days later
could be a crucial test.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign hopes to break McCain's efforts to overtake him
by the Feb. 19 South Carolina primary. Bush then hopes to use his
campaign's financial advantage to lock up the Republican
presidential nomination when 12 states hold primaries March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is well ahead of (McCain) here and is going to
stay well ahead of him,'' said former South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, a Bush supporter. ``South Carolina has generally been the
winnowing-out state as we go forward into the primaries, and we'll
winnow it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain national field director Trey Walker, a South Carolina
native, said he believes McCain is gaining ground in South Carolina
just as he is in New Hampshire. There have been no public opinion
polls in South Carolina since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain wins in New Hampshire, I don't think it is out of
the question that we can maintain that momentum in South
Carolina,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said a victory in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
primary Feb. 1 would improve McCain's campaign financing, even
though ``it will be a scramble.'' But he said a victory in both
states over Bush would give McCain a major boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain will be the story, the buzz everywhere,'' Walker
said. ``Money can't buy that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has targeted his South Carolina speeches at the more
than 400,000 military veterans living in the state that also is
home to five major military installations. He outlined his national
defense policy at a speech in September at The Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   With Veterans Day approaching, Bush promised Tuesday to overhaul
the Veterans Affairs health and benefits programs from ``top to
bottom'' if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said more than 500,000 disability cases are backlogged and
that health-care claims become lost in the massive bureaucracy.
Bush also said a 1994 law ought to be fully implemented to give
health-care benefits to soldiers suffering from Gulf War syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers once ordered by their government to stand in the line
of fire should not now be ordered to stand in line at the nearest
bureaucracy with hat in hand,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sounded similar themes in a speech to a maritime services
support group Tuesday in Chesapeake, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The military needs to offer higher pay and better benefits to
get people to join and stay in the service, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The all-volunteer force has not failed us. We failed the
all-volunteer force,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in Seneca, Bush told a crowd of mostly older people that
he wants to protect Social Security from efforts to use the money
for other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the money coming from the payroll tax that's supposed to
be going to Social Security needs to be going to one thing as far
as I'm concerned, and that's Social Security,'' Bush said, also
promoting retirement savings accounts for younger people.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mingled with his audiences, shaking hands. But he did not
take questions from voters as he had last week in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got laughs from his audiences Tuesday by poking fun at his
failure to name several world leaders during a reporter's pop quiz
last week. Bush said as he was leaving Austin, Texas, his wife,
Laura, told him he shouldn't ``show off, naming all those leaders
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore continued his jesting of Bush on the quiz
interview, reciting a litany of names of foreign leaders unknown to
most Americans in a tongue-in-cheek monologue on Don Imus's radio
show.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Payden Woodruff Jr., 75, of Pickens said she was not
bothered by Bush's inability to answer the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that the media is picking on him,'' Woodruff
said. ``I like him. I liked his father. I think he's a good man and
has good morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the South Carolinians attending Bush's events Tuesday
said they liked him because the governor reminded them of his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked his daddy George, and I think they pretty much have
the same ideas and are decent people,'' said Charles Powell, 62, a
retired bricklayer from Pickens. ``Tell that man to stay honest
with himself and the people and he'll be a winner.''

 &HT;    Mixed reactions greet home improvement announcement
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazon.com's plan to sell home improvement goods is
the latest to kick up dust on Home Depot's path to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ended speculation that Amazon.com might partner with
Atlanta-based Home Depot. The companies had held ``very casual''
discussions about an Internet alliance, a Home Depot spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Tuesday's announcement was mixed. Some analysts were
hoping that a partnership would give Home Depot access to
Amazon.com's large online customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement that Amazon.com will supply home improvement
materials was a disappointment because some people were hoping that
Home Depot would be partnered with Amazon,'' said Howard Ward,
manager of the $2.2 billion Gabelli Growth Fund. The fund owned 1.4
million Home Depot shares as of June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's stock closed Tuesday at $78.12 1/2, down $1. The
stock had been as low as $76.31 1/4 before recovering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Home Depot brand is insurmountable, in my opinion'' said
analyst Aram Rubinson of PaineWebber. ``This is not going to have
any impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, home improvement goods have been slow to take
off on the Internet. But lately, a pack of retailers have started
selling online while the top two home improvement companies develop
their strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot and Lowe's Cos., delaying their sales launches, plan
to start selling products on their Web sites in the first half of

   Analysts have seemed content with Home Depot's conservative
pace.

   ``When companies don't take their time, they do what Toys R Us
did and have their (Web) sites crash,'' Rubinson said. He was
referring to a report Monday that shoppers were blocked from the
retailer's site when a toy promotion created an unexpected surge in
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement category is one of the most crowded on the
Internet. Companies such as Hardware.com, Homewarehouse.com and
Buildscape.com. have recently joined the fray.

   Meanwhile, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. is ramping up its Web presence.
Sears, which has been selling appliances and Craftsman tools
online, plans to add other top brand tools later this month.

<P>
   Last week, Sears kicked off a marketing campaign for its Web
site. TV commercials show a 1950s-era family peering at appliances
through a store window. The scene moves to a modern family looking
at the sears.com Web site on a computer screen.

 &HT;    For technical writers, script is open-ended
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few years ago, Jeff Haas had a hunch.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with a degree in English from the University of
Chicago and landing a job writing business proposals, Haas bet he
could pen his own Information Age success story. He left the Windy
City, headed for Atlanta and began authoring his story.
</P>
<P>
   Haas' hunch paid off. In fact, authoring, or technical writing,
is his story. The founder and president of Haas Consulting Inc. in
Duluth, Ga., now works as a technical communication consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Combining his background in composition and language with a
longtime interest in computers and technology, Haas is one of the
increasing number of technical writers at work in one of the
nation's top markets for technical communication.
</P>
<P>
   As Atlanta grows and distinguishes itself in high technology,
the ranks and demand for technical writers swell at the same pace.
</P>
<P>
   Technical communication isn't about writing dry instruction
manuals anymore. As companies jump on the Information Superhighway,
the technical writer serves as ``translator,'' taking the high-tech
jargon of software and hardware makers and making it comprehensible
to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software companies hire me basically to work with their
software developers in order to explain how to use their
products,'' Haas says. ``Basically, I author online documents that
explain technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Authoring is as varied as the media it serves. Online help,
online books, computer-based training and getting-started manuals
are all examples of the work of a technical writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still write manuals, but most of those manuals are moving
online,'' says Haas. ``It's been a big shift over my career from
totally paper to totally online.''
</P>
<P>
   The job is varied. In addition to actual writing _ which
averages some 40 percent of a technical writer's duties _ it often
entails project management, document design and editing.
</P>
<P>
   The software tools of the trade include Word, RoboHelp and
FrameMaker. Technical writers must have an intimate understanding
of these programs, says Haas, who is a past president of the
Atlanta chapter of the Society for Technical Communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always recommend people be an expert in one of them and be
very familiar with all three,'' he says. ``If you're an expert in
all three, you can name your own price. There's close to 100
percent employment in Atlanta for technical writers.''
</P>
<P>
   It pays well, too. According to the 1999 STC Technical
Communicator Salary Survey, the median salary for technical
communicators is $47,560 for the United States, $45,000 in the
Southeast and $48,000 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very lucrative way to use your writing to make money.
In the business world, there aren't that many places for English
and journalism majors to land. Technical writing is a very
lucrative place to land,'' says Haas.
</P>
<P>
   He knows this firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   After working in Atlanta for Unisys for some 10 years, Haas went
out on his own in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really got into more online development. That's what I'm
doing exclusively.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas started by doing contract work through other agencies.
That's a route many writers take. The average hourly rate for
Atlanta contractors is $29 an hour, says Haas.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years since starting his consulting firm, Haas has
charged as much as $60 an hour for his services.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta average for consultants is $44 an hour, with some
charging as much as $100 for critical and time-sensitive projects,
Haas says.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for a career in technical communication, you can
train yourself, Haas says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a `RoboHelp for Dummies,' '' Haas laughs. ``When that
came out, I figured we had made it in the business world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Haas advises going to classes for formal training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays there are technical communication degrees. There are
Ph.D.-level degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Local colleges such as Georgia Tech, Georgia State and Southern
Polytechnic offer courses in authoring.
</P>
<P>
   Continuous training is imperative, as well. ``Things are always
changing. We learn new applications almost on a weekly basis,''
says Haas.
</P>
<P>
   Professional organizations and professional journals help
writers keep up.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the variety of work assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always interesting new technology to write about,''
says Haas, who typically works on one long-term assignment at a
time. ``I don't get stale because I'm going from place to place
meeting new people and learning new things.''

SENATE APPROVES BUSINESS TAX BREAKS, $1 MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate passed a Republican-sponsored measure
Tuesday that would give tax breaks to businesses and implement a $1
minimum wage increase, but spread the hike over three years.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-44 vote approving the measure, containing $18.4 billion
in business tax breaks, came after Republicans defeated another
Democratic-sponsored amendment that would have raised the current
minimum wage of $5.15 an hour to $6.15 by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal, offered by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachussetts, also would have provided $9.6 billion in more
targeted tax relief for small businesses, but it was voted down
50-48.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the Republican measure, offered by Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., a ``non-starter'' and threatened a veto if
it passes the House.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee began marking up similar
legislation Tuesday that contains $30 billion in tax cuts over 10
years for businesses that could be hard-hit by having to increase
the hourly wage of their workers. That measure could come up in the
House for a vote this week.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are Clinton won't have to exercise his veto
authority on the issue anytime soon, since the House and Senate are
unlikely to agree on a final minimum wage measure until sometime
next year. The Senate measure approved Tuesday also is attached to
a controversial bankruptcy bill that is bogged down and may not
pass this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the Republicans of using the minimum wage
measure ``as a cynical tool to advance special interest tax breaks
that aren't paid for and do little to help working families.'' He
said he would not allow the bill to become law ``in its current
form'' even if it does make it through both houses of Congress next
year because it contains a ``poison pill'' provision that would gut
U.S. law on overtime pay standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should pass clean legislation that boosts the minimum
wage by one dollar over the next two years and simply restores the
value of the minimum wage to what it was in 1982,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans countered that the Kennedy measure favored by
Clinton, while providing tax relief on a limited basis, would have
actually raised taxes by closing some corporate loopholes and
punishing polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici contended that the Democratic bill hurt some
businesses, making it more difficult for them to keep minimum wage
earners employed. He said his alternative would help save small
businesses, allowing them ``to grow and prosper'' while increasing
the wage of their workers.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan includes a health insurance tax deduction for
workers who don't have employer-provided coverage and an immediate
100 percent deduction for the self-employed who buy their own
insurance. The measure also would increase the deduction for
business meals from 50 percent to 80 percent. It raises the
contribution limit for 401(k) and other retirement plans as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy measure includes a number of items also designed to
help businesses, including tax credits for employer-provided child
care programs. There also were deductions for new business startup
costs, new market investments and for wages paid to workers in poor
areas designated as empowerment zones.
</P>
<P>
   However, the main difference between the Republican and
Democratic plans, in addition to the size and targeting of their
competing tax cuts, was the phase-in period of the $1 hourly wage
increase. The Republican plan would have phased in the dollar raise
in three, roughly equal installments, beginning with a 35 cent
increase in March of 2000, followed by similar increases in 2001
and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan would have phased in the raise as well, but
it would have been fully implemented by March of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy called the GOP plan a ``sham'' that would ``water down''
any potential benefit from the raise by spreading it over three
years and reducing the amount of earnings used in figuring overtime
pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's much of a bargain for working families,''
the senator said, accusing the Republicans of trying to use the
minimum wage as a ``cynical'' ploy to attract more support in next
year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cynical appeal to the public to indicate a concern for
those Americans that are on the lower end of the economic ladder,
but still have a great sense of pride and sense of dignity in their
work ...This is a complete sham and not worthy of its name as an
increase in the minimum wage,'' Kennedy declared.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum-wage issue has long been used as political stick by
Democrats to beat up on Republicans, who have generally opposed
raising the hourly rate because they believe that it hurts the
ability of some businesses to hire entry-level workers.
</P>
<P>
   But with control of Congress resting in a handful of close races
next year, Republicans sought to turn the tables on the Democrats
by using the issue to blunt their criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said his bill allowed Republicans to vote in favor of a
wage increase and at the same time deliver on their pledge to cut
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just seemed like the right combination as far as pulling
Republicans together,'' Domenici said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., seemed to
suggest that business tax relief included in the bill was more
important than increasing the minimum wage paid to some 11 million
U.S. workers, most of them under the age of 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main focus is to make sure that we have some tax breaks ...
for small (businesses) and the self-employed that will have to bear
the brunt of the cost of the increased minimum wage,'' he told
reporters before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Kennedy's criticism of the measure, Lott said: ``I
don't think it's cynical. I think it's sensitive to what's really
happening in the real world with small-business men and women, and
entry-level workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they still plan to press the issue in next year's
campaigns for Congress and the presidency and would try to force a
vote on a new bill before the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost this round, but we'll be back,'' said Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``I'd hate to be a Republican senator in
a close race and vote against minimum wage next year.''

MUSLIM CLERIC TURNS THE TABLE ON HIS ACCUSERS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ After the first 10 days of a trial that has
transfixed Iran, a prominent Muslim cleric who is accused of
betraying the Islamic revolution has infuriated the ruling
hierarchy by using the courtroom as a pulpit to promote the
democratic principles that caused him to be put on trial in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric is Abdullah Nouri, one of the most popular of a new
generation of reform-minded politicians. He has, in effect, turned
the courtroom into a seminar, not only on democratic freedoms, but
also on the question of whether Islamic teachings are compatible
with a society that elects its governments, tolerates freedom of
speech and respects human rights.
</P>
<P>
   That question underlies the political debate here, as it does in
many parts of the Islamic world. Speaking with an intellectual
nimbleness that has appeared to overwhelm the judge and prosecutor,
the 50-year-old cleric has dominated the hearing, to the point that
the judge, Mohammed Salimi, was driven in exasperation Tuesday to
remind the court that it was Nouri who was on trial, not the ruling
clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to remind you that the purpose of this court is not to
provide the accused with a platform to cross-question those who sit
in judgment on him,'' Salimi, himself a Muslim cleric, said after
interrupting one of Nouri's monologues.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It is the court's right to hear the evidence, review
it and pronounce a verdict. If we listen to what Mr. Nouri has to
say, it is not because we agree with him, it is only because we are
prepared to give him a hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, in his 30s, appeared to be responding to harsh
criticism from newspapers controlled by clerical hard-liners, some
of which have implied that Nouri has been allowed to hijack the
trial with his lengthy, often eloquent discourses on democratic
values.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers have called for the trial to be cut short, as
happened last year when another leading political reformer,
Gholamhossein Karbaschi, who was the mayor of Tehran, turned his
trial, much of it carried on Iranian television, into a showcase
for the reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   Karbaschi was convicted on corruption charges, which many
Iranians regarded as dubious, and sentenced to two years in jail
and a 10-year ban on political activity.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri, a hojatolislam, or cleric of the second-highest rank
after the ayatollahs, was a vice president of the Islamic republic
until he resigned to run in a Tehran city election earlier this
year, in which he won the highest number of votes. The charges
against him are more serious that those that Karbaschi faced.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Nouri is accused of ``insulting Islam'' and,
equally serious, of ``insulting'' and ``refuting the values'' of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, known here as the Imam, who led the
Islamic Revolution of 1979 and was the country's absolute ruler
until he died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's outburst Tuesday came as Nouri once again took over
the day's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at a lectern in his cleric's white turban and black
cloak, he rebutted the prosecution's case with arguments drawn from
his years as a close aide to Khomeini, from the Koran and from
Iran's Islamic Constitution, drawn up in 1980. In effect, he was
telling the court that he, better than they, understood the
principles that underpinned the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Although that was not at all what the ruling clerics intended
when they ordered Nouri to be tried, it is what they are now
getting in the trial, which is being closely followed across this
nation of 65 million through the blanket coverage it is receiving
in Iranian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many of Nouri's exchanges Tuesday with Salimi and with the
prosecutor, Mohammed Nikunam, also a cleric, turned on conflicting
interpretations of the teachings and instructions of Khomeini,
whose stature, among those contending over Iran's future, is akin
to that of Mao Tse-tung in China before he was denounced after his
death in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   As in China, conservatives and reformers alike squabble over the
dictums of Khomeini, each claiming to be his true legatees, each
scouring the record for anything that can be quoted in support of
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the judge accused Nouri of ``apostasy'' for
running articles in Khordad, a reformist newspaper controlled by
Nouri, about two banned political groups, the Freedom Movement of
Iran and the National Front of Iran.The two groups were prominent
in the struggle against the shah, then supported the Islamic
revolution, only to be proscribed by the clerics, with many of
their leading members imprisoned or driven into exile.
</P>
<P>
   After Salimi cited statements by Khomeini condemning the groups,
Nouri countered with competing quotations in which Khomeini praised
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to know is this,'' he said, referring to one of
Khomeini's letters. ``Would you say that the person who wrote this
was against the revolution, against Islam, and against the
leadership? Because that person was the Imam.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he said that those who attempt to suppress
freedoms, not those who seek to widen them, are against the Koran.
Quoting an ayatollah who until his assassination shortly after the
revolution was close to Khomeini, Nouri said, ``He reminded us that
one of the Koran's greatest teachings was to give the people
freedom within a just society.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Failing an extraordinary and unexpected acquittal by the Special
Court for the Clergy, the arch-conservative clerical tribunal that
is hearing the case, Nouri could be sentenced to as many as 10
years in jail, possibly even more, and to dozens of lashes, which
are administered to offenders in Iran with a plaited leather whip.
</P>
<P>
   For the reform movement, there is also the prospect of losing
Nouri as a candidate in parliamentary elections in February, which
are shaping up as a showdown between the ruling conservatives and
the reformers. Convicted criminals, or those caught up in criminal
proceedings, are banned from running.
</P>
<P>
   The last two elections _ the only elections generally considered
to have been conducted fairly since the 1979 revolution _ resulted
in landslide victories for the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, another Muslim cleric, Mohammed Khatami, who is 53,
won the presidency, an office with limited executive powers, with
nearly 70 percent of the 29 million votes cast. In February, when
nearly 200,000 seats on village, town and city councils were opened
to election for the first time, reformers supporting Khatami won by
landslides of similar proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, many Iranians see the Nouri trial as part of a
last-ditch strategy by the conservatives to halt the reformers. A
landslide in the vote next February, which would bring Nouri back
to national office as the parliamentary speaker, with wide powers
to initiate legislation and constitutional reforms, could be a
watershed for the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   They have ruled for 10 years under a 1980 constitution that
vests final authority over the army, the police, the judiciary and
the courts in the country's main religious leader, now Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   At several points in Tuesday's hearing, Salimi and Nikunam, the
judge and prosecutor, seemed almost at wit's end in dealing with
Nouri. At one moment, Nikunam abandoned the veneer of politeness
that has governed exchanges with Nouri, telling him, in effect,
that all the constitutional law in the world, as cited by Nouri,
would not help him when weighed against the sharia, or Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to sharia law,'' he said, referring to reports on
the Freedom Movement of Iran in Nouri's newspaper, ``what you have
done has clearly been in refutation of the Imam's views, and an
insult to Islam. And what do you say to that?''

   The leading Internet auction site eBay has begun blocking
efforts by another Web site to create an index of ongoing eBay
auctions. In the process, eBay has raised a crucial question about
intellectual property on the Web _ who owns the information on a
Web site?
</P>
<P>
   EBay is using special software to block out all visits from the
computers of AuctionWatch.com, a San Bruno, Calif. company that
runs a search engine for Internet auctions. Just as an Internet
user can go to the Lycos or Yahoo search engine to find information
on computers or sports, AuctionWatch seeks to offer a listing of
many different Internet auctions. By typing in an item of
merchandise, such as Pedro Martinez baseball cards, AuctionWatch
lists auctions where such cards are available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Most auction sites want to be listed on AuctionWatch, just as
most Web sites want to be listed in Yahoo or Lycos. But eBay
spokesman Kevin Pursglove says the 3 million auctions listed on the
site are a form of intellectual property. Services such as
AuctionWatch, which aggregate eBay's listings along with those of
other auctions, seek to profit unfairly from eBay's success by
stealing the information the company has acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe what aggregators want to do is essentially get a
free ride on that hard work and investment from another party,''
Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo Sales, cofounder of AuctionWatch.com, disagrees. Just as
services like Lycos automatically create indexes of millions of
public Web pages, Sales thinks AuctionWatch has a right to create
listings of auctions on public Web sites, including eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's available for anyone to view, right on the Web site,''
Sales said. ``It's not the property of eBay.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales tried to negotiate a licensing agreement with eBay that
would have allowed him to keep listing its auctions on his site.
But when the talks broke down, eBay demanded the specific IP
addresses of the computers used by AuctionWatch to search the eBay
auctions. To avoid having eBay block all of AuctionWatch's IP
addresses, Sales complied. Now eBay's auction computers block out
efforts by AuctionWatch to search the site.
</P>
<P>
   But Sales says he's not licked yet. He says he plans to
investigate possible ways around the blockage, including a method
that would make it appear that searches were coming from individual
AuctionWatch users, rather than from AuctionWatch itself. Told of
these efforts, eBay's Pursglove replied: ``We'll certainly block
that bridge when we come to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute could last quite awhile. Shari Steele, director of
legal services for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet
civil liberties group in San Francisco, said that no court of law
has ever settled the question at issue in this dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting legal question that has not been
resolved,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, eBay vows to keep playing hardball against other
search engines that target auctions. Burlington-based Bidder's Edge
Inc. announced in September that it would comply with eBay's demand
that it stop listing eBay auctions. But last week, Bidder's Edge
reversed itself and said it would once again feature eBay listings
on its site.

area.'' If workers cannot be placed in a comparable position,
Kaiser said it will place them in the more comparable
classification with the same pay for a period of one year or
longer. In exchange for job and income protections, the unions
agreed to more flexibility in the workplace, including the
elmination of some job classifications. By Jason Takenouchi.

   In a preface to  &UR; Francesco Mastalia  &LR; and  &UR; Alfonse Pagano &LR; 's new
photo book, ``Dreads'' (Artisan; $19.95 softcover), novelist
 &UR; Alice Walker &LR;  writes that she was just beginning to grow her own
dreadlocks during the 1985 filming of her book ``The Color
Purple.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the actresses in the movie, a North Carolina woman, had
to wear a cap because she had too much hair for a head rag or straw
hat. ``Saying this, she swept off her roomy cap, and a cascade of
vigorous locks fell way down her back,'' writes Walker. ``From a
downtrodden, hardworking Southern Black woman she was transformed
into a free, Amazonian goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer couldn't help putting her fingers into the actress's &LR; 
hair, ``both firm and soft, springy; with the clean, fresh scent of
almonds. It was warm black, and sunlight was caught in each kink
and crinkle, so that up close there was a lot of purple and blue. I
could feel how, miraculously, each lock wove itself into a flat or
rounded pattern shortly after it left her scalp. ... If this major
mystery could be discovered right on top of one's head, I thought,
what other wonders might not be experienced in the Universe's
exuberant, inexhaustible store?''

CABLE FIRMS COULD REAP WINDFALL BY OFFERING TELEPHONE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Cable TV companies upgrading their systems
for local telephone service could capture up to one-third of the US
phone market, according to a new study released Tuesday by
international consulting firm Arthur D. Little Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Amid widespread industry skepticism, the study offers some
support for AT&AMP;T's $120 million foray into cable-based telephony
and Internet access through its purchase of Tele-Communications
Inc. and planned takeover of MediaOne Group, Massachusetts'
dominant cable provider.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne next week will have its telephone service available to
nearly 500,000 potential customers in 58 Bay State communities, of
whom more than 15,000 have signed up for phone service, about an 8
percent penetration rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable telephony services are just now getting started,'' said
Peter D. Shapiro, a top Little communications consultant. ``The
ultimate potential of this business for cable operators is quite
substantial'' and could reach up to $14.7 billion in annual
revenues taken from Baby Bells, GTE, and other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Through a telephone survey last month of 1,004 adults, conducted
by Opinion Research Corp. of New Jersey, Little found up to 34
percent of US households are inclined to switch to cable-provided
phone service, up from 25 percent in a similar 1994 study.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said response was predicated on customers having access
to the type of $27-a-month service MediaOne offers locally, under
which people can keep their old phone numbers and buy a package of
premium services such as caller ID and call waiting for about 20
percent less than the same premium package from Bell Atlantic.
Little paid for the independent study.
</P>
<P>
   Among those saying they definitely or probably would take such a
plan, 77 percent cited the possible savings. Another huge market is
people buying cable modems for fast Internet access, of whom up to
59 percent would consider also taking phone service from the cable
company, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable modem services are important not only for the revenues
they will generate, but also as door openers for other
telecommunications services,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman Gary Morgenstern said, ``This certainly does bode
well for our broadband strategy. It's very encouraging news for our
consumers and ultimately our shareholders.'' He said AT&AMP;T has
counted on attaining only 25 to 30 percent market share in local
telephony to make the TCI and MediaOne deals profitable and would
be pleased to get more.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic spokesman Jack Hoey said customers thinking
about switching should consider that ``no one has a better record
of reliability than we do. When all else fails during the
nor'easters and blizzards, more often than not your Bell Atlantic
phone service keeps chugging along.''

BEVERAGE FIRM'S AD IRES AFRICAN-AMERICAN GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Talk about an irreverent ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A beverage company's nationwide promotion of an herbal juice
drink called VooDoo Rain has raised the ire of a Boston group,
whose members say the firm's Web site and neighborhood posters
reinforce the stereotype of Africans as wild while poking fun at
overweight women and animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   The posters, part of a national ad campaign by National Beverage
Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., appeared in some Massachusetts
cities and towns a few weeks ago. They also appear on the Web site
at www.voodoorain.com/wildposters.html.
</P>
<P>
   One poster depicts an African male with a bone through his nose,
yellow spirals for eyes, and a distended tongue. Another shows the
same man, presumably a consumer of VooDoo Rain, with a spear, the
bone, and an orange tongue. A third shows a large blonde woman
rent of a Viking opera character with the words, ``Big
Bottles, Big Taste, Big A--.'' And a fourth shows a steer with a
firey brand on his hind quarters and the words, ``Big A-- Taste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is reminiscent of how African-Americans were portrayed in
earlier times,'' said Raphael Abiem, a Sudanese lawyer and vice
president of the 90-member Boston Pan African Forum. The
organization, whose goal is to promote understanding between
African countries and the United States, said it wants the ads
removed from the Web site and city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Grace A. Keene, head of investor relations for National
Beverage, said the individual responsible for marketing the product
was traveling and could not be reached to comment. However, Keene
faxed The Boston Globe a statement from an unidentified company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize to those individuals (who) found one of our
VooDoo Rain posters offensive,'' the statement read. ``We intend no
disrespect to anyone. Our posters are part of a unique marketing
campaign that has been successfully launched in many cities
throughout the United States after comprehensive marketing studies
were conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the company planned to remove the ads from the Web
site, or alter its posters, Keene said she could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which describes its beverages as herbally enhanced,
has said in news releases that its goal is to attract ``the cool,
younger consumer.'' One poster contains the words ``Get Hooked on
Fun,'' and shows a young man with a hook piercing his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the ads are outrageous,'' said Kelly Chunn, a director
of the forum and founder of Kelly Chunn &AMP; Associates, a
multicultural public relations firm in Boston. ``I can understand
that the company is trying to bring attention to itself. For some,
any attention is welcome attention. But it seems that they are
going out their way to offend people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chunn said the group plans to contact the local NAACP and other
organizations to ask them to join the forum in lobbying against the
ads. ``We want them off the Web, and we want them out of the
state,'' she said. ``Based on these six posters, we could get a
lively e-mail campaign going as well as a boycott of the products.
I am sure women's groups and animal rights groups would be
concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributed to markets around the country last year, the
beverage has such descriptive names as Jungle Ice, a berry
endurance drink; Mojo Luv, a tropical passion punch; Taboo Tea, an
herbal green tea, and BrainBroo, an orange ``think'' drink.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Smikle, president of Chicago-based Target Market News, said
the posters and Web site were ``unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other word for it,'' said Smikle, who monitors the
marketing of goods and products to black consumers. ``A lot of this
promotional material has not actually hit the stores, but when it
does I don't think consumers in places like Philadelphia or Chicago
will stand for it. . . . There is a thin line between taking
creative license'' and promoting a stereotype, he said. ``Racism in
the name of creative license is never justifiable.''

CELTICS GEARING UP FOR WINLESS PISTONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After beginning the season with three victories, the
Celtics are having to adjust to a new role as favorites. But they
are being careful not to underestimate Wednesday's opponent, the
0-4 Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit is every bit as good as Toronto, Charlotte, and
Washington, maybe better,'' said coach Rick Pitino, referring to
the team's first three foes. ``The Pistons might be the toughest
opponent we've faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were 0-19, that would be statistical information that
might mean something. But this is a team that gives us headaches
watching them play. They have a unique style of play, it's a lot
like the old Loyola Marymount, but with defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons have Grant Hill and Jerry Stackhouse, and much of
the Celtics' focus will be on them. Adrian Griffin and Paul Pierce
will likely match up with Hill and Stackhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have just one player guarding Grant Hill,'' forward
Paul Pierce said. ``You have to just contain him, keep your feet
moving and run him to where the help is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a personal duel, but you automatically step
up your game against someone like that. He is one of the elite
players in the league. But pride enters into it. I want to stop him
and show the rest of the league that I am a good player, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce is second on the team in scoring (18.8 points) and
rebounding (7.0). His offensive potential should also distract
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works both ways,'' Pierce said. ``I have to take it to him
on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy's attitude can affect the whole team and everyone can
feed off that. I have to work hard and try to make him look bad. We
have to have that type of attitude, within the team concept, and
play good team defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' confidence has improved along with their record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we are supposed to win every time we play,''
Pierce said. ``Last year we got down on ourselves but now we have
confidence and we will always be focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's defensive play against the opposition's most prominent
scorer has been the surprise of the early season. Griffin also has
been an offensive threat; he leads the team in field goal
percentage (.552) and assists (23).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be a one-on-one situation with me,''
Griffin said of his defensive assignment. ``It's a team situation.
I'll do my best to keep in front of him and know that my teammates
are behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics appear to have adapted well to the NBA rule changes,
which were designed to encourage offensive play. They are third in
the league in scoring (106.5 points per game) and second in field
goal percentage (.500).
</P>
<P>
   ``The new rules were set up to increase scoring,'' Pitino said.
``I think it's good for everyone, including coaches because you
don't have to choreograph every play that goes on, and that's good
for basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was impressed by the Celtics' 103-100 win over Charlotte
Friday, as they withstood a late charge by the Hornets. The next
night, the Celtics had an impressive rally but fell short against
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held on and executed in the final minute and that was more
significant to me,'' Pitino said. ``We've had comebacks before.''

FOUR DISSIDENTS SENTENCED TO PRISON IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Four founders of the short-lived China Democracy Party
were declared guilty of subversion Tuesday and given prison
sentences ranging up to 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   With the verdicts, in the eastern city of Hangzhou, the
authorities appear to have virtually completed the destruction of
the outlawed Democracy Party, which for several months in 1998 had
tried to kindle a political alternative to the governing Communist
Party. The convicted men had a brief, collective trial on Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The longest sentence was given to Wu Yilong, 32, a former
master's degree student in literature, who received 11 years. Wu
was described as one of the party's earliest organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Two other long-time democracy campaigners who tried to promote
the new party, Mao Qingxiang and Zhu Yufu, were given sentences of
eight and seven years respectively, while a fourth, Xu Guang,
received five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentences were beyond what any of us expected,'' said Zhu
Chaopu, younger brother of the imprisoned Zhu Yufu, in a telephone
interview Tuesday evening. ``The families are all very angry,''
said the brother, who along with a few other close relatives of the
defendants was called to the courtroom Tuesday afternoon to hear
the verdicts and sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants stood erect to hear their fates, looking grim,
the brother said. ``It was all over very quickly,'' he said, and
neither defendants nor relatives had a chance to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The China Democracy Party was first proclaimed in June 1998,
during President Clinton's visit to China. A small group of
activists, led mainly by Wang Youcai of Hangzhou, called on the
government to permit the registration of a new political party _ in
a country where all organizations are required to submit to the
authority of the Communist Party. Hundreds of people around the
country voiced open support before it was banned in the fall of
'98.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, Wang was arrested on subversion charges and
sentenced to 11 years. Two other well-known, veteran dissidents
were given even longer terms.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following months, most of the remaining party leaders
were gradually arrested and sent to prison or labor camps. With
Tuesday's verdicts, the Democracy Party is all but extinguished,
supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Since December 1998, some 18 leaders of the party have been
convicted of subversion, according to the Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, a rights monitoring
group in Hong Kong. A few more party members, including a father
and his son in Hangzhou, are still awaiting trial on subversion
charges, the center said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The specified crimes of the four men sentenced Tuesday included
publishing a magazine called ``Opposition Party,'' posting
Democracy Party essays on Internet bulletin boards and
communicating with China's ``enemies'' abroad by e-mail, the center
said.

BUDGET PROBLEMS ARISE AS SIDES STILL BATTLE OVER TEACHER, U.N.
ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The possibility of a final budget settlement before
Veteran's Day faded Tuesday as White House and Republican
negotiators settled some differences over funding for police and
public lands, but were still tangled in disagreements over money
for new teachers and United Nations payments.
</P>
<P>
   A new problem also surfaced that could delay a final deal on
federal spending for the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   In a move aimed at easing clean water restrictions, Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., joined forces with Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, to
insist on an amendment that would allow eastern coal mining
companies and western hard-rock mining companies to dump wastes
from their operations into nearby streams and valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The mining controversy arose as Republicans agreed to give
Clinton $800 million out of his $1.3 billion request to help hire
50,000 new police officers. They also signed off on an additional
$400 million for U.N. peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and
included another $1 billion for education, labor and health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators were wrestling over whether the payment of nearly $1
billion in past U.S. obligations to the U.N. should be linked to
GOP demands that none of the money go to family planning groups
that promote abortion. Republicans were trying to work out language
on the matter late Tuesday night that Clinton could accept, and
negotiators said they were hopeful that the issue is close to being
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The main hang-up to a final agreement, however, continued to be
Clinton's insistence that $1.4 billion in education money be
designated specifically for his seven-year program aimed at
reducing class sizes in kindergarten through third grade by hiring
100,000 new teachers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   After initially turning aside the program last year, Republicans
agreed to fund the first phase of it and dedicated $1.2 billion to
the effort. Many of them ended up campaigning on the issue in the
1998 congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, GOP leaders are balking at funding the program
again. Instead they have earmarked $1.2 billion for education block
grants that can be used by local communities as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called on Clinton to
``be reasonable'' and accept the idea that local authorities ought
to have the final say in choosing whether to spend money on new
teachers or other needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is a good education policy to allow the districts
to have more teachers if that's what they prefer first, but to have
some flexibility,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   But other leaders, including House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, did not rule out giving Clinton specific funding for
another installment on the new teacher program if he can find a way
to pay for it without tapping the Social Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all these new spending requests, I say, Mr. President, show
me the money,'' DeLay told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a meeting with Cabinet officials Tuesday, called his
program for hiring teachers the most critical dispute remaining
with Republicans. He pleaded with them again to honor the
commitment they made last year, which he said helped hire 29,000
new public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Citing studies showing that students benefit from reduced class
sizes, Clinton said Republicans should not ``break the commitment
and just say, 'we'll give you a blank check, we don't really care
what happens to the money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his plans to leave Friday on a long-scheduled European
trip, Clinton said he would keep working with Congress to resolve
the problem, no matter how long it takes.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth in a series of temporary spending measures approved
since the start to the new fiscal year Oct. 1 is set to expire at
midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In order to keep the government operating, Congress and Clinton
will have to agree on a fifth stopgap measure to give them more
time to work out a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the clock, Lott said it was time for Clinton and
Republicans ``to look for innovative and flexible solutions to
reach a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said an agreement could be worked out Wednesday. But that
would leave little time before the Veteran's Day recess for both
the House and Senate to vote on the measures and for Clinton to
sign them.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said it would not be physically possible to wrap up everything by
Wednesday night even if all remaining issues get settled. He said
Congress would likely have to pass at least one more temporary
spending measure running through early next week for the job to get
done.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has signed eight of the 13 annual appropriations bills
needed to fund the government. But the remaining bills in dispute
cover half of next year's budget of $618 billion.

BELTRAN A STRONG CHOICE FOR AL ROOKIE HONORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City Royals manager Tony Muser calls outfielder Carlos
Beltran a ``five-tool player.'' Translation: ``He can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say that Beltran is the very deserving recipient of
the American League Rookie of the Year award, which was announced
Tuesday. Beltran batted .293 with 22 home runs, 108 RBIs, and 112
runs. He is the first rookie since Boston's Fred Lynn in 1975 (and
the eighth overall) to finish with 100 runs and 100 RBIs. Don't
think the large-market teams haven't taken notice of those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran garnered 26 of 30 first-place votes in balloting by the
Baseball Writers Association of America. Pitchers Freddy Garcia of
Seattle and Jeff Zimmerman of Texas finished second and third,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox rookie Brian Daubach receive one first-place vote and
finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran was not available for a conference call Tuesday. After
getting married over the weekend, he was on his honeymoon in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a fun year with him,'' said Muser, ``and part of
that fun is that he's not arbitration-eligible or has a chance to
be a free agent. It's a problem with all clubs in baseball today.
It's a difficult thing in baseball to keep players. I guess we will
have to show Carlos how much we appreciate him prior to that time.
It's all a part of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the season, Beltran was a virtual unknown on a faceless
team that was predicted by most to finish last in the AL Central
and beat out Detroit only by a half-game.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran had been a September callup in 1998 and batted .276. Not
bad, but in spring training this year he was still worried about
winning a job in the majors. He wasn't even the team's most touted
rookie. Also in camp was infielder Carlos Febles, who had hit .326
at Triple A Wichita in 1998 and .400 in 11 games with the Royals in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Carlos and Carlos, a couple of young kids,'' said
Muser. ``You don't know what you're going to get in the spring.
Febles played well. But that Beltran could come up with the year he
had is tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know him because of the market that
we're in. But I think the players and the pitchers who compete
against Carlos know who he is. He seems to be the kind of kid that
the bigger the pressure, the more he concentrates, the more he
competes.''

FAULK: ALLEGED AGENT BRIBES `NOTHING TO DO WITH ME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Patriots rookie Kevin Faulk has been
interviewed by police who are investigating alleged bribes and
gift-giving at Louisiana State, Faulk's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, who is not facing criminal charges, has admitted
receiving gifts from Randell ``Banks'' Menard, who is accused of
offering LSU defensive line coach Mike Heywood $30,000 to deliver
All-America defensive lineman Anthony McFarland to agent Tank
Blank, who represents Faulk (and Patriots running back Terry
Allen).
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Menard was arrested and charged with bribery and
violations of sports-agent laws. He is accused of offering money
not only to Heywood but also to an academic counselor at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Though Faulk has admitted accepting the gifts, his attorney said
Faulk did not know that Menard was trying to steer Faulk into
Black's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Black has been suspended by the National Football League
Players' Association for three years for using Menard as a
``runner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The law enforcement officials have interviewed Kevin and
several other players for informational purposes,'' said Jason
Robideaux, Faulk's attorney. ``Kevin has been more than happy to
share what he knows with the law enforcement agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk declined comment on the matter Tuesday, though he did make
the admissions about receiving gifts to the New Orleans
Times-Picayune last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with me,'' said Faulk Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robideaux said Menard was ``a surrogate big brother'' to Faulk,
whose real brother was murdered. Menard befriended Faulk even
before he entered junior high school and eventually provided him
with many gifts, including a $4,000 car when Faulk was in high
school, and a set of $3,000 rims for a Cadillac Faulk's uncle had
given him in college.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk told the Picayune, ``Basically, Banks has been helping me
out since I was in the eighth grade. He gave me everything I asked
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusation about McFarland was first brought to light by
Atlanta-based agent Ray Anderson last spring. Anderson (who
represents Patriots strong safety Lawyer Milloy) was competing for
McFarland with Black and other agents at the time, and he fingered
Black at an agent ethics meeting shortly after the draft in April.
The NFLPA determined that Anderson's concerns were valid. Black
never landed McFarland, but he did represent Faulk in negotiations
with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson declined comment on the matter Tuesday, saying, ``I'm
sure that I will be called to testify. I am certainly the one who
stood up and made the NFLPA aware of the activities I had learned
about.''
</P>
<P>
   NFLPA spokesman Carl Francis said Black has appealed his
suspension to an arbitrator, who is expected to make a ruling
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   According to captain Rickey Adams of the LSU police, it is still
being determined whether Faulk will have to testify in Menard's
criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somewhere down the road, he may have to testify,''
said Robideaux. ``I think the law enforceople are trying to
work it around the schedule of the other football players
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Robideaux, who has known Faulk since his freshman year at LSU,
said that when Faulk was in the process of picking an agent, ``He
had to take his phone off the hook. He also received several items
in the mail that he always turned over to LSU officials because he
knew he wasn't supposed to accept anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president Don Lowery said he doesn't believe Faulk
has been bothered by this situation. Allen would not comment on
Black. Attempts to recah Black and Menard were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana state law and the NCAA prohibit agents from giving
money to college athletes. The NCAA has not yet acted on this
situation.
</P>
<P>
   LSU players Mark Roman and Clarence LeBlanc were ruled
ineligible this season because of improper association with an
agent.

CBS' PERKY `EARLY SHOW' IS BETTER LATE THAN NEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After decades of obscurity, pain, tribulation, unintentional
comedy and career-ending gaffes, CBS has done it.
</P>
<P>
   It finally has a morning show that's practically
indistinguishable from everyone else's morning show.
</P>
<P>
   The ghost of Charlemane, the puppet lion that snuggled with
Walter Cronkite, can rest in peace. Phyllis George is forgiven.
Sally Quinn is redeemed. Mariette Hartley at last gets her giggle.
</P>
<P>
   The weight is lifted. The dawn hath broken. ``The Early Show''
is among us, and the sins of the past are buried.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you may say that there is no distinction in your show being
just like the other guy's show. But at CBS, in the morning hours,
it's not merely an accomplishment. It's a millennial miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Early Show'' is so much like its competitors that its
co-anchor, Bryant Gumbel, signed off for a program break last
Friday by saying, ``This is `Today' on NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   And hardly anyone noticed. I was watching, and I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   All of Manhattan is a functioning TV studio, you know, and CBS'
entry is a brand-new, indoor-outdoor, $24 million complex on Fifth
Avenue near Central Park. This is as opposed to the ground-floor,
TV-with-a-view facilities for ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good Morning
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun is a joint production of the three networks, though
there are teensy variations in its depiction. The sun is at its
most orange on ``The Early Show.'' It's a pulsating orange that
seems to radiate heat.
</P>
<P>
   Orange is (set ital)the(end ital) color on morning TV. The 1975
predecessor of ``Good Morning America,'' called ``A.M. America,''
was awash in orange. The whole set was orange. By amazing
coincidence, so was Stephanie Edwards' hair.
</P>
<P>
   It's also critical to have an alpha anchor and a perky anchor.
The dinosaurs among us might expect the alpha anchor to be male.
Shame on us. Anyway, this is not always the case. By actual
Perk-o-Meter measurement, Charles Gibson is 7.3 degrees perkier
than Diane Sawyer on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   But Gumbel is definitely putting ``don't cross, police line''
ropes around the alpha role on ``The Early Show.'' He does the big
news. He frowns and asks tough questions. He's good at that,
really.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel once in a while likes to flash a playful side. It's about
as convincing as Sam Donaldson's Art Deco hairpiece. No, Gumbel
takes himself seriously, even when his job requires him to be
insincere.
</P>
<P>
   His co-anchor, Jane Clayson, was most recently doing actual news
stories for ABC News, from whence she came. So far, she's settling
for lighter chores at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in an odd segment about a ``Thanksgiving feast with a
Latin flair'' _ turned out that meant turkey as it might be served
in the Southwest _ Clayson gamely talked to the cooking expert,
toured the table, nibbled on this and that, and did her ooohs and
aaahs.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics are ganging up on Clayson too soon. True, she's a
bit nondescript. Her perkiness needs perking. But she can chew and
think at the same time, and she has a pleasant voice with some
morning get-up-and-go in it.
</P>
<P>
   The other key spot on a morning ``news'' show is the willard
position, named after NBC's clownish weathercaster and friend to
centenarians, Willard Scott.
</P>
<P>
   A willard is someone who can relate the national weather in
about four seconds and spend the remainder of the morning being
incredibly lovable.
</P>
<P>
   A willard must like everyone, eat anything and suffer any sort
of indignity. Also, it helps to be paunchy. He is the occasional
butt of alpha anchor humor, and the mere sight of him makes the
perky anchor even perkier.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McEwen, a veteran, is the willard on ``The Early Show.''
The very first day, Monday last week, they had him chatting up Mel
Gibson on the set of Gibson's new Revolutionary War-era movie.
</P>
<P>
   McEwen thought those muskets looked formidable. Gibson agreed.
McEwen wondered if putting on a tri-cornered hat, buckled shoes and
the rest helped Gibson find his character. Gibson gave the
impression that McEwen was a moron. No, Mel, he's a willard.
There's a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Learning all of this is already paying dividends, however
modest, to CBS. The network's ratings for the time period were up
16 percent in the first week.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind, though, that CBS' base number was embarrassingly
low. Truth is, all the national networks' morning ratings were up
last week. It seems ``The Early Show'' tweaked public interest in
morning TV.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Early Show'' has taken its place on the landscape,
looking bright and chipper. And what matters more on TV than how
you look?
</P>
<P>
   I was encouraged, too, by the inclusion of Francesco the Clown
in the show's inaugural broadcast. Francesco's musical contribution
was ``Girl From Ipanema,'' played on metal strips affixed to his
body.
</P>
<P>
   I hope they bring Francesco back sometimes, for ceremonial
occasions. On national holidays, he could bang out Sousa on his
inner thighs.

NEW STUDY SHOWS HOW WOMEN CAN DRASTICALLY CUT RISK OF HEART
DISEASE  
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many studies have shown that certain behaviors, such
as eating a low-fat diet, giving up cigarettes and exercising
daily, can lower the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new study of more than 84,129 nurses looks at combining
all of those factors and finds that heart disease can be reduced by
82 percent if women aggressively follow risk-reducing guidelines
over a lifetime, researchers will report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The discouraging news is, only 1 percent to 2 percent of the
women surveyed actually adhere to those healthy habits, said Dr.
Frank Hu, a nutrition expert at the Harvard School of Public
Health, who presented the research at the American Heart
Association meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Participants were 34 to 59 years old and free from heart
disease, diabetes or cancer when starting the study in 1980. Over
the next 14 years, they answered questions about diet and lifestyle
every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers documented 1,129 cases of coronary heart disease in
that time. Although researchers attributed half of the cases to
study participants who continued to smoke, Hu said they could not
assign specific risk-reduction values to other behaviors in a way
that would allow individuals to pick and choose.
</P>
<P>
   Women characterized as low-risk in the study:
</P>
<P>
   _ Were not current smokers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Had a body mass index under 25 (BMI is a figure calculated
from height and weight).
</P>
<P>
   _ Drank moderately, about half of an alcoholic beverage a day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exercised vigorously for a half hour or more every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ate a healthy diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diet and lifestyle can have a profound effect on heart
disease,'' Hu said. ``Doctors pay more attention to medications
than lifestyle recommendations. Clinicians should recognize the
importance of both.``
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nieca Goldberg, chief of the Women's Heart Program at Lenox
Hill Hospital in New York and an AHA spokeswoman, addressed the
frustrating paradox of prevention _ why a concept so simple is so
difficult to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't have the information on how to get
started,'' she said. ``It's very difficult for the person who's not
exercising, who's used to a high-fat diet and smoking to change
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   One way a person can get started is to increase physical
activity, Goldberg said. Regular exercise keeps blood pressure
down, raises levels of ``good'' cholesterol and sometimes leads
people to make other changes, such as not smoking and eating
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand that this may take time. Results
don't happen in a day or a week, and it could take some months. But
in the end,'' she said, ``it does pay off.''

FLIGHT RECORDER RECOVERED FROM FLIGHT 990 CRASH SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ In the first major turning point of the EgyptAir
Flight 990 crash investigation, specialists in Washington have
begun to examine one of the doomed jet's so-called ``black boxes''
_ a flight data recorder plucked from the floor of the Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767-300ER flight recorder was retrieved before dawn
Tuesday by the Deep Drone, an advanced Navy remote-controlled
search-and-recovery submarine. It was then placed in a cooler full
of sea water and flown by helicopter to labs at the National
Transportation Safety Board headquarters for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, NTSB chairman James E. Hall said investigators
retreived the recorder at 2:30 p.m. and had removed the magnetic
tape from its protective casing, then cleaned and dried it. The
tape has data on it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That fact bolstered hopes among investigators that the cause of
the crash can be pinpointed. The NTSB also said the flight data
recorder was much more sophisticated than had been believed.
</P>
<P>
   If it was working properly, the recorder should provide
investigators with a wealth of information about the last 25 hours
of Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder installed by Boeing in 1989 when the 767 was
delivered to EgyptAir recorded 44 separate functions of the
aircraft and flight parameters such as speed, heading, roll and
pitch. EgyptAir officials said they enhanced the recorder, allowing
it to monitor 55 different functions. Tuesday, however, the NTSB
said the recorder could track more than 150 parameters of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   As the search for the second black box _ the cockpit voice
recorder _ continued 250 feet below the Atlantic Ocean, NTSB
personnel were prepared to work through the night to extract
information from the flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   It will take weeks to glean all the information from the data
recorder, but some preliminary information should be available
within days.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767-300ER left New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport with 217 people on board bound for Cairo
early Oct. 31. Thirty minutes into the flight, as the plane cruised
at 33,000 feet, it suddenly plunged to 16,700 feet in 40 seconds.
Radar indicates the plane then climbed to 24,000 feet before its
final dive, breaking apart before slamming into the water some 60
miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   There were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Storms and rough seas stalled the search and recovery effort,
but seachers had located the pingers _ underwater sound beacons
fastened to the boxes _ near the crash site. On Monday, ships
returned with two high-tech submersible robots to hunt for them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Tuesday that the pinger had been knocked off the
flight data recorder, which is actually painted bright orange. But
investigators viewing videotape from the Deep Drone noticed the
device as wreckage was being cleared to get to the pinger. The box
was about 10 feet away from the pinging signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were picking up pieces of wreckage when they saw it
there,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   After its recovery Tuesday, the flight data recorder was
transferred to the command ship USS Austin at first light. About
11:30 a.m., a Navy helicopter carrying the recorder began its trip
to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, where it arrived
about 1:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder made the journey in a seawater-filled cooler to
protect it from being damaged by contact with the air before it
reached NTSB headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing, Hall said one end of the flight data recorder had
been damaged, apparently by impact forces of the crash. ``We do not
know whether that damage will affect the quality of information
inside the recorder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items monitored by the flight data recorder are the
position of the thrust reversers on both engines of the 767.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that thrust reversers may have played
a role in the sudden dive of Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   A plane can fly without thrust reversers, which are designed to
slow the plane on landing by redirecting powerful exhaust from the
jet engines. If deployed in flight, however, the reversers can
render a plane uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The only fatal accident of a Boeing 767 due to mechanical
problems occured in 1991 when a Lauda Air jet crashed in a Thai
jungle when one of the thrust reversers activated during the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Some aviation specialists, however, doubt the mechanism was
responsible for the EgyptAir crash because radar tracks of the
airplane's final minutes are not characteristic of a plane
responding to the activation of a thrust reverser in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Magnum drone, which had been deployed by the Navy on Monday,
returned to the water Tuesday afternoon to assist in the hunt for
the cockpit voice recorder, a continuous loop tape that records the
last 30 minutes of converstation in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Drone, a more advanced robot, retrieved the flight data
recorder because the Magnum's fiber optic umbilical cord became
entangled about midnight Tuesday. The Magnum's mother ship, the
Carolyn Chouest, moved off site and was replaced by the Grapple at
2:20 a.m. The Grapple had been working with its drone at another
site.
</P>
<P>
   Although the attention of the news media has focused almost
exclusively on the search for the critical black boxes, the
recovery of human remains continues by the nine vessels deployed at
and near the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still part of the recovery. That has not stopped,''
said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   These remains, all in small parts, have been found floating on
the surface. Holloway said officials haven't decided whether to use
the drones to retrieve the victims from the ocean floor. The site
is too dangerous to send in divers.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, a Coast Guard helicopter left a final tribute
from the families of the crash victims. Circling over the crash
site, a crew dropped flowers from Sunday's memorial service into
the sea.

MOORE SIGNS WITH EVERTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joe-Max Moore, the leading goal-scorer in the brief
history of the Revolution, has signed a 3 1/2-year contract with
Everton of the English Premier League.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not announced, but the contract could be worth nearly
$2 million, far more than Moore could expect to earn in Major
League Soccer. But Everton could be getting a bargain, since MLS
will not be able to demand a high transfer fee. Moore's MLS
contract ends Jan. 1, so he could leave as a free agent, or a
minimal fee could be negotiated and Moore could be available for
Everton's Nov. 20 game against Chelsea in Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe-Max thought long and hard about this,'' said Moore's
agent, Cory Clemetson. ``He is excited about playing in the Premier
League, the contract is very lucrative, and he saw how management
treated players there and knew it was an environment he wanted to
be part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Everton, formed in 1878, is among the world's most historic
clubs, nine-time winners of the English League and five-time FA Cup
champions. Everton, nicknamed ``The Toffies,'' is currently in 10th
place with a 5-5-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Though Everton is undergoing an change in majority ownership,
purchasing funds became available with the transfer of Danny
Cadamarteri to Fulham. Though Cadamarteri is on loan, the club
controlled by Harrod's owner Mohamed El Fayed plans to pay 2
million British pounds to purchase him.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was recommended to the club by Richard Gough, a former
Scotland international defender who played in MLS in 1997 and '98.
The team also includes Scottish defender David Weir, who played at
Evansville University.
</P>
<P>
   Moore joined the Revolution midway through the 1996 season from
Nurnberg in Germany and converted 11 goals in 14 games. He was
slowed by injuries in 1997 and '98 but played for the US in the
World Cup in France, then returned at full strength for the '99 MLS
season. Moore scored 15 goals, increasing his total to 38 goals in
79 games for the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, who finished with a 7-20-5 record, also must
replace their best defensive player, Walter Zenga, who was fired as

<TEXT>
<P>
   Resorting to lofty rhetoric about constitutional principles,
lawyers argued two basic questions in the University of Wisconsin
student fees case heard Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Should a public university be barred from imposing a mandatory
student activity fee? If so, should students who find some of the
activities objectionable be able to force the defunding of those
activities or reduce the fees they personally pay?
</P>
<P>
   The answers should be no and no, affirming the school's policy
of supporting a broad range of activities as long as the subsidy
process is open and equitable. The reasons are not constitutional
but practical and political.
</P>
<P>
   The student activity fees charged by most colleges and
universities, both public and private, are relatively small sums
that are essentially no different from tuition, which also funds
extracurricular activities as well as academic courses.
</P>
<P>
   If the court rules against the fee at the University of
Wisconsin, what would prevent another student from demanding the
elimination of boxing or other potentially dangerous sports, or
theatricals that contain vulgar language or a bit of nudity, or
even a regular class that promotes an ideology the student finds
offensive?
</P>
<P>
   Once the legitimacy of the fee is established, the question of
what activities will be funded is a political one. Every school has
its own system, but most involve a selection committee, often with
heavy student representation. Students who object to the funding of
particular groups can try to get themselves chosen to the selection
committee or change the selection process or _ more directly _ set
up a group that seeks funding to express an opposing viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers opposing the fee cite rulings against ``compelled
speech'' in cases involving the use of members' dues by labor
unions and bar associations. But compared with schools, these
organizations have a narrower focus, and the court barred expressly
political activities in their members' names.
</P>
<P>
   Universities depend on an exchange of ideas. Without a yeasty
mix of opinions, they would soon be cold or dead.

 &HT;    Online financiers an innerconnected circle
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta is not the Southeast's banking center.
</P>
<P>
   That title probably now belongs to Charlotte. But the Atlanta
area is developing a reputation for a new kind of financial
service: managing money through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta probably has the highest concentration of online
financial services outside Silicon Valley, says Avivah Litan, an
industry analyst with Gartner Group.
</P>
<P>
   The companies include start-ups Derivion, Brightlane and Netzee,
and industry leaders such as CheckFree, Security First Technologies
and Net.Bank, among others.
</P>
<P>
   They, like many tech companies, owe their origins and their
location to the two things that fuel emerging industries: money and
corporate spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The robust root system that sprouted this thicket of companies
was planted by Atlanta's early high-tech industry, as well as its
financial community.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the progeny of one long-gone Atlanta technology firm:
Larry Dean's Stockholder Systems. At least four current
Atlanta-area high-technology financial companies owe their birth to
SSI.
</P>
<P>
   Dean started SSI in 1971. He was working for John Imlay's
Management Science of America _ the mother of Atlanta high-tech _
and wanted to develop a software product that helped companies keep
track of shareholders. SSI was bought by Nynex Investor Solutions
Group in 1990 and merged with Disc in 1994 to form Servantis
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Out of SSI or later Servantis grew:
</P>
<P>
   _ Alpharetta, Ga.-based Net.Bank, one of the first Internet
banks and the only one that has turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
   _ NFront, a Norcross, Ga., firm that sells software community
banks use to let their customers manage their money online. NFront
went public in June.
</P>
<P>
   _ Magnet Communications, a banking software firm that recently
emerged from Georgia Tech's Advanced Technology Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   _ CheckFree Holdings, the leader among companies hoping to make
the Internet the place where people get and pay their bills.
CheckFree bought Servantis, the former SSI, in 1996 and moved its
headquarters from Columbus, Ohio, to Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of one company spinning off several smaller ones
probably is as old as money. The companies that make up Silicon
Valley grew out of San Jose-area defense industry firms such as
Fairchild Semiconductor, out of which Intel grew.
</P>
<P>
   Imlay's MSA had 16,000 people on the payroll over the years, 53
of whom are now chief executive officers of companies each with
more than $6 million in revenue, Imlay said.
</P>
<P>
   The men who started companies like Intel and SSI were corporate
pilgrims, people with ideas seeking a place to express them.
</P>
<P>
   D.R. Grimes, Net.Bank's chief executive, sees something similar
happening in online money management.
</P>
<P>
   ``SSI, CheckFree, Disc. We all wind up back together,'' Grimes
said. ``It's kind of like a square dance. We swap partners and here
we are back again.''
</P>
<P>
   The connections illustrate a network of co-workers, college
friends and relatives that can tie or attract a company to an area
as easily as good schools, quality of life and skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bank's Grimes was hired by SSI in 1978 to develop the
company's telephone bill-payment product. Before SSI, Grimes worked
at SunTrust with T. Stephen Johnson. The pair helped connect
SunTrust branches to the bank's computer network. Johnson later
helped form Net.Bank. When CheckFree bought Servantis, legacy
executives such as Grimes were asked to leave. Johnson asked
Grimes, his former housemate, to help run his new Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 50, now is onto something new in a similar industry. He
envisions Brightlane.com as a Web site for small-business owners,
offering office supplies, payroll services, insurance plans and
employment information.
</P>
<P>
   SSI also is where Tripp Rackley, the 29-year-old chairman and
chief executive of nFront, did undergraduate work while at Georgia
Tech. Rackley started nFront a few years later and hired Robert
Campbell, the former head of Servantis, to be his president and
chief operating officer. Campbell was another legacy executive made
available when CheckFree bought Servantis and moved to Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Myers is part of that group as well. Myers, now Magnet
Communications' executive vice president and general manager,
started a cash management company called Interactive Technology.
The firm was bought by Disc in 1986. Disc was merged with SSI to
form Servantis in 1994. Myers started Magnet soon after CheckFree
bought Servantis.
</P>
<P>
   But the line from one company to another is not always so
straight.
</P>
<P>
   The first Internet bank, Security First Network Bank, was
started by brothers-in-law Michael McChesney and James S. Mahan III
in 1995. McChesney, an Atlanta native, developed the software.
Mahan, a Kentucky banker, had the bank charter. McChesney, 44, said
SFNB's idea of an Internet bank helped lead to the formation of
Net.Bank. McChesney and Net.Bank's Johnson knew each other through
a mutual friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we, in our own way, have been kind of proud of Net.Bank's
success,'' McChesney said, adding with a laugh, ``Although, we
would have liked to have profited a little more from it.'' Security
First sold the Internet bank division to Royal Bank of Canada last
fall. The company focuses now on selling the software banks use to
let their customers manage their money over the Internet. S1's main
competitor for consumer customers was Edify, based in Silicon
Valley. FICS, a Belgian company, was selling a lot of software to
banks doing business with international firms. With its
acquisitions of FICS and Edify, set to be completed Wednesday, the
new S1 is expected to dominate the high-volume end of the online
banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McChesney is onto something else: WebTone
Technologies, an Atlanta company developing customer service tools
for the next generation of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another local online banking company, Netzee, offered its stock
to the public for the first time Tuesday. A spinoff of
Atlanta-based the InterCept Group, Netzee did not exist three
months ago. The company is the result of several acquisitions,
including Call Me Bill in Kentucky, Norcross-based Dyad and the
Internet banking divisions of The Independent Bankers' Bank and The
Bankers' Bank. Bankers banks provide deposit, loans and other
services to other banks.
</P>
<P>
   Netzee sold 4.45 million shares at $14 each, raising $62.3
million. Of that, $32.4 million will be used to pay off loans used
to form the company, according to Netzee's Securities and Exchange
Commission filing.
</P>
<P>
   The company is targeting banks with less than $10 billion in
assets, offering software to manage money, pay bills and bank over
the Internet. The InterCept Group retains a 39 percent stake in
Netzee.
</P>
<P>
   Derivion is working in CheckFree's industry, helping companies
offer bill-paying through the Internet. Derivion's board includes
some familiar high-technology names, including John Collins, head
of InterCept Group.
</P>
<P>
   Imlay, now 63, said he looks on with pride at the companies MSA
spawned. Imlay still is seeding high-tech companies, but in a more
direct way. Imlay Ventures has invested in several new companies,
including Internet security firm ISS Group, headed by Tom Noonan, a
former MSA employee. LHS Group, a company that develops billing
systems for cellular phone customers, is in Imlay Venture's
investment portfolio, as is eTour, an Atlanta company that sends
you Web sites tied to your interests.
</P>
<P>
   Dean took SSI public in 1984 then sold it in 1990. He retired
four years later. Even though his SSI was on the forefront of the
development of money management software, Dean, 57, still likes the
traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not pay his bills or bank online. Yet. But he
trades stocks on eTrade.

SHARING KING'S DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hair-splitting niceties of copyright law cannot begin to
encompass the majesty of Martin Luther King's ``I have a dream''
speech, delivered in 1963 to 200,000 marchers on the Washington
Mall and to a hopeful nation beyond. The King estate's continued
effort to block distribution of the speech clings to a narrow legal
footing that diminishes its power and message. The more people who
hear its riveting words, the better.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998 a federal judge denied the King family's attempt to
block CBS-TV from rebroadcasting the address in its documentary
series ``The 20th Century with Mike Wallace.'' But an appeals court
reopened the case last week, saying the first ruling did not
establish clearly that King's initial delivery constituted
``general publication.''
</P>
<P>
   There are facts supporting both sides. The speech was covered
live by ABC, CBS, and NBC that day. Long sections were reprinted in
The New York Times and other newspapers. Advance copies were made
available to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the most memorable words were not in the prepared text: King
ad-libbed the rolling cadences of the ``dream'' sequence, one of
most famous perorations in American discourse. And King did
copyright the speech some months after it was delivered in an
effort to stop bootleg copies.
</P>
<P>
   There are mercenary considerations on both sides as well. CBS
has been selling videotapes of the Mike Wallace series in a boxed
set. The King family is contracting with Time Warner, a CBS
competitor, for the rights to market King's speeches on recordings
and CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Parting the Waters,'' a history of King's movement, Taylor
Branch describes the speech's ``ecstatic dignity.'' ``It went
beyond the limitations of language and culture to express something
that was neither pure rage nor pure joy, but a universal transport
of the kind that makes the blues sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   So too does the speech go beyond the limitations of ownership.
The King family is looking to sell his papers to the Library of
Congress for $20 million. It should make an exception for this
extraordinary speech and let it ring.

 &HT;    BellSouth offers U.S. travelers wireless use in Latin America
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth on Tuesday offered travelers the chance to
keep using the wireless phone they use at home when they head south
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The service will allow users to send and receive calls through
much of Latin America. The offering gives BellSouth a large step
toward the kind of global roaming that analysts say will soon be
common _ and expected from telecom companies.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``southbound,'' the service is available between North
America and 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean,
including Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Curacao. The company says
it hopes to expand the service across the region, planning to
include Sao Paulo, Brazil, the world's third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has been criticized by some analysts for not joining
the telecom merger frenzy that is making companies like SBC
Communications and Bell Atlantic _ which were smaller than
BellSouth just three years ago _ into behemoths. The conventional
wisdom is that they, along with WorldCom and AT&AMP;T, are becoming
``supercarriers'' that will dominate the industry after a series of
international alliances and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, which fell short in its last-minute, $100 billion bid
to buy Sprint last month, has a U.S. wireless network primarily in
the Southeast. Internationally, BellSouth has few investments
outside Latin America, but in that region, BellSouth is the largest
foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
   The company has argued that size is not all that matters. When
it comes to wireless, BellSouth believes that it is critical to
cover customers where they are most likely to roam _ and traffic
between BellSouth turf and Latin America is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business travel to Latin America is booming,'' said Mark
Feidler, president of the BellSouth Wireless Systems Group. ``More
than 33 million people currently travel between North and Latin
America each year, and nearly 50 million annual visitors are
expected by 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The service will cost 99 cents a minute wherever it is used.
Those charges include per-minute international roaming fees.
Long-distance charges and taxes would be extra. But no extra
monthly fees will be billed.
</P>
<P>
   At first, BellSouth is offering the service only to customers
who have been with BellSouth at least six months, as well as to
business accounts. To use it, a customer must have a digital phone
and must tell a BellSouth Mobility agent of travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Users will then be given a code they must use to operate the
phone in Latin America.

CHECHENS WAIT, SHIVER AS RUSSIANS DENY HUMANITARIAN DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARABULAK, Russia _ With snow falling and temperatures diving
below freezing, tens of thousands of Chechen refugees Tuesday stood
in shivering contradiction to Russia's claims that its bombing
campaign has not caused a humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has turned its back on us,'' declared Alikhadzhi
Saitov, one of 21,000 refugees crowded in places like this hastily
improvised tent city in the town of Karabulak, across Chechnya's
border with the Russian republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more civilians remained stranded inside Chechnya,
where a massive Russian bombing and artillery campaign has killed
at least 4,100 civilians, by Chechen count, in the breakaway
region. In all, an estimated 200,000 Chechen refugees have poured
into Ingushetia, the tiny and destitute region west of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Saitov, one of 12 family members trying to keep warm in a chilly
tent here, wondered how much worse things could get. A small nephew
has come down with bronchitis, but there is no medicine. A small
stove keeps the place warmer than the 20-degree chill outside, but
little firewood remains to keep the stove burning.
</P>
<P>
   Saitov's family is thankful for one thing _ that everyone got
out unhurt before their family house in the Chechen village of
Samashki was destroyed in a Russian rocket attack last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Saitovs' guest, Dagman Datsayeva, who fled Chechnya last
month, has no winter clothes or shoes, and no documents. There was
no time to take those when the bombs started falling near her house
in the capital, Grozny. There was only time to grab her 3-year-old
boy, Aslan, and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped in a robe and wearing only socks and slippers, Datsayeva
led the way through the 20-degree cold to the tent her family now
calls home. Inside was only slightly warmer. The heat from a small
wood stove quickly escaped through the tent's thin cloth lining.
</P>
<P>
   But even this tent is better than nothing, which is what
Datsayeva will have when she is evicted this week. New refugees are
arriving each day from Chechnya, putting each tent at a premium.
Ingush authorities have given her tent to someone with a proper
identification card. Datsayeva and her son will be out in the
street.
</P>
<P>
   The Shaipovs just got their own tent, which is better than the
rickety old bus where they spent the last month, except for one
thing: The tent has no working stove at all. Outside, a crowd
gathered around a truck where an aide worker was shouting that
there would be no new stoves today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep telling us we'll get them tomorrow,'' Kisa Sharipova
said. Her mother-in-law lay ill, wrapped in thin blankets, on the
tent's sole bed. The other eight family members stood or sat on a
cold plywood floor.
</P>
<P>
   Ingush officials say they are trying to help everyone but say
they have been overwhelmed by the number of refugees. Some
expressed consternation when the Russian foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, told ambassadors from the seven leading industrial nations
on Monday that the refugee crisis was being blown out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they say there is no humanitarian crisis?'' Azamat
Nalgiyev, a member of the Ingush parliament, asked as he inspected
the Karabulak tent city. ``What other word is there to describe
this?''
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians have tried hard to play down all the negative
aspects of their military campaign, even as international pressure
mounts and the first signs of Russian opposition to the war appear.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees tell of 1,100-pound bombs that flatten entire apartment
buildings in one blow. Avturkhanov Avenue, Grozny's main street, is
a row of deep craters. Chechnya has been without heat and light for
over a month, and Russian forces are letting into Ingushetia only a
fraction of the refugees lined up on the border.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Russian jets, ignoring the poor visibility, pounded
Grozny and the rebel-held regions in the mountainous south, and
fired rockets and dropped mines onto a major highway out of
Chechnya. News reports said four surface-to-surface missiles had
been fired toward Grozny early Tuesday from a Russian military base
near Chechnya _ an attack reminiscent of a market bombing last
month that killed at least 143 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military claimed to have killed eight militants in
Tuesday's air raids. Chechen officials said that at least nine
civilians had been killed and up to 50 wounded in attacks on
Grozny. Neither toll could be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin dismissed remarks by
State Department spokesman James Rubin, who accused Russia of
violating international laws on warfare by subjecting civilians to
indiscriminate bombardments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with armed groups which are well armed, trained
and financed from abroad,'' Putin told reporters. ``Our actions are
fully appropriate in view of the threat Russia is facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has insisted that the Russian military campaign is a
justified reponse to attacks on neighboring Russian territories and
a series of deadly apartment bombings, which Moscow blames on
``terrorists'' operating out of Chechnya. Chechen leaders deny
involvement in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Russia's united political front toward Chechnya cracked
as Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko party Tuesday
called for the Kremlin to immediately start peace talks with
Chechnya's president Aslan Maskhadov. He also called for Moscow to
halt its airstrikes and ground offensive for 30 days to allow
refugees to flee the war-torn rebel region.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky, a harsh critic of Russia's failed 1994-96 war in
Chechnya, has supported Russia's current offensive. In Tuesday's
announcement, Yavlinsky called attention to the plight of refugees
fleeing the conflict and increasing casualties among Chechnya's
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday
that 4,000 refugees each day had poured over the border to
Ingushetia since Russian authorities reopened the border last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear where they would go. And the forecast for
calls for temperatures to drop below zero.

<P>
   Board to have final say in WebMD/Healtheon merger this week
</P>
<P>
   By Michael E. Kanell
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD's long-awaited, much touted, high-stakes merger
with Healtheon is slated for a final vote by company boards
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a deal aimed at creating a health-care powerhouse in the
still developing world of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The script calls for the companies _ along with two others that
have agreed to be purchased _ to be officially combined Friday
morning, when the unified company to be known as Healtheon/WebMD
will issue an earnings report, then host analysts and reporters at
a Manhattan luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Arnold, the founder, chairman and chief executive of
Atlanta-based WebMD, is to become the combined company's CEO a few
weeks shy of turning 30. Mike Long, CEO of Healtheon, will be
chairman and chief operating officer. Healtheon founder Jim Clark,
who previously founded Netscape and Silicon Graphics, is not
expected to have an operational role.
</P>
<P>
   But uncertainty balances potential on the Internet, and
especially for this merger, at least some skittishness remains in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Long nor Arnold was available for comment Monday or
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Until the merger is consummated, there will likely be nervous
glances toward securities regulators in Washington, particularly if
questions arise about unusual activity in Healtheon's shares
Monday. The stock surged after it was reported that News Corp. was
considering a $1 billion investment in the merged company. The
company declined comment on that report by Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold several months ago was criticized for talking too much
and too loudly through the post-merger ``quiet period.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other slips. Arnold listed himself on the
company Web site as a graduate of the University of Georgia. He
attended but has no diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Then WebMD bought CertifiedMail.com in December, only to file
suit against the company in March, charging that it was given false
information before the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   And WebMD first touted the arrival of Jay Gilbertson to run the
company, then seven months later clumsily handled his departure.
</P>
<P>
   The merger's value has also shrunk to less than half its value
when the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon shares are the currency of the merger _ as well as the
acquisitions of Mede America and Atlanta-based Greenberg News
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   When the merger was announced in May, Healtheon stock rocketed
to more than $100 a share, making the deal worth north of $6
billion. Arnold boasted that his ambitious company was poised _
after less than a year in business _ to become one of Georgia's
most valuable companies, nearly on a par with Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon stock popped from $32.93 3/4 to $41 a share Monday in
trading that was about 77 times the normal volume. Healtheon stock,
which had fallen as low as $30.06 1/4 in August, closed at $41 a
share Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But if the deal is now worth less than $2.5 billion, that is
still a big number. And since the company plan is to exploit the
expected conversion of trillions of dollars in transactions to the
Net, the merger's potential remains immense. Moreover, despite the
market's fickleness and its own stumbles, WebMD has clearly racked
up an impressive series of deals.
</P>
<P>
   The deal-making started in August of 1998, when the nascent
company received a $10 million investment from HBO &AMP; Co. then went
on to recruit an experience management team. This year, WebMD
announced deals with DuPont and Microsoft _ hundreds of millions of
dollars that are helping to fuel WebMD's marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon/WebMD has no plans to be profitable for the
foreseeable future. Instead it hopes to entice doctors, to build a
huge customer base, said David Restrepo, analyst for Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have going for them _ and it's a good thing _ is all
that cash. That money from Microsoft and Dupont is essentially
going to give their service away for free.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Healtheon/WebMD is that others have noticed that
gigantic pot of Internet healthcare gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a slam dunk,'' said David Restrepo, analyst for
Jupiter Communications. ``They are going to be competing against
some entrenched players _ companies that have relations with
hundreds of thousands of doctors _ real relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the scores of companies are CareinSite.com, Claims.net,
AccentHealth and IDX, whose subsidiary ChannelHealth provides
physicians with a portal to information from a wide variety of
sources. The notion is that the resource will become vital doctors'
practices. Meanwhile, many others from Atlanta-based Adam.com to
DrKoop.com are aimed at providing consumer health information.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey projects the company losing money at least
through the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   But William Michalak, analyst for Wachovia Securities, said no
one else will have quite the breadth of offerings as
Healtheon/WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the shift to the Internet is still young enough to
give Healtheon/WebMD a shot at forging deals with insurance
companies, health maintenance organizations, laboratories and
pharmaceutical companies, all of them envisioning gigantic savings
as they move to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that many of the relationships have been
established yet,'' Michalak said. ``The field is really wide open
for developing those relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that potential, Wachovia has yet to issue a rating on
Healtheon/WebMD and is not advising a purchase. Net healthcare is
just too hard to predict, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone knows what it will look like in two
years.''

EPA CHIEF IN NEW ENGLAND TO TEACH, GO INTO BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He came into office with a tough guy reputation and a
picture of Bobby Kennedy under his arm and, for nearly six
tumultuous years, John DeVillars stood center stage in most of the
major environmental debates in New England, from protecting Maine's
coast to forcing the National Guard to clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant but sometimes abrasive, he drew criticism along the
way, especially within the regional office of the US Environmental
Protection Agency he was running. But he also won many admirers who
felt they could count on DeVillars to do the hard things, such as
prosecuting big corporations or reducing bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, though, DeVillars surprised all but his intimates with
his closing act, announcing that he will soon leave his post as
regional administrator of the EPA to teach at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and become a partner in an environmental
business.
</P>
<P>
   With no job security after President Clinton leaves office in
January 2001 _ and no financial nestegg accumulated after a career
spent mainly in government _ friends say the 50-year-old DeVillars
simply saw opportunities too good to pass up. They brushed off the
idea that critics had hounded him out of office.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not things I sought. They came to me,'' said
DeVillars, who said he was contacted about teaching a course at MIT
last winter. ``Ideally, if I could, I'd put these (opportunities)
in my pocket and pull them out a year from now and do them then,
but the world doesn't exactly work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials stressed that the 800-member New England staff
would continue to pursue the agenda laid out by DeVillars, which,
despite his image, emphasized more cooperation with most industry
and public agencies, coupled with high profile enforcement actions
against certain polluters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This region is doing good stuff. We're going to keep doing
good stuff and do it with a vengeance,'' said DeVillars' deputy,
Mindy Lubber, the early favorite to become regional administrator
when DeVillars leaves in January. ``I'll be incredibly disappointed
if we miss a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said they hoped Lubber is right, calling
DeVillars a rare bureaucrat who aggressively seeks new solutions to
old problems. Sen. John Kerry called DeVillars ``a great asset to
New England'' who ``tackled some of our toughest environmental
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Russell of the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation
said DeVillars ``has been an incredibly creative light at EPA. . .
. You don't have to go too far to find people who are mad at him.
But he really has shaken things up over there, and the people I
respect over at EPA like him, and that makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars was controversial almost from his arrival in 1994,
when he breezed into the Boston office intent on ``reinventing''
the EPA. A self-described progressive in the mold of the late
Robert F. Kennedy, he argued that the EPA was too interested in
enforcing rules for their own sake, and not interested enough in
reducing pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But DeVillars' reorganization _ and his impatience at carrying
it out _ alienated many staffers, who complained that he didn't
listen and that he was reducing enforcement. By 1997, top officials
at the US Justice Department complained that the New England region
under DeVillars' leadership had reduced enforcement against
polluters.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of his style, DeVillars could not escape the
watchful eye of the critics. Even when he volunteered to raise
money for land preservation, he was chided because the fundraiser
was an auto race in which he drove a car that gets only eight miles
a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, amid the controversy, DeVillars emerged as perhaps the most
influential environmental figure in the region, taking a decisive
role in one major issue after another: he stopped Maine Gov. Angus
King from building a port on an undeveloped Maine island; he
stopped military training at the Massachusetts Military Reservation
that threatened Cape Cod's drinking water; he ordered a cleanup of
the Charles River to be done by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars even delayed announcing his departure until he
completed negotiations with one of the world's biggest
corporations, General Electric, over its responsibility to clean up
high levels of PCBs in the Housatonic River of western
Massachusetts. Last month, GE agreed to invest $250 million to $750
million in the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue had languished for almost a generation, but no one
. . . would take on GE about it,'' said George Wislocki of the
Berkshire Natural Resources Council. DeVillars ``is extraordinary
for taking it on, and for that, we are eternally grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVillars will begin teaching a course in environmental
leadership in February at MIT's Urban Studies and Planning
Department, and he expected an announcement on the nature of his
environmental business within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But friends say DeVillars might not have stepped down at all if
EPA Administrator Carol Browner had decided to run for US Senate in
Florida, opening the possibility of DeVillars getting the agency's
top job.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, DeVillars said that he may well return to public life
down the road, but he promised that, next time, he'll avoid some of
the self-inflicted wounds that dogged him at EPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've learned a lot in this job,'' he said. ``I am a
more effective professional . . . and a better person.''

HIGH COURT HEARS DEBATE ON FREE SPEECH AND MANDATORY STUDENT FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Ariz., Va.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A debate over the right not to speak was at the
heart of a Supreme Court argument Tuesday on student speech on
public university campuses.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the University of Wisconsin's mandatory student
activity fee, which goes to support essentially any nonpartisan
student group that applies for a share. With 125 student groups
receiving money, three law students at the Madison campus,
describing themselves as conservatives and Christians, objected and
argued that they should be able to withhold their money from 18
groups that support gay rights, women's rights and other generally
liberal causes.
</P>
<P>
   The individual financial stakes are small, with the 18 groups
representing only a few dollars of an annual student fee that was
$330 when the law students filed their suit in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the practical and constitutional stakes are considerably
higher. A federal appeals court's ruling last year that the
objecting students were entitled to opt out of what would otherwise
be, in the court's view, a form of forced speech and association
has threatened to change the way activities are financed for
millions of students at public colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university may have an educational mission, but it has a
greater duty to protect the right of conscience of its students,''
Jordan Lorence, the students' lawyer, told the justices Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The court appeared sympathetic but not entirely convinced. Since
``ancient times,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told Lorence, open
debate has been part of university life. ``The difficulty with your
position is that you're asking us to do something against the
tradition of the university,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the court appear convinced by Wisconsin's appeal,
presented on the university's behalf by Susan Ullman, an assistant
state attorney general. She argued that the ``pot of money'' made
available to student groups was the equivalent of a public forum in
which anyone could speak without the speech being attributed to
those who might disagree.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But it was a ``metaphorical forum'' at best, said Justice David
H. Souter, as well as an ``odd'' forum from which overtly political
groups were excluded from eligibility for the money. Ms. Ullman
said the university drew this limit because ``it wants to avoid the
appearance of political favoritism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't want to get in dutch with the legislature,'' Souter
responded, adding: ``Why should we adopt the forum metaphor? The
core First Amendment value is in political speech. If you're
excluding that kind, what does that do to your forum analysis?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the edgy, hourlong argument in Board of Regents
vs. Southworth, No. 98-1189, it was far from clear how the justices
would resolve an issue that has divided state and federal courts
around the country. The Wisconsin litigation, as well as similar
lawsuits that Lorence, a sole practitioner in Fairfax, Va., has
handled around the country has been financed by a Phoenix group,
the Alliance Defense Fund. Its literature describes its goals as
``defunding the Left'' and ``reclaiming legal ground for the body
of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Supreme Court's decision will apply only to public
colleges and universities, which alone are governed by the First
Amendment's strictures, debates over the use of student activity
fees have also been a feature of campus politics at private
colleges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In ruling for the objecting Wisconsin students, the 7th Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago did not instruct the university
how to remedy the problem. Consequently, the justices are not
likely to address that question even if they uphold the appeals
court's constitutional analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Among various options are a system that would allow students to
withhold a portion of the fee; an approach permitting students to
select those activities they want to support, or a refund system,
which could be so expensive to administer at a campus of 40,000
students like the University of Wisconsin at Madison as to make use
of student activity fees impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens suggested at one point in the argument
that he believed Lorence's real objection was not to particular
groups but to ``the program as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is unusually challenging for the court because it lies
at the intersection of two lines of First Amendment doctrine. On
the one hand, in an approach expressed most recently in a 1995 case
from the University of Virginia, Rosenberger vs. Rector, the court
has insisted that government may not discriminate among speakers in
a public forum. In that case, the court ruled that the university
could not refuse to subsidize a student religious publication on
the same basis as other student publications and held that the
students' religious speech would not be attributed to the
university itself.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in a series of First Amendment cases
involving the rights of members of labor unions and bar
associations, the court has ruled that people cannot be required to
pay, through their dues, for the organizations' political
activities to which they object.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the picture, the court in the University of
Virginia case raised, but did not answer, the question of what
rights students might have if they objected to subsidizing the
religious publication.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling for the Wisconsin students, the 7th Circuit invoked
the labor union precedents. But several justices suggested Tuesday
that the analogy was inexact. As opposed to financing a particular
political viewpoint, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said to the
students' lawyer, ``You're giving money to a bunch of
organizations, at least distantly related to academic objectives.''
He added: ``Why doesn't that make a difference?''
</P>
<P>
   Souter observed that the activity fee helped promote ``a series
of messages that may be quite inconsistent.'' He said, ``Whatever
it is, it's different from being compelled as a union member to
take a particular position.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Lorence whether the university
could abandon the student fee and simply raise tuition accordingly,
as a source of money for student activities. That would also be a
problem, Lorence replied.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg raised the question of how far that
position might go. By paying tuition, ``people are compelled to pay
for all kinds of things being taught that they might not believe
in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If the justices were in agreement on anything Tuesday, it was
that one specific aspect of the Wisconsin system was particularly
troublesome. Unlike other student groups that went through an
application process, one group, the Wisconsin Public Interest
Research Group, won a referendum for the right to receive financing
of some $40,000 a year. This was a questionable approach, several
justices suggested. ``I guess the First Amendment is supposed to
protect views that are unpopular, but a referendum would seem to
protect the views that are popular,'' Breyer said.

CLINTON MAY ABBREVIATE VISIT TO GREECE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing anti-American demonstrations and the threat
of possible violence, President Clinton is considering cutting
short his trip to Greece this weekend, administration sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared confident Tuesday that he would be safe on his
state visit to the southern European nation, where he is scheduled
to spend three days at the beginning of an 11-day European visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the demonstrations, and I'm not troubled by them, and
I think that the security issues will be fine,'' Clinton told
reporters as he walked into a White House Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But in Greece, the president faces strong anti-US sentiment from
both a small group of hard-core communists and anarchists, as well
as less radical Greeks angry at the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A ``schedule adjustment'' that would cut the president's time in
Greece to one or two days is very possible, although the final
decision will be made by the White House, said a high-placed State
Department official.
</P>
<P>
   After Greece, Clinton is scheduled to go to Turkey for a meeting
of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to
Bulgaria for a state visit, and to Italy for a session on
governing.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip meant to promote civil societies in Europe, cutting
short a visit to the world's oldest democracy would underscore the
enduring troubles in the Balkans, where security is a concern even
in Greece, a US ally and fellow NATO member.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has visited Bosnia _ a country so unsafe, the State
Department warns Americans not to go there _ and on the upcoming
trip is likely to drop in to see US troops in Kosovo, which is
still badly damaged and dangerous nearly six months after the war
ended. Both regions are heavily mined.
</P>
<P>
   But while the government of Greece welcomes Clinton, many of its
citizens do not.
</P>
<P>
   Many Greeks, who share Orthodox Christian ties with the Serbs,
were bitterly opposed to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Many
Greeks are also angry at the United States for backing a military
dictatorship in 1967-74.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, leftist guerrillas shot at the Greek-American Union
cultural center and planted a bomb at the Athens office of Levi
Strauss. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, about 2,000 demonstrators staged a mock trial of
Clinton at the capital's central Syntagma Square, accusing the US
president of committing crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   US officials in Greece have long been targets of violence, and
American diplomats travel in armored vehicles, the State Department
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always get lectured about security before going to Greece''
on fact-finding tours, said a congressional aide. As recently as
1988, there was an atempted murder at the US ambassador's residence
in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, there are large demonstrations on Nov. 17,
commemorating a student uprising at Athens Polytechnic University
against the junta that ruled Greece. The marches generally end at
the US embassy in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators represent ``a very small but very vocal'' part
of the Greek population, said a senior Greek official, speaking on
the condition that he not be named. The government will allow
demonstrations as long as they are not violent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodossis C. Demetracopoulos, a spokesman for the Greek embassy
in Washington, said he had no word that Clinton would not spend the
full three days in Greece. The White House is ``not sure yet'' what
it will do, an administration source said, but is expected to
finalize plans by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The president will spend at least some time in Greece, said
White House spokesman Barry Toiv. With relations improving but
still strained between longtime foes Greece and Turkey, it would be
diplomatically upsetting for Clinton to cancel all of his time in
Greece and go just to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wanted ``very badly to see a resolution of the
tensions'' between the two countries. Greece and Turkey are
technically allies because they are both NATO members. But they
have sparred for decades over the future of the island of Cyprus,
populated by Greeks and Turks.

GORE SAYS HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH CLEMENCY DECISION
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore said Tuesday that he did not
know whether the White House gave any consideration to his
political standing with the Puerto Rican community when President
Clinton granted clemency in August to 16 Puerto Rican prisoners,
but that, in any case, he had nothing to do with the controversial
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has refused to comment on Clinton's decision,
which unleashed criticism by many law-enforcement officials and led
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is considering a Senate run in New
York, to oppose her husband publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans said on Monday that an internal White
House memorandum written in March said, ``The V.P.'s Puerto Rican
position would be helped'' if the prisoners were granted clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no knowledge of that,'' Gore told reporters Tuesday. He
had said in September that he was going to review the record on the
prisoners, but said Tuesday that he meant that the White House was
reviewing the record and he had no intention of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a misunderstanding,'' the vice president said
Tuesday. ``What I meant was that at that moment, the White House
was in the process of reviewing its decision-making. I have not
reviewed the records, and here's why: This is a power given to the
president, without any checks or balances. It's not reviewable by
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asserted executive privilege over the records that led
him to release the prisoners. Gore said he had no position on
whether the records should be made public.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested, in an answer to a question, that he had no
obligation to share his thinking with the public about the
clemency, even though he might face such a decision as president.
But then he seemed to think twice about that answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an imaginative theory,'' Gore said at first, laughing,
and then added: ``Yes, I think that's fair. But I don't think
there's any point in me reviewing a voluminous record upon which a
decision has been made that is nonreviewable by anybody; there's no
checks and no balances, it's his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had discussed another matter of vital importance to
Puerto Ricans, which was the continuation of U.S. naval exercises
on the island of Vieques, 6 miles off eastern Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy should search for an alternative way of training that
did not have the harsh impact on Puerto Rico that the use of
Vieques for the last 60 years has had,'' Gore said. ``I think they
should stop it as quickly as they can, find alternatives as quickly
as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   All live firing exercises on the island were suspended in April
after a Puerto Rican guard on the base was accidentally killed by a
bomb. A presidential panel investigating Puerto Rican complaints
recommended last month that the military be allowed to resume live
firing exercises but that the range be shut down in five years.

CLINTON MAY ABBREVIATE VISIT TO GREECE 
</HEADLINE>

 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing anti-American demonstrations and the threat
of possible violence, President Clinton is considering cutting
short his trip to Greece this weekend, administration sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared confident Tuesday that he would be safe on his
state visit to the southern European nation, where he is scheduled
to spend three days at the beginning of an 11-day European visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the demonstrations, and I'm not troubled by them, and
I think that the security issues will be fine,'' Clinton told
reporters as he walked into a White House Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But in Greece, the president faces strong anti-US sentiment from
both a small group of hard-core communists and anarchists, as well
as less radical Greeks angry at the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A ``schedule adjustment'' that would cut the president's time in
Greece to one or two days is very possible, although the final
decision will be made by the White House, said a high-placed State
Department official.
</P>
<P>
   After Greece, Clinton is scheduled to go to Turkey for a meeting
of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to
Bulgaria for a state visit, and to Italy for a session on
governing.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip meant to promote civil societies in Europe, cutting
short a visit to the world's oldest democracy would underscore the
enduring troubles in the Balkans, where security is a concern even
in Greece, a US ally and fellow NATO member.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has visited Bosnia _ a country so unsafe, the State
Department warns Americans not to go there _ and on the upcoming
trip is likely to drop in to see US troops in Kosovo, which is
still badly damaged and dangerous nearly six months after the war
ended. Both regions are heavily mined.
</P>
<P>
   But while the government of Greece welcomes Clinton, many of its
citizens do not.
</P>
<P>
   Many Greeks, who share Orthodox Christian ties with the Serbs,
were bitterly opposed to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Many
Greeks are also angry at the United States for backing a military
dictatorship in 1967-74.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, leftist guerrillas shot at the Greek-American Union
cultural center and planted a bomb at the Athens office of Levi
Strauss. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, about 2,000 demonstrators staged a mock trial of
Clinton at the capital's central Syntagma Square, accusing the US
president of committing crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   US officials in Greece have long been targets of violence, and
American diplomats travel in armored vehicles, the State Department
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always get lectured about security before going to Greece''
on fact-finding tours, said a congressional aide. As recently as
1988, there was an atempted murder at the US ambassador's residence
in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, there are large demonstrations on Nov. 17,
commemorating a student uprising at Athens Polytechnic University
against the junta that ruled Greece. The marches generally end at
the US embassy in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators represent ``a very small but very vocal'' part
of the Greek population, said a senior Greek official, speaking on
the condition that he not be named. The government will allow
demonstrations as long as they are not violent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodossis C. Demetracopoulos, a spokesman for the Greek embassy
in Washington, said he had no word that Clinton would not spend the
full three days in Greece. The White House is ``not sure yet'' what
it will do, an administration source said, but is expected to
finalize plans by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The president will spend at least some time in Greece, said
White House spokesman Barry Toiv. With relations improving but
still strained between longtime foes Greece and Turkey, it would be
diplomatically upsetting for Clinton to cancel all of his time in
Greece and go just to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wanted ``very badly to see a resolution of the
tensions'' between the two countries. Greece and Turkey are
technically allies because they are both NATO members. But they
have sparred for decades over the future of the island of Cyprus,
populated by Greeks and Turks.

SUDDEN EXERCISE NOT FOR THE SEDENTARY, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ones who are noticed most are the marathoners who suffer
heart attacks, such as the three runners stricken during the Boston
Marathon last April. But the real danger is for those who get
almost no usual exercise and then go for a jog, chase the dog,
shovel snow, or run for a bus.
</P>
<P>
   A study of 640 Hartford, Conn.-area patients, published
Wednesday, indicates that the risk that exercise will precipitate a
heart attack is 20 to 30 times higher among those who are
sedentary, compared to patients who are usually active before their
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The report presents a double caution to middle-aged people
concerned about their risk of heart attack, its authors said.
First, those whose hearts are not used to being stressed should be
careful about putting sudden demands on it.
</P>
<P>
   Second, sedentary individuals _ that is, most Americans _ should
start getting regular exercise, beginning slowly and ramping up to
more vigorous levels, said Dr. Paul D. Thompson of Hartford
Hospital, who led the study. That will prepare their hearts, he
said, for those inevitable bursts of activity ``that one can hardly
escape during a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that one in 10 heart attacks occurred during or
within one hour of vigorous exercise. About 40 percent had been
running or jogging before their attack, while the others had been
suddenly stressed by such activities as running indoors to answer a
ringing phone.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that such activities can precipitate heart attacks
``should not scare someone away from exercise,'' Thompson said.
``It should scare them toward exercise _ toward having some sort of
an exercise program.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which appear in this week's Journal of the
American Medical Association, also suggest that individuals should
reduce their other coronary risk factors, such as cigarette
smoking, high cholesterol and obesity, while they are beginning an
exercise program. These factors, along with male gender, were
strongly related to the risk of an exercise-induced heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who has studied the relationship between exercise and
heart disease for two decades, said he was surprised to find that
the sedentary heart attack victims actually had less coronary
artery blockage than those victims who were more active.
</P>
<P>
   ``This implies that the exercise indeed was the provocateur,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It fits with the current notion among researchers that a heart
attack is not simply caused by a blood clot that plugs a coronary
artery narrowed by plaque _ deposits of cholesterol, connective
tissue, and inflammatory cells. Instead, it's ``the crack in the
plaque,'' Thompson said, that touches off the obstructive clot.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise increases blood pressure and heart rate, Thompson and
his colleagues noted, which may initiate the sudden rupture of
artery plaques. In addition, an elevated heart rate ``increases the
frequency of the bending, twisting, and flexing motions'' of
coronary arteries, further raising the risk of plaque rupture.
</P>
<P>
   A second heart attack study, presented Tuesday at an American
Heart Association meeting in Atlanta, indicated that use of a $300
diagnostic test helped emergency room doctors confirm or rule out
heart attack among patients with chest pain _ reducing hospital
admissions for such cases by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results, emerging from a $5 million, seven-hospital study
involving nearly 2,500 patients with chest pain, give physicians a
better way of deciding who can safely be sent home because they are
not having a heart attack, and who should be admitted. The test,
called a sestamibi scan, reveals if the heart's blood flow is
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are urged to come in with chest pain. But if everybody
did that the emergency room would be deluged, and many would be
admitted unnecessarily,'' said Dr. Harry Selker of New England
Medical Center in Boston, who conducted the study with Dr. James
Udelson and Joni Beshansky.
</P>
<P>
   Wide use of the sestamibi scan, Selker said, would save hundreds
of millions of dollars a year nationally in avoided hospital
admissions and other costs.

 IN A CHALLENGE TO McCAIN, BUSH APPEALS TO VETERANS IN S.C. 
 (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PICKENS, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Tuesday that
American military veterans were getting less than they deserved
from the country they had served and should be given better health
care and relief from a tangled, tortuous bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers once ordered by their government to stand in the line
of fire should not be asked to stand in line at the nearest
bureaucracy, with hat in hand,'' Bush said in a speech here Tuesday
morning that was as draped in patriotic bunting as the courthouse
where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush did not offer specific remedies, he called for
change and sounded robust notes of gratitude and reverence for all
that veterans had done for their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's veterans today only ask that their government honor
their commitments as they honored theirs,'' Bush said. ``They ask
their interests be protected, as they protected their country's
interest in foreign lands.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his remarks during the first of nearly a half dozen
events involving veterans that are on his schedule in South
Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan and Ohio this week, and the
sustained theme reflected more than the approach of Veterans Day on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It also illustrated Bush's desire to compete for the support of
a set of voters to whom his chief rival for the Republican
presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, has special
appeal. McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, a harrowing
experience at the center of his best-selling autobiography, ``Faith
of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's military experience, which also came during the Vietnam
War, was confined to a stint as a fighter pilot with the Texas Air
National Guard, a slot that pretty much guaranteed that he would
not be sent into combat overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In informal comments after his speech at the courthouse, Bush
praised McCain for his character and his history of service but
described himself as more fit to lead the nation and oversee its
military and its commitments abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think voters are going to say I'd be a better commander in
chief because I've had chief executive experience,'' Bush said,
referring to his nearly six years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's credentials on foreign policy came into question last
week after the widespread broadcast of a television interview that
showed him failing, in a pop quiz, to answer correctly three of
four questions about the leaders of three foreign countries and a
Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeatedly made a joke of that performance on Tuesday.
Outside a restaurant in Easley, S.C., he said that as he was
leaving home, his wife, Laura, told him, ``Don't get out there and
try to show off, naming all those leaders in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in Jacksonville, Fla., Bush said he thought the
fallout from the test was positive, apparently referring to his
straightforward acknowledgment about what he did and did not know.
He had said: ``I think a lot of Americans are saying, `You know
something? I kind of respect old George W. I appreciate the way he
handled it.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People interviewed at his stops in South Carolina on Tuesday
said the incident had barely caught their notice. To the extent
that it had, they said they were not concerned about any gaps in
Bush's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing South Carolina as the place to depart from his
standard stump speech and to talk extensively about veterans for
the first time in this campaign, Bush was acknowledging the heavy
concentration of veterans in a state that has an early primary next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain is also concentrating on enlisting support
of veterans here as well as in New Hampshire. On Veterans Day, the
senator will be traveling throughout South Carolina with other
veterans to attend parades and memorial services.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A phalanx of veterans stood beside Bush on Tuesday on the steps
of the Pickens County Courthouse, a building fronted by four tall,
white columns. A high school marching band also fanned out around
him, and in the front yard lay a newly engraved stone memorial to
the county's four Medal of Honor winners.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers hope that veterans will respond to Bush's
promises to increase pay for members of the armed forces and to
spend more in general on the military. Bush reiterated those
pledges Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us resolve never to multiply our missions while cutting
our capabilities,'' Bush said.

BEVERAGE FIRM'S AD IRES AFRICAN-AMERICAN GROUP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Talk about an irreverent ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A beverage company's nationwide promotion of an herbal juice
drink called VooDoo Rain has raised the ire of a Boston group,
whose members say the firm's Web site and neighborhood posters
reinforce the stereotype of Africans as wild while poking fun at
overweight women and animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   The posters, part of a national ad campaign by National Beverage
Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., appeared in some Massachusetts
cities and towns a few weeks ago. They also appear on the Web site
at www.voodoorain.com/wildposters.html.
</P>
<P>
   One poster depicts an African male with a bone through his nose,
yellow spirals for eyes, and a distended tongue. Another shows the
same man, presumably a consumer of VooDoo Rain, with a spear, the
bone, and an orange tongue. A third shows a large blonde woman
reminiscent of a Viking opera character with the words, ``Big
Bottles, Big Taste, Big A--.'' And a fourth shows a steer with a
firey brand on his hind quarters and the words, ``Big A-- Taste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is reminiscent of how African-Americans were portrayed in
earlier times,'' said Raphael Abiem, a Sudanese lawyer and vice
president of the 90-member Boston Pan African Forum. The
organization, whose goal is to promote understanding between
African countries and the United States, said it wants the ads
removed from the Web site and city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Grace A. Keene, head of investor relations for National
Beverage, said the individual responsible for marketing the product
was traveling and could not be reached to comment. However, Keene
faxed The Boston Globe a statement from an unidentified company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize to those individuals (who) found one of our
VooDoo Rain posters offensive,'' the statement read. ``We intend no
disrespect to anyone. Our posters are part of a unique marketing
campaign that has been successfully launched in many cities
throughout the United States after comprehensive marketing studies
were conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the company planned to remove the ads from the Web
site, or alter its posters, Keene said she could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which describes its beverages as herbally enhanced,
has said in news releases that its goal is to attract ``the cool,
younger consumer.'' One poster contains the words ``Get Hooked on
Fun,'' and shows a young man with a hook piercing his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the ads are outrageous,'' said Kelly Chunn, a director
of the forum and founder of Kelly Chunn &AMP; Associates, a
multicultural public relations firm in Boston. ``I can understand
that the company is trying to bring attention to itself. For some,
any attention is welcome attention. But it seems that they are
going out their way to offend people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chunn said the group plans to contact the local NAACP and other
organizations to ask them to join the forum in lobbying against the
ads. ``We want them off the Web, and we want them out of the
state,'' she said. ``Based on these six posters, we could get a
lively e-mail campaign going as well as a boycott of the products.
I am sure women's groups and animal rights groups would be
concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributed to markets around the country last year, the
beverage has such descriptive names as Jungle Ice, a berry
endurance drink; Mojo Luv, a tropical passion punch; Taboo Tea an
herbal green tea, and BrainBroo, an orange ``think'' drink.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Smikle, president of Chicago-based Target Market News, said
the posters and Web site were ``unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other word for it,'' said Smikle, who monitors the
marketing of goods and products to black consumers. ``A lot of this
promotional material has not actually hit the stores, but when it
does I don't think consumers in places like Philadelphia or Chicago
will stand for it. . . . There is a thin line between taking
creative license'' and promoting a stereotype, he said. ``Racism in
the name of creative license is never justifiable.''

DEATHS IN BABIES WHO UNDERGO HEART SURGERY FALLING, PEDIATRIC
REGISTRY SHOWS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new database shows that deaths in babies who undergo
surgery for heart defects decreased significantly over a 15-year
period, researchers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium studied 82,314 patients,
ranging from newborns to 18-year-olds, who had heart surgery
between 1982 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered:
</P>
<P>
   _ In newborns less than 30 days old, the number of deaths fell
from 26 percent in 1982 to 17.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ In infants younger than 1 year, deaths decreased from 20
percent to 11 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among all age groups combined, deaths in that time frame fell
from 9.6 percent to 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had major improvements in mortality,'' said Dr. James
Moller, head of pediatrics at University of Minnesota where the
registry is based. These improvements occurred at the same time,
Moller added, that doctors were performing increasingly more
complicated operations on younger and younger patients.
</P>
<P>
   Moller presented the information at the American Heart
Association meeting in Atlanta and said improvements are partly due
to better medications and surgical techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the same thing. It is one of those advances you
wouldn't be able to put a finger on a single cause,'' said Houston
physician Dr. Charles Frasier. Frasier is chief of congenital heart
surgery at Texas Children's Hospital and an assistant professor of
pediatrics and surgery at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a constellation of factors. The first thing that's
been recognized is children are not little adults,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike adult heart problems, which are usually acquired over
time, child heart abnormalities often result from birth defects.
The AHA estimates that for every 1,000 babies born, eight have a
heart defect. These defects range in severity from ducts that won't
close, to complex, structural malformations or missing parts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most difficult patients to treat are babies born
prematurely. Their hearts are tiny and fragile _ about the size of
a medium strawberry, Frasier said _ their lungs weak and other
organs immature. Successes in treatment have been achieved by
assembling teams of anesthesiologists, respiratory therapists,
surgeons and cardiologists who specialize in children, Frasier
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another substantial change over the last 15 years, has been
repairing heart defects as early as possible, Frasier said.
</P>
<P>
   A report by researchers in France presented at the AHA meeting
showed a higher survival rate among low birth-weight babies who had

COMMENTARY: THE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who have spent the past decades tracking the
Arab-Israeli peace process, this is indeed an auspicious week.
Finally, finally, finally, we are really at the final negotiations,
which began Monday in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   As the moment arrives, however, we find a surprise waiting for
us. People are focused on the huge territorial gap between the
Arabs and Israelis. But that's not the key issue. The key issue is
what to do with two core groups of people _ the 100,000-plus
Israeli settlers living inside the West Bank, who want to stay, and
the roughly two million Palestinian refugees living outside the
West Bank, who want to return there and to Israel proper.
</P>
<P>
   How the refugees and the settlers are dealt with is the key
because these two groups symbolize the original causes of the
conflict. The Palestine Liberation Organization was formed to
galvanize the refugees into an armed movement to reclaim their
homes _ in the West Bank and Israel. And the West Bank settlers
were galvanized to take Zionist ideology about reclaiming the Land
of Israel to its logical conclusion, by seeking to settle all the
land of biblical Israel between the Mediterranean and the Jordan
River.
</P>
<P>
   Without addressing _ or explicitly limiting _ the claims raised
by these two groups it will be impossible to say that the core of
this conflict has been resolved. There is no way for the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, or Israel's prime minister, Ehud
Barak, to deal with the end of this conflict without dealing with
the beginning. But this stuff is political dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two groups of people in this negotiation who are
totally indigestible by the other side _ the settlers and the
refugees,'' says Stephen P. Cohen, of the Center for Middle East
Peace. ``Barak wants a deal whereby Arafat has to digest most of
the settlers and Arafat wants a deal whereby Barak has to digest
most of the refugees. How they balance the two is going to be the
key to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, for now, are demanding the right of all
Palestinian refugees to return to their original homes in the West
Bank, Gaza or Israel, and to receive compensation. Arafat feels he
must make this demand to prevent the refugees now living in
Lebanon, Syria and Jordan from scuttling any final peace. And
Barak, for now, is offering a deal in which the vast majority of
settlers will get to stay where they are in the West Bank _ and
only a few isolated settlements would be uprooted. Barak hopes that
by letting most of the settlers stay they won't block a deal to
create a Palestinian state in the rest of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak refuses to accept any Palestinian refugees back into
Israel. He is counting on
</P>
<P>
   Arafat absorbing some of them into the West Bank and Gaza, and
the rest being taken by the Arab states. What Barak seems to be
figuring is that in the crunch, with the balance of power so much
in Israel's favor, Arafat will have to eat most of the Jewish
settlers in the West Bank, without Barak having to eat any of the
refugees inside Israel. But it is not going to be so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the painful conversation Barak and Arafat are about to
have. Barak will say to Arafat: ``If you want to get a state, you
need to help me with my political problem, and that is the
settlers. You've got to eat most of them. And anyway, that's the
price you have to pay for launching a war against us in 1967.'' And
Arafat will reply: ``If you want me to help you with your political
problem, you have to help me with mine. You have to radically
reduce the number of settlers in the West Bank and the amount of
territory you keep there for security so that I have room to settle
the refugees. And you are going to have to take at least a symbolic
number of refugees back into the Israel proper _ if I have to take
some settlers. I can't help you solve your political problem if you
can't help me solve mine.``
</P>
<P>
   As Cohen notes: ``Either Arafat and Barak agree that both the
settlers and refugees are not going to be accommodated very much in
a final deal, or they will have to acknowledge that the final deal
is going to go beyond pragmatic partition and include some
recognition of each other's original ideological claims _ that the
Jews are connected to all of the Land of Israel and the
Palestinians are connected to all of Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the core trade-off, and, as I said, this is dynamite.

 &HT;    Bisek: Affair with Gingrich affair began 6 years ago
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (w) Washington and (p) Political categories.)
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt Gingrich's paramour testified Tuesday that her
affair with the former speaker dates back six years.
</P>
<P>
   But not once, Callista Bisek told lawyers in Gingrich's divorce
case, did the leader of the Republican Revolution send her flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek, an aide to the House Agriculture Committee, answered
questions under oath in a suburban Virginia law office for more
than two hours. She is at the center of Gingrich's demand for a
divorce from his wife of 18 years, Marianne.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek refused to discuss her sex life with Gingrich, the lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Bresnahan, Bisek's lawyer, said she advised her client
not to answer questions that could expose her to ``infamy, ridicule
or personal contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Evans, one of Gingrich's lawyers, has said the couple's
relationship is ``intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bisek answered everything else she was asked, including that she
knows very little about Gingrich's finances, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Gingrich had only recently given her any gifts of
monetary value, Gingrich's lawyers said. Prominent among these were
a set of Callaway Golf clubs, including a Big Bertha driver, which
they valued at $1,300.
</P>
<P>
   She also received a pearl ring in June. ``Not even a really nice
ring,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also gave Bisek a recording of Christmas songs and one
of classical music, a piece of luggage and a few books.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not Valentino-type things,'' said Tom Browning,
Gingrich's other lawyer in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Bisek elicited a chuckle when Browning asked whether
Gingrich ever sent flowers and she said he had not.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning took place amid a legal battle between lawyers
for the Gingriches and it was unusual in that only his lawyers
attended. The deposition was not recorded on videotape, and the
lawyers said they would ask the court to seal the transcript from
public view.
</P>
<P>
   John Mayoue, who represents Marianne Gingrich, said a scheduling
conflict kept him from the session, which he called ``a ploy and a
sham'' to avoid a more adversarial deposition that would be
preserved on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen a husband in a divorce case attempt to
depose his own girlfriend?'' Mayoue said in a telephone interview
after the questioning had concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But Evans said Mayoue may have lost the chance to question Bisek
by staying away Tuesday. A Washington judge will decide Nov. 23
whether Bisek must answer Mayoue's questions and produce gifts and
other items that document the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   As both sides' positions hardened, Evans said he received notice
Tuesday of a mandatory mediation session that has been scheduled
for Dec. 16
</P>
<P>
   Bisek would not talk to reporters. But she told the lawyers that
their relationship began in November 1993, more than a year before
Gingrich became speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   In Evans' view, the date is significant because Gingrich has
asserted that he and his wife were legally separated at the time.
Also in 1993, the Gingriches made an offer to buy a home in east
Cobb County and vacationed together in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said that those occurrences were not inconsistent with
their separation. ``They continued to attend functions together,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Evans conceded that Gingrich's relationship with Bisek
continued unabated, even after the Gingriches eventually bought a
house in Cobb and he assumed the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anybody's proud of the existence of the
relationship,'' Evans said. ``But I think that, given the
circumstances here, it's a little different, where you had a legal
separation and something developed between two people. Every person
I think will have to make their own assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich told his wife of his affair when he phoned her at her
mother's home in Ohio on May 10. He did not say then when the
relationship began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marianne obviously is shocked and distressed,'' Mayoue said.
``We are disappointed that Mr. Gingrich chose to actively conceal
this relationship from his wife, particularly for such a long
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers are due in court in Cobb County, Ga., on Thursday to
argue about the Gingriches' finances. Newt Gingrich will not attend
the court session, Evans said.

LOOKING AT ANCIENT EGYPT, SEEING MODERN AMERICA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DEBORAH WEISGALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Egypt in Boston'' is what five of this city's
cultural institutions call their thematic collaboration this year,
described as a pioneering venture into ``cultural tourism'' and
``an unprecedented look at Egyptian culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharaohs of the Sun: Ikhnaton, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen,'' at
the Museum of Fine Arts, provides the focus. The result is an
instructive pastiche, one that provides fewer clues to ancient
Egypt than to the tastes and preoccupations of contemporary
America.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Lyric Opera, whose general director, Janice Mancini
del Sesto, instigated the collaboration, will perform ``Aida'' by
Verdi, ``Akhnaten'' by Philip Glass (in a co-production with the
Lyric Opera of Chicago) and ``The Magic Flute'' by Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Ballet will stage a newly choreographed ``Cleopatra''
and the Museum of Science is showing the IMAX film ``Mysteries of
Egypt'' as well as presenting ``Virtual Egypt,'' a show that
provides computer tours of archaeological sites and tombs.
</P>
<P>
   As a marketing device, Egypt is as old as its mummies; the
exportation of its gods and their physical embodiments as works of
art has been a thriving industry for a couple of millenniums. Even
for the ancient Greeks, Egypt's art, myths and history stretched
back into infinite generations, and despite the 18th century's
pursuit of rationality, Egypt retained its mystical aura;
entertainments with Egyptian themes constituted almost a genre in
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Flute'' and ``Aida'' continue to influence our
perceptions of ancient Egypt, keeping alive 18th- and 19th-century
notions of that civilization, while ``Akhnaten'' addresses
20th-century preoccupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `The Magic Flute,' Mozart invented a religion with an
Egyptian flair,'' says Robert Levin, the Dwight P. Robinson Jr.
professor of humanities at Harvard. ``It was designed as a smoke
screen for the ideas of freemasonry, with its radical notions of
political equality. Mozart's agenda included magic and low comedy,
along with a sophisticated philosophical program. It was intended
to cross class barriers, and it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest sets for ``The Magic Flute'' made use of drawings
documenting newly explored monuments along the Nile, as European
scholars began to unravel the intricacies of ancient Egyptian
history. Seventy-one years later, the Ottoman ruler of Cairo
commissioned ``Aida'' to mark the city's entrance into modern
history; the opera was to commemorate the opening of the Suez Canal
and inaugurate the Cairo opera house.
</P>
<P>
   Verdi refused the commission twice, dismissing Egypt as a
country with ``a civilization I have never been able to admire.''
What changed his mind was a hefty sum of money combined with a
compelling scenario _ a modern, historical tale of imperialism and
passion, as opposed to Mozart's enlightenment parable of good and
evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida'' was concocted by Auguste Mariette, an eminent
Egyptologist, the overseer of research into Egyptian antiquities
and the founder of the Ancient Egyptian Museum in Bulaq, whose
collections formed the basis of the Cairo Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Mariette not only outlined the opera's story but designed the
sets, costumes and jewelry, then went to Paris to oversee their
construction. When the seamstresses could not get the costumes
right, Mariette sewed one himself. The opera's historical accuracy,
he believed, would be crucial to its success.
</P>
<P>
   Mariette's letters describe his efforts to balance his
re-creations of ancient garments with the requirements of
contemporary singers, and he worried about the appearance of the
cast. By contract, French singers had to shave their facial hair to
suit a part.
</P>
<P>
   Italian singers did not, and Mariette fretted about how
ridiculous their goatees and mustaches would appear beneath his
meticulously researched headdresses. All went well, however, and
the opera, its irresistible alloy of historical realism and doomed
love galvanized by great music, scored a huge success in Cairo in
1871.
</P>
<P>
   ``Akhnaten,'' Philip Glass' minimalist opera, also depends on an
aura of historical accuracy for its drama; the work casts the
pharaoh as the founder of monotheistic religion. Whether he was
remains an unanswerable question, yet the connection between
Ikhnaton and Moses, who was raised as an Egyptian prince, remains
tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' opera uses letters, poems and decrees from Ikhnaton's
time _ texts written and sung in Akkadian, the language of
Mesopotamia, Egyptian and biblical Hebrew. But its concerns are
ours. Roots, origins, existential questions of belief: Was Ikhnaton
a proto-Jew? And the opera tells its story in a postmodern way, in
fragments ``much as we might learn about Akhnaten and his time,''
Glass writes, ``from the partially told story revealed in the
exhibition cases of modern museums.'' We live in an age of
evidence; we crave proof, even of what is beyond proving, even of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   These questions of faith make Egypt, with its grandeur and
confidence, so compelling. In Rome, at the time Christianity was
spreading, cults of Isis also attracted many followers, especially
among the disenfranchised, who were drawn to its myths of
resurrection and life after death.
</P>
<P>
   The mysteries of human existence have not changed since the Old
Kingdom pharaohs planned for eternity inside their pyramids. They
simply didn't believe in endings, in the certainty of dust to dust.
And even 21st-century cultural tourists, who understand that the
sun will die, share that ancient and profound desire for permanence
in the face of all evidence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seemed to be magic. Music burst forth from two
dozen string and wind instruments in perfect synchronization,
without a conductor to summon it.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, during a break, the business school students who
had been watching the chamber orchestra rehearse had the same
question: How did you all start playing at the same moment? ``Body
gestures,'' Eriko Sato, the first violinist on the piece,
Telemann's ``Water Music,'' said as she shrugged her shoulders to
demonstrate. The musicians watch one another closely, they
explained, and as each new movement begins, they know where to look
for their cue.
</P>
<P>
   This is Orpheus, the orchestra with no conductor and the
ultimate flat, nonhierarchical organization. Its members had come
to the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College, the only
MBA-granting public school in New York City, to explain how they
won three Grammys this year and have become an annual fixture at
Carnegie Hall without ever having an onstage boss.
</P>
<P>
   It was a compelling sight: Artists who make about $30,000 a year
teaching would-be executives who will bring home twice that in
their first year out of school. But Orpheus has more in common with
some of America's largest companies than the casual observer might
think. The group has become a living, and entertaining, microcosm
of a management theory that has been transforming Corporate America
throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred first by the corporate downsizing that began the decade
and then by the Internet explosion that is ending it, hundreds of
American companies are trying to become ``flatter'' by removing
management layers between top executives and people in the field.
The movement began as an effort to cut costs, but it has picked up
steam, even during the current economic expansion, as executives
try to reshape their companies to react quickly to technological
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is becoming the most important criterion for growth and
survival,'' said C.K. Prahalad, a professor at the University of
Michigan Business School who has advised Citicorp and Oracle.
``That is taking decision-making and accountability to levels that
are closest to the business.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 survey of large companies by the Center for Effective
Organizations at the University of Southern California found that
78 percent had removed at least one layer of management in the
previous decade, while 14 percent reported getting rid of at least
three.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of flatter structures are some of the
best-performing companies of the 1990s, like Wal-Mart and Cisco
Systems. ``The more nodes in a communications link, the more likely
it is that bad information goes up to the top,'' said Steven Kerr,
the vice president for leadership development at General Electric,
which has tried to remove management layers. At their worst,
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kerr added, bureaucratic organizations can resemble the
childhood game of telephone, in which children line up and pass a
whispered message from one to the next, only to have the end result
barely resemble the original statement.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus _ named for a mythological Greek character whose
beautiful music tamed wild beasts _ has never needed to eliminate
layers because, onstage at least, it has never had any. Julian
Fifer, a cellist, and a few friends founded the group in 1972 with
the aim of replicating the give-and-take of small chamber music
groups in the larger setting of a chamber orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   For every piece, a core group of musicians meets to decide how
to play it. The first violinist, known as the concertmaster,
typically leads the rehearsals, distilling the core group's plan
into one voice. During pauses, other musicians call out
suggestions, or objections, and hold smaller debates within their
section of the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   When disagreements arise, Orpheus members try to talk them out
until they reach a consensus. Failing that, they take a vote.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not always smooth sailing. Last year, Fifer, who had
stopped playing with the group in 1990, stepped down as its
executive director, a job in which he oversaw the group's schedule
and business matters. His resignation came after he had clashed
with group members who thought Orpheus was spending too much time
on international tours.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Without a conductor to make final decisions, smaller matters can
be tricky, too. At the Zicklin School rehearsal, the students
noticed that some musicians had spoken much more often than others
and wondered whether more outgoing people had too big a say in
decisions. Many of the musicians smiled, to acknowledge that this
was an issue, but said they tried to speak up frequently only when
they were members of the core group.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, however, they are not shy about offering criticism.
At Zicklin, for example, violinist Nardo Poy stood up at one point
and said, ``I know it's water music, but it sounds like it's a
little at sea.'' At another break, Ms. Sato politely but firmly
dismissed a criticism by waving her hand and saying, ``We are
working on this.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a standard orchestra, where the conductor is king, such
give-and-take is virtually unheard of. Much as a corporate vice
president's word can be final in a highly structured company,
musicians do not question a conductor during rehearsal. One result
is a message that is clear but, Orpheus members say, stifles
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Jolles, a violinist who plays with the group frequently,
said, ``When you play with a conductor, it's easy to sit there and
do what you're told.'' Orpheus members, by contrast, are willing to
lend advice to other musicians, knowing that critiquing the
performance is not the job solely of one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orpheus gives every individual the opportunity to lead,'' said
Harvey Seifter, the current executive director. ``But it also
creates an imperative that everyone pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   That seeming contradiction has helped the group land consulting
gigs. Earlier this year, Kraft Foods invited Orpheus to its
Illinois headquarters in an attempt to teach product managers to be
more honest about their disagreements, Seifter said. And over the
next two years, the orchestra will hold seminars for hospital
administrators in the United States and for companies in Berlin and
Paris. Eventually, Seifter said, 10 percent of the orchestra's
income could come from such activities.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, for their part, are hoping that shedding bureaucracy
will help them replicate the connection that Orpheus members, who
often devote hours to hashing out musical decisions, feel to the
group. That connection can reduce employee turnover, which has
become a crucial issue for businesses as the unemployment rate has
fallen to its lowest level in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sturman Industries, a mechanical-valve designer in Woodland
Park, Colo., might be considered the Orpheus of the corporate
world. The 140-person company is split into 12 functional groups,
each with a coordinator who oversees administrative functions and
can make final decisions when a consensus is unreachable. Other
than the coordinators and the company's president, Carol Sturman,
nobody has a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the easy route,'' Ms. Sturman said, because people
are used to working in a more structured environment and are
sometimes confused about what to do. But it has paid off: Sales at
Sturman, a privately held company, are expected to increase 60
percent this year. And since moving to Colorado from California
three years ago, the company said it had lost only four employees,
a remarkable retention rate in the current labor market.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward flatter organizations shows little sign of
abating. Management textbooks, which once extolled
``seven-by-seven'' companies that had seven levels of management
and assigned seven workers to most managers, now trumpet the
elimination of hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Business schools besides Zicklin are training their students to
work in a less structured world, too. At the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania, for example, Professor Michael Useem
has brought an improvisational acting group into his classroom and
led a group of MBA's on trekking trips in the Himalayas, all with
an eye to better understanding how less structured groups interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a hierarchical structure, you can get away with
having managers who get people to do things because of their
position,'' said Mike Jenner, who teaches leadership at the
University of Chicago. The more relevant question now, he said, is
``how can you manage the performance of others when you don't have
the power over them?''

 &HT;    Rift threatens King papers
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The purchase of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
private papers appears dead in Congress due to growing concerns
over cost, copyright control and removing the papers from other
collections held at the King Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The House was considering giving the Library of Congress
permission to purchase the slain civil rights leader's papers from
the King family for $20 million, about $10 million less than the
appraised value. After authorizing the purchase, Congress would
need to find the money to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial legislation, authored by Rep. Jim Clyburn
(D-S.C.), ran into trouble when Republican lawmakers raised
objections over setting precedent in buying the papers for the
largest sum ever spent by the library for a collection.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to that reservation are a number of Republican and
Democratic lawmakers who believe that if the papers are purchased,
the King family should not be allowed to retain control over the
lucrative copyright of the material.
</P>
<P>
   And even those who marched side by side with King during the
civil rights movement questioned why the papers were being
purchased, not donated.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that the NAACP, the Urban League and a number
of civil rights veterans have already donated their papers to the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars also objected, saying it would undermine the historic
value of the papers to separate King's private papers from the
collections held at the King Center.
</P>
<P>
   The King Center's documents include the works of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to move legislation forward when you have
questions from a broad band of people,'' said Rep. Bill Thomas
(R-Calif.), chairman of the House Administration Committee, which
oversees the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas plans to hold a hearing when Congress returns in January
to air the variety of viewpoints that have arisen.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he wants the Library of Congress to own the papers,
but he wants to settle the issues that have cropped up before any
purchase is authorized.
</P>
<P>
   The King family did not respond Tuesday to questions about the
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have legislation that raises more questions than it
answers, it's not ripe for passage,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing would be to give Congress a greater understanding of
what it is actually buying, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn introduced the legislation on Sept. 28 to take advantage
of what he called a ``window of opportunity'' to buy the papers
from the family. His goal was to keep King's papers intact at the
Library of Congress, rather than scattered throughout the country
in some public auction sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shame,'' said Clyburn, who had hoped Congress would
have authorized and financed the purchase before the House's
targeted adjournment date of today.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate unanimously passed a similar measure two weeks ago
after stipulating that private funds would be considered for the
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn, whose measure is co-sponsored by Georgia's Democratic
Reps. Sanford Bishop, John Lewis and Cynthia McKinney, said the
papers are a ``national treasure'' that should be preserved at all
costs.
</P>
<P>
   He is dismayed at the opposition to the purchase, especially the
repeated suggestion that the King family is ``cashing in'' on the
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they are trying to say that the family tried to profit off
of his name. My Lord, what did those children get when he was
assassinated?'' said Clyburn, who worked with King. When King won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, he gave away the prize money to
civil rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a father of three daughters, the only problem I had with
King was that he didn't secure his children's future,'' Clyburn
said. ``This is something the nation ought to own.''
</P>
<P>
   Race is an issue in the purchase, Clyburn said, noting that the
federal government is considering paying the family of former
President Richard Nixon $30 million for papers that were seized by
Congress after he resigned from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a private, non-black family, we wouldn't be
having these discussions,'' Clyburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he was disappointed that the legislation was killed.
``It is my hope that in a different climate, a different
environment, that Congress will authorize the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis wants Congress to consider purchasing the SCLC and
SNCC papers in addition to King's personal papers.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises the question of what would be left at the King
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is the end,'' Lewis said. ``I hope the
family will be patient and give the supporters an opportunity to
regroup and address what happens to the other papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayborne Carson Jr., a Stanford University history professor
who is editing a 14-volume set of King's papers, said in an ideal
world papers as important as the King papers would be donated to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   But Carson asks if the Nixon family is going to get public
funds, why shouldn't the family of a national hero such as King? He
said the request for money is not unreasonable and should be
funded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a private family that own something of national
importance for less than the appraised value, it would be the end
of story,'' Carson said. ``Had it not been the King family, it
would have been the end of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   If the King papers leave Atlanta, the question should be asked
whether all of the papers should leave the King Center and be
housed under one roof at the Library of Congress, Carson said.

VAN DYCK AT 400: A TENDER AND A MODERN TOUCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be a form of colonialism to claim the art of earlier
periods as proto-modern, to use it primarily as a mirror of our own
time, as further affirmation of our accomplishments and character.
But every period looks for company and precedents, for connections
with the past. And it's usually more humbling than
self-aggrandizing to realize that things considered particular to
one's own era came into being much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, Anthony Van Dyck's portraits, which dominate an
exhibition at the Royal Academy in London until Dec. 10 on the
400th anniversary of his birth, provide marvelous company while
delivering a bit of a millennial comeuppance. Who knew that
portraits made in the early 16th century could feel quite so
immediate and of the moment?
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways that these paintings might qualify as
modern, not all of them good. When you look at Van Dyck's double
portrait of the Stuart brothers, posed with exaggerated nonchalance
in shimmering silks, cascading curls and fancy boots, you may want
to give him credit for the high-gloss fashion spread. If the word
fop didn't exist before this painting was made, it surely did
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   And when you read in more than one place that Van Dyck's
portraits of Charles I were highly effective tools of propaganda
that balanced the human and the regal in just the right way, you
may also see the artist not only as the ancestor to society
portraitists from John Singer Sargent to Andy Warhol, which he
certainly was, but also as one of the first modern image handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Both reactions sell him short, but also point in the general
direction of his true achievement: Van Dyck revealed his sitters
with a relaxed immediacy that was rare if nonexistent in European
painting up to that point, and he did so with an odd combination of
flamboyance and restraint, of stupendous technical skills and
self-effacing empathy.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists had been masters of exacting if somewhat stiff
verisimilitude _ van Eyck, Durer and Holbein most obviously. Still
others produced paintings animated by human gesture, physical
spontaneity and extreme expressions _ for example, Brueghel,
Caravaggio and Hals, each in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   But in many of his portraits, Van Dyck put these things together
with an unusual lack of fuss and fireworks, a kind of mundaneness
that still speaks to us. The main movement in his work is that of
the beating heart, of the living, breathing body and its
personality in a calm quiet space, in communion with someone else
in the picture, or with the artist himself.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyck's best pictures are found throughout his compressed,
fast-moving career, which is laid out in chronological order in
this show, according the cities in which he worked. In the first
two galleries your jaw may drop: most of the 24 paintings on view
were made during his teenage years in Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   He had been born there in 1599 to a family of wealthy,
artistically inclined textile merchants who quickly recognized that
they had a prodigy on their hands. By age 10 he was apprenticed to
the city's leading painter; by 17 he had his own studio and a
roster of students. Two years later he was the most valued
assistant of Rubens, specializing in painting heads.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyck's ability to capture engaging expressions that draw us
in is already manifest. In a small portrait of Cornelis van der
Geest, dean of the merchants' guild and an important collector, the
face of a thin, intelligent man quietly sizes us up.
</P>
<P>
   In a sweetly complex family portrait, a young father, seated
slightly behind his attentive baby daughter and calmly contained
wife, leans forward with an air of discreet, sadness-tinged
urgency, as if he knows the portrait is an attempt to capture a
moment that cannot be held.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1621, Van Dyke left Antwerp. He traveled briefly to London
and then spent six years in Genoa, Palermo and Rome, painting
worldly Italian aristocrats and their families, while studying the
works of Titian in their collections. His skills became even more
assured, but rarely are his subjects burdened with ostentatious
displays of style, technique or temperament.
</P>
<P>
   In front of his ``Man in Armor,'' from his Genoa phase, the
rendering of the finely worked breastplate accented with vivid red
velvet ribbon is astounding, but quietly so, without a hint of
bravura or flourish. It doesn't distract from the man's solid
emotional appeal: his strong, intelligent face, proud gaze and
neatly cropped white hair. And in the portrait of Maddalena
Cattaneo, the artist's famed sympathy for children shows itself in
the conflicting mix of curiosity and shyness playing across her
angelic face.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Van Dyck's reputation was preceding him. When he
returned to London in 1632, Charles I, one of the leading
connoisseurs of his age, wasted no time; he appointed Van Dyck his
court painter, gave him a title and placed a house on the Thames
and a country estate at his disposal. Except for brief periods in
Antwerp and Brussels, Van Dyck remained there until he died,
probably of the plague, in 1641 at the age of 42.
</P>
<P>
   In London, his art came into full bloom, inspired by the
relatively relaxed atmosphere and freer, more colorful fashions of
the English court. The show's grand finale is a long gallery
containing 20 of these often spellbinding paintings, with several
double portraits of men being the most weirdly alluring.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyck's English double portraits have the intimacy and
unguarded feeling of some modern pictures, both paintings and
photographs. They capture infinitesimally thin slices of life in
which thoughts or feeling pass between two people and ricochet
outward in the manner of Degas's paintings of the Bellelli family
or Manet's subtly erotic tete-a-tete, ``In the Conservatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most fascinating are ``Thomas Kiligrew and a Man `not
known certainly''' and ``Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Stafford, with
Sir Philip Mainwearing.'' In each the principal character looks
outward, while the other man looks on, waiting to resume an
interrupted exchange that seems have been been broken by a wave of
sadness in Kiligrew and by a bit of alarming news in the case of
the clearly distressed Wentworth. (His companion waits, pen in
hand, as if to take dictation.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these might be called personal history paintings.
Kiligrew, a playwright and courtier, had just lost his wife.
Wentworth, an important politician who changed his allegiance from
parliament to the king as England was sliding toward civil war, had
just received a letter pressing him into the king's service, an act
for which he would soon be tried for treason and executed.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyck is often condemned as light or frivolous. ``Silly
paintings of silly people'' was the response of one critic when I
mentioned I'd seen the London show. But, like Mozart's, Van Dyck's
art is not so much light or silly as exquisitely, rather modestly
perfect. Its effortless clarity offers no resistance; it does not
instruct, moralize or overbear; it does not get in the way. If its
content came down to one word, that word would be tenderness.

2 VETERANS OF REVOLUTIONS PAST SEE ANOTHER MILESTONE, A PAPAL MASS
IN GEORGIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia _ Ten years to the day after the collapse of
the Berlin Wall, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze did
something that was unthinkable 10 years ago, when he was foreign
minister of the Soviet Union. He sat in the audience at a Mass
celebrated by John Paul II before 7,000 people and jumped out of
his seat and warmly kissed the pope on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the two men who helped prod the fall of communism held
hands going upstairs to meet privately at the presidential
residence. The Georgian president thanked the pope for his pivotal
role. The pope replied, ``You too played a part.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a poignant reunion for two elderly leaders who along with
Czech President Vaclav Havel, are the only veterans of that
tumultuous era left in office.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope's visit to Georgia is also a milestone in
Catholic church history. It is the first papal visit to the
Caucasus and only the second time a pope has set foot in a
predominantly Orthodox country in more than 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who dreams of reconciling the two Christian churches,
came to Georgia to build on the momentum he started in Romania last
May, where he held breakthrough joint services with the Orthodox
patriarch of Romania.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, which began in India, has taken a toll on the aging
pope, who shows symptoms of Parkinson's disease. He shivered under
stiff winds at a runway airport arrival ceremony even after Vatican
aides wrapped him in a red cape and formed a phalanx to block the
wind. That evening at an Orthodox cathedral he was so shaky the
patriarch had to grab his arm and help him to the altar.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, told reporters on Tuesday
that the pope had caught a ``big chill'' on Monday but had no
fever, slept well and got up Tuesday morning at 5:30. By the time
the pope did his last event, a visit to the Church of Saints Peter
and Paul, the pope had rallied enough to make friendly jokes with
local nuns.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II's reception from the Georgian Orthodox Church has
been cordial but guarded. There are deep differences between Roman
Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church, including the primacy
and infallibility of the papacy, differences which date back to the
schism of 1054. Orthodox leaders fear that Catholic missionaries
seek to proselytize in their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Patriarch Ilia II nor his bishops attended the Mass, and
church officials had warned their followers that it was against
Orthodox canon law to take part in a Catholic service. Asked if he
thought the two churches had grown closer during the visit,
Patriarch Ilia told reporters that ``Georgia and the Vatican were
closer but rapprochement between the churches would be decided by
all Orthodox faith branches'' and not by the Georgian Church alone.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Mass was a starkly plain service, with tiny red
candles lined up on bleachers behind the altar serving as a
religious decor. The pope did not flinch when a shepherd in
traditional Caucasian costume kneeled and placed a lamb on the
floor before communion. The pope made a sign of the cross over it.
</P>
<P>
   There were many Orthodox believers at the Mass Tuesday who
showed no remorse for their violation of church rules.
Shevardnadze, who was baptized in 1992, the year he was elected as
head of state, was one. Svetlana Chkhvimiani, a 23-year-old
Georgian woman was another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very interested in seeing this, it's like a wonderful
performance,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican spokesman said the pope was not bothered by the
guarded reception. ``We knew the problems before we left Rome,''
Navarro-Valls told reporters at the Mass. ``But a door has been
opened, and we have to wait and see what happens next.''

SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER CREATES FUROR OVER AIDS DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The South African government is embroiled in a
deepening crisis of credibility after President Thabo Mbeki said
his administration could not approve giving the anti-AIDS drug AZT
to pregnant woman because it may be toxic.
</P>
<P>
   The claim, which runs counter to a body of international
scientific research, has baffled local and foreign AIDS
specialists. It is the latest in a long series of hostile and
contradictory positions of South African officials against the
drug, and raises new doubts about Mbeki's seriousness in combating
the epidemic, growing faster in this country than anywhere else in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the controversy, health officials and AIDS
specialists say, lies a bitter dispute between South African
officials and powerful pharmaceutical companies, most notably AZT
manufacturer Glaxo Wellcome. It may also reflect Mbeki's deep
resentment at dependence on the wealthier West to solve African
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very frustrating,'' said Saul Johnson, a physician
studying the effectiveness of AZT on pregnant women in Soweto. ``It
sets us back again and takes the focus off the main thing, which
is: What is the government doing about the epidemic? We are
dilly-dallying around this question of toxicity while more children
become infected.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the government's concern over the debacle, Mbeki's
top advisers _ normally known for their reticence _ have been
clamoring to defend the toxicity claim through the country's
opinion pages and airwaves. Senior health officials, meanwhile,
sealed themselves off from the media, saying that Health Minister
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang had imposed a gag order. The minister
denies doing so.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage has been done. Some scientists have threatened to
boycott an important international AIDS conference scheduled to
take place in the South African city of Durban next year unless the
government changes its position on AZT. And one state medic, who
already faces disciplinary action for criticizing the previous
health minister, laid charges against Tshabalala-Msimang before
South Africa's Human Rights Commission for endangering the lives of
thousands of unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that AZT didn't work. We heard it was not cost
effective. Now we hear it is toxic. How many more excuses do we
need to hear?'' asked Mark Lurie, an AIDS specialist at South
Africa's Medical Research Council. ``This coming from a national
government that is incapable and unwilling to deal with the HIV
epidemic. Let's wear red ribbons, close our eyes, and hope it goes
away. That's the strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the National Council of Provinces in Cape Town
on Oct. 28, Mbeki said there ``exists a large volume of scientific
literature alleging that, among other things, the toxicity of (AZT)
is such that it is in fact a danger to health. These are matters of
great concern to the government as it would be irresponsible for us
not to heed the dire warnings which medical researchers have been
making.''
</P>
<P>
   That Mbeki is driving the latest resistance to AZT, and that
concern over toxicity may be little more than a smokescreen, became
clearer Tuesday in a private meeting between senior health
officials and executives of Glaxo Wellcome. According to Peter
Moore, Glaxo's medical director for Southern Africa,
Tshabalala-Msimang ``did not raise any specific safety concerns and
reiterated that they were only following the president's
instructions to investigate all issues pertaining to AZT.''
</P>
<P>
   Other questions about the validity of the toxicity claim arise
from the government's own record. Former health minister Nkosazana
Zuma sought ways to import the drug at lower prices and raised
issues of effectiveness, but never safety. At the same time, she
and Mbeki supported local research into a drug called Virodene,
which included industrial agents and has been widely condemned by
the international scientific community as dangerous and
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   International research shows that AZT can cut the transmission
of HIV from mother to child by as much as 50 percent. UNAIDS, the
World Health Organization, and the Food and Drug Administration all
recognize the efficacy of AZT treatment for HIV-positive pregnant
women. Tshabalala-Msimang and other South African officials say,
however, that research conducted in other countries does not apply
in southern Africa, where many women breastfeed and nutrition is
often poor. She says the government cannot endorse the drug without
more research.
</P>
<P>
   But many South African concerns already have been addressed.
Zuma claimed AZT was too expensive, but by her own estimates, a
nationwide program to provide AZT to HIV-pregnant women, along with
counseling, testing, and infant formula for newborns, would cost
less that 1 percent of the total annual health budget. And that
calculation was made before Glaxo Wellcome offered to cut the price
of AZT to South Africa by 75 percent for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Most AIDS experts in South Africa agree that, with roughly 100
children born HIV-positive every day, cutting infections among
newborns with AZT is less expensive than treating some for AIDS
later.
</P>
<P>
   Research has been and is being conducted in South Africa on AZT
and mother-to-child transmission. A three-year multinational study
sponsored by UNAIDS conducted from 1996 to 1999 showed that AZT
cuts transmission by 37 to 50 percent. Two of the sites and 52
percent of the patients were in South Africa. The study indicated
no clinically significant side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Many speculate that Mbeki formulated his concerns about toxicity
based on documents pulled from the Internet. Parks Mankahlana, the
president's spokesman, vehemently denies this. When asked to cite
the research reviewed by Mbeki, he instead attacked the validity of
Western findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency to think that anything done in the US or
Britain has to be right,'' he said. ``The president has questioned
the conventional wisdom.''

STUDENT-REBEL MOVIE EARNS HIGH MARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The setting of the better-than-average ghetto drama, ``Light It
Up,'' is a hellhole of an overcrowded Queens high school with
abusive security guards, no textbooks to speak of, and broken
windows in the classrooms that let in the freezing winter wind.
</P>
<P>
   One day, after the institution's one idealistic, much-loved
teacher (Judd Nelson) is unfairly suspended by the over-stressed
principal (Glynn Turman), several students break under the strain,
and the incident leads to a small rebellion, which, in turn, leads
to a security guard (Forest Whitaker) being shot in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   In the melee, everyone panics, one of the students seizes the
guard's gun, and suddenly it's a hostage situation, with the
evacuation of most of the students and teachers, reporters and SWAT
teams lining the perimeter, a negotiator (Vanessa L. Williams) on
the phone and six kids inside holding a gun on the injured guard.
</P>
<P>
   The kids are Lester (Usher Raymond), a star athlete depressed by
the recent death of his father; Stephanie (Rosario Dawson), a
beautiful honor scholar; Ziggy (Richard Ri'chard), a sensitive
graffiti artist; Lynn (Sara Gilbert, of TV's ``Roseanne''), a
pregnant teen; Rivers (Clifton Collins Jr.), a part-time pusher;
and Rodney (Freddo Starr), a surly hood on the run from a rival
gang.
</P>
<P>
   As written and directed by the gifted writer (``Black Rain,''
``Straight Time'')-turned-director Craig Bolotin, the film has such
total sympathy for the hostage-takers, and sticks to its ``Rebel
Without a Cause'' stereotypes so closely, and resolves itself so
neatly, that it loses much of its bite along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But it has moments of effectiveness, some of the performances _
especially Whitaker and Robert Ri'chard _ are quite moving, and the
power-producer couple of Tracey E. Edmonds and Kenneth ``Babyface''
Edmonds (``Soul Food'') obviously have only the best of
community-minded, non-exploitative intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Light It Up. Directed and written by Craig Bolotin. Produced by
Tracey E. Edmonds. Cast: Usher Raymond, Forest Whitaker, Judd
Nelson, Vanessa L. Williams. Fox 2000 Pictures. 100 minutes. Rated
R for violence.

A YOUNG ACTRESS WITH LOTS OF CLASS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, Nov. 12 or thereafter) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Friday was more or less a typical day in the life of Ivy
League college freshman Natalie Portman. She had been out late the
night before watching a friend play jazz at a local club. She woke
early to take care of some schoolwork before her 9 o'clock class
and then zipped over to a local elementary school where, with some
of her classmates, she's teaching dance to fifth- and
sixth-graders. Following that, she had lunch with a friend, ran
some errands, returned to her dorm room and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so tired all the time,'' Portman says, (relatively) fresh
from a catnap. ``I sit down, and I end up falling asleep. It's
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, she's having the time of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Portman's collegiate journey (she asked that we not disclose the
name of her school) neatly parallels the theme of her new movie,
``Anywhere but Here,'' a comedy-drama about the evolving
relationship between a mother and daughter who try to start a new
life for themselves in Beverly Hills. Portman was 17 when she shot
the movie last summer, and, like her character, Ann, she was eager
to begin making her own way in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, she's just completely afire with college and
learning,'' says Susan Sarandon, who plays Portman's mother in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Portman (who uses her grandmother's last name in another nod to
privacy) has made quite a career for herself since being discovered
at a Long Island pizza parlor at age 11. Her resume includes ``The
Professional,'' ``Heat,'' Broadway's ``The Diary of Anne Frank''
and a little-known film from this past summer, ``Star Wars: Episode
I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this daughter of a infertility-specialist father and artist
mother isn't even sure if she wants to continue acting past her
commitment to the next two ``Star Wars'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised by anything she does,'' Sarandon says.
``She has an incredibly strong home life and a great sense of
self-esteem. There are a lot of good actresses her age, but she has
this core of dignity, health, grace and innate intelligence that's
a pretty formidable package when you put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Wayne Wang, who directed ``Anywhere but Here'': ``The movie
could not have been made without Natalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is interesting because Portman came close to skipping the
film altogether. She and her parents objected to a love scene that
had been adapted straight from the movie's source material, a novel
by Mona Simpson. When it became clear to Wang that he would lose
Portman if he didn't lose the scene, he rewrote it to everyone's
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Here Portman talks about why she doesn't have a hankering for
on-screen hanky-panky, how college cafeterias have challenged her
vegetarian lifestyle and why all those bad ``Star Wars'' reviews
didn't bother her in the least.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So I'm guessing you've established a fairly flexible curfew
for yourself as a college freshman.
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs) You could say that. You know, you learn. Certain
nights, I'll say, ``I'm not going to go out.'' And I think I can
handle a lot more than my parents imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your parents have a reputation for being loving and great,
but protective as well.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think I have the worst combination of things to have
protective parents. I'm an only child, I'm Jewish, and I'm an
actress. My parents are always worried about me when I go out,
because I could be potentially bothered by somebody. So to all of a
sudden be independent is obviously shocking _ and liberating. I
love being able to set my own curfew and my make my own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And have any of those decisions backfired on you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course! My school is known for kids staying up to all
hours of the morning doing work. So we stay up late, and we also
party pretty hard because there's so much school stuff going on
that we just have to have a release. The social aspect of all this
has just been amazing. I've made so many new friends.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Being a vegetarian, how are you coping with cafeteria food?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's hard to be a vegetarian at college. It's hard to be a
food-eater at college. The food here is disgusting. I shouldn't say
that, because it's hard to feed 1,500 mouths. But there are a lot
of restaurants in the area. I don't eat at school much.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Everyone always says you're so ``centered'' and ``together,''
which I find to be a little odd given that you just turned 18.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's kind of hard to come to terms with that, because all of
us know that we're not together. And especially for me, right now.
It's so confusing, this part of your life, because you have to
figure out what you want to do and what you want to be. Even things
like choosing your classes ... it all leads up to who you are going
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And the wrong choice might be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   A: You're faced with that every day. You're deciding how you
want to define yourself in a new situation. You don't know anybody,
and you're trying to present an image of yourself to people. And
you have to figure out who you are in order to do that, and that's
hard and confusing. So I'm definitely not always together, although
I think I know myself really well. I may not know what I want to do
with my life, but I know what I like and what I don't like.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And how does acting fit into the equation?
</P>
<P>
   A: I really appreciate being an actress. I think I'm learning to
love it more now that I'm in school. I'm learning how to control my
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What frustrates you about acting?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot of things. I have a real problem with love scenes. I
did my first one over the summer in this movie, ``Where the Heart
Is.'' And it was the best possible situation: I liked the director,
and I was really good friends with the guy, but there was nothing
going on between us. And we were both completely dressed under the
covers (laughs) and we didn't have to do anything explicit ... just
kissing and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you still freaked out?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was (BEGIN ITAL)so(END ITAL) uncomfortable. I just felt so
weird being told to kiss someone that I didn't want to kiss. I
almost felt whorish, being told what to do in a sexual way. I guess
if I had surrendered completely to my character, I wouldn't have
felt that way. But I couldn't. And I think it would be even harder
if I had a boyfriend. I was thinking, ``I hope I get married
someday, and then how would I feel?'' It would probably be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else about the business bugs you?
</P>
<P>
   A: The constant quest for approval. On one hand, it keeps me
going, trying to prove myself. But at the same time, it can be
really frustrating relying on other people's opinion of you. And
then there's this aspect of acting: In exchange for doing what you
do, you have to give away a big part of your privacy. People are
going to start recognizing you. And people can be very strange.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I assume you're talking specifically about ``Star Wars'' fans
here.
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, given the amount of hype surrounding the movie, the
backlash was nothing compared to what I thought it would be. I
didn't have any problems because of that film. Maybe it was all
that makeup my character wore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the critical backlash?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't really mind. I thought the movie was fun. I thought
it accomplished what it set out to accomplish, and I know a lot of
kids who liked it. The intended audience got it. Sometimes
reviewers are right, and sometimes they can be hideously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And next summer, it's back to being Queen Amidala.
</P>
<P>
   A: And off to Australia. And because I have that already set up,
I'm not reading any scripts. I'm in a little bubble here. I gave my
agent my phone number and told her, ``I only want you to call as a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you even been to a movie since school started?
</P>
<P>
   A: I couldn't even tell you what movies are out right now. It's
the first time in my life where I'm not even following that. I'm
just totally blind to the outside world. I read my daily newspaper,
and that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So it's Friday night. You're exhausted. Naturally, you'll be
going out with your friends.
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course I am! It's Friday night, and I've been working so
hard all week. I've earned it. Besides ... I can always study over
the weekend. &QL;

 &HT;    South atoning for racist murders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Across the South, according to a New York Times
survey, lawmen are taking a renewed interest in racially motivated
murder cases once thought too difficult to prosecute. That's a
gratifying trend, in sharp contrast with the selectively blind
brand of justice that prevailed in this region a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, witnesses could be unwilling or afraid to testify;
investigations often were compromised because local lawmen
sympathized with perpetrators or might even be implicated in racial
crimes themselves. And when the U.S. Justice Department stepped in
where local authorities wouldn't prosecute, white juries all too
frequently refused to convict white defendants.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a generation makes. The most heartening
contrast is that now the impetus for a day of reckoning comes not
from outside but from within the communities involved. Local
prosecutors and investigators, most of them white and most of them
children when these crimes occurred, are leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' says District Attorney Doug Jones, a
Birmingham native, ``to reopen a case and let the community know
that it's not forgotten . . . If you can bring it to closure,
everyone can finish the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   One big encouragement for Southern lawmen has been the success
in prosecuting two high-profile murder cases in Mississippi over
the last five years, ending with the convictions of Byron de la
Beckwith for the 1963 sniper-murder of Medgar Evers and of Sam
Bowers for the 1966 fire-bombing murder of Vernon Dahmer.
</P>
<P>
   There are other interesting factors at work helping to revive
once-moribund cases. The FBI is much more cooperative in sharing
relevant information than it was during the days of J. Edgar
Hoover, who tried to ruin Martin Luther King Jr. Witnesses are no
longer intimidated by the prospect of Klan retaliation, as they
once were. Some witnesses are even said to be eager to get what
they know about old crimes off their consciences as they approach
the end of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult obstacles remain. In some cases, memories are faulty;
witnesses are no longer living; files are skimpy; transcripts are
missing. Still, as long as there is a demonstrable will to do
justice, there may be a way.

PROCEPT GETTING INTO FUNERAL PLANNING VIA THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 11 years of trying to improve lives developing biotech
drugs to treat cancer and AIDS, Procept Inc. has decided there is a
bigger business opportunity in death, by showing funeral directors
how to knock on heaven's door using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a major strategic change, and some shareholders
called to ask why I was doing this, but financing biotech companies
is very difficult _ while the startup opportunities on the Internet
are tremendous,'' said John F. Dee, who took over as Procept's
president last year.
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday, the struggling Cambridge, Mass. biotech company
began transforming itself into an Internet business by signing an
agreement to acquire Heaven's Door Corp., of Coral Gables, Fla.,
which has developed a World Wide Web site (www.HeavenlyDoor.com)
for the funeral home industry. Terms of the agreement were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Procept's decision to veer away from risky biopharmaceutical
development and enter the fringes of the $25 billion a year funeral
business via the Internet came last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Procept, which was working on a gel to protect against
HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases, had bought
Pacific Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Diego. Pacific had a drug under
development to help patients overcome resistance to certain
chemotherapy to treat brain, colon and prostate cancers.
</P>
<P>
   But to continue work on both drugs, Procept needed to raise $5
million _ which proved difficult, Dee said, because of the
company's low stock-market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Dee, who spent six years as a McKinsey &AMP; Co. consultant before
joining Procept, said that was when he decided he could ``create
more shareholder value with the Internet and place the biotech
assets with a large pharmaceutical company.''
</P>
<P>
   Also helping to convince Procept management that there might be
more financially rewarding opportunities helping bury the dead was
Paramount Capital, a New York investment company and the company's
largest shareholder. As it happened, Paramount simultaneously was
raising money for privately held Heaven's Door Corp., which went on
line last year.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven's Door is among the early entrants in Internet funeral
planning, which includes Web links that help find local funeral
homes and cemeteries, carries on-line obituaries with photos, and
is planning such features as ``Grief Discussion Rooms,''
``Religious Counseling,'' and a ``Firefighters Memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee said he sees Procept in the business of helping people, both
with their struggles with disease and the grief that comes with
death. He recalled the sorrow that followed the death of his
stepfather, John H. Bush, a cofounder of Millipore Corp., last
year. ``I saw what this could do to a family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem to like the switch: Procept shares, traded on
Nasdaq, have risen from 1 1/2 in July to hit a 52-week high of 2
7/16 on Monday and closed Tuesday at 2 1/4.

A TWITCHY TAKE ON A TALE OF TERROR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dressed in a black suit, black-and-white striped
socks and windshield-size black sunglasses, his hair a nest of
gravity-defying tendrils, Tim Burton looks as if he has been sewn
together by a very chic Dr. Frankenstein.
</P>
<P>
   In his suite at the Regency Hotel here, after a day of
interviews to promote his film, ``Sleepy Hollow,'' he appears to be
equal parts funeral director, mad scientist and Swifty Lazar. He
does not mind jokes about his hair looking as if it has been combed
with a Mixmaster. He's just glad he has a head. By the end of his
new film, so few cast members do.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Washington Irving's classic ``The Legend of Sleepy
Hollow,'' this film is Burton's chance to make the kind of
semi-cheesy horror films produced by Hammer Films in England in the
1950s and '60s so revered by hipsters today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the kinds of movies that fed my soul,'' said
Burton, who is 41. ``They were my form of fairy tales.'' The film
reteams Burton for the third time with Johnny Depp, who plays
Ichabod Crane. The character is now a constable instead of a
teacher, but his jitteriness remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to keep the feeling of Ichabod,'' he says. ``This is
the first action hero who's played like a 13-year-old girl.'' In
Burton's hands, the story is retold as a battle between intellect
and evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a guy who's living in his head versus a guy with no
head,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Burton says he was feeling ``quite headless myself'' when he
decided to make this picture. The script, written by Andrew Kevin
Walker and doctored by an uncredited Tom Stoppard, arrived from the
producer after Burton had spent months working in vain on a new,
radical interpretation of ``Superman'' that was to have starred
Nicolas Cage. It never took flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I wasted a year and that's the worst feeling you
can have,'' Burton says. ``It was traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Revamping a classic short story instead of a classic superhero,
while equally ripe for Burton's visual flair, was a bit daunting.
``The only literary works I'd brought to the screen were comic
books,'' he said. ``I'd known the `Sleepy Hollow' story from school
and from the Disney cartoon. It had an interesting mix of humor and
spookiness, action and design, which I liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's ``Sleepy Hollow'' includes an homage to that animated
film, a scene in which a headless horseman, who is carrying a
jack-'o-lantern, chases Ichabod. ``The chase was one of my favorite
parts of any cartoon ever,'' he says. ``It was such a strong
visceral sequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Although set in upstate New York, this new ``Sleepy Hollow''
(which opens on Friday) was filmed in England, where Burton had
shot ``Batman'' 10 years earlier. ``My whole life,'' he says, ``I
never felt at home anywhere and I felt at home there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had intended to shoot the movie in picturesque
corners of New York State, he decided instead to build a village
from the ground up. Working with the production designer Rick
Heinrichs, Burton created his own Sleepy Hollow: ``We built this
forest, and we were filming in there, and it started to become an
actual forest. Bugs and birds started moving in.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York State of 1799 that he has dreamed up is more
expressionist than authentic. ``Dutch Colonialism doesn't
necessarily pack 'em in,'' he says. ``Candle dipping isn't the most
cinematic thing.'' And while there are special effects, Burton has
kept computer-generated images to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers seeing the 1998 version of ``Godzilla'' and
thinking how much better the laughably low-tech original was. ``I'd
rather see the guy in the suit,'' he says. Asked about the gore in
a film whose posters bear the slogan ``Heads Will Roll,'' Burton
laughs and says, ``He's a headless horseman, not an Avon lady.''
The film, however, is more bewitching than terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   The film marks Burton's latest collaboration with Depp, the
quirky heartthrob who has become the director's cinematic alter
ego. ``He's a great chameleon,'' said Burton. ``He's a major
transformer. He doesn't care how he looks. He usually wants to look
worse than you want him to look. I like those kinds of actors.''
Not a typical hero, as Ichabod Crane, Depp appears totally afraid _
a teacup clattering in his shaky hand; bedcovers pulled up over his
terrified head.
</P>
<P>
   Depp describes his working relationship with Burton as ``this
strange invisible tether.'' He continues: ``I feel a strong
connection with Tim and trust him completely. It's amazing to be
invited into his world.''
</P>
<P>
   The roles Burton has offered the actor _ a sharp-clawed
suburbanite with a heart of gold in ``Edward Scissorhands,'' the
angora-wearing auteur of notoriously bad movies in ``Ed Wood'' _
have resulted in some of Depp's most original work. ``When I got
the phone call for `Sleepy Hollow,''' says Depp, ``Tim didn't have
to finish the sentence. I'd have played Lady Van Tassel.''
</P>
<P>
   The two make a strange and interesting duo. ``Tim stands off set
and throws blood at Johnny and think it's the funniest thing that's
ever been,'' says Christina Ricci, who plays Katrina Van Tassel.
``You would think that someone who's been called a genius would be
a bit more pretentious, but he isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's stable is an odd mix of the young Hollywood and older
character actors with great faces and greater presence. The cast
includes Christopher Walken, Casper Van Dien and Martin Landau, who
won an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi in ``Ed Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Burton wanted to film in England was its trove of
actors like the stage star Michael Gambon and the Hammer Films
horror veteran Christopher Lee, who makes a cameo appearance.
``Those British actors are so great,'' says Burton. ``I really
enjoyed all of these people. It felt like a really high-class
version of the `Ed Wood' group. I saw them all in the same room and
I freaked out. It was surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From Burton, that is the highest compliment.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sleepy Hollow,'' as in all his work, Burton is drawn most
often to material in which a misfit triumphs. ``I'm still a
teenager in many ways,'' he says. ``That's where I'm at. I still
can't get over feeling different or feeling separate.'' Burton grew
up feeling out of place in Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Although he worked first as an animator at Disney, he achieved
notoriety with his 1985 directorial debut ``Pee-wee's Big
Adventure,'' a funhouse of a movie starring Pee-wee Herman, the
man-child alter ego of the comic actor Paul Reubens. ``It was the
perfect first movie for me to do,'' Burton says. The film allowed
him to marry high design and humorous fantasy _ his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later Burton unleashed the off-the-wall ghost comedy
``BeetleJuice'' starring Michael Keaton. Burton cast Sylvia Sidney
as a caseworker in the Hereafter who smokes cigarettes through her
neck. ``She scared me when I met her,'' he recalls. ``I thought,
`She's going to be mean to me.' But I loved her.'' (He cast her
again in his 1996 movie ``Mars Attacks,'' one of her last roles.)
</P>
<P>
   With ``Batman'' in 1989, Burton entered the big leagues. No
longer a carefree artist, he was given the responsibility of
guiding what would become a huge moneymaking franchise for Warner
Brothers. The film, starring Keaton as a brooding bat-winged
vigilante, was a hit, but the pressure took its toll on Burton, who
was ill during much of the filming. The 1992 sequel, ``Batman
Returns,'' was ``harder than the first one.'' By then, he says,
``the franchise mentality was firmly in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The sequel, which starred Danny DeVito as an ink-drooling
Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer as an erotically charged Catwoman, and
Christopher Walken as Max Schreck, was even darker than the first.
Its perverse excesses set off what Burton calls ``the darkness
backlash.'' Although the film did well at the box office, he was
not asked to direct the third and fourth films in the series:
``They didn't want me to do another one, which was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Free of ``Batman,'' Burton moved on to more personal films like
his 1990 fable ``Edward Scissorhands,'' starring Depp as a
mechanical boy whose creator dies before giving him human hands,
was praised for its originality and its candy-colored suburbia. ``I
spent four months east of Tampa in a second rate golf resort,''
Burton says. ``Talk about scary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Wood,'' his little-seen 1994 paean to the ultimate B-movie
director of works like ``Plan 9 From Outer Space,'' also mined
themes Burton understood. ``Thematically, I completely related to
it _ the delusional aspect of filmmaking.'' he says. ``You could be
making the biggest piece of junk in the world, but you think it's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he loves making movies, Burton says he abhors the
marketing and business aspects involved. At test screenings, for
instance, he says, ``I have out of body experiences _ I lose all
feeling.'' At that point, he is so close to the work that he isn't
able to judge or appreciate it: ``It takes me three to five years
to look at a movie and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course he understands the pressures to sell tickets _ and
tie-in merchandise, of which ``Sleepy Hollow'' will have its share.
``Any movie is money,'' he says, estimating that ``Sleepy Hollow''
cost between $60 million and $70 million. The pressure wasn't
always as intense, however. ``When you first start out, you're
flying below the radar, and that's liberating,'' Burton says.
</P>
<P>
   And success, he says, has made it harder to dazzle audiences:
``The element of surprise is gone. First, it's a surprise, then it
becomes an expectation.'' Ms. Ricci, who at 19 is in a filmmaker's
golden demographic, illustrates what he means. ``I was worried
about it not living up to its anticipation,'' she says, ``but it
did. My friend was writhing in her seat and doing all the normal
horror-movie things.''
</P>
<P>
   While he figures out what his next project will be _ this one
``has to get out of your system before you can get on to another,''
he says _ Burton will concentrate on his relationship with Lisa
Marie, an actress memorable for her performances as a big-haired
Martian in ``Mars Attacks'' and as the horror hostess Vampira in
``Ed Wood.'' They've been a couple for eight years. Are children in
their future? ``I could see that,'' Burton says. ``I'll try not to
scare them too much.''

REMEMBERING THE WOMEN WHO SERVED IN VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ Donna Lowery wore high heels, with her
waist-length hair pinned up, the day in 1967 she climbed aboard a
military flight to Vietnam _ 20 years old and the lone female on a
plane crowded with soldiers headed for war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot made an announcement over the speaker, `Yes, she is
going to Vietnam with us. No, there wasn't a mistake,''' recalls
Lowery, 52, of Olympia. ``I was one of the first 44 Women's Army
Corps members sent to Vietnam and I was such a novelty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery was also a minority within a minority.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 4 inches, she stuck out among the American soliders in
Saigon and Long Bihn. And she wasn't a nurse, which set her apart
from the 9,000 female medical personnel who eventually served in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery worked as a typist and clerk, one of about 1,000 women
who served during the Vietnam War in non-medical roles.
</P>
<P>
   This week _ for the first time _ she and her non-nurse comrades
are hosting their own Vietnam Women Veterans Conference in Olympia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men have had their reunions, the nurses have had their
reunions, now we want to credit the women who served as clerks,
administrators, photojournalists, commanders,'' said Precilla
Wilkewitz, a conference coordinator from Louisiana who worked as a
clerk in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day meeting is a combined memorial, health-care fair
and long overdue homecoming, said Wilkewitz. Seminars and workshops
range from mental health and war trauma to veterans benefits. A
candlelight vigil will honor the deceased, and banquets, bands and
speakers will celebrate the living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the pagentry,'' said Ruth Anderson, 56,
of Graham, Wash. Anderson served as an intelligence officer with
the Air Force. ``We worked shoulder to shoulder with the guys, and
I'm proud of our service.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacting the 1,000 or so non-medical female veterans for the
gathering was a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war everybody scattered. Nobody knew where anybody
was,'' said Wilkewitz.
</P>
<P>
   Records were scarce, so she and other reunion coordinators spent
more than two years searching by phone, letter, Internet and
through various veterans services.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke with nearly 700 women. About 175 from 48 states are
expected to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the conference came to Wilkewitz and several other
veterans while they were attending a memorial dedication a few
years ago in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   When people look back on the Vietnam War, many do not realize
that women other than nurses served there, Wilkewitz said. Their
homecoming was like that of many soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some were spit on, called names,'' said Lowery. ``We want to
put a positive memory in place of a bad one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery recalls the challenges posed to women living in the
male-dominated war zone, from underwear shopping to basic privacy.
``I can remember once going to the PX (Post Exchange) to buy a bra.
All the guys just stared. After that my family sent me personal
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They really weren't equipped for us,'' said veteran Anita
Wampach, 52, a mental health therapist from Seattle. ``It was very
male-oriented. I can imagine it must have been very funny for the
PX guy to order tampons for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   But both also recall fond memories. Lowery shared her one dress
among a dozen female friends. ``We all would take turns on
different days wearing the dress, because it was so hot,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their days started early, usually before 6 a.m., and bed check
was promptly at 9 every night. Close living arrangements made the
occasional date a very public event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would sit on a little bench outside our quarters and talk.
Or we would go in a Jeep to the military policemen club and eat
popcorn and watch movies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wampach, who completed two tours as a clerk in Vietnam, recalls
``multiple accidents in front of the WAC (Women's Army Corps)
detachment'' from rubbernecking men crashing their vehicles. ``We
were a novelty at first,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many women also remember the long days and longer nights
associated with war.
</P>
<P>
   The night of Jan. 31, 1968, found Wampach pressing mattresses
against the inside walls of her two-story building for protection
as the Viet Cong lobbed mortars and fired rockets during the Tet
Offensive, a surprise attack by the North Vietnamese that was a
turning point in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was safe,'' said Wampach, ``They were basically
throwing everything and the kitchen sink at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although women in her unit were scraped and bruised, no one was
killed or seriously injured. ``It was stressful for these young
women to be exposed to enemy fire because they were not issued
weapons for self-defense,'' Wilkewitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma business consultant John Jackson, an adjutant general
near Saigon in 1968, recalls working with U.S. military women in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``They served well, they were very competent people,'' said
Jackson. ``They lived under the same condition as the guys _ living
in the same wooden shacks and dealing with the same heat, bugs,
dysentery and bad food as the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are starting to get the recognition they deserve.''

GORE PASSES A POP QUIZ _ HIS OWN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let no one accuse Vice President Al Gore of not
knowing his Uzbeks from his Moldovans.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was magnanimous Tuesday toward Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas and his inability, in a pop quiz last week, to
identify the leaders of several foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing the names, I think that's kind of
understandable,'' Gore said in an appearance Tuesday on ``Imus in
the Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the other day, I was talking to Otkir Sultonov _ you
know, the prime minister of Uzbekistan. And he asked me, `Did you
send a birthday card to Hamed?' That, of course, is Hamed Karoui,
the prime minister of Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought, God! How could I have forgotten? I had just
been talking about him with Ian Sturza, the prime minister of
Moldova. We're old friends. We actually met through a mutual
friend, Lennart Meri, the president of Estonia, of course.''

   Her fists speak when her voice cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I beat someone up, I feel better,'' said Chrystal, 25,
one of 60 women portrayed in a new book on female aggression.
``It's just like a release, like all the weight is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Violent, negative aggression (like Chrystal's), and healthy,
positive aggression (like leaving a bad relationship or advancing
up the career ladder) are presented in detail in the book ``Behind
the Mask: Destruction and Creativity in Women's Aggression''
(Harvard University Press, 321 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   It is billed as the first book on female aggression written from
a woman's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Western Washington University professor and author Dana Crowley
Jack said she wrote it because _ in a society permeated by male
aggression and violence _ women too often aren't asked about their
own aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women typically deal with anger or hurt in less violent
ways,'' she said. ``I'm trying to broaden the discussion for humans
living in a violent society. We have to add the female voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Most discussions of aggression focus on male behavior, said
Marci Feldman , assistant director of Violence Prevention Programs
at Harvard University's School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically males are the ones perpetrating the crimes,''
Feldman said. Today, however, that trend is changing and more
females are committing violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Still Jack, 54, a professor in psychology and women's studies,
believes women could offer new tools for dealing with negative
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   There is no single definition for aggression, Jack said. In her
book, she asks each woman to provide her own view. ``An upscale
female lawyer is going to have a very different definition than a
woman who is living in poverty,'' Jack said.
</P>
<P>
   Her book is based on interviews with women of different ages,
ethnicities and class backgrounds, including teachers, artists,
homemakers, police officers and substance abusers. Each is
identified by first name, age, race and occupation, and many live
in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Maria, a 32-year-old lawyer who litigates for minority clients,
said: ``Aggression means strong to me. I don't see it in a negative
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lyn, a 39-year-old student living with her two teenage
daughters, had a different definition: It's not ``nice'' to be
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised to be `nice,''' she said. ``Aggression in my life
was, you just don't do it to a girl. I don't know the balance
between nurturing other people and standing up for myself, so I am
playing with that gentleness-aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack found that, unlike Chrystal, most women generally stifle
violent aggressive tendencies rather than yield to them. ``When
asked what keeps them from acting on their feelings, they usually
say they don't want to hurt others,'' Jack said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, women might mask their aggression through manipulation,
silence, exaggerated sweetness or ``looks that kill,'' she said.
But over time, these approaches can lead to depression,
disconnected relationships or even numbing behaviors such as
overeating, drinking or drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki, a 39-year-old teacher, conveys feelings of
destructiveness and anger by ``rattling the dishes around, making
comments under my breath that nobody can hear ... instead of
figuring out what's really bothering me and talking about that. Oh,
I totally sabotage my family that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Curious about women's methods of aggression release _ healthy
and unhealthy _ and discouraged by the lack of research, Jack said
she was ``drawn to study aggression by listening to women's
experience of their depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack has written two other books, including one on depression
called ``Silencing the Self'' (Harvard University Press, 256 pages,
$19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Her goal for ``Behind the Mask'' was to ``explore why women so
often disguise their aggression when we know that women feel
intense anger and are capable of rage and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack offers stories of women who have used aggression in a
positive way. For Lynnea, a 32-year-old social worker, that meant
taking a stance the day she found out her husband was cheating on
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying, `You know, we could just forget it.' And I said
`You can forget it. I'll never forget it, my feelings have changed.
I don't love you. I don't trust you. I don't respect you. So what's
to hold the relationship together?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That day,'' Lynnea said, ``I really felt like I grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   For Carol, a 32-year-biologist, aggression meant confronting
fears in her job tracking wolves, bears and snowy owls in the
Northwest. She transfers this courage into her relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was working for the Forest Service, we would camp out.
And I remember putting my tent away from everybody else, just so I
could be afraid of the woods,'' Carol said.
</P>
<P>
   Later she used this confidence with an unwelcoming group leader
during a climb in Nepal. ``I communicated with him, told him how I
felt it was unfair how he was treating me.'' Carol made it to the
summit on that climb.
</P>
<P>
   Standing up for yourself is a form of aggression that gives a
woman a new sense of strength, maturity and absence of fear, Jack
said. And for people like Chrystal, who lash out with their bodies
and not their minds and voices, it is a way of rechanneling
destructive aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Positive aggression takes many forms _ self-protection,
standing up in the face of negation ... pushing for new
possibilities, defending against harm,'' Jack said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Chrystal, through self-help groups, is discovering new,
positive ways of directing her violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chrystal was abused as a child; she has never known any other
way. She is learning loving forms of connection, to use her words
instead of her fists.''

JAPAN'S GAME SENSATION ARRIVES ON THE SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you came in late, Pokemon _ a Japanese ``Englishism''
for ``Pocket Monsters'' _ is a fantastically popular kiddy
franchise that its owner, Nintendo, confidently bills as ``the
largest child-driven phenomenon of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   It began in Japan in 1996 as a game cartridge for the Game Boy
system, in which players try to ``capture'' each other's Pokemon:
cute little mutated versions of mice, turtles, dragons, cats, ducks
and every other imaginable creature.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997 the game was a sensation in Japan and had successfully
branched out into Japanese comics, toys, trading cards, CDs and
books. A television series came to America in 1998, and since last
February has been aired six times a week on the Kids'WB! network.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistically titled ``Pokemon The First Movie'' is a
domestic Japanese film that's been extensively reworked for the
American market _ not just dubbed and rescored with all new music,
but digitally enhanced and removed of all Japanese background signs
and references.
</P>
<P>
   Its story is sparked when a group of scientists unwisely decide
to clone an ancient, catlike Pokemon called Mew from DNA extracted
from a fossilized hair sample.
</P>
<P>
   The result is Mewtwo, a super-Pokemon who quickly overthrows his
new masters and sets out to conquer the world.
</P>
<P>
   (Do children in the film's target 2-to-11 age group really grasp
such sophisticated concepts as the extraction of DNA and cloning?
Either they do or they're very patient, because the near-thousand
of them at the film's Seattle preview last Saturday morning sat
through this exposition without any noticeable squirming.)
</P>
<P>
   From his fortress on New Island, Mewtwo soon lures the world's
best Pokemon players _ including the series' human heroes, Ash,
Misty and Brock.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie consists of an epic Pokemon battle in
which the trio's own pet Pokemon must do battle with super-powered,
cloned versions of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned that, unlike most animated features of the '90s,
nothing extra has been inserted here to appeal to captive adults.
No compelling story line or subtle humor or hummable songs. The
animation is relatively bare-bones and often shoddy. It assumes its
audience's preknowledge of the concept and characters, and explains
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon phenomenon has also come under fire from various
quarters for teaching small children a host of bad values: Its
sensibility is essentially that of a cockfight _ my pet fights your
pet. And the film's tagged-on moral that ``fighting is actually
bad'' is hypocritical and unconvincing, given what's come before.
</P>
<P>
   Should parents then be concerned by the phenomenon?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but then, given history, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The big lesson of all kid-driven, cartoon crazes of the past 20
years _ from ``Care Bears'' to ``Masters of the Universe'' to
``Transformers'' _ is that they tend to disappear even faster than
they arise.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon The First Movie. Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama. Produced
by Choji Yoshikawa, Tomoyuki Igarashi and Takemoto Mori. Written by
Takeshi Shudo. Warner Bros. 69 minutes (plus a 20-minute short,
``Pikachu's Vacation''). Rated G, suitable for all audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C

SENATE OK'S $1 WAGE BOOST FOR POOR; VETO THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved a $1 minimum wage increase
Tuesday, voting to boost the paychecks of low-income workers for
the first time since the welfare system was overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-proposed increase, to be spread over three years,
would be accompanied by significant tax cuts for businesses, a
provision that angered Democrats, who said the measure was an
attempt to defuse a sensitive election-year debate.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton renewed his veto threat and accused
Republicans of trying to resurrect a tax plan that died earlier
this year, calling the legislation ``a cynical tool to advance
special interest tax breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage increase from the current $5.15 was an
amendment to the bankruptcy bill that still must be approved by the
Senate. With a similar minimum wage bill being considered by the
House, it is possible that in the end-of-session flurry no increase
will be approved this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the $18.4 billion in tax cuts, spread over five
years, were necessary to keep small businesses afloat. Earlier in
the day, Republicans defeated a Democrat alternative proposed by
Senator Edward M. Kennedy that called for a $1 increase over 13
months and $9.6 billion in tax cuts, saying that plan would have
led to other tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in great contrast to earlier debates over the minimum wage,
Tuesday's vote followed a debate uncharacteristic of the GOP-led
Senate, over how to increase the minimum wage instead of whether to
increase it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main focus is to make sure that we have some tax breaks,
some tax incentives for small businessmen and -women, and the
self-employed, that will have to bear the brunt of the cost of the
increased minimum wage,'' Senate majority leader Trent Lott said
before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about tax relief for small business, not the
wealthiest,'' agreed Senator Rod Grams, Republican of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed 54-44, represented a landmark for the
Senate's newest member, Senator Lincoln D. Chafee, a Rhode Island
Republican who assumed his late father's seat five days before.
Chafee, who voted for both the Democratic proposal and the GOP
plan, said it was a difficult ballot to cast, not only because of
its political sensitivity but also because he tried to ``factor
in'' what his late father, Senator John H. Chafee, would have done.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said he sought advice from members of his father's staff,
many of whom now work for him. Even so, Chafee said he did not make
a final decision on his vote until he went into the Senate chamber
Tuesday morning. Asked why he had supported the Kennedy amendment,
Chafee paused, then said it was because 20 percent of workers earn
the minimum wage, and because the bill helped keep their salaries
on par with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Republicans voted for both plans _ including
Senators Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Olympia Snowe of Maine and
James Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, Chafee's second so far, was being watched closely by
Democrats eager to recapture the Rhode Island seat in the 2000
election. Chafee, who is still officially the mayor of Warwick,
R.I. until Nov. 19, has said he will vote as a moderate Republican,
as his father did. But, he said, ``I am learning there are going to
be some difficult choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican plans had two essential
differences: the length of time it would take to implement a $1
increase in the minimum wage, and the size and scope of tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the Democratic proposal would have cost up to
500,000 jobs by forcing small businesses to downsize. Democrats
said the Republican plan would give tax cuts to the wealthy instead
of struggling businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides acknowleged politics were in play. Rick Berman,
executive director of the Employment Institute, a Washington think
thank that is funded by business and opposed to a minimum wage
hike, said the fact that Tuesday's vote took place at all was
``because of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clearly forced by Kennedy onto the Senate,'' he said.
``What the Democrats really want is an issue, rather than an
increase. And the Republicans are not going to give them an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did, in fact, lead a public relations war for weeks,
making it clear to Republican leaders that they would suffer
politically if the minimum wage were not addressed this year.
Senator John F. Kerry said: ``If it weren't for Ted Kennedy
pushing, and for his leadership on this, the Republicans wouldn't
be doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats were surprised the Republican leadership did not
throw more obstacles in the path of an issue the GOP traditionally
opposes. The Democratic plan, which would have added tax credits in
a number of instances _ including for start-up businesses and
employer-provided child care _ was defeated by a narrow margin,
50-48.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the $1 increase, Kennedy expressed outrage over the
Republican measure, accusing his GOP counterparts of being ``more
interested in providing tax breaks for the rich than in fairly
compensating minimum wage workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day we fail to raise the minimum wage, families across
the country continue to fall farther behind,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton concurred. ``I cannot let this bill become law
in its current form,'' he said. ``I once again call on Congress to
give working American families the pay raise they deserve.''

 &HT;    Heart monitoring gets safer with new device
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A simple, safe heart-monitoring device attached to a
computer is now available to replace the more risky catheterization
used for decades on heart patients.
</P>
<P>
   Hooked up for demonstration at the American Heart Association
meeting in Atlanta, the device delivers within minutes information
that doctors need to make treatment decisions for patients _ both
in the emergency room and in cardiac clinics. Called BioZ.com, the
12-pound, $28,000 computer measures the amount of blood being
delivered to the body, lung fluid buildup, heartbeat, blood
pressure and eight other circulatory functions.
</P>
<P>
   This information, known as a patient's hemodynamic status, was
previously obtained by a pulmonary artery catheterization. About 2
million of these procedures are performed annually, at a cost of
about $1,500-$2,000 each. They require inserting a thin plastic
tube through a patient's neck or groin into a major artery, then
threading it into their heart. The procedure requires anesthesia
and carries a slight risk of infection, rupture of the main artery
and death.
</P>
<P>
   Though BioZ.com would cost considerably less per patient,
physicians have been slow to embrace the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps the physician understand the kind of circulatory
disruption and how severe it is when a patient comes in with
shortness of breath or chest pain,'' said Dr. John Strobeck, who
has used the device for the past year at Heart-Lung Center in
Hawthorne, N.J., and is the co-founder of the Heart Failure Society
of America. ``It is the most useful tool I've seen come out in
cardiac care.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviews were more lukewarm at Northside Hospital of Atlanta,
where the device has been in place about one year. ``We've used it
in intensive care to guide therapy decisions and to adjust a
pacemaker in an outpatient,'' said Dr. Michael Balk, a
cardiologist. ``It's not a revolutionary device. The information it
gives you has been available the last 20 years, but the technique
is unique. The fact that it is noninvasive and doesn't have risk is
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The device also is being used at Crawford Long Hospital and
Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, and the Mayo Clinic and
Cleveland Clinic, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The computerized method requires four special sensors to be
placed on a patient's neck and the sides of the chest. Small
electrical currents are transmitted through the chest, and the
signals are analyzed and spit out by the computer's software within
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Uses of the data range from helping doctors see if patients with
congestive heart failure are responding to medicine to instantly
knowing the heart and lung damage sustained by a gunshot victim.
</P>
<P>
   Made by the California company Cardiodynamics, BioZ.com is
actually a new twist on old technology that goes back to the space
race of the 1950s and '60s. To date, about 400 hospitals and
private doctors' offices have bought the BioZ.com, said a spokesman
for Cardiodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinical studies have just been released proving its validity
and application, and that's what our customers were looking for,''
said marketing manager Paul Jansen.Patricia Guthrie writes for the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    ATTN EDs: Ohio papers OUT.
 &HT;    HOUSE PANEL TOLD TO CUT TROOPS, NOT AID TO HAITI
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Plans to reduce the number of American military
troops in Haiti should not interfere with efforts to foster
economic growth and democracy there, federal lawmakers told a House
panel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., suggested that the United States retain
a small military presence in Haiti to assist the government in
building schools and roads. Graham added that international
observers and possibly a U.S. congressional delegation should be
positioned in Haiti to supervise next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning our back on Haiti is not an option,'' Graham said at a
hearing of the House Committee on International Relations Tuesday.
``We would be the beneficiaries of Haiti's improved health.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham noted that Haiti's economic and politcal stability are
crucial to Florida, in particular, which has experienced waves of
Haitian refugees during periods of turmoil on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Graham urged the House to follow the Senate's lead in passing an
expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative to give countries in
Latin America and the Caribbean trade status similar to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said, ``We can't ignore Haiti. Our
nation can still play a constructive role in partnership with the
Haitian people to ensure that the money troubles inflicting this
small island do not pass a point where they can't be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton dispatched 20,000 American troops to restore
democracy to Haiti in 1994. The administration expects to remove
those troops by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Local elections in Haiti, which were scheduled to occur in
December, have been postponed until March and its presidential
elections are planned for November 2000. DeWine said that elections
have been rescheduled three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent a stable and democratic government in place, Haiti has
no hope of achieving real and lasting economic, political, and
judicial reforms,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Haiti abolished its military forces and created
a national police force.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., said the United States has spent more
than $75 million training and building the police force but it has
only 5,000 members to patrol the entire country. Haiti is about the
size of New York City which has about 45,000 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the Haitian national police are up to the task of of
ensuring an adequate security environment for next year's elections
is a justifiable concern,'' Goss said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Romero, acting assistant Secretary of State for Western
Hemisphere Affairs, told the panel that the United States has
invested $16 million in the upcoming election process, $2 million
of which will be used to strengthen the police force.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine urged that until a more democratic government is
established in Haiti, U.S. financial aid should be sent through
private organizations _ rather than the government _ in order to
guarantee that the money is used for the welfare of the people.

CHRIS KENNEDY DECIDES PRIVATE LIFE IS BETTER THAN PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It happens to every Kennedy, sooner or later. Two
weeks ago it happened to Christopher G. Kennedy, son of the late
Robert F. Kennedy, when a local politician suggested the Chicago
businessman should run for an open congressional seat in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But the classic family Kennedy quandary _ whether to run for
public office or protect a private life _ came with extraordinary
pressures for Kennedy, 36.
</P>
<P>
   It was not simply that his father had been assassinated on the
campaign trail, or that his older brother, former Representative
Joseph P. Kennedy II, was reminding him of the perils of public
life. Chris Kennedy also had another relative on the phone:
Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, a cousin and a
friend _ and the congressman in charge of winning back the US House
for the Democrats in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The seat in question, the 10th district of Illinois, has been
held by the retiring Republican Representative John Edward Porter
since 1980. Winning it would be a boon to Patrick Kennedy's
nationwide effort to overcome the Republicans' 10-seat margin; he
had set his sights on it even before his cousin's name came up.
</P>
<P>
   Then Illinois House Speaker Michael J. Madigan stepped in. With
a narrow majority in the Illinois House of Representatives, Madigan
could not bear to see one of his Democrats run for the open seat.
His first alternative: Chris Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevermind that Chris Kennedy had forsworn politics years ago,
and liked to joke that he had gone into the ``other family
business'' by taking over the Kennedy enterprise, Merchandise Mart.
Nevermind that, even though he was Joe Kennedy's finance chairman
in 1986, Chris Kennedy was what one associate called the ``sensible
head'' in the family, committed to his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, soon after Chris Kennedy's name was mentioned, a flurry
of excitement followed among Democrats on Capitol Hill. For a time,
the buzz seemed to offer even Patrick Kennedy a glimmer of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was really settled in, with a beautiful wife and
wonderful children in suburban Illinois . . . but when I really
thought about it on reflection, I thought he would be a great
candidate,'' Patrick Kennedy said last week. ``He's held in very
high regard in the business community in Chicago, which is very
important in this district. He's also got a great legacy from his
father to carry, in terms of his ability to connect with Democratic
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a family member, I would love to support Chris if he ran,''
Patrick Kennedy almost gushed, admitting that, even though he is
supposed to remain impartial during Democratic primaries as head of
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he would have
backed his cousin in private.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said he spoke to his cousin, along with the other
Democratic candidates for the seat. But Joe Kennedy was talking to
Chris, too, describing for his younger brother the long hours and
painful exposure to public view that come with being a member of
Congress, family associates said.
</P>
<P>
   The older brother had left politics a year and a half earlier,
following a spate of family tragedies involving another brother,
Michael. Joe, then a congressman from Massachusetts, thought about
running for governor of Massachusetts, and then thought about
running for re-election in 1998. In the end, he did neither, opting
to run Citizens Energy _ another family business _ instead.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with his brother, political consultants and his
family, Chris Kennedy finally announced his decision Tuesday.
Saying he had given it ``serious consideration,'' he said: ``The
tremendous burdens of a hard-fought congressional race and the
prospect of an enormously demanding role as a congresman would be
difficult for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came one day after an early barb from
Republican Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, the congressman in
charge of securing US House seats on the GOP side. In an interview
with the Chicago Sun-Times, Davis swore the Illinois district
``will not elect a Kennedy by divine lineage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an entitlement district,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the decision seemed less political than
personal, even more wrapped up in the family lineage than a
congressional race would have been. He announced his decision not
to run in a letter to House Speaker Madigan, Chris Kennedy wrote:
``I have come to believe that the bullet that kills a father wounds
his children. There were a lot of wounded children when I grew up,
and extending the difficulties of a single-parent household to
another generation would violate the promise I made to myself a
thousand times when I was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Kennedy family members was available for comment.

THEODORE ALVIN HALL, WHO AT 19 GAVE SOVIETS ATOMIC SECRETS, DIES AT
74  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Great Britain, N.M.)   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Theodore Alvin Hall, who was the youngest physicist to
work on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos during World War II
and was later identified as a Soviet spy, died on Nov. 1 in
Cambridge, England, where he had become a leading, if diffident,
pioneer in biological research. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of his death was cancer, said his wife, Joan Hall.
</P>
<P>
   For 37 years, since moving to England in 1962, Hall steadfastly
declined to directly confirm accusations of espionage. But
fragments of cables from Soviet spies in New York and Washington
during World War II were released in 1995 and 1996, giving
credibility to the accusations against him.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement published in 1997, he came close to
admitting the charges, although obliquely, saying that in the
immediate postwar years, he felt strongly that ``an American
monopoly'' on nuclear weapons ``was dangerous and should be
avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To help prevent that monopoly I contemplated a brief encounter
with a Soviet agent, just to inform them of the existence of the
A-bomb project,'' the statement said. ``I anticipated a very
limited contact. With any luck it might easily have turned out that
way, but it was not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   What Hall gave up, say Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel,
authors of the 1997 book ``Bombshell: The Secret Story of
American's Unknown Spy Conspiracy'' (Times Books), was not merely
knowledge of the bomb's existence, but technical information that
helped the Soviet Union build a bomb years earlier than would have
been possible otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to assessments that his actions changed the course of
history, Hall said: ``Maybe the course of history, if unchanged,
could have led to atomic war in the past 50 years _ for example the
bomb might have been dropped on China in 1949 or the early 1950s.
Well, if I helped to prevent that, I accept the charge.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview he acknowledged having had some second
thoughts after disclosures of the brutality of the Soviet
government. ``I think my emotional revulsion against Stalin's
terror would have stopped me in my tracks,'' he said. ``Simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The only people at Los Alamos convicted as Soviet agents were
the German Klaus Fuchs and the American David Greenglass, whose
espionage led to the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   A third spy was long suspected. But the identity of the spy,
code-named Mlad _ from a Slavic root meaning young _ remained
opaque.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs, a refugee from Nazi Germany who was a member of the
British team at the Manhattan project, was convicted of espionage
and sentenced to prison in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was interrogated by the FBI in the 1950s, but just before
that he had left the spy network. His erratic contacts were
difficult to trace, and he was never prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, a former teacher of Russian and Italian, Tuesday night
described his espionage activities as ``something in his youth'' _
a time when he was known as a brilliant physicist who had won a
Harvard degree by the time he was 18 and was the youngest of the
team of young scientists recruited to the top-secret Manhattan
Project in Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was born in New York on Oct. 20, 1925, the son of a
furrier, and attended P.S. 173 in Washington Heights during the
Depression. So precocious was his intelligence that, by the time he
was 14, he was tentatively admitted to Columbia University,
according to ``Bombshell.''
</P>
<P>
   The book chronicled Hall's rise through Harvard, where he was
accepted at 16, to his first interview for a position as junior
physicist at Los Alamos sometime around his 18th birthday in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to the project in January 1944, he became known as
something of a rebel against military ways, frequently omitting to
salute, say ``sir,'' or to wear a regulation Army cap. He won the
right from the base legal officer to wear a yarmulke although he
was not religious.
</P>
<P>
   According to Albright and Ms. Kunstel, Hall and a former Harvard
roommate, Saville Sax, approached a Soviet trade company in New
York in late 1944 and began supplying critical information about
the atomic project.
</P>
<P>
   Hall gave the Soviets, according to Albright and Ms. Kunstel,
some of the crucial technical information that helped them build
their own bomb, a near-copy of the American version, at a great
saving in industrial investment.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered, they say, the ``implosion principle,'' a radical
departure from previous designs for igniting a nuclear explosion.
It made it possible to produce the pressure needed to set off a
nuclear chain reaction using plutonium, the main bomb fuel of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar era, and Mrs. Hall seized on an opportunity to
leave the United States in 1962 for what was initially to be one
year at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's work there in the use of electron microscopes in
biological X-ray micro-analysis led to broad acclaim. In an
interview with a British newspaper in 1996, he described it as his
greatest achievement.
</P>
<P>
   After living a quiet life in Cambridge, his past returned to
haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   With the decoding and declassification of Soviet cables in the
mid-1990s, naming ``Teodor Kholl'' and ``Savil Saks'' as volunteer
Soviet informants, the years at Los Alamos caught up with him
again, just as his own health was failing.
</P>
<P>
   By that time the deaths of Sax and others who might have
directly tied him to espionage, and those of Soviet spymasters,
would have made a successful prosecution unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Hall had Parkinson's disease and inoperable cancer of the
kidney. He never seemed to apologize and seemed to take a secret
pride in his espionage activities..
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 statement to Albright and Ms. Kunstel, which he
finally made after many hours of interviews with them, he said he
had acted at the age of 19 as someone who was ``immature,
inexperienced and far too sure of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am no longer that person _ but I am by no means ashamed of
him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, his daughter Ruth said in a telephone interview:
``He did what he did out of a real motive to save people's lives.
It was an obligation. He was a principled man of enormous
integrity. He did what he did at great personal risk. He had
nothing to gain from it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secrecy now,'' she said. ``He did it. They can't do
anything now.''
</P>
<P>
   But for decades, she said, his actions weighed on him and he did
not share his secret with his children until his activities became
public in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept it secret all his life,'' she said. ``It was a great
burden on him.'' In addition to his wife and daughter Ruth, Hall is
survived by another daughter, Sara.

NEWS ANALYSIS: SEEKING MIDEAST COMPROMISE IS CLINTON'S LONG SHOT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As formal talks start between Israelis and the
Palestinians on how they will define themselves and relate to each
other in a final peace, President Clinton finds himself in a
central role. The question for him is how he can make this role
work for the sake of Middle East peace and for his own place in
history.
</P>
<P>
   In what had been billed as a major foreign policy address on
Monday, Clinton said that the next 100 days were critical in
reaching what he hopes would be a historic accord in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   But presidents before him have faced such deadlines and missed
them. Whether Clinton can squeeze fateful compromises on borders,
the status of Jerusalem, or the right of return of 3.6 million
Palestinian refugees is a long shot, administration officials and
Middle East experts said.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few months left before election year politics take
over his presidency, Clinton does not have a lot of leverage left.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton finally extracted $1.8 billion in stalled aid
for Israel and the Palestinians from Congress last week, the length
of the battle has left many in Israel and in the Palestinian
Authority concerned about his ability to obtain the far larger sums
needed to support a final peace.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage that Clinton has is the turnaround by the Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, who had initially sought to minimize
the administration's role but has now come to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final-status issues are so existential and the
Palestinians have developed such a strong relationship with the
United States that the American role appears inevitable,'' said
Joseph Alpher, director of the American Jewish Committee office in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, administration officials have acknowledged that they are
prepared for dramatic walkouts and possible terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the talks through a terrorist act sponsored by
Iran is one of the administration's biggest fears, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, the administration has specifically warned
Iran not to try to destroy the peace talks by encouraging terrorist
activity.
</P>
<P>
   While urging on the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, the
administration is also seeking to unlock the Israeli-Syrian talks
that broke off three years ago. Last month, Clinton took the
unusual step of inviting the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk
al-Sharaa, to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The president presented Sharaa with a list of questions to take
back to his ailing leader, Hafez Assad, to determine whether the
Syrians were serious about reviving contacts. An official said the
questions revolved around basic issues like Syria's willingness to
recognize Israel and maintain an embassy in Tel Aviv. Another issue
was Syria's willingness to agree to Israel's installing an early
warning station atop Mount Hermon, which dominates their border. In
exchange, Israel would return the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which formally opened on Monday in the West Bank are
intended to produce a general framework agreement by Feb. 13,
giving the basic outlines of a peace accord. The American officials
said the goal of the negotiators for both the Israelis and the
Palestinians was to reach broad consensus on all the major issues.
But it was possible, the officials said, that some of the most
emotional issues, like the future of Jerusalem, would be excluded
from the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A final settlement is supposed to be reached by September.
</P>
<P>
   As a base line, the talks that are under way have the emergence
of a Palestinian state as their main working assumption, a senior
administration official said. ``It is clearly an issue on the
table,'' the official said. ``The Israeli public has accepted the
likelihood, the inevitability of a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is certain to fall far short of Arafat's demands and his
public expects. The size of a Palestinian state is just one
example, a senior administration official said, of how tough the
problems are.
</P>
<P>
   On one count, however, the administration appears relatively
confident _ a trust, and even a personal chemistry, seemed to have
taken hold among Clinton, Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear after the preliminary get-together last week in
Oslo. At one point in the office of the queen of Norway before a
palace dinner, Clinton wrapped his arms around Arafat and Barak and
strolled with them to a corner, one witness said. Within moments,
Clinton had coaxed peals of laughter from the pair, not about
jocular matters, but about the difficulties ahead.

DRUG COMPANY EXECUTIVES IN EUROPE PREDICT SUPERMERGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Executives from three of Europe's largest drug
companies are predicting not only that Pfizer will win the battle
for Warner-Lambert but that the combination of those two companies
could touch off a series of massive mergers, creating the
industry's first super companies.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews here this week, the chief financial officer of
SmithKline Beecham and the chief executives of Glaxo-Wellcome and
AstraZeneca said Warner-Lambert's proposed $72 billion merger with
American Home Products had not overly concerned them until Pfizer
stepped in with an $80 billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Home Products with Warner-Lambert would not have had
a major impact on our business,'' said Sir Richard Sykes,
Glaxo-Wellcome's chief executive. ``But if you get Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert, you are taking about 7 or 8 percent market share, a
big number, with a big spend on research and development of $3
billion and $4 billion a year. I think it should be a big concern
to anybody that one company is spending between $3 billion and $4
billion a year'' on research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for Warner-Lambert, generally regarded as one of the
drug industry's most prized acquisitions, has ignited talk in
Europe that several of the Continent's big drug makers will soon
announce acquisitions of similar size. Speculation about impending
deals has become so rampant over the last week that drug executives
have even begun pointing fingers at their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McKillop, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, the world's
largest drug company, said in an interview in his office on Sunday
that he thought Sykes would make an acquisition because ``Glaxo
hasn't delivered on its growth promises.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment left Sykes mildly amused. ``He would have said
that, honestly, if you had asked him at any point in time over the
last two years,'' Sykes said in an interview in his office on
Monday. ``They were terrified that we were going after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have become increasingly confident that SmithKline and
Glaxo-Wellcome would rekindle a merger agreement that collapsed
last year. That now appears unlikely given the tensions that still
exist between the two companies. The deal fell through because of
the clashing egos of the companies' chief executives, Sykes and Jan
Leschly at SmithKline.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about merging with SmithKline, Sykes said flatly that
if that pairing was so obvious it would have already happened. Then
he warned coyly not to expect the obvious. It appears, too, that
SmithKline Beecham has rethought its merger options and that Glaxo
has toppled, for the moment, from the top of its list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position here at SmithKline is that we're doing well,''
said Andrew Bonfield, the chief financial officer at SmithKline
Beecham. ``We are achieving growth that is in the solid teens. Why
should we run out and merge with Glaxo, when they have single-digit
growth?''
</P>
<P>
   European drug executives have kept close watch on the scuffle
for Warner-Lambert. Lodewijk de Vink, Warner-Lambert's chairman,
sent a letter Tuesday to Pfizer's board that admonished the
directors for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, de Vink wrote that Warner's board was
``disappointed'' that it was in such a dispute with Pfizer and that
Pfizer's actions do not agree ``with the way we believe partners
should treat one another.'' De Vink's letter also stated that
Warner-Lambert was committed to its merger with American Home
Products.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from American Home Products and Warner-Lambert
traveled to Atlanta Tuesday to attend a heart association meeting,
where they had talks with analysts and some investors.
</P>
<P>
   While it is uncertain which company will get Warner-Lambert,
several European drug executives said this week that regardless of
what happens, the fight has forever changed the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   Several European drug executives were shocked that William
Steere, Pfizer's chairman, made letters he had written to de Vink
public, as if he were a jilted lover determined to get revenge.
Executives were also concerned that hostile bids, rare in the
pharmaceutical industry, would now become common practice There has
already been significant discussion about a few public blunders
Pfizer is perceived to have made.
</P>
<P>
   One consultant, who works for Pfizer and spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said on Monday that Pfizer had believed that because
the company ``walked on water in the media's eyes,'' no one would
look closely at the company's pipeline of drugs under development
to conclude that it trailed many of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to say that even with Pfizer's size, American
Home Products has an edge for Warner-Lambert,'' said Neil Sweig, an
analyst with Ryan Beck &AMP; Co. ``They are the ones with the merger
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the situation in the United States, Steere did win some
praise from his fellow European executives. One executive said that
the public release of de Vink's letters by Steere roused some
sympathy for Pfizer, which was necessary to lift the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have become more confident that several of the European
companies are analyzing deals that might work. Several industry
analysts and executives said over the weekend that Novartis was
taking a serious look at Monsanto and that Roche was also looking
to make an acquisition, although no partner had surfaced yet.
People close to Monsanto confirmed Tuesday that the company had
held talks with Novartis but said no deal was imminent. They said
Monsanto had also talked with several other companies about
possible combinations.
</P>
<P>
   It has been speculated that Novartis would try to buy American
Home Products if the company fails in its merger with
Warner-Lambert. Analysts said Tuesday that Novartis would have
antitrust problems over its agricultural holdings if it made an
attempt to buy Monsanto.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sykes, who has been on record for months saying that industry
consolidation is inevitable, has begun to enjoy being the topic of
merger speculation. Bonfield, however, dismisses the topic kindly,
noting that there is no need to make haste about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Both executives said they planned to concentrate on their
businesses while the Warner-Lambert brawl plays out. And the
civility that once ran through the industry has apparently been
shoved aside when it comes to products as well.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo-Wellcome is set to introduce a drug for irritable bowel
within the next several months in the United States, to be followed
soon thereafter by a competing drug from Novartis. Lotronex,
Glaxo's drug, has been shown to work more in women than in men.
Sykes said on Monday that the drug would still be a success because
80 percent of irritable bowel sufferers are women.
</P>
<P>
   When told that Novartis was already beginning to dispute those
numbers, Sykes became angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not take any notice of anything they say,'' Sykes
snapped. ``They have made such ludicrous statements about their
drug, and our drug, that I am becoming concerned about their
sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Novartis declined to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Sykes may be making one acquisition from the Warner-Lambert
brawl after all. Acknowledging that de Vink could possibly be out
of a job if Pfizer succeeds, Sykes smiled broadly.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, he said, ``They lost a good man. Perhaps that
is our strategy: We will hire de Vink, and then we can stay
alone.''

TRUMP PROPOSES CLEARING NATIONAL DEBT AT EXPENSE OF THE RICH
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Preparing to embark on his first trip as a prospective candidate
for president, Donald Trump presented a plan Tuesday that he said
would pay off the national debt, bolster Social Security and slash
taxes by billions of dollars. Trump promised to accomplish all this
at no cost to ordinary Americans, by forcing the rich to pay for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, describing the first proposal of his exploratory
presidential campaign, said the government should impose a one-time
14.25 percent tax on the assets of individuals and trusts worth $10
million or more. That would raise $5.7 trillion, he said, enough to
pay off the national debt in a single year. And eliminating the
debt, Trump explained, would save the nation $200 billion in annual
interest payments, money that he said could be used for tax cuts
and ensuring the future stability of the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   The New York developer chose an unusual forum to unveil what he
described as a policy cornerstone of his prospective campaign: a
rolling series of radio and television interviews. The proposal
came a week before Trump is to fly to Florida for a series of
campaign-style events in Miami, the first of three such trips
planned over the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones are going off the hook,'' Trump reported, as he
combined a discussion of his economic ideas with a description of
what he described as the public's giddy reaction to his foray into
economic policy-making. ``I've never seen anything like this. Do
you make Page 1 with this one?''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of politics, Trump's proposal _ simple in its
concept and framed in populist terms _ seems aimed directly at the
people who have supported the Reform Party since Ross Perot first
called it to arms with, among other things, a call to wipe out the
national debt. Trump, should he run, said he would seek to become
the Reform Party's candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also had the advantage of lessening any liability
Trump might believe he could suffer because of his own wealth. The
developer put his own net worth at $5 billion, and said that under
his plan, he would owe $750 million in taxes (though his estate
would ultimately profit if another part of Trump's plan was
enacted: the repeal of the 55 percent estate tax).
</P>
<P>
   Trump's plan met a response that ranged from incredulity to
ridicule from a number of economists Tuesday. They suggested that a
14.25 percent tax would be impossible to get through a
Republican-controlled Congress that championed a $792 billion tax
cut this year. Beyond that, they said that even if it passed, it
would be problematic to measure net worth, and then to tax it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the plan makes much economic sense,'' said
Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the libertarian
Cato Institute. ``The fact is that most people's wealth, that has
been built up, over 10, 20 or 50 years, is wealth that has already
been taxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump's main opponent for the Reform Party nomination, Pat
Buchanan, offered a harsher assessment of Trump's plan. ``This is
serious wacko stuff,'' Buchanan said by telephone from Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan predicted that Trump's plan would cause the wealthy to
move their holdings beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue
Service. ``I can't think of a better idea to cause capital flight
out of the United States,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Trump said that he had come up with the idea on his own, and
worked out its details with some private economists. He declined to
name them.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected criticism of his idea, demanding: ``Where is Gore's
plan? Where is Bradley's plan? Where is Bush's plan? They don't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was clear that some parts of Trump's proposal remained
unformed. For example, of the $200 billion in interest costs that
would be saved, he said he would apply half to the Social Security
system and the rest to tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Trump said that $20 billion of that would pay for eliminating
the inheritance tax. Asked how he would allocate the rest, he
responded: ``All different taxes across the board. That would be
determined and worked out.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Five years after a U.S.-led force of
20,000 troops invaded this island and restored constitutional rule,
the Haitian people are entering a new and uncertain era.
</P>
<P>
   While crime, insecurity and a crumbling infrastructure continue
to threaten residents, the Haitian government has been virtually
paralyzed for more than two years. Now, the last of the regular
U.S. military presence in the capital is set to end in January,
with the 400 troops replaced by shifts of reservists on short-term
training missions throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   That is yet another blow for a country that has made
dishearteningly little progress despite high expectations _ perhaps
unrealistic _ since the invasion. By the end of this year, police
trainers and human rights monitors from the United Nations and the
Organization of American States are also to leave, although U.N.
officials are seeking to maintain a smaller, ongoing mission.
</P>
<P>
   After Jean Bertrand Aristide, a former priest, became Haiti's
first democratically elected president in decades, an army-led coup
drove him into exile in 1991. After increased internation
repression, the Americans invaded and restored Aristide to power.
The current president, Rene Preval, was his hand-picked successor,
but Aristide remains the nation's leading political figure and is
expected to run again next year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military's role in Haiti has gone from ensuring
security to carrying out the kind of work that brings tangible
relief to the residents of the hemisphere's poorest nation _
providing free medical care, repairing wells and building schools.
While thousands of Haitians have benefited from this assistance,
countless more have taken psychological comfort from the mere
presence of the U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, Anes Anis came home from her factory job to
find a U.S. soldier sitting behind his M-60 machine gun atop a
Humvee while another paced the side of her hilly dirt street. She
said she welcomed these silent sentries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We re happy to see them,'' she said. ``If something happens
now, we could call on them. Otherwise, we have nothing at all to
protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers were not there to bring peace to her
neighborhood. They had only come to secure the area while dozens of
U.S. sailors painted a local schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many Haitians had expectations that the intervention would solve
day-to-day problems. Now the departing forces leave behind a nation
that is still trying to create a democratic, functioning state.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian army was disbanded but not disarmed, contributing to
an increase in street and drug crimes. While a new police force
struggles to enforce the law, a dysfunctional judiciary has
hampered its efforts. People and cars crowd the streets in midday,
but few people venture out very early or late, lest they become
targets for bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment has been a trickle. With unemployment
hovering at 60 percent, factory owners have been closing their
doors as their clients shift their orders to nations with equally
cheap labor but more stability.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With regularity, residents in some neighborhoods vent their
frustration and try to get the government's attention by hauling
tires and trash into the street and setting up flaming roadblocks.
It has hardly helped.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government itself has been virtually paralyzed since 1997
while Preval fought with his opposition in Parliament over his
choice for prime minister. He finally named a de facto prime
minister earlier this year when the Parliament's term ended,
leaving the nation without a functioning legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the standoff, the government failed to pass either a
budget or laws that would have brought $500 million in
international aid to shore up its crumbling infrastructure and
reduce suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative elections have been pushed back from December of
this year to March 19, prompting fears of campaign fraud or
violence. International observers and diplomats have accused
Aristide's supporters of trying to wrest control of the civilian
police force to use it for their political advantage. Recently, a
daylong voter education event sponsored by the national electoral
council was disrupted by hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   The governmental paralysis has disappointed both Haitians and
other countries, which are coming to realize that they also had
unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of dictatorship under Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and
his son, Jean-Claude, left the country with scant experience with
democratic rule. Now, as Haiti continues the transition to
democracy that it began when the Duvalier regime ended in 1986,
other nations say they are willing to help but that the Haitian
people must take the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is for Haitians to come together and
address their past so they can come up with answers that will help
them create their future,'' said the U.S. ambassador in Haiti,
Timothy Carney. ``The political culture has got to change.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The years since the intervention have brought some improvements.
The United States, working through private contractors and
nongovernmental organizations, has provided $300 million for health
care, education and judicial reform. Inflation has been reduced to
single-digit figures, and the currency is stable.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the leaders of a coup that had ousted Aristide
and ushered in years of repression were removed. Diplomats say the
nation's human rights record has improved and individual freedoms
have grown.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the Haitian National Police from 5,300 mostly
raw recruits has also been seen as a positive development, although
the force is hampered by insufficient resources and inexperienced
mid-level commanders. Since its inception three years ago, more
than 800 officers have been dismissed for offenses ranging from
corruption to human rights violations. Yet even that is seen as
evidence that it is willing to ensure its integrity by rooting out
malfeasance.

FLIGHT RECORDER RECOVERED FROM FLIGHT 990 CRASH SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects third graf to say NTSB investigators had received
recorder at 2:30 p.m.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ In the first major turning point of the EgyptAir
Flight 990 crash investigation, specialists in Washington have
begun to examine one of the doomed jet's so-called ``black boxes''
_ a flight data recorder plucked from the floor of the Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767-300ER flight recorder was retrieved before dawn
Tuesday by the Deep Drone, an advanced Navy remote-controlled
search-and-recovery submarine. It was then placed in a cooler full
of sea water and flown by helicopter to labs at the National
Transportation Safety Board headquarters for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, NTSB chairman James E. Hall said investigators
received the recorder at 2:30 p.m. and had removed the magnetic
tape from its protective casing, then cleaned and dried it. The
tape has data on it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That fact bolstered hopes among investigators that the cause of
the crash can be pinpointed. The NTSB also said the flight data
recorder was much more sophisticated than had been believed.
</P>
<P>
   If it was working properly, the recorder should provide
investigators with a wealth of information about the last 25 hours
of Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder installed by Boeing in 1989 when the 767 was
delivered to EgyptAir recorded 44 separate functions of the
aircraft and flight parameters such as speed, heading, roll and
pitch. EgyptAir officials said they enhanced the recorder, allowing
it to monitor 55 different functions. Tuesday, however, the NTSB
said the recorder could track more than 150 parameters of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   As the search for the second black box _ the cockpit voice
recorder _ continued 250 feet below the Atlantic Ocean, NTSB
personnel were prepared to work through the night to extract
information from the flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   It will take weeks to glean all the information from the data
recorder, but some preliminary information should be available
within days.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 767-300ER left New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport with 217 people on board bound for Cairo
early Oct. 31. Thirty minutes into the flight, as the plane cruised
at 33,000 feet, it suddenly plunged to 16,700 feet in 40 seconds.
Radar indicates the plane then climbed to 24,000 feet before its
final dive, breaking apart before slamming into the water some 60
miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   There were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Storms and rough seas stalled the search and recovery effort,
but seachers had located the pingers _ underwater sound beacons
fastened to the boxes _ near the crash site. On Monday, ships
returned with two high-tech submersible robots to hunt for them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Tuesday that the pinger had been knocked off the
flight data recorder, which is actually painted bright orange. But
investigators viewing videotape from the Deep Drone noticed the
device as wreckage was being cleared to get to the pinger. The box
was about 10 feet away from the pinging signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were picking up pieces of wreckage when they saw it
there,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   After its recovery Tuesday, the flight data recorder was
transferred to the command ship USS Austin at first light. About
11:30 a.m., a Navy helicopter carrying the recorder began its trip
to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, where it arrived
about 1:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder made the journey in a seawater-filled cooler to
protect it from being damaged by contact with the air before it
reached NTSB headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing, Hall said one end of the flight data recorder had
been damaged, apparently by impact forces of the crash. ``We do not
know whether that damage will affect the quality of information
inside the recorder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items monitored by the flight data recorder are the
position of the thrust reversers on both engines of the 767.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that thrust reversers may have played
a role in the sudden dive of Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   A plane can fly without thrust reversers, which are designed to
slow the plane on landing by redirecting powerful exhaust from the
jet engines. If deployed in flight, however, the reversers can
render a plane uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The only fatal accident of a Boeing 767 due to mechanical
problems occured in 1991 when a Lauda Air jet crashed in a Thai
jungle when one of the thrust reversers activated during the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Some aviation specialists, however, doubt the mechanism was
responsible for the EgyptAir crash because radar tracks of the
airplane's final minutes are not characteristic of a plane
responding to the activation of a thrust reverser in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Magnum drone, which had been deployed by the Navy on Monday,
returned to the water Tuesday afternoon to assist in the hunt for
the cockpit voice recorder, a continuous loop tape that records the
last 30 minutes of converstation in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Drone, a more advanced robot, retrieved the flight data
recorder because the Magnum's fiber optic umbilical cord became
entangled about midnight Tuesday. The Magnum's mother ship, the
Carolyn Chouest, moved off site and was replaced by the Grapple at
2:20 a.m. The Grapple had been working with its drone at another
site.
</P>
<P>
   Although the attention of the news media has focused almost
exclusively on the search for the critical black boxes, the
recovery of human remains continues by the nine vessels deployed at
and near the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still part of the recovery. That has not stopped,''
said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   These remains, all in small parts, have been found floating on
the surface. Holloway said officials haven't decided whether to use
the drones to retrieve the victims from the ocean floor. The site
is too dangerous to send in divers.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, a Coast Guard helicopter left a final tribute
from the families of the crash victims. Circling over the crash
site, a crew dropped flowers from Sunday's memorial service into
the sea.

 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti: out malfeasance.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``On the human rights side, clearly a number of things have
improved,'' said Colin Granderson, the executive director of the
United Nations/Organization of American States International
Civilian Mission in Haiti. ``There is an emphasis on
accountability, which was unheard of before. Serious human rights
violations are no longer a policy of the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   But with every advance there have been setbacks that make Haiti,
in the words of one diplomat, ``a country of push-pull doors.''
While the police have been trying to enforce the law, they have
been stymied by an inept and backlogged judiciary: 80 percent of
all Haitian prisoners are awaiting trial. A school supported by
international donors has been training judges, and the government
recently increased judges' salaries to make them less susceptible
to bribes. But some feel the reforms did not address the
fundamental flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we're still functioning with an old justice
system we inherited from the days of the military dictatorship,''
said Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis.
</P>
<P>
   He added that despite the obstacles, the administration was able
to carry out some programs. Land reform has reduced supply costs
for farmers. Cooperatives have been established, he said. And while
the pace has been slow, the government is privatizing the
operations of ports and the airport.
</P>
<P>
   But much more could have been accomplished had it not been for
the paralysis that overtook the government shortly after the 1997
Parliamentary elections. Members of the opposition, the
Organization of People In Struggle, accused the governing Lavalas
Party of fraud. For two years, they blocked Preval's choice for
prime minister, and accomplished little else, said diplomats and
international officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 8 million people here and they're running out of
time and space,'' said one diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock has frozed $500 million in loans from the
Interamerican Development Bank, the World Bank, and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that money is going to be lost,'' Granderson said.
``That money is not going to be held for Haitians until they make
up their minds that they're ready to use it. The window is
closing.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue felt by donors is shared by ordinary Haitians.
Craters filled with mud and putrid sewage cover long stretches of
the National Highway that runs past the sprawling slums of Cite
Soleil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the government's problem,'' said Israel Domones, on a
recent day after he hit a hole and the bottom of his tractor
trailer, filled with sacks of flour, fell out, causing a huge
traffic jam. ``The water is deep and I did not see how big the hole
was. The road is stuck. The country is stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans first invaded Haiti in 1915, they stayed long
enough to build up the country's infrastructure. This time, their
focus has been on aid, like the free clinics where hundreds of
Haitian line up for hours to receive medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The military has also built many schools and repaired wells. The
U.S. soldiers speak enthusiastically about their mission, but they
also admit that the nation's impoverished social conditions can
seem overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they need roads or water now, or do they need education?''
said Lt. Comdr. Joseph Larry of the navy, chief engineer for the
American military support group. ``It's a tough nut to crack as to
what Haiti needs more of.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also little time remaining for elections, which are
seen as the only way out of the government's paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are clamoring for elections to take place as soon as
possible so we can get back to a government of parliamentary
normalcy,'' Alexis said. ``Democracy cannot be decreed, it can only
be built.''
</P>
<P>
   But with only four months to go, the logistical obstacles are
daunting in a country where phone lines, electricity and other
necessities for administrative efficiency are unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of setting up of 3,500 polling places, regional and
local electoral offices and a voter registration system is also
running up against time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and Haitians fear that the elections could be
delayed again, possibly combined with the presidential elections
scheduled for next November. They say supporters of Aristide, who
was succeeded by Preval when his last term was up, favor that
scenario, hoping to use his coattails to win seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and international observers also worry about reports
of intimidation by Aristide supporters and reports they they are
trying to gain control of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Yvon Neptune, a spokesman for Aristide's party, denied those
accusations. ``We hope the election schedule is going to be kept,''
he said. ``We also hope the conditions will be created so that
voters will feel comfortable to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake in the coming elections, and not just the
return of a functioning, daily government. The country is at a
point where it is being urged to find a national consensus on how
government can work for all sectors of Haitian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government itself has been the situation, in their total
lack of management, vision and honesty,'' said Georges Sassine, an
apparel factory owner and vice president of the Association of
Haitian Industries. ``You feel there are 200 different governments
and within each branch you have sub-branches and they all go their
separate ways. I'm not going to call it anarchy. Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke inside his vast, empty factory, where he had just laid
off 260 workers. While the government has been paralyzed, orders
from the United States dried up. He said that in the last two
months, 22 factories have closed, leaving nearly 5,000 people
jobless. This was not, he said, what he thought the intervention
would have accomplished. Sure, some people have done well,
including those who have taken advantage of governmental inaction
and desperate poverty to make fast money in contraband. But the
majority are still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haiti has not learned there is no individual salvation,'' he
said. ``If you're in a sinking boat and you jump out, are you
really saved? It's either everybody gets saved or nobody does.''

ANTI-AMERICAN DEMONSTRATIONS IN GREECE COULD SHORTEN CLINTON'S
TRIP
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House officials said Tuesday that President
Clinton's visit to Greece this weekend will probably be shortened
or rearranged because a rash of anti-American demonstrations and
attacks there have raised security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist groups have been holding daily protests against Clinton
in advance of his state visit to Athens, and the State Department
has warned visitors of possible terrorist bombings and other
attacks against American targets. At one mass demonstration on
Monday, protesters opposed to the recent NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
held a mock trial of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, however, said they were readjusting
details of the trip, which also includes stops in Turkey, Italy and
Bulgaria, taking the protests into consideration. ``We have to look
at the schedule, the routes, the president's exposure and make
judgments,'' one aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-American protests come with the territory in Greece.
Although the country is an American ally and a NATO member, many
Greeks still criticize the United States for its support of the
military dictatorship that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974 and for
failing to stop Turkey from dividing the island of Cyprus in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about the protests, Clinton said he was expecting
dissent but was not overly concerned about security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the demonstrations and I'm not troubled by them, and
I think that the security issues will be fine,'' he said before a
cabinet meeting Tuesday. ``I know that Greece has a long and rich
history of Communists, the anarchists and the others on the left
demonstrating. And they all disagreed with my position in Kosovo,
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that one goal of the trip was to reduce tensions
between Greece and Turkey over territorial claims, especially the
long dispute over Cyprus. After Greece, Clinton will visit Turkey
for a summit meeting held by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued a travel advisory this week noting
that the middle of November is typically a time for demonstrations
commemorating the 1973 student uprising against the military junta
in Greece. The warning noted that there had been several terrorist
bombings and other attacks aimed at American-affiliated businesses
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Greek officials said the protests should not deter Clinton's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will be absolutely safe or otherwise he wouldn't
be going,'' said Theodossis Demetricopoulos, a spokesman for the
Greek Embassy in Washington. ``We always have the phenomena of a
small number of young people creating havoc, breaking windows and
setting cars on fire.''

LEARNING AT MAYOR LA GUARDIA'S KNEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Author identification appears at end of story.) (DW) 
 By DAVID ROCKEFELLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I was his aide for a year and a half. It was a
$1-a-year proposition. I did a variety of things for him, like
traveling with him in his big car when he visited a dedication of a
big school or Department of Sanitation garages. He also gave me a
number of special assignments, which included finding ways to get
to La Guardia Airport and how they could increase their revenue by
having shops and things like that.
</P>
<P>
   He could change his manner very quickly. I would sit in his
office while people would come in. An elderly lady would have a
very sad story to report, and he would be extremely considerate and
warm, and then some commissioner who had done something he didn't
like would come in, and he'd fly into a rage and throw his glasses
at him.
</P>
<P>
   He could turn on whatever was needed in terms of attitude,
depending on who it was. He was very versatile and very
charismatic, but he could also be very angry and tough. But
basically, I liked him very much. I remember when I got engaged to
be married while I was with him, he took us out to Tavern on the
Green. It was a nice thing for the mayor to do.
</P>
<P>
   He taught me how to deal with many different people, even though
one had no prior connection or background with them. He understood
the role and importance of city government, and I think he helped
me recognize the extraordinary diversity and complexity of the city
and to realize that one was dealing with people of different
backgrounds and needs and aspirations, and it was the
responsibility of the mayor to be helpful to all those groups.
</P>
<P>
   He was an extraordinarily colorful figure, and he had a sense of
the audience he was talking to to a degree I've never seen. He
would go to a school or some other gathering without having
prepared anything and sense what the audience was interested in,
and he'd always get loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me a feel for the city I wouldn't have otherwise had.
What I learned from him was an ability to deal with a broad variety
of people. I realized one thing, that the city of New York was a
great deal broader than Manhattan Island south of 96th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce for many years dealt mostly with the
large businesses downtown; one who wanted to have organization
really citywide had to include a large variety of people from many
different ethnic and cultural groups and from many parts of the
city and many economic levels, and the New York City Partnership (a
leading business advocacy group Rockefeller founded) does. It was
important that a private sector group that wanted to speak for the
city was more inclusive. That had been my experience with the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   This was a very good way to get a sense of city government and
the relationship of the city to the private sector, and I feel very
strongly that many activities should not be handled exclusively by
either city government or the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   David Rockefeller, the patriarch of perhaps the most influential
family business empire of this century, was an unpaid aide to Mayor
Fiorello La Guardia in 1940 and 1941.

DRUG RESEARCH REPORTS SEEN AS OFTEN MISLEADING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Denmark, Minn.)  (rk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports of research on drugs tend to exaggerate the drugs'
benefits, making them sound better than they really are, according
to an article and editorial being published Wednesday in The
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The exaggeration occurs for several reasons: positive results
tend to be published more often than negative ones, researchers
sometimes publish the same study more than once and some poorly
designed studies slip through the safety net of journal editors and
expert reviewers who should screen them out.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of such research harms patients, because doctors rely
on it to make decisions about treatment, said Dr. Drummond Rennie,
a deputy editor of the journal and author of the editorial.
Decisions based on misinformation may result in patients' being
given an inferior drug or a new, expensive one that looked good in
a study but that is really no better than an older, cheaper
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the patient is shortchanged,'' Rennie said in a
telephone interview, adding that although there were no precise
figures on the amount of misleading research, he suspected it was
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   His editorial and the journal article describe studies on drugs
used to treat people with rheumatoid arthritis, post-surgical
vomiting, depression, schizophrenia and immune deficiency resulting
from cancer. Much of the research, like drug research generally,
was financed by pharmaceutical companies, which often stand to
benefit from the false impressions.
</P>
<P>
   But Rennie attributed the problem not only to drug companies,
but also to researchers and the institutions that allow shoddy
research, and to journal editors and scientific reviewers who do
not discern or blow the whistle on flawed or deceptive studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peer review does its best, but it's only as good as the people
doing it, and the honesty of the people doing it,'' Rennie said,
referring to the system in which journals ask experts to review
papers being considered for publication. ``Anything can get
published, literally anything. The best journals spend a lot of
time and energy and effort trying to find the best stuff, but you
can still be stiffed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rennie and the other authors, Dr. Helle Krogh Johansen and Dr.
Peter C. Gotzsche, of the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen,
described several sources of distortion in medical research. One is
``publication bias,'' meaning that studies showing positive results
from drugs are published faster and more often than studies showing
neutral or negative results, which may never be published. The net
result is that the medical literature is skewed toward studies that
show drugs in a favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kay Dickersin, an associate professor of community health at
Brown University, who has extensively studied publication bias,
said that many scientists had blamed journal editors for refusing
to publish negative results, but that she and her colleagues had
found that the scientists themselves held back the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardly any were submitted to journals, so they couldn't blame
the editors,'' she said. ``When we asked why, the major reason they
gave is that the results just weren't interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   A second problem is that researchers sometimes publish the same
data more than once, without letting on that it has ever been in
print before. That may mislead doctors into thinking that there are
more positive studies of a given drug, including more patients,
than there really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for everybody _ except patients and readers,''
Rennie said, noting that the extra publications made ambitious
researchers look more productive and provided more studies for drug
companies to hand out to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his editorial, Rennie described ondansetron, a drug that was
being studied to prevent vomiting after surgery. Researchers
analyzing the literature found 84 studies involving 11,980 patients
_ or so they thought. Some of the data had been published twice,
and when the researchers sorted it out, they realized that there
were really only 70 studies, involving 8,645 patients.
</P>
<P>
   The duplicated data, they concluded, would lead to a 23 percent
overestimate of the drug's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of another drug, risperidone, used to treat
schizophrenia, had been published multiple times in different
journals, under different authors' names. The same thing had been
done with studies of drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis, with some
having been published two or three times, and one even published
five times.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael O'Connell, deputy director of the Mayo Clinic Cancer
Center in Rochester, Minnesota, and an expert on clinical trials,
said: ``To publish the same data again with entirely different
authorship, as if it were an entirely different data set, is
reprehensible. Readers would conclude there were two different
studies that strengthened the conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In their paper, Gotzsche and Johansen described still another
problem: a study design that seemed to stack the deck against one
of the drugs being tested, in essence guaranteeing that the other
would look superior.
</P>
<P>
   The two drugs were amphotericin B (made by Bristol Myers Squibb)
and fluconazole (made by Pfizer), both being tested to prevent
fungal infections in patients. The researchers looked at 15 studies
done during the 1990s, including 12 in which Pfizer had
participated by providing grants, statistical analyses or other
help.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the studies appeared to show that fluconazole, a newer
drug, worked better. But when the researchers analyzed the studies
more closely, they discovered that the majority of the patients had
been given amphotericin B orally; that drug is supposed to be given
intravenously and is not effective taken by mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the trials included a third drug, called
nystatin, and the results for nystatin and amphotericin had been
lumped together. But nystatin was known to be ineffective, and so
combining the results for the two drugs made amphotericin B look
bad.
</P>
<P>
   When Gotasche and Johansen sorted out the studies and the
contributions made by the various drugs, they concluded that
fluconazole was actually no more effective than amphotericin B.
</P>
<P>
   When they tried to ask the authors about the design of the
studies, some ignored the requests, and others said they no longer
had the data. Pfizer, contacted by The Journal of the American
Medical Association, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, Mariann
Caprino, said she did not have the data on the individual studies
and could not explain the reasoning behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bert Spilker, senior vice president for scientific and
regulatory affairs at PhRMA, a trade group for drug manufacturers,
said: ``We don't have a perfect situation. It probably can be
improved.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that medical journals require authors to disclose
formally whether their papers had been published elsewhere in any
form, and to include that declaration in the published report. In
addition, he said, the institutional review boards that approve
studies at the hospitals where they are conducted should evaluate
them more closely to make sure that they are designed properly.
</P>
<P>
   The best solution to publication bias, many researchers and
journal editors say, is to require that all studies be logged into
a central registry when they begin. That way, scientists can track
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rennie said, ``You can call the investigators up and say,
`Whatever happened to that study you began?' and they might say,
`It was a disaster.' And then you can ask, `Why didn't you publish
it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Some drug companies have begun to register their trials, but
others resist, partly for fear of revealing information that their
competitors might use.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have proprietary interests, which I respect,'' Dickersin
said. ``But there is a larger interest here of society as a
whole.''

TO A CZECH, THE POLKA WAS A BALL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are in Scottish lore brands of whiskey virtually unknown
to outsiders. Merchants keep them out of sight lest some wandering
American, Englishman or even a resident of the next county know
their identity. Music has its secrets, too, despite the alarming
internationalization of tastes, instruments and performing styles.
</P>
<P>
   Often the appreciation of home-brew is as unexportable as the
object of affection. Reasonable in other musical matters, I turn to
jelly at the sound of Nelson Riddle's languid orchestrations and
add-on chords. This is not a value judgment I would expect Viennese
musicologists to share, though I expect they, too, feel a
sugar-fueled tug when Schrammelmusik begins to waft its way down
from Grinzing.
</P>
<P>
   France's barroom chanson and the Portuguese fado have their
cultish international followings, but I suspect that in both cases,
language and culture are so wrapped up in music that one can admire
from the outside without truly penetrating. The music of Pierne and
Vieuxtemps still rings through the halls of the Paris Conservatory
but hardly anywhere else. We are what we have grown up with, and
memory can be stronger than judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Bedrich Smetana's music seems split between public and private
sectors. ``The Bartered Bride'' and ``Ma Vlast'' are household
names in every musical family, but how many of us know that this
19th-century Bohemian composer wrote two-thirds of his 300
compositions for the piano and that an awful lot of them are
polkas? More than 30 pieces are called just that, and many more are
polkas in everything but name.
</P>
<P>
   The polka, The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians tells
us, probably began as a country round dance, but by the 19th
century it was evolving into a ballroom specialty for couples.
``Polka'' may be a corruption of ``Polska,'' the Czech term for
Polish girl. It moves in two beats to the measure as opposed to the
mazurka's three, but later on, there were hybrids combining the
steps of the polka with mazurka time. An early Parisian source
describes polka tempo as that of a slowish military march.
</P>
<P>
   The program booklet for Andras Schiff's splendid new compact
disc of Smetana polkas for Teldec offers snippets of etiquette as
laid down by The Ball Room Annual (London, circa 1844). ``There
should be no stamping of the heels or toe,'' it reads. ``This may
be tolerated at a Bohemian auberge, but it is inadmissible into the
salons of London or Paris.'' Later: ``The polka must be danced
quietly, gracefully and without any awkward gestures, such as
lifting up the leg too highly, or starting off in an abrupt
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   So rougher American sensibilities beware. The 14 items played by
Schiff are not of the ``Beer Barrel'' or ``Too Fat'' variety,
familiar from late-night television come-ons. They are tender,
pliant and understated.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff records here on a Bosendorfer piano, which adds to the
crystalline quality of Smetana's writing. As you may already have
guessed, the composer must have been a superior pianist; the operas
and symphonic pieces came later in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Smetana's youth followed a pattern common among precocious
musical talents in the 19th century: family opposition to a musical
career (his father was a brewer), education in more mundane
subjects and then a breaking free. He met the Schumanns and
probably Berlioz. Liszt became a friend and supporter; Smetana
adored him.
</P>
<P>
   Later life was not easy, centering largely on music schools of
his own founding. Musical politics at home deprived him of many
rewards and satisfactions, although an extended stay in Sweden won
considerable respect abroad. Illness virtually wiped out Smetana's
first household, but he married again and struggled more, the last
and most galling enemy being deafness. He died in Prague in 1884,
at 60.
</P>
<P>
   The young Smetana was by all appearances a successful social
animal, and his talents at the piano made him the musical center of
evenings at the homes of the well-to-do, where dancing was a
necessary part of entertainment. Virtually none of the pieces here
are for virtuoso display; neither are they, when properly played,
much good for dance accompaniments. Think of them as idealizations
of a form and an activity that were as natural to a young Central
European of the time as eating and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff's playing is of admirable delicacy. There is not a touch
of grandness, and the polka rhythms are stretched enough to point
out harmonic points of tension while never overreaching. The
curious lilt and the alternations of major and minor harmonies in
short phrases reflect the musical culture that Dvorak was to draw
upon so successfully a little later.
</P>
<P>
   The charm of this music is so unassuming that the outsider feels
almost an eavesdropper. Think of that hidden stash of whiskey:
Schiff has gone behind the counter and sneaked a bottle out for us.
I think we foreigners will like its taste.

 &HT;    Bush's style sits well with South Carolinians
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PICKENS, S.C. _ For George W. Bush backers in this critical
early primary state, it's all about feel. And many of them feel
sure they like him though they're hard-pressed to say why they feel
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything. Everything,'' Mildred Bates said Tuesday,
expansively but imprecisely, when asked what she likes about Bush,
who bus toured the state. ``And I like Rush Limbaugh, too.'' Five
months and several major policy speeches into his presidential
campaign, Bush still is attracting support based on who he (and his
family) is rather than what he is proposing. South Carolina's Feb.
19 primary will be the season's third major test and the first in
the South. War hero and ex-POW John McCain is counting on a strong
showing in this state, which includes as many as 400,000 veterans,
coincidentally the same number as the expected turnout at the GOP
primary.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush starts with a major edge transferred from another war
hero, his father. In his 1992 loss, South Carolina was
then-President George Bush's second strongest state.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father served'' said Army retiree Randy Hughes. ``And the
great man his father was, I know he had to learn something from his
dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The dad factor is going a long way with Bush backers here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to stand for the right things,'' said retired factory
worker Janie Liptak of Pickens.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know a lot about his positions on issues?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, not a whole lot. But I like what I've heard,'' she
said. ``And I love Barbara and George.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Jones, a county co-chairman for the Bush campaign, said
feelings transcends issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you elect a president on an issue, because he
has to deal with everything. I think George W. can do that,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blease Graham, a political science professor at the University
of South Carolina since 1970, said the attitude of the Pickens
crowd is typical of people in the Palmetto State. A majority of
South Carolinians believes state and local officials, not federal
ones, should make decisions on most issues, Graham said. As a
result, South Carolina voters don't necessarily care about a
candidate's position on a myriad of topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidate image, more than issues or party identification,
weighs heavily in the behavior of the South Carolina voter,''
Graham said. ``South Carolinians tend to weigh candidates by the
pound; to see a candidate, shake his hand, chat with him.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of peace and prosperity, the emphasis on feel rather
than policy positions may extend beyond South Carolina's
boundaries. A recent Gallup poll found that for the first time
since 1954, there isn't a single issue that more than one-fifth of
Americans agree is the most pressing one facing the country.
Eighteen percent of those surveyed said the most important problem
was a decline in ethics and morality, 17 percent said crime, 11
percent said education and 10 percent said gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The results stand in stark contrast to 1980, for example, when
44 percent of respondents cited foreign policy, or 1975, when 60
percent chose the high cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Smith, the head of the University of New Hampshire Survey
Center, said most people just ``don't have the time or the interest
to really look into and even try to understand the policy positions
or the issues that the candidates are going to have to respond
to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think of all the choices we have today: We've got sports
to entertain us, 150-200 channels of cable television, movies,
computer games, the Internet. We've got so many other distractions
that frankly, most people don't pay much attention to politics,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the campaign trail, Bush uses the time after his speeches
to dive into the crowd for hand-shaking and photo-taking. It's a
technique that lends great energy to the events.
</P>
<P>
   Former South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, a Bush co-chairman,
said the one-on-one strategy works well here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like him because he is just like most of them. He is a
pretty easy guy to meet. He's not a hot dog. He's not somebody that
thinks he is a star. He is just out there meeting the people,''
said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It worked Tuesday at Jimmy's Family Restaurant in Easley, where
Bush made no speech, opting instead to take his campaign table to
table.
</P>
<P>
   Retired pharmacist Jim Findley of Easley said he liked ``most
everything about him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any specifics but I think he is the man for the
job. I think mainly it's the feeling of integrity,'' said Findley.
</P>
<P>
   Across the restaurant, Denear Knupp told Bush she is supporting
him. The candidate leaned in to, in his words, ``seal it with a
kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Charmed, Knupp said moments later that she backs Bush because
``he's honest.'' Asked to delineate the issues that led her to
Bush, she said, ``Now you put me on the spot. . . ``

<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging from her cinematic repertory, one might think that the
actress Emily Watson would be tiny, vulnerable, an imperiled sprite
of a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Her roles _ the tormented young wife of a paraplegic in the 1997
film ``Breaking the Waves''; the volcanic, terminally ill cellist
Jacqueline du Pre in ``Hilary and Jackie''; the impoverished Irish
housewife in ``Angela's Ashes,'' opening Dec. 22 _ seem to call for
someone small whose intellectual and spiritual presence eventually
dominates the room. On screen, her face seems as fragile as a
blossom; her eyes serene, confused little puddles of clear blue;
her cheeks as cartoonishly full as those of a kewpie doll.
</P>
<P>
   But she turns out to be a beanstalk, more than 5-foot-9 in
sneakers. Earlier this fall, she strode into the lobby of the
Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan, wearing black pants and T-shirt,
without a whisper of makeup, and began a conversation by answering
the basic interview question: what, so far, has been your favorite
role?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard question to answer,'' she said. ``It's sort of
like asking someone, `Out of all the people you've slept with, who
was the best?' You wouldn't want to hurt anybody's feelings, would
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Well. So much for that waif thing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson's career has been brief but fiery. She was born in
London and studied at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Her first
movie role _ as the God-fearing Scottish wife whose disabled
husband asks her to take lovers while he observes, in Lars von
Trier's 1997 film ``Breaking the Waves'' _ won her Oscar and Golden
Globe nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, she played the long-suffering wife of an imprisoned
welterweight in ``The Boxer'' and later the role of Jackie in
``Hilary and Jackie.'' Again, for the latter, she was nominated for
both the Oscar and Golden Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Late this year, she will appear in two very different films. In
Tim Robbins' ``Cradle Will Rock'' (opening Dec. 10), an earnest
drama about the Works Progress Administration, American theater in
the 1930s and its run-ins with government censorship, Ms. Watson is
a Depression-era actress living on the streets, looking for work
and desperate to be onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed that more Americans don't know the story of
censorship in America in the 1930s,'' Ms. Watson said, sipping tea
as a tropical-force downpour spattered the Peninsula windows.
``Every city in the country was doing right-to-the-minute
contemporary plays about events that were happening that week, and
there was all this strife and social unrest. There was an
extraordinary sense of upheaval, and the theater was right there
dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson's character is rescued off the streets by a
faux-gallant WPA actor (played with machismo by James Sheridan)
who, in Ms. Watson's words, ``rescued her by doing that older-male
thing.'' Lowering her voice to a growl, she continued: `` `Honey,
you're here with us now. We're going to take care of you.' Then you
flash to the next scene, and they're in bed and he's leaving and
it's all gone terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is her role as Angela in the long-awaited film version of
``Angela's Ashes,'' based on the 1996 Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir
by Frank McCourt, that will draw most eyes to Ms. Watson this year.
And in a way, the character of Angela McCourt _ a woman who lost
three of her children in infancy, endured the rages of an alcoholic
husband, struggled to feed her surviving children _ is the least
fragile of all Ms. Watson's roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not fragile at all,'' Ms. Watson said. ``The big
opportunity in me playing her was that the part offered no
emotional pyrotechnics whatsoever. There were no big passions or
scenes. She never acted out. She was contained. She lived inside of
all this sorrow and never came out.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCourt watched an early screening of the film in early
fall, he told Ms. Watson that the scene that moved him most
profoundly was the one in which the young Frank smacks his mother,
sending her reeling onto a stair landing.
</P>
<P>
   In the scene, Angela rights herself and stares at her son. Her
face, at first, seems eerily placid; the only indication she has
been slapped is her hand's comforting her cheek. And then her face
crumbles into a Picasso portrait, the mouth wobbling into a crooked
line and the eyes sinking into her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that floored him,'' Ms. Watson said. ``When we met in
Dublin during filming, I asked him if he wanted to tell me anything
about his mother, and he said no. Because I am never going to be
anything like his mother. There's no way of knowing what she was
like. I can only reinvent what was in the book. I think that's most
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The role hads its physical price to pay as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a filthy shoot,'' she said. ``We were up to our ankles
in water most of the time. And every day, we would go into makeup,
and every day they would add gray hair, especially as Angela
started to age, and broken blood vessels, and it was really less of
a making up than it was a pulling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that Ms. Watson was becoming typecast as a woman in a
state of constant emotional turmoil. So after filming ``Angela's
Ashes,'' she began looking for something lighter _ ``for my peace
of mind,'' she said. She read dozens of scripts for romantic
comedies, which she found mostly mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept reading these scripts and thinking, `Gee, I don't
know.' Then along came this off-the-wall comedy and I thought,
that's it. There's a little bit of romance in it, but it's not
`Runaway Bride' or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear of being pigeonholed as an actress of any kind comes
out when she talks about the star of ``Runaway Bride,'' Julia
Roberts, as the poster girl of the American romantic comedy: ``Poor
girl. It must be so hard. To be in that situation where you are the
victim of marketing. You know it's not her fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Watson's next movie is ``Trixie,'' in which she
plays a Midwestern would-be private detective with a flat Chicago
accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, to do a comedy is a relief,'' she said with a sigh.
``It is, I'll admit, the first time I've come away from a movie not
feeling damaged.''

EGYPTAIR 990 FLIGHT DATA RECORDER RECOVERED  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ A submarine operated by remote
control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the
ocean south of Nantucket on Tuesday, bringing to the surface a
crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The container that held the recorder, known as a black box,
showed signs of damage when it was recovered, but the flight
recorder inside seemed to have survived the jetliner's catastrophic
impact and nine days of submersion in salt water, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnetic tape was removed from its protective casing,
cleaned and dried,'' James E. Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said Tuesday night after investigators
in Washington began evaluating the recorder's condition. ``The tape
has data on it, and NTSB engineers are currently working to extract
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the box, and the condition of its contents,
appears to have provided the first breaks in what has been a
frustrating case. For much of the past week, investigators and
mourning families have waited as foul weather and winds caused
delays in the search for the recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary radar data has shown that the plane fell
precipitously, and three lobstermen reported hearing a strange
rumble where the plane slammed into the ocean's surface. But until
the recovery of the data recorder on Tuesday, virtually no other
information had been available. EgyptAir's pilots reported no
trouble over their radios before or during the dive, and the
wreckage recovered to date has revealed little more than that the
great airplane _ a Boeing 767 with a wingspan of 156 feet and a
length of 176 feet _ was reduced to bits when it struck the sea.
The crash killed all 217 passengers and crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the retrieval of the first recorder _ another, the
cockpit voice recorder, remains missing on the sea floor _ could
provide key insights into the crash. ``In any investigation, the
most important information comes from the recorders,'' Hall said.
``They can save several steps in the investigatory process.''
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder is designed to preserve conversations
among the pilots and ambient sound in the cockpit, including the
noise from plane alarms, its two engines, or any obvious mechanical
problems. The flight data recorder is designed to record more than
150 categories of information that shows how the plane was flying,
how the pilots were handling it and how the aircraft's systems were
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he hopes the recorder ``will paint a picture of what
this airplane was doing in its last minutes, and seconds, before
this tragedy occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The black box was discovered before dawn in 245 feet of water by
the Deep Drone, a robot submarine that was deployed and controlled
from the Grapple, a Navy salvage ship. The Deep Drone had resumed
searching after a more capable robot, known as Magnum and deployed
from the submarine support vessel Carolyn Chouest, damaged its
fiber optic cable on undersea wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of lifting the black box aboard the Grapple, the
Navy flew it by helicopter to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland,
where it was transferred to Washington. Agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, who are treating all debris recovered from
the aircraft as potential criminal evidence even though the
investigation has turned up no indication that the plane was
brought down by a crime or terrorism, accompanied the recorder on
its trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, working in moderate seas of 5 to 7 feet, planned to
continue searching for the remaining black box through the night
and into Wednesday morning. Retrieving the second recorder is
important because in some past jetliner accidents, information from
the two flight recorders, together, has provided a level of detail
that has enabled investigators to pinpoint causes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when an Aeroperu Boeing 757 crashed soon after
takeoff from Lima in 1996, the cockpit voice recorder captured the
desperate conversation of the two pilots. ``Everything has gone,
all the instruments went to (expletive),'' the captain said, as the
plane dropped into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder later revealed that the instrumentation
problem was with three small vents on the side of the plane, known
as static ports, which are used to measure air pressure and
determine air speed. The static ports are crucial because speed
cannot be determined visually from a jet flying at high altitude at
night, and if a plane flies too fast or too slow, it will crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, zeroing in on the static ports after reviewing
the two flight recorders, eventually found that maintenance workers
had covered the 757's static ports with protective masking tape
when they washed the plane, and had neglected to remove it _ an
oversight that meant the pilots could not read their airspeed from
the instruments and flew the plane to its doom.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, however, flight recorders have proved
insufficient. In the crash of SwissAir Flight 111 off the coast of
Nova Scotia last year, the recorders have provided no insight into
the source of smoke in the cockpit that the pilots described to air
traffic controllers on the ground.

 &HT;    Atlanta expects problems in Y2K transition
 &HT;    By Julie B. Hairston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The city of Atlanta's Y2K program is ``terminally
behind schedule,'' disorganized, leaderless and secretive, a widely
respected computer consultant has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The technology in question controls financial and accounting
systems that could affect revenue collection and payment of bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They handle a lot of money over there at City Hall,'' said Ron
Dolinsky, executive director of the Atlanta/Southeast Regional Y2K
Solutions Center. ``If the software doesn't work right, they could
lose track of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   James McCullough, who worked as a Y2K consultant with the city,
said the city may not make the Dec. 31 deadline for bringing all
city computers into compliance. Getting the millennium bugs out of
the city's system will require a lot of hard work and more
resources than the city is currently putting into its Y2K program,
said McCullough, a former information technology director for Delta
Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might have been interesting stuff in February, March or
April,'' said Dolinsky, ``but it's not. It's November. This is
serious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolinsky has been working with the state's Citizens Y2K Task
Force, who began meeting with city officials earlier this year
after reports began to circulate that Atlanta might not be Y2K
compliant by the end of the year. Although the formal charge of the
task force focused solely on the city's essential services _ fire,
police, water and sewer, and the emergency response network _ some
task force members felt Atlanta's importance as a cultural,
governmental and economic center called for some wider scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose is to see that the state of Georgia gets through
the Year 2000 without any problems,'' said James A. Jones, managing
director of the Information Management Forum and a task force
member. ``The city is key to that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the meetings with city officials progressed, task force
members asked McCullough, who also works for the Y2K Solutions
Center and is an acknowledged Y2K expert, to join the discussions.
Early last month, Ted Fisher, a task force member who spearheaded
the Atlanta liaison group, asked McCullough for his analysis of
Atlanta's Y2K compliance efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a scathing assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my professional opinion,'' McCullough wrote in an Oct. 6
memo to Fisher, ``Atlanta's Year 2000 Program is being poorly
managed, months behind schedule, and is not taking the necessary
actions to improve the chances of any real success.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, McCullough says he stands by his initial
assessment of the city's Y2K program, which has cost taxpayers more
than $17 million over the past two years. But he also said
essential services seem to be ``in as good shape as anybody'' and
the city can complete the rest of its Y2K mandate if it applies
personnel, time and money to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have to get after it,'' McCullough said. ``They've
got to get their best 'athletes' on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But city officials said they have no plans to add more personnel
or money to their efforts, and insist Atlanta will make the
deadline. They described McCullough as ``disgruntled,'' even though
he was not employed by the city when the Oct. 6 memo was composed.
They said he did not have enough information at his disposal to
form a credible conclusion about Atlanta's readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that, to the extent humanly possible, we will
not have any Y2K compliance problems,'' said Atlanta Chief
Operating Officer Larry Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the city's essential services are ready for Y2K, as
is 83 percent of the rest of the system. ``The remaining 17 percent
or so has been remediated and is being tested,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At risk are millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. The city's
mainframe computer has not been certified as Y2K compliant, and an
Oct. 27 memo from McCullough to Administrative Services
Commissioner Herb McCall indicates city officials do not have
reliable intelligence on exactly what remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials said their Y2K contingency plans, developed
under a contract with TRW, will allow the city's business to
continue, even if automation ceases completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything we need to do,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is not alone in its race to the Y2K finish line.
Washington, D.C., officials have admitted on a nationally broadcast
television program that their vast computer network will not be
ready for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia task force members have helped Atlanta in getting its
essential services into shape for 2000. At their urging, BellSouth
experts stepped in at no cost to bring the city's 911 emergency
center into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   If the city falls short in its Y2K efforts, the consequences
might not be apparent for some time. ``You and I as citizens might
not see it right away,'' McCullough said, ``but we might see it one
month . . . or even two months later.'' Councilwoman Cathy Woolard,
a member of the Y2K task force and regional director for the
American Electronics Association, has been particularly persistent
in her efforts to discern Atlanta's Y2K status. She said she has
become increasingtrated with the poor quality of the
information she has received from city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspected all along that we were in this kind of shape, but
have not been able to confirm it,'' she said of McCullough's
report. ``It's quite obvious that from the top down, nobody has a
clue what they're doing.''
</P>

   McCall won't promise the city's computers will be glitch-free

 &HT;    Citadel's sordid past to resurface in cadet's lawsuit
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ As it distances itself from its hostile
treatment of women in recent years, The Citadel finds itself back
``on trial'' as a jury prepares to hear a former female cadet's
allegations of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Anderson on Tuesday seated a jury to
hear Jeanie Mentavlos' 1997 lawsuit against the formerly all-male,
state-supported military college and five men who were cadets in
the fall of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial approached, the Charleston college and two former
cadets settled with Mentavlos for undisclosed sums.
</P>
<P>
   ``While The Citadel may have settled, it is ultimately going to
be on trial,'' said Sandra Senn, the Charleston lawyer representing
two defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The two 23-year-olds _ senior cadet James Saleeby and former
cadet Justus Anderson _ refused to settle and appeared for
Tuesday's jury selection, as did Mentavlos, 21, now a Charlotte,
N.C., schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-cadet, Edward Bohm, conceded Mentavlos' allegations
against him. He will be involved in the trial only in any
consideration of monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Mentavlos' allegations, including charges that her sweatshirt
was set ablaze and she was demeaned by sexual slurs, recall a
defiant era for The Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   The trial comes as the school tries to mend its reputation after
an embarrassing string of incidents involving women, starting with
its unsuccessful legal battle against trailblazer Shannon Faulkner
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In August of that year, after a federal judge had ordered the
school to admit her as a cadet, Faulkner enrolled. But she quit a
few days into ``Hell Week'' for first-year ``knobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a similar
males-only policy at Virginia Military Institute. The Citadel's
Board of Visitors promptly lifted its century-and-a-half ban on
women joining the corps of cadets.
</P>
<P>
   Mentavlos was among four women who enrolled in August 1996. But
she quit in December along with Kim Messer, who last year settled
her harassment lawsuit against The Citadel for $37,750.
</P>
<P>
   The two other women did not quit. Nancy Mace graduated in May,
and Petra Lovetinska is now a senior cadet.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy women are now among the 1,758 cadets, said Bruce
Williams, a Citadel spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Mentavlos' suit is stirring up memories The Citadel would rather
put behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best of all possible worlds, everybody would have
settled, from a publicity standpoint,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The school said earlier the settlement ``closes a chapter in the
history of The Citadel'' that ``represents a reasonable solution
for all parties involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was flat cheaper to go that way,'' said Michael
Westmoreland, 62, a 1959 Citadel alumni who lives in Chapin, S.C.
``Had they gone to court and won, they still would have lost in the
public's eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Collins, 35, former president of The Citadel's alumni club
in Atlanta, said the college simply has to endure another round of
negative publicity during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect those two individuals' right to say, `I have not
done anything wrong, and I want my day in court,' `` said Collins,
an Atlanta businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Judge Joe Anderson (who is not related to defendant
Justus Anderson) quizzed potential jurors about their knowledge of
Faulkner's suit.
</P>
<P>
   The references to Faulkner were among numerous signals in court
Tuesday that, even though The Citadel settled out of court, past
conduct of administrators and cadets will surface during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all the evidence that would have come in against The
Citadel will be at issue in this trial,'' said Mentavlos' lawyer,
Dick Harpootlian. Lawyers on both sides have subpoenaed Citadel
officials and former cadets _ including Messer, Mace and Lovetinska
_as possible witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   While the judge has cautioned lawyers against discussing the
trial, the defense strategy could include portraying hazing as
widespread at The Citadel. That would bolster arguments by Saleeby
and Anderson that they did not single out Mentavlos because she was
a woman. In January 1998, the U.S. Justice Department concluded it
lacked evidence to prove that Mentavlos and Messer were hazed
because they were women. Noting that its investigation found that
``many of the male cadets were subject to the same type of abuse
and harassment,'' the agency decided it would not prosecute anybody
at the school for civil rights violations.Chris Burritt writes for

EUROPEANS HAVE DEFERRED TO U.S. IN MICROSOFT LITIGATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It is almost impossible to walk into an
office in Europe and not bump into desktop computers that run
Windows 95 and other Microsoft programs like Word and Excel.
</P>
<P>
   So it was hardly surprising that the scathing appraisal issued
in the Microsoft case by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson last Friday
has been front-page news across the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates has had it now,'' Die Tageszeitung, an irreverent
left-of-center paper in Berlin, asserted. The conservative daily
Die Welt predicted that ``the giant will pull its head out of the
noose.''
</P>
<P>
   European competitiveness officials have not been shy about
challenging Microsoft _ five years ago, they cooperated with
American regulatory authorities in an antitrust investigation that
the company settled by changing contracts with personal computer
manufacturers and eliminating some restrictions on software makers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the European Competition Commission is
investigating at least two formal antitrust complaints against
Microsoft, one from a personal computer maker and the other from a
software maker, commission spokesman Michael Tscherny said. He
would not identify either company but said their complaints concern
Microsoft's operating systems for personal computers and larger
machines called servers.
</P>
<P>
   In the big antitrust case litigated in Washington over the past
year, however, Europe's competition officials have consistently
deferred to American prosecutors, hoping to avoid a long and
expensive investigation of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Tscherny said Monday that officials would ``study the judgment''
and carefully monitor how the case is finally resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy makes sense because Microsoft would probably
replicate in Europe any changes in its policies or its structure
that might be imposed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The European Competition Commission has been aggressive about
challenging other American companies. Karel van Miert, who recently
stepped down as head of the Competition Ministry, forced the Boeing
Co. to abandon some of its long-term contracts with major airlines
before he approved Boeing's merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp.
Though both aerospace companies were American, they needed European
merger approval in order to do business here.
</P>
<P>
   But in that case, American antitrust officials took a much more
benign view of Boeing's practices than the Europeans did. European
officials were also worried about a major European rival _ Airbus.
By contrast, Microsoft's biggest critics are American companies
like America Online. European software companies are mostly on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   That could change. If Microsoft and the U.S. Justice Department
settle the antitrust charges with measures that European
authorities consider too mild, the European Competition Commission
could launch its own proceedings based on evidence that has
surfaced in American court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But European antitrust regulators already are straining under
the weight of other pressures. The competition commission in
Brussels oversees hundreds of routine merger approvals a year and
launches dozens of more intensive investigations. It has also acted
against alliances in European digital television, charged car
manufacturers with trying to hinder cross-border transactions and
recently opened an investigation into the pricing of Internet
access services by European telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, competition officials have steered clear of
issues involving Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has hardly avoided Europe. As it has in the United
States, the software giant has been looking for deals with European
cable television operators and mobile telephone companies, which
are rolling out wireless Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reached an agreement to acquire 29.7 percent of
Telewest, the British cable television operator, from Media One
Inc. It has also held discussions with Bertelsmann AG of Germany
and Deutsche Bank, both of which have been interested in buying up
cable television systems from Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is likely to be affected much by the outcome of
Microsoft's court battle with the Justice Department.

<P>
   When patients come to the University of Virginia Health System
to have an abnormal heart rhythm diagnosed or treated, they are
told that doctors will be threading thin wires through their veins
directly into their heart. They learn that they face a slight risk
of infection, or of damage to the heart, lungs or blood vessels
from the very nature of the invasive procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one thing they are not told: although the catheters
and wires are labeled ``single use only,'' they may have been used
before. They have been cleaned and sterilized, but they have spent
time in someone else's blood vessels and heart.
</P>
<P>
   In hospitals and clinics around the nation, these devices and
others _ biopsy needles used to extract tissue, tiny scissors used
to cut out tissue in patients' gastrointestinal tracts, wires or
balloons that go into the coronary arteries or the heart itself _
are being reused more and more often despite their labeling.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of reusing devices that are approved only for
one-time use is not necessarily dangerous, experts say, but it
generally violates federal regulations. So far, however, the
government has declined to ask the companies that reprocess the
devices to submit evidence that they are safe and effective, but is
now reconsidering its approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have used what we call `enforcement discretion' not to go
after them,'' said Dr. Larry Kessler, who is director of the office
of surveillance and biometrics at the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the FDA has little evidence of a safety
problem, Kessler said, although everyone admits that research is
urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big `yuck' factor to reusing devices,'' Kessler
said. But, he added, ``there are no products where we have
significant evidence that there is immediate harm to public
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and federal officials say the issue is more about
economics than safety. Device makers make less money when
single-use devices are cleaned, sterilized and used again.
Hospitals and medical centers save money, in some cases tens of
thousands of dollars a year, when they reuse the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that manufacturers charge so much that they often
cannot afford to use devices just once; nor can they pass the cost
along to patients, because in many cases the rates have been set in
advance by insurance companies or Medicare. And, they say, many
expensive devices that are labeled ``single use only'' can safely
be used repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Device makers reply that the hospitals are putting patients at
grave risk to save money. ``The real issue is patient safety,''
said Josephine Torrente, president of the Association of Disposable
Device Manufacturers. ``Until you prove otherwise, these devices
are safe and effective for one use. After that, they're garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, caught in the middle, is considering regulating those
who reprocess devices in the same way it regulates the original
device makers. They would have to get approval _ showing the
reprocessed devices were safe and effective _ before they could
sell them. The only exception would be devices, like surgical saw
blades, that are considered to pose a very low risk after being
cleaned and sterilized. At the same time, the agency is suggesting
that the device makers explain on their labels what the risks would
be if the devices were processed.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is posting the proposal on its Web site (www.fda.gov
_ follow the links to ``Medical Devices,'' then ``Recent Federal
Register Notices''). The FDA will hold a satellite teleconference
Wednesday in which the device makers, the companies that reprocess
devices, doctors, hospitals, and ethicists can comment. And on Dec.
14, the FDA will hold a public meeting on its proposal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From all accounts, the business of reprocessing medical devices
is booming, with commercial companies springing up to clean and
sterilize devices and to take on the liability if their processes
fail.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Salomon, the senior vice president of corporate development
at Vanguard Medical Concepts, a reprocessing company in Lakeland,
Fla., said that when he joined Vanguard in 1995, it had just 12
employees. Now, 220 people work there and the plant has grown to
50,000 square feet from 2,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Used devices are cleaned and disinfected. Then the company tests
them to make sure they still function the way they are supposed to.
Finally, the devices are packaged and sterilized with ethylene
oxide gas, the same method that the device makers use.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Are the devices really as good as new?
</P>
<P>
   One way to keep track of device problems is through the FDA's
device surveillance system. When medical devices fail or injure
patients, manufacturers, hospitals, and doctors are supposed to
notify the agency. Of the 100,000 such reports to the agency each
year, virtually all are from devices that were used just once,
Kessler said. Of course, if a reused device does fail, the FDA may
not get a report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine a hospital that discovers a problem and the
manufacturer had said, `Don't reuse that device'? '' Kessler said.
``Do you think the hospital would want to tell anyone? They are
worried that they will be in court and in serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks
outbreaks of infections, which would occur if reused devices were
not sterile. ``To date, there is no strong evidence in this country
that reprocessing medical devices leads to more adverse events than
single use,'' said Dr. William Jarvis, who heads the infections and
prevention branch in the hospital infections program at the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some ask why take a chance. Dr. Philip Grossman, a
gastroenterologist in Miami who is a consultant to the device
manufacturers group, said he has challenged defenders of reuse in
public forums. ``I said, `You look me in the eye in front of this
group and tell me you do it because you think it's better for your
patients,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that the debate can best be advanced by actual
data on safety.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical groups, as well as a device maker, have done their
own studies, asking whether medical devices can be safely cleaned,
sterilized and reused.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Davis, an electrical engineer and senior patent
attorney at Boston Scientific, a leading device maker, said her
company has evidence that devices often are contaminated and
degraded when they are e-processed.
</P>
<P>
   The company takes reprocessed devices off hospital shelves and
sends them to independent labs for testing, Ms. Davis said. ``In
all cases,'' she said, ``at least 45 percent of the devices have
come back contaminated.'' In one case, Ms. Davis said, the FDA and
Vanguard independently tested devices from lots that the company
had said were contaminated. But when they looked, the devices were
sterile.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Spears, a director of enforcement at the FDA, said the
agency was still investigating. ``We have a number of different lab
results for the same product,'' he said. ``We need to find out what
happened _ and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis, who said the company was working on getting its
studies published in the United States, also stated that Boston
Scientific's tests indicate that reprocessed devices can have
subtle changes in their functions that could be devastating to
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Other safety studies were published in leading medical journals.
In one, Dr. Richard Kozarek, chief of gastroenterology at Virginia
Mason Medical Center in Seattle, examined the reuse of an argon
beam plasma coagulation probe, a $190 device that is used to stop
bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. If used 10 times, it would
cost $24 per procedure, even with the cost of cleaning and
sterilizing; if used five times, it would cost $42. The device was
first introduced in Europe and Asia, labeled for multiple use. It
even came with instructions for cleaning, Kozarek said. A few years
ago, it was introduced in the United States, labeled for single use
only.
</P>
<P>
   Kozarek and his colleagues put the device through a rigorous
test, contaminating it with spores from the bacterium Bacillus
subtilis, among the most difficult organisms to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found organisms too numerous to count throughout the
device,'' Kozarek said. But after he cleaned it and sterilized it,
they were gone. The investigators also asked if the device still
functioned and found that it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long and short of it was that it was reusable for up to 10
times and we didn't test it more than 10 times,'' said Kozarek, who
published his results in the American Journal of Gastroenterology
in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kozarek also tested sphincterotomes, which are used to cut open
abnormal sphincter muscles in the bile duct. His group again found
that the devices could safely be cleaned, sterilized, and reused,
publishing their data in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in 1997.
Kozarek's group began reprocessing the devices and, among 1,000
patients treated, found two who had become infected. They checked,
fearing the infections had arisen from improperly sterilized
devices. But ``they were brand-new devices,'' Kozarek said. The
infections turned out to be unrelated to the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kozarek and his colleagues routinely reuse gastroenterology
devices. ``We saved this institution about $65,000 in medical
costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Dr. James Frakes, a gastroenterologist in Rockford,
Ill., say they do not reuse devices because of liability concerns.
But Frakes said such caution has a cost. ``We cannot afford to use
some single-use accessories in our unit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Virginia Health System, where
electrocardiologists routinely reuse devices that can cost $1,000
or more per patient but far less if they are reused, there have
been no safety problems, said Dr. David Haines, a professor of
internal medicine there. Several groups have published papers
reporting that it is safe to reuse the devices. And Haines says the
economics of medicine leaves him little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of single use is prohibitive,'' he said. ``If we were
forced to have single use on catheters we would shift from being
marginally profitable to probably losing $600,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Torrente said that those who reuse devices that are
designed for single use are playing a risky game. ``If this is so
safe and so OK, why don't we tell the patients?'' Ms. Torrente
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Haines said there was no reason to bring it up. ``Why force the
issue?'' he said. ``Show us the data that says this is exposing the
patient to increased risk.''
</P>
<P>
   What if patients started insisting that Haines use new devices,
fresh out of the package?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we found that a lot of patients were starting to demand
that we use brand new equipment,'' Haines said, ``we would probably
decline to take their cases and refer them elsewhere.''  &QL;

 &HT;    POWER COMPANIES SAID LOBBYING FOR POLLUTION 'RIDER'
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Electric industry lobbyists have drafted a
one-paragraph ``rider'' to allow power companies to sidestep
continuing federal air pollution charges, environmental groups
charged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government last week sued seven large utilities with aging
coal-fired power plants for illegally pumping millions of tons of
pollutants into the air since passage of the Clear Air Act in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Suits filed by the Justice Department for the Environmental
Protection Agency contend that 32 power plants were exempt from the
original air pollution law under the theory they would be phased
out. Instead, power companies illegally modified and expanded them,
dumping more 3 million tons of pollutants into the air annually, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Power company officials have denied violating environmental laws
and have vowed to oppose the lawsuits, which could result in
millions of dollars in fines against them.
</P>
<P>
   A seemingly innocuous bill being circulated in the Capitol this
week would give the companies immunity from ``civil or criminal
penalties or sanctions'' while the government's suits are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, who released the document late Tuesday,
said it is drafted to be attached as a last-minute ``rider'' to one
of four federal appropriations bill in Congress's last-minute rush
to adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying ``explanatory statement'' says that the language
is necessary to allow the companies to perform ``routine
maintenance and repair activities'' on the plants while the suit is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Hawkins, a senior attorney with the Natural
Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the bill
would give power companies amnesty from daily fines of several
thousand dollars per plant during the period that the cases are in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could tell their lawyers to just go to court and let the
meter run for 10 years,'' said Hawkins, who was assistant EPA
administrator for air programs in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   Without the legislation, the companies eventually could be held
liable for pollution they cause during what might be an extended
court fight over the suits, as well as past violations, Hawkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another environmental group, Clean the Air, charged that the
power companies were looking ``to friends in high places today to
win a back-room deal that would protect them from looming penalties
because of past violations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic case of lawmakers assisting lawbreakers,''
said Angela Ledford, campaign manager for Clean the Air.
</P>
<P>
   Power industry officials contacted late Tuesday said they knew
nothing of the proposed rider.

</P>
<P>
   Suits filed by the Justice Department for the Environmental
Protection Agency contend that 32 power plants were exempt from the
original air pollution law under the theory they would be phased
out. Instead, power companies illegally modified and expanded them,
dumping more 3 million tons of pollutants into the air annually, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Power company officials have denied violating environmental laws
and have vowed to oppose the lawsuits, which could result in
millions of dollars in fines against them.
</P>
<P>
   A seemingly innocuous bill being circulated in the Capitol this
week would give the companies immunity from ``civil or criminal
penalties or sanctions'' while the government's suits are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, who released the document late Tuesday,
said it is drafted to be attached as a last-minute ``rider'' to one
of four federal appropriations bill in Congress's last-minute rush
to adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying ``explanatory statement'' says that the language
is necessary to allow the companies to perform ``routine
maintenance and repair activities'' on the plants while the suit is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Hawkins, a senior attorney with the Natural
Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the bill
would give power companies amnesty from daily fines of several
thousand dollars per plant during the period that the cases are in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could tell their lawyers to just go to court and let the
meter run for 10 years,'' said Hawkins, who was assistant EPA
administrator for air programs in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   Without the legislation, the companies eventually could be held
liable for pollution they cause during what might be an extended
court fight over the suits, as well as past violations, Hawkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another environmental group, Clean the Air, charged that the
power companies were looking ``to friends in high places today to
win a back-room deal that would protect them from looming penalties
because of past violations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic case of lawmakers assisting lawbreakers,''
said Angela Ledford, campaign manager for Clean the Air.
</P>
<P>
   Power industry officials contacted late Tuesday said they knew
nothing of the proposed rider.

   WASHINGTON _ Electric industry lobbyists have drafted a
one-paragraph ``rider'' to allow power companies to sidestep
continuing federal air pollution charges, environmental groups
charged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

coal-fired power plants for illegally pumping millions of tons of

RESIGNATION OF IMF CHIEF SETS OFF STRUGGLE FOR SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Great Britain, Germany)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michel Camdessus resigned Tuesday in the middle of
his third term as chief of the International Monetary Fund, setting
off a behind-the-scenes struggle involving the Clinton
administration and big European nations over who will direct the
agency that is in effect dictating national economic policy from
Russia to Indonesia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus, who has steered the IMF for nearly 13 years through a
succession of economic crises, said Tuesday that ``entirely
personal reasons'' had prompted his resignation two years before
the end of his term. Colleagues said constant travel and a
succession of international crises had exhausted him.
</P>
<P>
   But in a half-hour conversation in his office here Tuesday
afternoon, the 67-year-old former central banker in France appeared
vigorous, telling tales of political intrigue, responding to
attacks from conservatives in the U.S. Congress who had accused him
of wasting billions in bailing out Russia, and arguing that his
much-attacked prescriptions saved Asia from a far worse economic
fate.
</P>
<P>
   And in discussing the fund's growing political impact throughout
the world, he acknowledged for the first time that its actions in
Indonesia served as a catalyst in forcing out the man who led the
nation, the world's fourth-most populous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created the conditions that obliged President Suharto to
leave his job,'' Camdessus said. ``That was not our intention,'' he
said, but quickly added that soon after Suharto's resignation he
traveled to Moscow to warn Russian President Boris Yeltsin that the
same forces could end his control of Russia unless he acted to
contain them.
</P>
<P>
   Because the IMF has become such a tremendous political force on
the world scene, the struggle over who will occupy Camdessus'
spacious office, situated almost exactly halfway between the White
House and the Federal Reserve, will likely be a fierce one.
Traditionally the fund has been run by a European, and for 30 of
its 51 years the top job has gone to a Frenchman. And Washington
has usually had only a bit role in selecting the head of the fund
because it has sole discretion to choose the head of the IMF's much
larger sister institution, the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank focuses on alleviating poverty and promoting
development, while the fund's mission is economic stabilization,
particularly in time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   All that may change. Europe appears divided on the question of
who should succeed Camdessus when he steps down in February, and
the administration has signaled that it intends to play a much
bigger role in the selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important decision for the fund at a very
important time,'' a senior Treasury official said Tuesday evening.
``The stakes are higher now because the fund's profile is so much
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the United States was looking for a
candidate ``who will have strong credibility in the markets,'' and
that the United States was not necessarily ready to back a European
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top candidates for the job are Caio Koch-Weser, the
state secretary of finance in Germany and former managing director
of the World Bank, and Andrew Crockett of Britain, who heads the
Bank of International Settlements in Switzerland. Other possible
successors include the current head of the Bank of France,
Jean-Claude Trichet, who is scheduled to be the next head of the
European Central Bank; Mervyn King, deputy governor of the Bank of
England; Nigel Wicks, a top official in Britain's treasury
department; and Horst Koehler, head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
   In his nearly 13 years at the fund, Camdessus earned praise _
particularly from American officials _ as a savvy political
operator who could cajole, wheedle and threaten foreign leaders who
were reluctant to enact economic reform. ``Damn right he can be
tough,'' former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen once said of him,
though he added ``sometimes you have to lean on him real hard to
get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Washington called for help, he was almost always there
_ particularly in 1995, when an early-morning call from Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin with the news that Congress would not back a
bailout of Mexico, led him to take extraordinary unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
   He committed $18 billion without the usual round of negotiations
with the board that directs the fund. He later told them,
``Gentlemen, I don't ask your permission because you would have to
speak with your ministers or governors. And you have no time for
that.'' The bailout worked.
</P>
<P>
   His critics, and they were legion, have had many complaints.
They have viewed Camdessus as arrogant _ ``I am French,'' he once
said in an interview during the Asian financial crisis, ``and what
Frenchmen is not accused of that?'' _ and far too quick to urge the
devaluation of currencies and fiscal austerity. In fact, that is
what the IMF did when the Asian crisis started in Thailand and
Indonesia, but within months it backed away, restoring subsidies
for fuel and rice to contain growing street protests.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, conservatives have complained that the fund wasted
billions, particularly with a $17 billion bailout of Russia last
year that collapsed in months _ and which has spurred ongoing
investigations into where the fund's money went. Camdessus repeated
Tuesday that ``the charges are completely unsubstantiated,'' and
said that ``we must not loose sight of the fact that Russia is now
a democracy and a market economy, even if it is blurred by
corruption and cronyism and mistakes in Chechnya.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What undercut some of Camdessus' credibility on Capitol Hill,
where funding for the IMF is perpetually under attack, was his
tendency to act as a public cheerleader for countries in trouble.
Speaking of the capital flight from Russia in the spring of 1998,
for example, he said: ``Contrary to what markets and commentators
are imagining, this is not a crisis. This is not a major
development.'' It became one quickly, spurring one of the fund's
biggest and least successful stabilization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Camdessus said he was resigned to the fact that
Europeans and Asians view him as a lackey for the United States _
``they call me a damn U.S. neoliberal in Europe,'' he said _ while
in Congress he is viewed as not doing enough to advance the U.S.
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the American influence in the IMF is strong,
very strong, and for good reason,'' he said. ``America has a
systemic vision of the world. The problem is that America does not
always put its money where its mouth is. When my countrymen in
Europe complain about that, I say that if you had the guts to stand
united, you would have more power than the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he ushered a visitor past his collection of sculpture,
including one of an Indian goddess who ``dances on ignorance and is
the force of creative destruction,'' to a favorite painting. It
shows a blur of hands reaching into the pockets of a pinstriped
suit. The painting is titled: ``Sorry, no funds.''

 &HT;    POWER COMPANIES SAID LOBBYING FOR POLLUTION 'RIDER'

   WASHINGTON _ Electric industry lobbyists have drafted a
one-paragraph ``rider'' to allow power companies to sidestep
continuing federal air pollution charges, environmental groups
charged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government last week sued seven large utilities with aging

 &HT;    Airlines set to take on Web giants of travel
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines and three other big carriers plan a
joint venture to create a travel Web site that will compete with
giants Travelocity and Expedia.
</P>
<P>
   The as-yet-unnamed site, to be launched by mid-2000, will offer
``brand neutral'' comparative fares from most of the world's
airlines, including Internet-only specials, the carriers said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also will be able to make hotel, car and cruise
reservations at the site, which is to be independently managed.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines in the joint venture _ Delta, United, Northwest and
Continental _ will still offer their own Web sites and continue to
participate in independent sites such as priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the new site will attract consumers who want a range of
services and the ability to do comparison shopping, said Vince
Caminiti, Delta's senior vice president for sales and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neutrality is the key here,'' he said. ``We want to have the
customer believe they are getting objectivity and neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines also hope the joint venture will grab a share of
the business now dominated by Microsoft's Expedia, which has about
4.4 million monthly visitors, and Sabre Corp.'s Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   Sabre is a unit of American Airlines parent AMR Corp. It
recently announced plans to buy Preview Travel, another large,
all-purpose travel site, and combine it with Travelocity. Together,
the two sites have about 7 million monthly visitors and trail only
Amazon.com and eBay.com in e-commerce sales, according to Media
Matrix.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying underscores the airline industry's broad embrace
of the Internet as a cost-cutting distribution channel. Consumers
who book online essentially do the work of travel agents and
reservationists, cutting the airlines' commission and labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to get the airline industry to agree on very
much, but one thing they seem to be together on is the potential of
the Internet to lower distribution costs,'' said PaineWebber
analyst Sam Buttrick.
</P>
<P>
   James Cammissa, publisher of Travel Industry Indicators, said
the new joint venture Web site is another ominous sign for travel
agencies, which have seen airlines chop commission rates at the
same time they are pushing travelers toward the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're creating an electronic travel agency that can book at
extremely low cost,'' he said. ``It should get a lot of consumer
recognition and response.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents, who remain the biggest distribution channel for
air travel, contend they offer the most objective pricing
information to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The growth curve in Internet travel bookings is steep. A new
study by PhoCusWright Inc., an online travel consulting firm, said
11 million Americans booked travel online in the past year, an 80
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Delta now generates between 7 percent and 9 percent of its
revenue from Internet bookings _ about half at its own Web site.
Caminiti said industry forecasts predict that airline-specific
sites will capture about 40 percent of online bookings in the
future, with independent sites garnering the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, that share is dominated by a couple of big players,
and we plan to add another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But PhoCusWright Chief Executive Philip Wolf said Tuesday's
announcement was ``more headline-grabbing than anything else,''
with many details left unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be folly for the airlines to think they can operate a
Web site any more efficiently than Travelocity or Expedia,'' he
said, noting it will take a major investment ``to pay for
operations, technology and marketing expenses of the new Brand X
portal.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines did not reveal any financial details or the
headquarters location of the planned joint venture.

POLL SHOWS PUBLIC TRUSTS DEMOCRATS ON KEY ISSUES, BUT GOP STILL HAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   A year before the election, Democrats enjoy public confidence on
most critical election issues, from health care to education to
Social Security, and more voters say they will vote for Democrats
than Republicans in the House of Representatives, the latest New
York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   The poll does contain some good news for the Republicans. The
party still has the leading candidate in the presidential race:
George W. Bush, who holds a clear, though somewhat smaller lead
over either Vice President Al Gore or former Sen. Bill Bradley. And
Bush himself remains the runaway favorite among Republicans for his
party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Republicans, whose image suffered badly during
the battle to impeach President Clinton, have recovered some ground
on several issues and for the first time in more than a year have
an overall favorable standing with the public. But the gains are
modest and do not affect Democratic dominance on issues that voters
say they care about the most.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest number for the Democrats in the poll was on how
people expected to vote in House races next year. Forty-five
percent said they would vote for a Democrat in their district,
while 38 percent said they would vote for a Republican. While a
national poll cannot predict the results of 435 House elections, an
actual 7 percentage point advantage in the November 2000 election
would ensure a Democratic House.
</P>
<P>
   The public clearly finds the most fault with the Republicans who
control Congress. A Gallup Poll, conducted on the same days,
Thursday through Sunday, as the Times/CBS News Poll, showed 53
percent of the public disapproved of congressional Republicans,
while 38 percent approved. For Democrats in Congress, 49 percent
approved and 42 percent disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   On issues, the poll measured one especially striking Republican
failure. Despite their spending much of the summer and fall trying
to assert that their party was trying to protect Social Security
while Democrats were about to squander its resources, the public
solidly prefers the Democrats to make the ``right decisions'' about
Social Security. Forty-nine percent preferred the Democrats; 33
percent the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 49 percent to 33 percent ratio favored the Democrats
on improving education in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   When the public was asked which party would do a better job of
improving the health care system, 54 percent cited the Democrats,
compared to 28 percent who named the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But on the question of which party would do best at ensuring a
strong military, Republicans held a 57 percent to 37 percent
advantage. Yet that advantage has little apparent political value.
Only 2 percent of the public considered defense the ``single most
important problem for the president and Congress to deal with.''
Six percent cited education, 8 percent cited Social Security, and
13 percent cited health care.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also suggested that the early dominance of Bush may be
softening in the presidential race. The poll showed that he led
Gore by 50 percent to 41 percent and Bradley by 51 to 39 percent.
The differences between those two hypothetical races are not
statistically significant in this poll of 1,162 adults, of whom 953
said they were registered voters. In both groups the margin of
sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led Gore by wider margins in CBS News Polls conducted
earlier this fall, by 17 points in September and 15 points in
October. His lead over Bradley has fluctuated, going from 12 points
in September to 22 in October and back to 12 points in this poll.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore retained wide leads, nationally, for their
party's nomination, though those figures do not reflect the
standings in particular states, like New Hampshire, where several
surveys have found the races much closer.
</P>
<P>
   Among people who said they were likely to vote in a Democratic
primary or caucus, Gore led Bradley, 56 percent to 30 percent. That
was slightly less than his 58 percent to 26 percent lead in a CBS
News Poll last month. And while both trailed Bush, both led Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., in a trial matchup. Gore's lead was 47
percent to 36 percent; Bradley's was 47 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the candidates in both parties, Gore's support seemed
firmest. Forty percent of his Democratic backers said their minds
were made up, while 59 percent said it was too early to be certain.
Among Bradley's primary supporters 27 percent said their minds were
made up.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also enjoyed another edge over Bradley, and Bush, too. When
people who said they would vote for him in a general election were
asked why they liked him, 86 percent gave a specific reason, like
his experience or a position on an issue. Seventy-two percent of
Bradley's supporters had that sort of answer.
</P>
<P>
   The differences were even more striking between Bush and McCain.
Sixty-one percent of Bush backers and 86 percent of McCain
supporters had a specific reason. Bush had a number of backers who
said ``I like him'' or ``He can win.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's national lead is immense, with two-thirds of
Republican primary voters supporting him, and no one else in
shouting distance at the moment, the vagueness of support could be
troublesome. Backers who support someone because he can win can be
quickly discouraged if he loses in a single primary. A dramatic
example of that came in February 1980, when the governor's father,
George Bush, led Ronald Reagan but Reagan's backers were much
clearer in their reasons. After Bush lost in New Hampshire, his
backing dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Among people who said they were likely to vote in a Republican
primary or caucus, Bush was supported by 68 percent. No one else
had more than 8 percent, the total for McCain, who in recent weeks
has attracted a surge of support in New Hampshire, the site of the
first primary. In a CBS News Poll last month, his nationwide
support stood at 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the publishing heir, had 5 percent in the most
recent poll, followed by Alan Keyes with 3 percent, and Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch of Utah and Gary L. Bauer at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was viewed favorably by 60 percent of Republican primary
voters, and unfavorably by just 7 percent. The only other
Republicans with more favorable than unfavorable ratings were
McCain and Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republican primary voters, there was little difference in
the intensity of support. For Bush, 28 percent said their minds
were made up. For all the others, the total pools of supporters
were too small to provide a reliable measure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One key to Bush's strength in the nomination process has been
his party's belief that he has the best chance to win in November.
And a persistent key to his strength is his support from women and
from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, election polling has consistently
shown that women are less likely than men to support the Republican
Party and its candidates. But those differences become
statistically meaningless in Bush's case. He led Gore 51 to 41
percent among men and 50 percent to 41 percent among women. He led
Bradley by the same 51 to 41 percent among men, and 51 to 38
percent among women.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also attracted substantial numbers of Democrats, 20 percent
against Gore and 24 percent against Bradley. Those party defectors
tended to be southern, conservative and religious.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lost only 6 percent of Republicans to Gore and 8 percent to
Bradley. While Republicans often have lower defection rates than
Democrats, the difference between the rates involving Bush are
greater than usual. For instance, in the 1996 presidential
election, there were about an equal number of defections on both
sides. Thirteen percent of Republicans voted for Clinton and a
roughly equal 10 percent of Democrats voted for former Sen. Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The poll did show a favorable standing for Bush's party.
Forty-eight percent of the respondents viewed the Republicans
favorably, while 43 percent had an unfavorable opinion, and 9
percent had no opinion at all. For the Democratic Party, the
results were a bit better; 52 percent had a favorable view; 39
percent an unfavorable opinion, and 9 percent no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's political wild card, the Reform Party, has a
strongly negative image. Fifty-three percent have an unfavorable
view, 26 percent a favorable opinion, and 21 percent no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are its potential presidential candidates highly regarded.
Pat Buchanan draws 6 percent of the vote if matched against Bush
and either Gore or Bradley. In both matchups, Buchanan takes votes
mainly from Bush and narrows Bush's lead over the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is viewed unfavorably by 54 percent of the voters, and
favorably by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not nearly as negative as the view held about Donald
Trump, the New York real estate magnate who has just joined the
Reform Party and says he will seek its nomination if he believes he
can win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Just 7 percent of Americans have a favorable view and 70 percent
an unfavorable opinion. That is the highest unfavorable view ever
recorded by a Times/CBS News Poll. The last comparably negative
rating was a 3 percent favorable, 55 percent unfavorable recorded
by Linda Tripp, the former friend of Monica Lewinsky, in October
1998.

 &HT;    UPS's initial public offering is largest ever
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service today delivers itself to Wall
Street, completing the biggest initial public offering ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandy Springs-based package delivery giant on Tuesday issued
shares valued at $5.47 billion, eclipsing the $4.4 billion Conoco
Inc. IPO of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The shares begin trading publicly today on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker symbol ``UPS.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS is selling about 10 percent of its private stock, or 109.4
million shares. The company and its underwriters settled Tuesday on
a price of $50 a share, slightly above the target range of $47 to
$49.
</P>
<P>
   UPS Chairman and CEO Jim Kelly _ whose own holdings are worth
about $10 million at the offering price _ will ring the opening
bell at the stock exchange. He'll be joined by a UPS pilot, driver
and office worker.
</P>
<P>
   The company will stage an outdoor exhibit on Wall Street. It
will include various modes of UPS transport, from a full-scale
Boeing 727 fuselage to a classic brown truck and a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   While headline-grabbing IPOs these days tend to be high-tech
upstarts, UPS is a venerable corporate giant. The company, which
moved its headquarters to Atlanta in 1992 from Greenwich, Conn.,
last year delivered a profit of $1.7 billion on revenue of $24.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   For most of UPS' 92-year history, stock has been in the hands of
management and foundations. In 1995, all employees were allowed to
buy stock at an internally set price, which recently was about half
the public offering price. About 125,000 employees own stock, and
all will see a significant gain as a result of the public offering.
But under federal regulations, it will be six months before
employees can begin selling stock on the public market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty excited, but I wished I owned more,'' said Clarence
Witchard, a UPS driver from College Park.
</P>
<P>
   UPS says the offering is aimed not at raising cash but rather at
creating a class of publicly traded shares that can be used as
currency in future acquisitions. About a month after the offering,
UPS will use the proceeds to buy back as much as 10 percent of
shares held by employees, at the new market price.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poors analyst Mark Basham said he doesn't expect a
big price run-up in first-day trading. ``But we think UPS will be a
blue chip core holding in many portfolios,'' he added.

 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, New York _ Gov. George Pataki announced Tuesday a plan
to stop the decades-old practice of emptying its huge psychiatric
hospitals and called for spending an additional $125 million for
supervised housing and other community-based services for the
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The policy shift would temporarily suspend the mandate that
hospital administrators have faced for years to reduce their
inpatient hospital populations. That mandate has frequently forced
administrators to discharge patients who in many cases pose a
threat to themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the proposals represent the most comprehensive
plan in recent memory to plug holes in a system that critics say
has been cynically used by the state to trim hundreds of millions
from its budget at the expense of mentally ill people who have been
discharged onto the streets with little or no supervision.
</P>
<P>
   A series of violent attacks committed by mentally ill people
discharged from state mental hospitals has cast a stark spotlight
on the issue, and fueled intense criticism of Pataki's
administration. Mental health advocates have pointed to budget cuts
that year after year have reduced critical support networks that
allowed some of the mentally ill to survive outside psychiatric
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the state has come under fire in the case of
Andrew Goldstein, a schizophrenic man who shoved Kendra Webdale in
front of a New York City subway car last January, killing her.
Goldstein had tried to get help before the attack but was turned
away again and again by the state's troubled and overburdened
mental health system. His criminal case ended in a mistrial last
week after a jury deadlocked over whether Goldstein's behavior met
the legal definition of insanity when he killed Ms. Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   The governor specifically cited Goldstein's case in
acknowledging the problems in the state's mental health system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that I am personally shocked when something
like this happens,'' Pataki told reporters during a news conference
at the Capitol. ``Whenever there is an incident like this, I take a
look and think: My goodness. What can we as a people _ what can I
as a governor _ do to protect individuals from themselves and to
protect us as a society?''
</P>
<P>
   The state spends $4.2 billion a year on mental health, with
about $2.3 billion of that going toward community-based programs,
group homes, supervised housing and expensive, short-term care in
local hospitals. The $125 million would be parceled out, with $52
million geared toward case managers and $20 million set to pay for
2,000 new housing units, with the rest divided among a variety of
programs.
</P>
<P>
   While the additional money, which requires approval by the state
Legislature, is a small part of the overall budget for mental
health, some advocates say the governor has financed just 200 new
supervised housing units for the mentally ill during his first four
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal also called for temporarily halting the
state's longstanding policy of deinstitutionalization, a practice
that has systematically discharged thousands and thousands of
mental patients from the state's big psychiatric hospitals. Moving
patients into group homes and community-based services began in the
1950s as a response to public outrage over the deplorable
conditions and neglect uncovered in some of the larger institutions
and in response to a growing awareness of more humane treatments
for the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, the policy is widely believed to have
been a significant factor in the growth of homelessness, as
financing and community-based housing failed to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, 93,000 patients lived in New York's state mental
hospitals. Deinstitutionalization has decreased that number to
6,000 patients, the majority of whom are seriously mentally ill,
and, in many cases, criminally insane and prone to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan announced Tuesday, the state would set aside, for
one year, its goal of reducing the mental hospital population to as
low as 3,700 and would adjust spending projections at the hospitals
so that financing would stay the same to care for the higher number
of patients during the yearlong hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   While mental health systems vary from state to state, the effort
to empty publicly financed psychiatric hospitals has spread across
the nation over the last 20 to 30 years. But like New York, many
states have found in recent years that the effort has led to
problems like increased homelessness and incarceration among the
mentally ill, many of whom found themselves discharged without
adequate community supports.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the fastest-growing part of mental health budgets
in most states has been for programs in prisons and jails,
according to Clarence J. Sundram, a mental health expert who was
the head of the state's Commission on Quality of Care for the
Mentally Disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health advocates in New York State said Tuesday that they
were surprised by the governor's announcement and they praised his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Madarasz, a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees
Association, which represents 9,000 workers at state psychiatric
hospitals, said the change came at a crucial time. He said many of
the patients who remained in the state's psychiatric hospitals
could not be easily discharged, given the severity of their
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stunned,'' he said. ``On the face of it, this is very
welcome. It is as if the administration is finally recognizing the
reality that we have been talking about for years. A lot of these
patients need long-term care and supervision that can be best
provided in a hospital setting.''
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million planned for the 2,000 new supervised housing
units will come from federal, state and local governments, with
two-thirds provided by the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan falls short of the number of apartments that
supporters and even the state itself say is needed. In the
mid-1990s, for example, the state's Office of Mental Health
conducted a survey that determined the state could use between
35,000 and 40,000 units of housing for mentally ill people.
Currently, the state provides only 21,000 supervised community
beds.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the plan include financing for permanent housing with
24-hour supervision. Critics of the state's mental health policies
say this type of housing is critically important for seriously ill
patients like Goldstein, if they are expected to function outside
psychiatric hospitals. A draft report of a new state investigation
has concluded that the mental health system spent nearly $100,000 a
year to treat him through repeated short-time hospital stays when
he needed the less costly combination of supervised housing and
daily visits from a case manager.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials note that their plan will free up much
of the existing 24-hour supervised housing that currently exists.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Nortz, director of policy for the Coalition for the
Homeless, called the governor's plan a step in the right direction,
but added that it does not fully address the overall need of New
York's mentally ill. Ms. Nortz said that in New York City alone,
roughly 10,000 homeless mentally ill people need some sort of
state-funded supervised housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very encouraged that the governor is now inching his
way toward meeting the housing need for this vulnerable
population,'' she said. ``We are now moving from the point where
this administration was cutting service to the mentally ill to a
point where the governor is taking this issue seriously and adding
the resources that are long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   The housing proposal comes seven months after Pataki and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani reached a compromise on expanding a landmark
program for housing mentally ill homeless people in New York City.
The agreement, known as New York-New York II, requires that the
city and state spend slightly more than $100 million to provide
1,500 apartments for mentally ill homeless people over the next
five years. But that figure falls short of the number of apartments
that supporters of the program had sought.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's announcement Tuesday, he called for increased
financing of $52 million for new case managers, a move that mental
health advocates say was critically important if the state hopes to
adequately monitor patients assigned to the new units that the
administration now plans to finance.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials could not say how many new case
managers would be hired, they estimated that the number of mentally
ill people receiving case management services would increase to
25,000 from 15,600. The plan also calls for spending $8 million to
expand temporary housing units operated at five state-financed
psychiatric hospitals in New York City, in an effort to help
patients prepare for life outside those institutions before they
are discharged.

$1 INCREASE IN MINIMUM WAGE WINS SENATE APPROVAL BUT FACES A VETO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Mex., R.I., Vt., Me., Pa., Ga., Ohio)  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Split along party lines, the Senate on Tuesday
approved a Republican plan to raise the federal minimum wage by $1
an hour over three years, to $6.15, and provide a variety of tax
breaks mostly to the owners of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan passed 54-44. Before that vote, the Senate
rejected, 50-48, the Democratic alternative _ a $1 hourly increase
in the minimum wage over 13 months and more limited tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Neither plan stands a chance of enactment this year, but it is a
fair bet that one way or another, the minimum wage will be raised
before next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has pledged to veto the bill the Senate
approved Tuesday if it reaches his desk. In a White House statement
Tuesday, Clinton accused Republicans of ``using a minimum wage
increase as a cynical tool to advance special interest tax
breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Representatives, minimum wage legislation has
been stymied for months because of three factions, none of which
commands a majority: Republicans, including the leadership, who
oppose any increase in the minimum wage; most Democrats, who favor
the alternative rejected Tuesday by the Senate; and a coalition of
many Republicans and a few Democrats who support a bill similar to
the one passed by the Senate except that it has even more generous
tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, the House Ways and Means Committee approved
the tax component of the bill favored by the bipartisan coalition.
It would reduce taxes by more than $30 billion over the next five
years. More than half of this cost would result from lowering the
inheritance taxes of wealthy families.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage issue has divided Democrats and Republicans for
generations, and the arguments have hardly changed since the first
minimum wage, 25 cents an hour, was introduced as part of the New
Deal in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats generally hold that the lowest paid workers deserve a
larger share of the country's growing bounty. Republicans usually
maintain that an increased minimum wage would go mainly to
teenagers, not to primary bread-winners, and that businesses would
tend to lay off workers rather than raise their pay.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., argued Tuesday
that ``the hardest working Americans'' deserved a pay increase ``at
a time of extraordinary prosperity.'' Without an increase, Kennedy
said, the buying power of the minimum wage will become the lowest
in decades.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.Mex., quoted studies
showing that two-thirds of minimum-wage workers are part-time
employees, more than half are younger than 25, and only 8 percent
are female heads of households.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle Tuesday was more over politics than substance. In
public opinion polls, more than 80 percent of Americans say they
favor raising the minimum wage. Democrats want to press that
advantage. Republicans want their own bill to keep Democrats from
getting the political credit.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Congress voted to raise the minimum wage was
before the 1996 elections. In two stages, the level was increased
to $5.15 from $4.25.
</P>
<P>
   The political imperatives have led both sides to refuse to split
their relatively small differences.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seemed perfectly happy to have the issue spill over
into next year, an election year. Following the vote Tuesday,
Kennedy said, ``If we're not going to win in the early part of next
year, we'll win at the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would raise the minimum wage by 35 cents next
year, 35 cents in 2001 and 30 cents in 2000, and would lower taxes
by $18 billion over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also allow self-employed workers to take an
immediate tax deduction for all their health insurance premiums,
give employees a deduction if their companies do not pay most of
their premiums, make pension rules more generous to business owners
and better paid workers and allow 80 percent of the cost of
business meals and entertainment to be deducted, up from 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It would rewrite basic labor law so that employers would no
longer have to count bonuses, commissions and some other forms of
compensation when calculating how much overtime pay workers were
owed. This provision directly challenges a law sacred to labor
unions and might have been designed to taunt Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   These minimum wage and tax measures were added as amendments to
a bill, favored by banks and credit card companies but opposed by
many consumer organizations, that would make it harder for people
to avoid paying debts by declaring bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other amendments to the bankruptcy bill are pending,
and its fate is very much in doubt as Congress tries to wind up the
session.
</P>
<P>
   On the narrow vote Tuesday rejecting the Democratic version of
the minimum wage bill, the solid block of Democrats were joined by
four Republicans: Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of
Vermont, Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee's vote was noteworthy in that it was his first
opportunity to break with his party since he was sworn in last week
to replace his father, John Chafee. John Chafee, who died last
month, often broke party ranks, though he rarely cast a decisive
vote that led to a Republican defeat. Many in the Capitol have been
watching closely to see the extent to which the son follows in his
father's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   On the vote approving the Republican plan, only two senators
crossed party lines. Max Cleland, D-Ga., voted for the measure, and
George Voinovich, R-Ohio, opposed it.

<P>
   Two years ago, in the weeks before the National Football League
draft, Bill Polian found himself immersed in a great debate: Who
was the better quarterback, Peyton Manning or Ryan Leaf? Now the
choice seems laughable, but at the time NFL executives argued the
point ferociously. In the offices of the Indianapolis Colts,
something about Leaf's lack of seasoning compared to Manning's
maturity struck the master architect Polian. Manning became his
choice, and Leaf went to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Manning donned his blue and white Colts jersey,
completing the move by Polian that would change the Colts' fortunes
and even help revitalize the league itself, Polian was speaking to
an NFL executive. He asked Polian a simple question: What was the
final thing that propelled him toward Manning and away from Leaf?
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at Manning and I knew I was getting a leader who
could put this team on his back for 15 years,'' the executive
recalled Polian as saying. ``I looked at Ryan and I saw a much more
immature player. In my gut I wasn't sure how long Ryan would last
in the NFL. It could be 10 years, but it could be one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently Polian denied making those exact remarks. ``I've said
all along I felt both guys were exceptionally talented,'' he said.
``To me, Peyton was ahead going in and coming out but I still do
think that Ryan has the talent to succeed in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end it was about a choice. Manning or Leaf. Leaf or
Manning. It is the kind of decision that can change the course of a
franchise, make a career, or ruin one. Polian, as he did while
building the Buffalo Bills into a four-time Super Bowl contender,
made the right choice.
</P>
<P>
   Manning has led the Colts to a surprising 6-2 record heading
into Sunday's game against the Giants at the Meadowlands, and is
one of the most exciting players in the game. He is surrounded by a
cast of Polian-assembled talent, notably wide receiver Marvin
Harrison and running back Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in San Diego, Leaf was benched midway through his
rookie year and was recently suspended for four weeks after cursing
out Bobby Beathard, the general manager who drafted him, for
refusing to complete a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Manning isn't the golly-gee guy he is often portrayed to be in
the news media; like most football players, he has been known to
occasionally use a spicy word to get a teammate focused. But
Manning is always professional and would never show his general
manager, or his dry cleaner for that matter, such disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will get to see firsthand on Sunday exactly how
exceptional Manning is. His intelligence, poise, arm strength and
leadership all point to his developing into the next superstar
quarterback. In fact, he may already be that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was starting a franchise today and had my choice,'' Miami
Coach Jimmy Johnson said, ``I'd give strong consideration to
picking Peyton Manning first. He's a big-time quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of reasons why, and they go beyond Manning
being a highly accurate passer, who has completed more than 60
percent of his throws and this year became only the 12th
quarterback in league history to throw a touchdown pass in 21
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   It is Manning's off-the-field habits that distinguish him from
many of his peers. Manning watches more game film than the coaching
staff, and has been known to lock himself in a room for hours,
staring at the moving figures on the screen. It is a habit that
goes back to Manning's days at the University of Tennessee. There,
the quarterback watched so much film that he sometimes instructed
the scout team, which simulated that week's opponent, where to line
up because he knew things that even the coaches had missed.
</P>
<P>
   In the off-season, Manning does not disappear for six months. He
spends inordinate amounts of time working out at the Colts'
training complex, especially with his primary offensive outlet,
Harrison, who has drawn comparisons to a young Michael Irvin. ``I
just don't think you can play football, and then at the end of the
season, just go to the Bahamas and not come back until training
camp,'' Manning said. ``All the great players think about football
year-round.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning is the core of one of the league's most feared offenses,
with the threesome of Manning, Harrison and James earning
comparisons to a younger Troy Aikman, Irvin and Emmitt Smith. On
Oct. 31, Indianapolis beat the Cowboys, 34-24. In that game, the
Colts showed why they are such a complete offense, and how they are
on the way to replacing the crumbling Dallas dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Polian drafted James over the more popular choice, Ricky
Williams, because he thought James' better pass-catching skills
would fit more snugly in the Colts' system. In that Dallas game,
James ran for 113 yards but caught an impressive 7 passes for 92
more.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders became so fixated on James that when
the back received a fake handoff, Sanders bit, standing and waiting
for James to get the ball, while Harrison ran right by the
perennial All-Pro defender. Manning tossed a perfect pass for the
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   With their 25-17 victory over Kansas City on Sunday, the Colts
were winners of their fourth straight game, and now have as many
victories as they did the past two years combined. Indianapolis is
off to its best start since the team was called the Baltimore Colts
and began 1977 with a 9-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the young Colts stars, Manning is the one who has watched
his life slowly become less private. He is living the real-life
``Truman Show'' in Indianapolis. But he deals with all of the
publicity well. He learned how to from his father, Archie, who
quarterbacked the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still do what I want to do,'' Manning said. ``I go on dates.
I go out to eat. If I'm eating dinner and someone wants an
autograph, that's OK. I watched my dad handle all that stuff with
class and that is how I try to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are times when Manning will go to the grocery store
at 11 o'clock at night so he can peruse for food in peace. Shopping
for his breakfast cereal at bedtime aside, Manning never has second
thoughts about trading his busy life for one of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfair, but Manning and Leaf may forever be linked by that
draft, Manning the success and Leaf, at least so far, the failure.
``Ryan and I stay in touch from time to time,'' said Manning. ``The
fact we will always be compared is true. But I don't get into that.
I just play the game. I only hope Ryan is able to rebound from his
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Polian said: ``No one could anticipate that things would go this
poorly for Ryan. I think it's unfair to judge any young player
against Peyton because Peyton is so exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   So were Polian's instincts on that April day two years ago, and
the choice changed the fortunes of two franchises.

HOUSE VOTES TO BOLSTER A DRUG-TRAFFICKING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., in 5th graf, spelling of Liipfert is CQ) 
(HLW) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a bitter fight involving some of Washington's
most powerful lobbying firms, Congress is dropping legal
protections sought by international companies that feared they
would become targets of new laws against drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed by voice vote on Tuesday a classified bill
authorizing intelligence programs for the fiscal year 2000 that
contains a provision to prevent American companies from doing
business with international companies or foreigners identified by
the United States as major drug traffickers. Senate approval of the
bill is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate intelligence
committee, had sought to modify the bill's drug-trafficking
provisions. His aides said he was trying to prevent overzealous
officials from seizing the assets of legitimate companies linked to
drug trafficking by scant evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Shelby's opponents won the argument. The bill, according to
the unclassified version made available to the public, deletes the
protections he sought for these companies and instead sets up an
independent commission to evaluate the new law's effects after a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Documents circulated in Congress show that one of the lobbying
firms involved in the debate was Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard,
McPherson &AMP; Hand, which employs two former Senate majority leaders:
Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican, and George Mitchell, the Democrat
from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The firm was hired by Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, a major
shipping company that has fought to clear its name after news
accounts quoted U.S. intelligence reports tying it to the drug
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the House also orders the Central
Intelligence Agency to report to Congress next year on its
involvement with the coup that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to
power in Chile in 1973, and the agency's knowledge of the extensive
human rights abuses committed under the general, who held power
until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money the United States spends on intelligence
programs remains classified, though the CIA said it was just under
$27 billion two years ago. This year, independent experts and
congressional staff members say, it has risen to about $29 billion
or more.

NBC MOVIE SHEDS NO NEW LIGHT ON `MARY, MOTHER OF JESUS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Virgin Mary looks vaguely familiar, you can thank George
Lucas, who cast Pernilla August as Anakin Sywalker's
devoted-but-incredibly-unselfish mother in ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrust into the same desertlike milieu for ``Mary, Mother of
Jesus,'' August reprises her ``Phantom Menace'' look for the
two-hour telefilm premiering Sunday on NBC. Come to think of it,
the roles themselves are similar, especially if one accepts the
messianic interpretation of Anakin's being ``chosen'' to lead his
people out of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The only real difference is that August's role in ``Phantom
Menace'' was a supporting one, which she handled capably. In
``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' she has the lead role, and again her
performance is solid, if somewhat restrained. The problem, as in
most Bible-based films, lies in character development. There simply
isn't enough. The title might be ``Mary, Mother of Jesus'' but the
effect is Mary, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her eldest son, Bobby, produced the
film so we might see, in Eunice Shriver's words, ``an interesting
story about an extraordinary woman'' and come to regard Mary as ``a
mother, a teacher and a revolutionary rather than as the beautiful
but rather placid and not very passionate woman depicted in the
Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Placed against those expectations, director Kevin Connor's film
fails grandly. The viewer hardly gets to know Mary beyond the
goody-two-shoes cardboard cutout that even the most unchurched or
un-Christian among us would expect to be the film's starting point,
not its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't August's fault. In a film whose running time, not
counting commercials, is about 90 minutes, August doesn't appear
until the 39th minute, leaving her precious little time to make an
impression.
</P>
<P>
   Before August's appearance, at a point in the film when Jesus is
12 years old, young Mary is played by Melinda Kinnaman. As it
happens, Kinnaman resembles August, and the two actresses actually
have appeared together as daughter and mother on the Swedish stage.
But having them share the lead role was an ill-advised decision
that splits the film into disparate one-act mini-plays that don't
add up to a satisfactory whole.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnaman's Mary is naive, unsure of the plan God has for her.
August's Mary is self-assured, as comfortable as a mother can be in
the knowledge that her son's fate isn't something she, or even he,
will be able to control. The circumstances that lead to such
personal growth would make for a terrific movie, but ``Mary, Mother
of Jesus'' misses them completely.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of material on Mary's life is no doubt partly to
blame. Lacking hard data, Connor relies on re-enactments of New
Testament stories, such as the wedding feast at Cana _ scene of
Jesus' first miracle _ and his triumphant ride into Jerusalem,
which focuses not on Mary but on her son and his impending demise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some artistic license that gives Mary Magdalene (Simone
Bendix) a larger role than the Bible intimates, the film is
unwilling to assume too much about Mary, the mother of Jesus.
Instead, the producers retell Bible stories in a sort of Sunday
school recitation that lacks depth and breadth, and they deliver
another hunkalicious adult Jesus (Christian Bale) that hardly
advances the image fostered for decades in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a production needed a deus-ex-machina rescue, it is this
film. But not even the clout of a Kennedy can get heaven to save
``Mary, Mother of Jesus'' from TV-movie mediocrity. Instead of a
movie, what we have here are good intentions that never evolved
beyond a movie outline.
</P>
<P>
   Mary, Mother of Jesus. Two-hour TV movie starring Pernilla
August, Christian Bale, Melinda Kinnaman, David Threlfall, Toby
Bailiff, Simone Bendix and Geraldine Chaplin. Sunday on NBC.
Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

CISCO SYSTEMS CITES 49 PERCENT GAIN IN REVENUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cisco Systems Inc. reported a 49 percent gain in
sales for its fiscal first quarter as the company remained a top
beneficiary of the build-up of the Internet. Excluding
acquisition-related charges, its earnings exceeded analysts'
published estimates by a penny but fell a penny short of the
so-called ``whisper number.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Cisco said it had agreed to acquire Aironet Wireless
Communications of Akron, Ohio, in a stock swap valued at about $799
million. Aironet is Cisco's first acquisition in the emerging
market for wireless corporate computer networks. During the
quarter, Cisco announced seven acquisitions and closed five of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco released its results after the close of the market. In
Nasdaq trading, Cisco shares closed Tuesday at $74.1875, down
$1.0625. Cisco shares have more than doubled in the past 52 weeks.
Aironet shares closed at $45.375, up $2.125, also on Nasdaq. In
after-hours trading, Cisco shares rose $2 to 76.1875.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the earnings, they're a penny above our estimate,
so there's no real surprise there,'' said Elias Moosa, an analyst
with Thomas Weisel &AMP; Partners. ``A lot will depend on what the tone
and guidelines will be for outlook in the so-called Y2K quarter,
which is their January quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with securities analysts, Cisco president
and chief executive John Chambers said the company's strategy had
not changed for the January quarter. But he said he believed that
the outlook had brightened slightly. He said Cisco expected sales
of corporate network systems to be flat to slightly down, relative
to the first quarter, but that sales to Internet service providers
and small to medium businesses would continue their rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really won't know the impact of Y2K until well into the
quarter,'' Chambers said. ``We have only seen a few customers
actually freeze their spending. If anything, we have more
visibility and feel more optimistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Oct. 30, Cisco reported earnings of $438
million, or 13 cents a diluted share, down 14 percent from $512
million, or 15 cents a share, in the comparable period a year
earlier. Sales rose to $3.88 billion from $2.60 billion. First
quarter 2000 earnings reflected a one-time charge of $381 million,
equivalent to 11 cents a share, for various acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the charge, Cisco earned 24 cents a share. Analysts
had expected the company to report earnings of 23 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. The whisper number,
communicated verbally between analysts and fund managers, was 25
cents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was Cisco's 39th earnings report since going public, and the
company has never missed analysts' forecasts since its initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best indicator was that receivables were flat at
32 days, and that inventory turns improved,'' said Al Tobia, an
analyst with Bank America Securities. ``This is seasonally their
worst quarter, so that is a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, he said, ``has used the phrases `healthy level of
paranoia,' and `cautiously optimistic' for the last 17 calls, but
relative to expectations, this was a very clean quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco executives said large corporate networks, its traditional
market, now account for slightly less than half of revenues. Growth
is coming from telecommunications service providers, as these
companies move to offer combined voice and data lines, as well as
from small business customers adding Internet connections and
internal networking.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco said it would swap 0.637 share for each share, option and
warrant of Aironet, or $47.97 each, an 11 percent premium to
Aironet's closing price Monday. Cisco said it expected a one-time
charge against after-tax earnings of between 3 cents and 8 cents a
share for research and development expenses in the third quarter of
fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it was adding Internet and telecommunications
products as more people use cellular phones, personal computers and
networked devices. Aironet's products let PC users check e-mail and
surf the Internet without being plugged into a telephone jack, a
system known as a wireless local area network. Aironet's customers
include Dell, Ford Motor, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Microsoft and
Sears. &QL;

see whether modern DNA testing might verify DeSalvo's guilt. Though
DeSalvo owned up to the killings more than a year after the last

UNABLE TO SETTLE BUDGET, CONGRESS IS READY TO WORK OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress cannot settle its financial and political
scores with the White House and abandoned hope Tuesday of
completing its budget and adjourning this week, Republican leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans instead turned to the year's fifth stop-gap
measure, keeping the government running without a formal budget for
another week, until Nov. 17. The House passed it Tuesday night, and
the Senate plans to pass it on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As if to symbolize the lack of progress, the Ohio Clock, the
12-foot-tall timepiece that has stood outside the Senate's central
doorway since 1816, stopped dead at 6:14 p.m. Tuesday night, while
Senate and House Republican leaders met without finding a way out
of their impasse with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Forty days and forty nights past their legal deadline, the end
of the last fiscal year on Sept. 30, they are unable to finish five
spending bills in a way acceptable to the White House, leaving
billions of dollars and a handful of crucial policy issues still
unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   There are still no clear signs that any of the major policy
issues in the spending bills that divide President Clinton and
Congress have been settled.
</P>
<P>
   They include Clinton's $1.4 billion measure to help hire 100,000
teachers and reduce class sizes, his demand that Republicans agree
to pay nearly $1 billion in dues the United States owes the United
Nations and his insistence on changes in measures that favor the
mining, oil and gas industries and dismay environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are not small,'' said Jack Lew, the White House
budget chief, who was summoned back to Congress for a third
straight evening of late-night negotiations that neither side
expected to end in harmony. ``There are lots of loose ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Though both sides agree that the financial issues separating the
two sides are relatively small _ only a few billion dollars in a
$1.75 trillion budget _ the political disputes remain
show-stoppers.
</P>
<P>
   And the players are exhausted. Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin,
the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said
his colleagues were ``falling asleep in the middle of the
conferences, because they're bone tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who is chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said each side was using the budget
battle to grapple for political advantage in the coming struggle
for control of Congress and the White House next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of politics in the issues being raised, and people
are looking long-term at next year's elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, said there were slow, but sure, signs of
some progress in the budget battle.
</P>
<P>
   He said congressional negotiators had agreed to add $625 million
to the $39 billion bill for the Commerce, Justice and State
departments, including most of the money that Clinton sought to
hire officers for local police departments and finance peacekeeping
operations in Kosovo. They were also modifying the measures in the
$14 billion Interior Department bill that offend the
environmentalists, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 billion bill for foreign operations, passed by the
House, remains hung up in the Senate. A bill with $429 million for
the District of Columbia is the only bill ready for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem remains the dispute over hiring teachers, part
of the $314 billion education, labor and health bill, to which
congressional negotiations plan to offer to add more than $1
billion requested by the White House, Republican aides said Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue looms. Almost every one of these compromises makes
the final cost of the bills rise, and the White House has still not
revealed the spending cuts or any other fiscal mechanisms it plans
to offer to offset those costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, show me the money,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the House majority whip. DeLay has insisted that the bottom
line of the spending bills will not require dipping into Social
Security funds or raising taxes in any form.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about closing legal loopholes in the tax code to help pay
for the bills, he said, ``That's raising taxes, if you're the guy
that has the loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership says it will insist on an
across-the-board cut of less than 1 percent in all the spending
bills to hold the line on Socurity. But they have not
emerged as a decisive force in this struggle.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., did not speak out. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., did not lead his fellow
Republicans to close deals with the White House. ``You have to look
at innovative and flexible solutions to reach a conclusion,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   But none are yet in play, all sides said Tuesday night. So
Congress will have to return next week to try to do the only big
job the Constitution commands of it: Pass the spending bills.

   The New York Times exclusive story, MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST by Joel
Brinkley is now scheduled to move by 9:45 p.m. ET, in `f' category.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The state and federal officials prosecuting the
Microsoft antitrust case now say that their goal in any settlement,
or court-imposed remedy, will be to break Microsoft's monopoly in
personal computer operating systems, or limit the power to wield
it. The Justice Department officials and state attorneys general
have not decided how that should be done, and several proposals are
on the table. In the end, the trial judge will be the one to
approve a settlement. But even before a final verdict, expected in
February, the plaintiffs have been emboldened by the judge's
findings.

DeSalvo owned up to the killings more than a year after the last

   EXPORTS-SEATTLE (Washington) _ Businesses in metropolitan
Seattle last year exported more than those from any other part of
the country, according to statistics to be released Wednesday.
Thanks largely to The Boeing Co., Seattle powered past New York,
Detroit, San Jose and Los Angeles to top an annual study of
metropolitan area exports by the Commerce Department. The study,
which President Clinton is to announce during a speech on trade at
a Harley-Davidson factory, is being touted by the administration as
evidence of how much the Seattle area has to gain from hosting the
World Trade Organization later this month.

BOTTOM-LINE EFFECTS OF UNITEDHEALTH'S DECISION QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., N.C.) (rk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM and JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As recently as a week ago, Dr. Elihu Sussman in New York would
have an office assistant call a nurse at the UnitedHealth Group,
one of the health maintenance organizations that he deals with, to
request approval to send a patient for a magnetic imaging scan. The
assistant would wait on the line, endure 20 minutes of elevator
music, typically get the approval and send the patient on his or
her way.
</P>
<P>
   Now the assistant will no longer have to listen to the music.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolically, the change is a giant one. The UnitedHealth Group
said on Monday that it would return decision-making power over
patient care to physicians on issues like admitting health plan
members to hospitals or providing other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was ostensibly made to eliminate one of the most
frustrating and infuriating features of most doctors' work: getting
insurance companies to approve medical decisions that the doctors
think they should make.
</P>
<P>
   Health care analysts said the change would be popular with
customers, and several other insurance companies said that they
offered some of the same features. Blue Cross and Blue Shield
plans, for example, offer several types of coverage in which
doctors do not need prior approvals; they also offer HMOs that do
require prior approvals. Pacificare Health Systems, based in
California, said its doctors, who are paid a few dollars each month
for each member, do not need approvals.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not at all clear how United's decision will affect the
bottom line for hospitals and doctors. United said it rarely
rejected requests for approval under the old system. Furthermore,
the company still plans to review doctors' methods after the fact
and use the information to influence the way they practice.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth Group already sends doctors in its network a report
every six months that compares their work with national averages
for United's doctors nationwide who treat similar ailments.
Physicians who stray too far from the averages could be dropped
from the plan and lose their UnitedHealth patients.
</P>
<P>
   To further increase its influence over doctors, the company said
it planned to eventually publish these ``physician profiles'' for
customers to consult when they choose their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Health care analysts said that no longer requiring prior
approvals might increase costs slightly if the number of procedures
rose, but the change would be popular with customers. ``If United's
costs turn out to be a couple of percentage points higher, they
will still be the preferred choice of a significant number of
people,'' said Jack Bruner, a health care expert with the Hewitt
Associates consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   As insurance companies respond to widespread complaints by
partially relaxing their cost controls, overall health care costs
are rising. Large employers have already agreed to pay 8 percent to
10 percent more for health coverage next year, up from a 7.8
percent increase this year, according to a new Hewitt survey of 600
companies. In New York, the increase is 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt said the average cost per person would range from $3,947
for HMOs and $4,514 for discount networks of preferred providers to
a high of $6,285 for traditional unmanaged coverage. Part of the
increase will be passed on to employees, who will pay about $110
more next year.
</P>
<P>
   As for patients, United said it was not changing its rules. In
some employer health plans, they will still have to notify the
company before they get certain types of care. But Dr. Archelle
Georgiou, chief medical officer of the United Healthcare unit of
UnitedHealth Group, said the company was ``reaching out to patients
to help them navigate through the health care system.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sussman, a pediatrician in downtown Manhattan, said that even
though he would no longer need advance approval to send patients
for tests, that would not change the fact that his income has
dropped ``30 percent to 40 percent'' over the last six years since
managed care took over most of his patients.
</P>
<P>
   The policy change will not increase reimbursement rates for
surgical and other procedures and hospital stays, another hot issue
between health care workers and the insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had mixed reactions Tuesday . Many questioned the
company's motives at a time when Congress and the states are
working on patients' rights laws and several companies, but not
United, face class-action lawsuits challenging managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a defensive move,'' said Dr. Charles Aswad, executive
vice president of the New York State Medical Society. ``With the
enormous public presure for the right to sue health plans, they are
saying, `We have no liability, the doctor did it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton praised UnitedHealth Tuesday. ``Good for them,
I applaud them,'' he said. He also said the patient protection bill
that the House had passed was still needed. Differing Senate and
House versions of the bill are being discussed in a conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the company's motivation, United's policy change is
perhaps the sharpest example of the way that the backlash against
managed care _ the complaints of doctors and patients, and a
growing number of lawsuits against the insurance companies _ seems
to be changing the way the largest companies do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``United's move is an acknowledgment that some of the
tried-and-true solutions from a managed care cost containment
perspective are really not working correctly,'' said Keith M.
Korenchuk, a health care lawyer for Davis Wright Tremaine, a law
firm in Charlotte, N.C. ``The bureaucracy has been a major
disappointment for patients and a frustration for physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some health care experts said that it was too early to tell what
United's move would mean to the marketplace. But as a public
relations gesture, the move could create some initial good will.
</P>
<P>
   Sussman's assistant, Geraldine, who is also his wife, said that
if all five HMO's that the office dealt with followed United's
example, she would gain at least three hours each week that she now
spends preparing paperwork and calling for approval.

began a hunt for evidence of bodily fluids or tissue remaining from
the massive investigation in the case of the Boston Strangler to
see whether modern DNA testing might verify DeSalvo's guilt. Though
DeSalvo owned up to the killings more than a year after the last
victim was found, police feel he was not a convincing enough
confessor to erase all doubt that he perpetrated the heinous acts.

IT'S ALL OVER, BUT THE `THE END' IS STILL NOWHERE IN SIGHT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Franz Lidz, the author of ``Unstrung Heroes,'' and Steve Rushin,
the author of ``Road Swing,'' are senior writers at Sports
Illustrated.  
 By FRANZ LIDZ and STEVE RUSHIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies used to end. Audiences knew the end was near when two
lovers walked into a sunset, a cowpoke rode off into a sunset, or
Gloria Swanson descended the stairs in her mansion on Sunset
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   For those who couldn't take a hint, filmmakers invariably
flashed the phrase ``THE END.'' Like a bartender flipping the
lights on after last call, ``THE END'' told moviegoers to beat it,
pal.
</P>
<P>
   Such endings provided a punctuation mark, finality, what Oprah
acolytes call closure. But now ``THE END'' is in foreclosure.
Movies dribble out their final moments like an NBA point guard
trying to kill the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE END'' did a slow fade in the late 1960s, upended in favor
of an endless roll call of key grips and caterers, producers and
the nattering nabobs of
No-Animals-Were-Harmed-During-the-Making-of-This-Movie. The
convention was once such an integral and inevitable part of a film
that it became a source of satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destination Moon'' (1950), the pathetic, prophetic
spaceploitation epic, concluded with ``THIS IS THE END,'' only to
dissolve, hopefully, into the words ``OF THE BEGINNING.'' Welded
onto the chilling coda of ``The Naked Truth'' (1957) was the
harrowing hedge: ``THE END . . . OR IS IT?'' In an Ike-era
conclusion that seemed to beg a sequel, ``The Blob'' (1958) closed
with ``THE END,'' only to have the letters swirl together into an
ominous question mark.
</P>
<P>
   International cinema has more loose ends than a Richard Simmons
jazzercise class. Italian filmmakers often cap their pictures with
the approving ``FINE,'' Portuguese filmmakers with the enchanting
``FIM.''
</P>
<P>
   The critic Andrew Sarris remembers ``Miranda'' (1948), ``a
strenuously whimsical comedy about a mermaid,'' in which ``instead
of `THE END,' the screen archly flashed `FIN,' a play on the
familiar French word for `THE END' and a sea creature's
appendage.'' Fineastes know that the gag was revived 40 years later
in the briny, brainy ``Fish Called Wanda.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through ``Monty Python's the Meaning of Life'' (1983),
the phrase ``THE MIDDLE OF THE FILM'' appears on the screen. But
today's films are an eternal middle. Few are more muddled than last
year's ``Wild Things,'' a neo-noir nightmare with a plot so
serpentine you needed a herpetologist to follow it. Plot gaps were
filled well after ``THE END'' _ in a series of flashbacks during
the credits _ long after the theater had emptied out.
</P>
<P>
   The director John McNaughton should have heeded the advice of
the current billboard in Times Square, which reads ``Prepare for
the End.'' It's the come-on for the coming
Satan-versus-Schwarzenegger Lucifiction, ``End of Days.''
</P>
<P>
   The placement of ``THE END'' presented a special metaphysical
problem in the endolymphatic ``Neverending Story'' (1984), a German
potato salad adapted from a novel whose title _ ``Die Unendliche
Geschichte'' _ doesn't tell the half of it. Unhappy with the
screenplay, the novelist's name appears only once (and
appropriately) in the closing credits: Michael Ende.
</P>
<P>
   Print ads for Hampton Fancher's recent direct-to-Delta Airlines
schlockudrama ``The Minus Man'' bore the tag line ``It Doesn't End
When It Ends.'' Tell that to the Masai, who have a saying:
``Everything has an end.'' (Though few Masai, admittedly, have ever
made it through ``Waterworld.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The End'' was how a 1978 Burt Reynolds film began, perhaps the
only feature in which the phrase appears in the opening credits.
``The End'' was, after all, the movie's title. In this career
murder-suicide, Reynolds effectively ended not only his own
directorial ambitions but the professional lives of Myrna Loy, Pat
O'Brien, Kristy McNichol, Robby Benson, David Steinberg, Dom
DeLuise, Glen Campbell and Norman Fell. Virtually the only escapee
was James Best, who bettered himself a year later by playing
Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane on television's ``Dukes of Hazzard.''
</P>
<P>
   A critical reappraisal of the film suggests that it's as toxic
as the blood disease that imperils the life of Reynolds' Sonny
Lawson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to tell me one thing: What's it going to be
like at the very end?'' a dying Lawson asks Dr. Samuel Krugman (
Fell, just before the fall).
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be hospitalized,'' Lawson is told. ``You will
experience a great deal of shortness of breath. Severe cramping.
And a great deal of hemorrhaging. A great deal.'' Anyone with a
Blockbuster card can experience the same symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   There is a simpler way to tell the end is near. ``And now the
end is near,'' Frank Sinatra croons as Sonny swims out into the
Pacific. ``And so I face the final curtain.'' But as the audience
faces the final curtain, it will not find ``THE END'' at the end of
``The End.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Reynolds wraps the movie like so many directors before
and since: in search of _ to coin a redundancy _ the most
superlative ending. The less-than-superlative ending has Sonny
fleeing, in fast motion, a steak-knife-wielding DeLuise. Which is
to say ``The End'' ends as every episode of ``The Benny Hill Show''
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finis coronat opus,'' the ancient Romans believed (long before
they settled on FINE). ``The end crowns the work.'' By this
standard, the be-all and end-all of endings belongs to ``Ghost of
Dragstrip Hollow,'' a 1959 beatnik-pic about a haunted hot rod. It
concludes: ``THE ENDEST, MAN.''

COLLAPSE OF U.S. BOAT IN AMERICA'S CUP TRIALS CHALLENGES
DESIGNERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New Zealand, R.I., Calif.)   By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to America's Cup yacht design and construction,
there is a fine line between too light and just right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically speaking, the best structural design is the one
that collapses and sinks just as you cross the finish line of the
last race in the event,'' Paul Cayard, the five-time cup
campaigner, said in a recent interview. ``That means it was just
strong enough for the job, but not too heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in blustery 20-knot conditions during the second round
of challenger trials off Auckland, New Zealand, the New York Yacht
Club's entry Young America soared off a six-foot wave and crashed
hard on the wrong side of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   With massive failure to Young America's carbon-fiber side decks
and topsides _ the portion of the hull above the waterline _ the
roughly 75-foot yacht, which is also called USA 53 after its sail
number, cracked amidships and folded into an elongated V-shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like hitting a pothole on the freeway,'' the skipper,
Ed Baird, said in a conference call from Auckland Tuesday. ``The
wind and waves had been increasing, but it happened so quickly
there was nothing to do. When it yields, carbon fiber doesn't
slowly stretch, then break. It just goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird ordered the 17-man crew to abandon ship. Remarkably, the
vessel's underbody and internal bracing remained intact. Once the
crew was rescued and accounted for, high-capacity pumps and
flotation bags were positioned aboard the stricken craft and it was
slowly towed downwind back to the syndicate's compound in downtown
Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   The incident brought to mind a similar mishap in the 1995
America's Cup trials in San Diego, when the Australian contender
One Australia fractured in two and went straight to the bottom.
Coincidentally, the Australian skipper in command that day, John
Bertrand, was on the water in Auckland Tuesday providing Internet
commentary when USA 53 nearly suffered the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was certainly a sense of deja-vu,'' Bertrand said in a
phone interview with The Times. ``The difference was that ours went
down in 90 seconds and theirs stayed afloat all day.''
</P>
<P>
   USA 53 may have stayed afloat, but it will be weeks, if not
months, before it is ready to sail again. Tuesday, the boat's Rhode
Island-based builder, Eric Goetz, and three assistants flew to
Auckland to begin repairs to the Bruce Farr-designed boat. The
Young America spokeswoman, Jane Eagleson, said the team hoped to
have the boat available next January. The challenger finals begin
on Jan. 25. The winner will face Team New Zealand in the America's
Cup match next February.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Young America has a second Goetz-built yacht,
USA 58, in New Zealand. Tuesday, the group petitioned the
international jury overseeing the event to substitute boats, a
change that is allowable under the rules when substantial damage is
incurred during a race.
</P>
<P>
   But the introduction of USA 58 poses an interesting question:
supposedly configured for the lighter airs expected on Hauraki Gulf
after the new year, will the syndicate's second boat be strong
enough to stand up to the gusty winds that have dominated the
Auckland site thus far?
</P>
<P>
   ``The two boats are very similar in their layout and structural
organization,'' John Marshall, the president of Young America, said
in an interview Tuesday. ``We'll want to put some additional
structure into USA 58 so we don't have to worry about it. The side
decks are the real critical compression member. So we'll add some
combination of more carbon and reinforcing structures like
bulkheads and frames to stiffen that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Those modifications are expected to take at least two days, and
the boat will have to pass an official measurement inspection
before receiving the green light to compete.
</P>
<P>
   But Young America caught a break Tuesday when a scheduled race
with the Swiss Fast 2000 syndicate was canceled because of steady
30-40 knot winds gusting to 60 knots. The extended forecast, Baird
said, called for more gales. ``Mother nature seems to be on our
side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that keeps the weather outside the parameter of
racing conditions helps us in our preparations to get back on the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   But will this be the end of the carnage in Auckland? Bertrand
doesn't think so. ``These boats will be sailing in worse conditions
between now and March,'' he said. ``The conditions here are
volatile. I'm suggesting that it could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will more boats break?'' the boatbuilder Tom Rich, whose New
England Boatworks created Dennis Conner's latest Stars &AMP; Stripes,
asked rhetorically from his company in Portsmouth, R.I. ``I can't
tell you that. From our point of view, when building a carbon-fiber
boat it's very difficult to assess the strength of the product.
It's not something you can just look at and say, that is or isn't
strong enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich's summation will not ease the minds of the designers and
engineers who must reassess and recrunch their figures as this
strange America's Cup season continues to unfold. ``When you come
down to it,'' he said, ``it's a pretty black art.''

REMEMBER: LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS SO WONDERFUL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Jamie Malanowski's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the director Wes Craven.  
 By JAMIE MALANOWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who doesn't love the holiday movies? Who can watch ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' and not feel a surge of exultation when the
friends of the desperate George Bailey pour into his home, and we
see all the good he has done in his life abundantly repaid? Such
moments leave us all aglow, reassured that in a world of
tribulation, it is possible to find good will among men.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as soon as the tape ends and begins to rewind, we
look about and find ourselves watching the television with no
glowing Jimmy Stewart, but with our ordinary, 365-days-a-year
families and friends. And that really starts bringing down the
mood.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet that on more ordinary Christmases, George Bailey's
mind would be grinding on Uncle Billy's tendency to detail his
medical diagnoses over dinner, on the little sucking noises he
makes with his lips at the table, on his inebriated and numbingly
repeated dissertation on how nothing in Bedford Falls is as good as
it used to be, on something, something, something about that
annoying Uncle Billy!
</P>
<P>
   For no matter how we may try to suppress it, directing a certain
irritation, if not a darkening rage, toward our nearest and dearest
is as much a part of the holiday season for some of us as the holly
and the mistletoe and the stockings hung with care. And there are
movies for us Grinches _ more recent ones _ that have tried to have
some fun with the dark underbelly of the holidays, the kitsch and
the chaos and the pressures of family propinquity.
</P>
<P>
   People don't mind movies appearing at holiday time that aren't
exactly drenched in the spirit: big Christmas-week hits have
included ``Straw Dogs'' (rape and murder), ``The Getaway'' (robbery
and mayhem), ``A Clockwork Orange'' (rape, murder, robbery and
mayhem), ``Midnight Express'' (visit Turkey!) and ``Nixon'' (such a
moody twitch), so it's clear that not everything at a tenplex has
to feature chestnuts roasting on an open fire.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations for holiday movies, even darkly comic holiday
movies, are different. Like the dramatic rule that requires a gun
introduced in the first act to be fired by the third, the presence
of an ornamental lawn Santa behind the title requires that the main
character undergo an epiphany before the final credits roll. And
it's hard to be snide and sarcastic and warm and uplifted all at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to try, there's ``The Ref,'' Ted Demme's 1994
comedy about a cocky cat burglar (Denis Leary) who has the bad luck
to take hostage on Christmas Eve an argumentative Connecticut
couple (Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis) who are speeding toward
divorce. The movie works best when the reluctant and annoyed
burglar actually has to referee the squabbles; but it flatlines
once it starts turning to the couple's reconciliation (the
unavoidable epiphany).
</P>
<P>
   Along the way a number of holiday horrors are hysterically
illuminated: in one, for example, Ms. Davis, having seen too many
European art movies, forces all her dinner guests to wear on their
heads thick wreaths that support tall, flickering candles, an image
pretty enough to be plausible and dangerous enough to be
horrifying. The fact that they all just sit there wearing them
without talking about it is a riot.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also has one of the more chilling holiday lines anyone
could hope to hear: in a presents-opening scene, a boy, already
disappointed at having received a pair of pants, hears his
self-satisfied grandmother announce, ``I got you the husky size.''
Talk about the horrors of the holidays!
</P>
<P>
   Another movie full of unrealized potential is ``Jingle All the
Way,'' the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle from 1996. This movie had
a splendid premise: a business-obsessed but guilt-stricken father
races around on Christmas Eve to buy his son the hot holiday toy,
the Turbo Man action figure. As in so many comedse days, the
filmmakers equate mayhem with humor, so there are a lot of scenes
of destruction and demolition, but every once in a while a satire
on consumerism breaks out, as in the scene where James Belushi
plays Santa as a shakedown artist who runs a North Pole-like toy
factory that is in fact a criminal conspiracy designed to separate
parents from their money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzenegger's character ends up less with an epiphany than a
moment of triumph: his kid finally appreciates him, but only
because the kid thinks dad is secretly his hero Turbo Man _ and
only after Dad has destroyed all kinds of property, exploded a bomb
in the face of a policeman and clobbered a monomaniacal postal
worker. This is a comedy that wanted to be dark but ended up just
sour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Foster's ``Home for the Holidays'' (1995) sends Holly
Hunter back to her dysfunctional family for Thanksgiving. The movie
captures the tensions of most family gatherings well enough:
parents who don't listen when their kids are speaking, children who
don't get along with one another, hard-to-take relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through, a love story suddenly appears _ which is nice,
but when the movie is over, you realize, ``Hey, I can get this at
home!'' And with characters less mannered and cloying. Plus you get
to roll up your sleeves and participate in the dysfunction, which
is, of course, so much more rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the father in ``Home for the Holidays'' likes to watch
old home movies of his family _ the same thing the father in ``The
Myth of Fingerprints'' (1997), another film about a family
gathering for Thanksgiving, likes to do. But whereas Charles
Durning, in ``Home,'' is sad and eccentric, Roy Scheider, in
``Myth,'' is depressed and destructive, which tends to limit the
levity. ``The Myth of Fingerprints'' has attractive characters but
is largely a downer, which makes it like quite a lot of real
holiday visits: you couldn't say you had a good time, but you like
the people well enough that you'll probably go back.
</P>
<P>
   There is one dark comedy about the holidays that manages to be
both acerbic and sweet: ``National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation''
(1989). Yes, it's spotty and sometimes tasteless, but Chevy Chase
is so perfect as Clark Griswold, Homo suburbas. This is the movie
that, years from now _ after everyone has forgotten World War II
and ``It's a Wonderful Life'' is devoid of all historical and
cultural context _ people will watch for its nostalgic view of what
we were like back then.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold, who aspires to nothing but virtue _ to be the good
provider, the generous relative, the upholder of the holiday
tradition _ keeps being thwarted by the indifference, greed and
hostility of those around him. Not to mention the fact that he's
stupid. The nifty twist is that the basis of Clark's spirit and
generosity is his confidence that he's in line for a big bonus, and
when his trust in his boss is misplaced, he goes off the deep end.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Clark gets his moment of warmth when his family
finally appreciates him. Chase is not an actor with a wide range,
but that works to his advantage here: Clark's response to almost
every provocation is a kind of a horrified forbearance.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes at the holidays, that's the best of any of us can do.

MARKET PLACE: COMPUTER ASSOCIATES EXECUTIVES MUST REPAY $558
MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For want of a clause, a fortune was lost.
</P>
<P>
   A Delaware judge ruled Tuesday that the three top executives of
Computer Associates must return company stock worth more than a
half billion dollars, part of an enormous stock grant that
infuriated shareholders last year. The judge found that the
executives' pay contract lacked a provision authorizing adjustments
in the number of shares awarded in the event of stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   The executives were ordered to return 9.5 million of the 20.25
million shares that they received. The 9.5 million shares are worth
almost $558 million, based on Tuesday price, a sum that approaches
the $626 million profit that the Islandia, N.Y., company earned in
the year ended March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The issues in the case were so clear, wrote Vice Chancellor
Myron Steele of Delaware Chancery Court in his 33-page opinion,
that he did not need to hold a trial to rule that Computer
Associates' directors had improperly given away more stock than
shareholders had authorized.
</P>
<P>
   The language in the performance pay contract was
straightforward, the judge wrote, ruling solely on the basis of
pleadings from both sides. He said the company and the three
executives wanted him to read the contract in a way that ``distorts
the plan's plain language.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer Associates said it might appeal because the ``decision
runs counter to the reasonable expectations that all the parties
had when the plan was approved'' by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The stock award was widely criticized at the time as excessive,
even by the lavish standards of executive pay that have made some
chief executives billionaires. The 20.25 million shares were worth
$1.1 billion, or 3.75 percent of the company's value, in May 1998,
when the bulk of the shares were awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Charles Wang received a total of 12.15 million
shares worth $669.8 million; president Sanjay Kumar received 6.075
million shares worth $334.9 million, and executive vice president
Russell Artzt got 2.025 million shares worth $111.6 million. The
shares came with restrictions on their sale for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, in recounting details of the performance pay plan
approved by shareholders, said the contract authorized up to 6
million shares for the three executives if Computer Associates
stock sold for more than $180 a share for 60 trading days in any
12-month period.
</P>
<P>
   The plan contained a provision adjusting the stock price in the
event of stock splits. Steele wrote that ``the corresponding and
conspicuous absence of a provision authorizing alteration'' of the
number of shares that could be awarded reinforced his conclusion.
He specifically found that the reasonable expectation of
shareholders was that no more than 6 million shares would be
awarded.
</P>
<P>
   The judge found that the stock was allotted in two steps.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, the executives were awarded 2 million shares. He
held that they were entitled to the dividends on those shares,
including any additional shares allotted in stock splits, since
technically a split is a dividend paid in the form of additional
shares. Because of splits, those 2 million shares had grown to 6.75
million three years later.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, the executives were given 13.5 million more shares,
which reflected the remaining 4 million of the 6 million shares
specified in the plan adjusted for several stock splits. But the
judge ruled that the board had no authority to adjust these shares
after the stock had split and that it thus could hand out only 4
million of this block of shares.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Steele ruled, the executives were entitled to 10.75
million shares _ the 6.75 million from the 1995 grant and the 4
million given to them in 1998 _ not the 20.25 million the board
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months after the 1998 stock award, shares of Computer
Associates, which had been trading in the mid-50s, lost about a
third of their value, eventually tumbling to $26 by the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the economic crisis in Asia had depressed
orders and led to a business slowdown, but critics also noted that
the 1998 stock award, taken as a charge against earnings, turned a
profitable quarter into one with a $480.8 million loss.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has since recovered. It closed Tuesday at $58.6875, up
6.25 cents, after trading as high as $63.48125 in early October.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote that even with his ruling, the executives were
well rewarded for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even under the strictest reading of the plan,'' Steele wrote,
``the three participants will together still receive nearly $320
million. $320 million is no bagatelle. I find it remarkable that
defendants would believe that CA shareholders would consider that
$320 million for three individuals failed to `encourage, recognize
and reward sustained outstanding individual performance by certain
key employees.'''
</P>
<P>
   Without testimony, he said, he could not decide if the directors
had acted with mere carelessness or with such a breach of their
duty to shareholders that they should be held individually liable.
It is unclear whether the shareholders who brought the suits will
pursue the matter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard Grasso, a director of Computer Associates who is also
chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, declined a request
for comment on the judge's ruling. The other directors named in the
lawsuit are Irving Goldstein, Shirley Strum Kenny, Willem F.P. de
Vogel and the three executives.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Unger, a lawyer in the firm of Tenzer Greenblatt, who
argued the shareholders' position, said the decision ``shows that
you have to live with what the shareholders approve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The broader lesson,'' he added, ``is that shareholders do have
rights and that company directors can't just make it up as they go
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger, who said his major business was defending companies in
securities cases, said that Computer Associates would probably owe
attorneys' fees and nothing more. Separate lawsuits that accuse the
company of providing misleading information before the company's
stock price fell last year are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Salwen, an executive compensation lawyer in Manhattan,
said that had the case been tried under New York law, the stock
splits would probably have been found to be implicit in the
contract. He said contracts require careful review because
``language disappears all the time in computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, author of the Crystal Report, a newsletter on
executive compensation, said the case displayed ``stunning
incompetence on the part of the lawyers who drafted this _ it will
be interesting to see if Charlie Wang sues these idiots for failing
Compensation 101.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did not respond to requests for information on who
drafted the plan.

 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You see her yield completely, fainting with a soft
abandon in a supported deep back bend, and before you see the
recovery, she is already standing apart, mild and free, as if in
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The dancer was the teen-age Suzanne Farrell, in 1964. The writer
was Edwin Denby, one of the great chroniclers of the New York City
Ballet, where Ms. Farrell danced. The ballet he wrote about was
``Meditation,'' created for her by George Balanchine, whose
choosing of the young dancer as his muse was to become a central
metaphor in the lives of Ms. Farrell, Balanchine and American
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Farrell, who retired from the stage in 1989, has become
a muse of another sort. Since 1993, she has taught summer master
classes at the Kennedy Center in Washington, at the invitation of
James Wolfensohn, then chairman of the center, as part of the
institution's extensive arts education programming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she was invited to present ``Suzanne Farrell Stages
Balanchine'' at Kennedy Center as part of its 25th-anniversary
celebrations. And now Ms. Farrell has embarked on a touring project
called ``Suzanne Farrell Stages the Masters of 20th-Century
Ballet,'' a program of works by Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and
Maurice Bejart. Another presentation of the Kennedy Center, it
opens at the New Victory Theater in Manhattan on Thursday for a
10-day engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Farrell and James Wilker, president of Kennedy Center,
are cagey about the future of the 16-member company. The troupe has
no name, and its rehearsal and performing dates were built around
the schedules of its lead dancers, who are international
freelancers or performers with other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Would the company have another season? ``We're not going to let
her escape,'' Wilker said. ``She's fabulous and she's very
talented. She will continue to do summer workshops. We're letting
our relationship evolve and grow.'' Ms. Farrell said she thought of
the five-city tour, which began in mid-October and ends in New York
City, as ``a trial run, but not a do-or-die one.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure. Ms. Farrell is already one of the most
popular restagers of Balanchine ballets for the Balanchine Trust,
an independent organization, founded after the choreographer's
death, that oversees the licensing and staging of his ballets. But
she has also become known as a coach with a special talent for
expanding the gifts of mature, already formed dancers, a talent
that was much remarked on by critics in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is incredible to work with,'' said Ben Huys, a lead dancer
in the touring company. ``The knowledge she has from her career
just pours out of her. Every day and after performances she gives
you something to think about, so that after a while it all comes
together. She gives you the ballet and lets you find your own
way.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard for some to imagine that Degas figure that Denby
wrote about, that paragon of ``soft abandon,'' directing her own
company. In at least one aspect, however, Ms. Farrell has not
shifted gears so drastically. Always the mix of surrender and
determination captured by Denby, she has become not only an
inspiration to older dancers but also a hands-on muse to a younger
generation, embodying a largely vanished world in which ballet was
a profession akin to a religious vocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She helped me realize how much I love to dance,'' Katrina
Poppe, a teen-age alumna of the master-class program ``Exploring
Ballet With Suzanne Farrell,'' said. ``She really gets into it and
works very hard, and she makes you get into it and work hard,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   A small but outspoken group of dance aficionados and writers see
her influence as proof that Ms. Farrell, so profoundly connected to
Balanchine and his later work, would have made a better preserver
of the legacy of City Ballet than Peter Martins, its current head.
Ms. Farrell maintained an uncertain relationship with the company
after her retirement from the stage until 1993, when Martins fired
her after the publication in The New Yorker of an interview with
her that was implicitly critical of Martins.
</P>
<P>
   The flames were fanned by the 1995 program at Kennedy Center, a
mini-festival of six Balanchine ballets, staged with Victoria Simon
of the Balanchine Trust, that were for the most part glowingly
received.
</P>
<P>
   Had she felt shut out from City Ballet? ``I do my work,'' Ms.
Farrell said simply, after a long pause. That includes teaching
summer classes with her former husband, Paul Mejia, on their island
in an Adirondacks lake. ``I know sometimes people say I'm
strange,'' she said, talking of her much-publicized devotion to
Balanchine as well as of her intensity about her work. ``That's not
true.'' She smiled mischievously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very committed,'' she continued. ``At the same time,
nobody does nothing better than me. I live in my now. I focus on
what is real. While I'm working with these dancers, they are the
most important thing. Everything I do is for them. And you know
what? As a result, I'm happy. And I think that's what people sense
about me. They know I care, that they're important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her degree of shyly fervent involvement was evident in a recent
rehearsal of Balanchine's ``Apollo,'' part of the tour repertory,
in a studio backstage at City Center. At 54, Ms. Farrell does not
look much older than she did in her City Ballet heyday. Dressed in
neat practice clothes and an old pink sweater, her hair tucked up,
she was so focused on the work at hand that there were frequent
gentle collisions as she darted out among the dancers to correct or
suggest or draw a hesitant dancer into the stream of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   There were problems with the unyielding rhythms of the taped
music and with the tape machine itself. ``After this, I'm going to
go work for Crazy Eddie,'' she said with mock despair, trying for a
small joke in that austere atmosphere. Giving up at last on the
machine, she sang the rhythmic counts to the opening moments of the
central pas de deux in ``Apollo,'' in which the young god falls in
love with Terpsichore.
</P>
<P>
   Sung in a high, childlike voice in that softly lighted space,
the tender passage from the Stravinsky score brought back memories
of Ms. Farrell herself as a baby-faced Terpsichore dancing with her
rugged young god, Jacques d'Amboise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farrell's own memories help make working with her both a
vivid and an extremely practical experience, said Duncan Cooper, a
principal with Dance Theater of Harlem. Cooper was so eager to
perform with Ms. Farrell's group that he rehearsed with her at
night after his work with his own company. ``We had a wonderful
artistic bonding when she came to coach `Prodigal Son' in 1997,''
said Cooper, who had to withdraw from the tour because of an
injury. ``I've felt such a connection with very few choreographers
or stagers. The tidbits of wisdom, the advice, the hours talking
about dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farrell's passion for detail, which reminded Cooper of
Mikhail Baryshnikov, meant that he learned the precise grab of the
foot on a table in ``Prodigal Son'' or that the character would
look more believably exhausted in another passage if he imagined a
weight on the back of his neck. That was advice Balanchine had
given a dancer in rehearsals for ``Don Quixote.'' ``She'd look up
to heaven as if she were talking to him,'' Cooper said
affectionately.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Farrell had also worked before with Huys and several other
dancers in her group. Her criterion for choosing them was simple.
``They are interested in repertory and in working this way,'' Ms.
Farrell said. That repertory includes Robbins' ``Afternoon of a
Faun'' and an excerpt from Bejart's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also several Balanchine pas de deux, among them
``Meditation,'' that Ms. Farrell sees as ``encounters'' of
different sorts, and excerpts from Balanchine's ``Divertimento No.
15,'' which she describes as ``just beautiful dance, beautiful
manners, where ballet comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the performers are graduates of her ``Exploring
Ballet'' program. Ms. Farrell said she told the youngsters ``just
to learn everything,'' as she did at the start of her.
``First of all, it's a good exercise for the mind,'' she said.
``They'll be watching beautiful dances, for example, as I did. If
you were learning them just with the realization that you have to
perform them, you wouldn't learn in depth. And I learned about a
lot of life in the ballets that I danced. It's a beautiful example

   ``When I was a young girl, you would be horrified if you went to
a dance and found someone wearing the same dress. Now everyone

you do stand out.''

THE STREET TALK, HE SAYS, IS A BUM RAP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14)

   Dr. Dre, who has sold more than 20 million albums as a rapper
and producer, feels like an underdog again. ``For the last couple
of years, there's been a lot of talk out on the streets about
whether or not I can still hold my own, whether or not I'm still
good at producing,'' he said. ``That was the ultimate motivation
for me. Magazines, word of mouth and rap tabloids were saying I
didn't have it any more. What more do I need to do? How many
platinum records have I made? O.K., here's the album _ now what do
you have to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dre, 34, was talking about his second solo album, ``Dr. Dre
2001,'' in the lounge of a midtown Manhattan hotel on the afternoon
before his Oct. 23 appearance on ``Saturday Night Live.'' Wearing
an oversized Fubu jersey and fielding handshakes from his
Avirex-branded entourage as he talked, he was rousing himself after
waking up late. The reason, he said, was that his wife had made him
play the album five times the night before. ``She's big on it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On many of the album's songs, Dr. Dre raps like a hard-partying
character surrounded by eager, trampy women. His wife, Nicole, whom
he married in 1996, doesn't mind. ``For awhile, right when I got
married, I was kind of turned off from using the type of language I
was using and the type of records that I was doing,'' Dr. Dre said.
``It was, like, O.K., I'm married now, so maybe I need to tone it
down. And my records stopped coming out as good as they should. So
she got with me: `What's up? I want to hear the hardcore stuff.'
She was a big reason for me getting back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardcore means a return to the staples of gangsta rap: boasts,
threats, shootouts, marijuana and sex. On ``2001,'' Dr. Dre said:
``Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different
varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments,
aggressive moments. You've even got a `Pause for Porno.' It's got
everything that a movie needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The album started out with a different approach, Dr. Dre said.
It was originally going to be like a mix tape, the quasi-bootleg
collections of songs that disc jockeys make, with songs connected
by interludes of fancy turntable effects.
</P>
<P>
   But during the year and a half that Dr. Dre worked on ``2001,''
other rap albums appeared with the mix-tape format, so he moved in
the opposite direction: clean, spartan production with a minimum of
turntable scratching. ``I don't make my records for the clubs, the
radio or nothing like that,'' he said. ``I make my records
basically for people to play in their cars or just play in their
houses when they're cleaning up. I believe that's where people
listen to the most music: in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   His albums, he said, are simply entertainment, not an
advertisement for the lifestyle of the gangsters and players in his
raps. ``I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with
this record,'' he said. ``I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and
try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A lot of times
the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else
when it's all entertainment first. Any person that listens to these
records and wants to imitate them is an idiot, unless they just
want to imitate the fact that it's a good record. You shouldn't
take it too seriously. It's not like you're going to go see a play
or a movie or something and want to come out to be Rambo.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dre is already planning his next projects. One is a possible
tour with Snoop Dogg that would present a full-fledged hip-hop
musical, with actors portraying the stories from the songs. ``For
instance, an undercover cop gets killed on stage, and then me and
Snoop would come out and do `Deep Cover.' It could work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is looking for a singer to make an album of hip-hop soul
songs that he has stockpiled. He's producing Eminem's next album.
He is also contemplating a revival of N.W.A. to include two other
original members of the group _ Ice Cube and Ren _ plus Snoop Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see how the business goes on that,'' he said.
The album is tentatively planned for the Christmas 2000 buying
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a winner, man, I'm a leader,'' Dr. Dre said, an underdog
no more. ``I've got to do this, I've got to keep doing it. I want
to do another 10 years and set a record _ the longest person to be
in this business successfully. And I want to keep shocking people
like, `Man, what is he going to next?'''

STILL TOUGH, STILL AUTHENTIC. STILL RELEVANT?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  (With DR.-DRE-ALBUM) 
(af) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andre Young, better known as Dr. Dre, hasn't exactly been silent
since he released his first solo album, ``The Chronic,'' in 1992.
He produced Snoop Doggy Dogg's debut album, Tupac Shakur's ``All
Eyez on Me,'' and Eminem's ``The Slim Shady LP,'' all multimillion
sellers, while rapping on their albums and co-starring in their
video clips.
</P>
<P>
   But on his new album, ``Dr. Dre 2001'' (Interscope 069490486),
Dr. Dre sounds defensive, as if he's worried that hip-hop considers
him a has-been. ``Now we got a new era of gangstas, hustlers and
youngsters living amongst us, looking at us now, calling us
busters,'' he admits in ``The Watcher,'' adding, ``It's funny how
time flies.''
</P>
<P>
   So he reiterates his resume, and he insists that he's still
tough, still authentic, still relevant. ``I'm still at it,'' he
insists in ``Still D.R.E. ``Takin' my time to perfect the beat, and
I still got love for the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   He's facing the questions that confront most rappers sooner
rather than later: Is there a next step in hip-hop? After youthful
audacity has faded, can a rapper mature? On ``2001,'' Dr. Dre, 34,
postpones any answer. He describes himself as seasoned: ``All you
savage cats know that I was strapped with gats when you were
cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch,'' he raps.
</P>
<P>
   But then, joined by Snoop Dogg, Eminem and his latest
discoveries among younger rappers, he banks on the cheap thrills of
his past: the guns, the girls, the weed.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop evolves at hyperspeed, a function of intense
competition, widespread innovation and an audience that's impatient
with formulas. As a result, rappers have careers that make Olympic
gymnasts look like tenured faculty. Stars rise and fall within
months; follow-ups to million-selling albums are ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Production styles generate hits and are then absorbed,
outmaneuvered and discarded while listeners find the next novelty.
And leading rappers make careers outside hip-hop as actors (like
Dr. Dre's former partner in N.W.A., Ice Cube) or television
personalities (Queen Latifah). Dr. Dre has already beaten the odds
more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dre can rightly take credit for changing the course of 1990s
hip-hop. As a member of N.W.A. and the co-producer (with Yella) of
``Straight Outta Compton'' in 1988, he created the template for
gangsta rap: straightforward stories about crime, gunplay, raw sex
and hatred for the police, set to uncluttered backup tracks.
</P>
<P>
   While Schoolly D, Boogie Down Productions and Ice-T had already
rapped about ghetto violence, ``Straight Outta Compton'' turned
gangsta rap into a full-fledged genre and growth industry;
countless groups have since come up with variations on N.W.A.'s
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dre found a next step on ``The Chronic,'' the album that
defined West Coast hip-hop with a personalized style, G-Funk,
that's simultaneously relaxed and menacing. The bottom register is
swampy synthesizer bass lines that openly emulate
Parliament-Funkadelic; the upper end is often a lone keyboard line,
whistling or blipping insouciantly. In between are wide-open spaces
that hold just a rhythm guitar, sparse keyboard chords and perhaps
a singalong chorus between a rapper's unhurried rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hermetic sound, sealed off from street noise as if behind
the windows of a limousine or a jacked-up jeep; it's the sound of
the player, enjoying ill-gotten gains but always watching his back.
</P>
<P>
   With its mixture of clarity and deep bass punch, Dr. Dre's
tracks jump out of ordinary car radios as well as boomboxes and
fancy sound systems. And his style makes a cushy, inconspicuous
backdrop for characters as nonchalant as Snoop Doggy Dogg, as testy
as Tupac or as bratty and manic as Eminem. But the sound alone
wasn't enough to make hits for him when, in 1996, he extricated
himself from Death Row Records (which was owned by the notorious
Suge Knight, now in prison for parole violations) and started his
own label, Aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Been There Done That,'' in which Dr. Dre rapped about money
while renouncing what had become gangsta-rap cliches, was
considered a dud.
</P>
<P>
   While Dr. Dre's G-Funk hasn't disappeared, the late 1990s have
brought him plenty of competition: the raw loops and ominous
density of the RZA with the Wu-Tang Clan, the shameless pop samples
of Sean (Puffy) Combs, the thumps and grunts of Master P, the
twitchy electronics of Timbaland and the choppy austerity of Swizz
Beatz, for starters. He has probably been paying attention, but for
the most part, Dr. Dre doesn't remake his music for ``2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he distills it. The album's tracks, produced by Dr. Dre
and Mel-Man, are lean and immaculate, each one a pithy combination
of beat, rap, melody and strategic silences. There's a reason for
each cymbal tap and slinky keyboard phrase. And nearly every note,
every sound effect and every scratch is audible in its own space,
except when Dr. Dre adds quiet, high-pitched tones to subliminally
raise tension. Nothing distracts from the rappers' voices; they
complete the groove, moving at doubletime or bouncing against the
beat.
</P>
<P>
   Filling the foreground, the raps settle into the tried-and-true:
male bonding, high-life boasting, toting guns and grabbing women.
Andre Young's marriage in 1996 hasn't changed Dr. Dre's recorded
persona; the male rappers expect service on demand from the women
they dismiss with contempt, and scripted female voices throw
themselves at Dr. Dre himself when he walks into a bar or
interrupts an orgy.
</P>
<P>
   A female rapper, Ms. Roq, gets in a few token tough-gal rhymes
on two of the album's 22 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dre, who says he has ``moved out of the 'hood for good,''
generally lets guest rappers, especially a newcomer called Hittman,
handle the street-level details of gang tension and murder plots,
though he insists he still stays armed to defend himelf. ``As long
as I've got a Beretta,'' he raps, ``I'm down forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, however, he stays at the edge of the crime scenes,
sometimes reflecting on how things have gotten out of hand. ``Bang
Bang'' depicts violence everywhere he looks, with gun-wielding kids
who are ``way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days.'' It's
followed by one more gangsta-rap convention: an elegy.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Dre pays some last respects, ``The Message'' sends Mary
J. Blige's voice and wordless moans rising above a mournful Marvin
Gaye-style vamp. ``Don't get caught up in the 'hood,'' she sings.
</P>
<P>
   The album's most vigorous tracks are the ones with Dr. Dre
demanding respect: ``The Watcher,'' ``Still D.R.E.'' (with Snoop
Dogg comparing his mentor to prime-grade marijuana), ``Big Egos''
and two songs featuring a motor-mouthed, wildly (and violently)
fantasizing Eminem: ``What's the Difference'' and ``Forgot About
Dre.'' Dr. Dre isn't going through the gangsta and player motions
on those songs or delegating them to his cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking like the competitive, hard-headed mogul that he is,
he's fighting the prospect of his own obsolescence. For a few
minutes at a time, he manages to keep it at bay. But the album is a
holding action, not an advance.

   WASHINGTON _ An air of joyful mourning, if such a thing can be,
permeated the White House Wednesday as the nation both honored the
nine black students who desegregated Central High School in Little
Rock, Ark., in 1957 and paid homage to the civil rights leader
Daisy Bates, who died last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daisy Bates called them the Embattled Nine,'' Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., said at an East Room ceremony where
Congressional Gold Medals were given to the Central High students,
who were admitted to the school under guard by federal troops and
had to withstand the torment of repeated threats.
</P>
<P>
   They were jeered, spat upon and threatened with death, but they
became a symbol of courage to a nation that, with great difficulty
in places like Arkansas, was just ending legally enforced
segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas' other senator, Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat, said she
could not imagine how those teenagers, now in their late 50s, had
accomplished what they did while being called ``hateful names by
state leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Mrs. Bates, who led the desegregation fight at
Central High as president of the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP,
Lincoln told the honorees: ``I know she was a guardian angel of
sorts for you. I know she is with us today in spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Melba Patillo Beals, one of the students, said in an interview
that she and her friends, joined together in the turmoil of 1957,
were humbled by Tuesday's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold on to each other dearly when we meet,'' Ms. Beals
said. ``We never thought we'd live this long. We thought we'd die
that year.''
</P>
<P>
   That year saw President Dwight D. Eisenhower order federal
troops to Little Rock to force state and local officials to accept
court-ordered school desegregation and admit the nine: Ms. Beals,
Ernest Green, Jefferson Thomas, Carlotta Walls Lanier, Minnijean
Brown Trickey, Thelma Mothershead Wair, Gloria Ray Karlmark,
Elizabeth Eckford and Terrence Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, his son, John, was at the White House Tuesday
for a ceremony where the Old Executive Office Building was named
for Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously the right thing to do,'' Eisenhower said of
the action his father took. ``It was nice to be here to see this
tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest award bestowed by
Congress, which was thanked by President Clinton for allowing the
ceremony to be held at the White House because of his Arkansas
roots.
</P>
<P>
   The first Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to George
Washington. More recent recipients have included the Rev. Billy
Graham and his wife, Ruth; Frank Sinatra, Mother Teresa, Nelson
Mandela, former President Gerald Ford and his wife, Betty, and Rosa
Parks, who became a seminal figure in the modern civil rights
movement by refusing to give up her seat on a city bus in
Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the admission of the Little Rock students was
``the story of the triumph of the rule of law and the American
Constitution'' and that this was ``a happy and a sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was happy, he said, because of the honor to the nine black
students, and sad because of Mrs. Bates' death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daisy said what they endured was a volcano of hatred,'' the
president recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He motioned to the nine and said, ``They look real fine sitting
here today,'' adding: ``They have lived good lives and accomplished
remarkable things. But we're giving them this medal because they
paid the price.''

MICROSOFT PROSECUTORS SEEK END OF OPERATING-SYSTEMS MONOPOLY AS
REMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Ill., Utah, Calif., Iowa)  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The state and federal officials prosecuting the
Microsoft antitrust case now say that their goal in any settlement,
or court-imposed remedy, will be to break Microsoft's monopoly in
personal computer operating systems, or limit the power to wield
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department officials and state attorneys general
have not decided how that should be done. Several proposals are on
the table, ranging from forcing Microsoft to publish the
proprietary code for Windows so other companies could design
competing systems, to breaking up the company. And in the end, the
trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, would be the one to approve a
settlement or select a remedy, after receiving recommendations from
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   But even before a final verdict, expected in February, the
plaintiffs have been emboldened by the judge's findings on Friday
that Microsoft had used its operating-system monopoly to stifle
innovation, reduce competition and harm consumers. The officials
say their goal is to create competition in the operating-system
market _ or to put severe limits on Microsoft's ability to exercise
monopoly power with its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a position to get a rather dramatic remedy,''
said Elliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, the lead
plaintiff of the 19 states in the case. ``And it's an overwhelming
opinion now that it has to address their monopoly in operating
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months since the Justice Department and the states
filed suit against Microsoft, much of the discussion about the case
has involved Web browsers and Microsoft's decision to build one
into Windows. But Jackson's findings of fact made explicit what had
been implicit before: The case is really about the operating-system
monopoly and Microsoft's use of its monopoly power to promote other
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this case, we had nowhere near as specific and
clear an idea how serious and far reaching the evidence of this
abuse of their monopoly would be,'' said Richard Blumenthal,
attorney general of Connecticut. ``The case showed that Microsoft's
abuse of its power in the operating-system market is endemic to its
conduct, and any remedy has to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   James Doyle, the attorney general of Illinois, agreed, saying,
``Any remedy has to talk about the operating system monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-eminent among the judge's findings was Microsoft's abuse of
its monopoly power, a finding that swept some of the softer
remedies _ like forcing it to revise some of its contract
agreements with other companies _ out of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge released his preliminary verdict last Friday,
Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general who heads the antitrust
division, said that any settlement or remedy would have to ``fully
and properly address'' the problems cited by Jackson, though he has
not elaborated on how to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   Before last Friday, the state attorneys general seemed to be
taking a tougher line than the Justice Department. For months they
have called for a strong remedy that would restructure Microsoft or
its products, but were not necessarily focused on the operating
system. But now they are unified in the position that the problem
is the Windows monopoly, and they say the Justice Department has
joined them in that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge's findings have moved the states from rabid hawks to
mainstream,'' said Wayne Klein, head of the antitrust division in
the Utah attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who stood on the podium with Attorney General Janet
Reno and Klein during a news conference on Friday, just after the
judge's findings were published, said Tuesday: ``I don't detect any
difference or divergence of viewpoint on remedies between the
states and the federal government. We are in total unanimity on how
to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said, ``We believe it is
premature for anyone to be talking about regulatory steps before
the court actually issues a ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lockyer, the attorney general of California, said that
``the rigorous analysis'' of possible remedies ``is now just
beginning in a very serious way, by academics and experts, and we
will all want to review what they have to say before we go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   One academic advising the states, Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor
at the University of Iowa College of Law, said: ``In my opinion, if
the findings show significant abuse of monopoly power, then the
appropriate remedy is to break up the monopoly _ not to hobble the
company or try to regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ``breaking up'' a company is not such an extreme
concept for the federal government. Quite often recently, the
government has required companies to spin off divisions to win
approval for a merger or acquisition of another company. But
splitting up Microsoft is hardly the only proposal under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said he believes it is possible to compel Microsoft to
live within the law with its current structure, even though he says
he worries about the effectiveness of agreements limited to
changing the company's conduct, like Microsoft's 1995 consent
decree with the Justice Department to end an earlier antitrust
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that we could devise conduct guarantees that are
more enforceable than in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other attorneys general disagree, saying such guarantees
would not be effective. But among the conduct guarantees still
under discussion at state and federal levels are proposals that
would force Microsoft to charge every computer manufacturer the
same price for Windows, so the company could not impose higher
prices to punish competitors or those who do business with them.
Such a proposal would also have to include clear guidelines on what
Microsoft products and services it could build into Windows,
government officials say. But those ideas would require constant
regulatory scrutiny that many government officials oppose. The
Justice Department and the states have not said how they will come
to agreement on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government officials say four additional remedies are under
discussion, though each of them could be applied in a variety of
ways and might be combined with elements of others. Not
surprisingly Microsoft says it opposes all of them.
</P>
<P>
   One idea would be to force Microsoft to publish the secret,
proprietary source code that makes up the Windows operating system.
The goal would be to allow other developers to design competing
operating systems that are compatible with Windows and the many
thousands of software titles that are written for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when IBM was trying to sell OS/2, a
competing operating system, the company said it was stymied because
software companies were unwilling to rewrite their programs for
OS/2. And without access to the Windows source code, IBM could not
make OS/2 compatible with the existing library of programs written
for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea long favored by the states would be to force
Microsoft to auction the source code to Windows so that two or
three other companies could begin selling competing operating
systems. In that case, Hovenkamp noted, the newly competing
companies would have to set up a ``joint venture for compatibility
standards'' so that computers and software would work equally well
with each of the systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the officials are discussing two proposals for
breaking up the company. One would divide the company into several
equal parts; each new company would hold all of the software code
and intellectual property from all of Microsoft's products. But
after the breakup, all of the new companies would begin competing
with the others, immediately creating a competitive marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   A final alternative is that of breaking Microsoft into three
different companies. One would control the operating system; one
the applications programs, like Word and Excel, and the third would
control the Internet and related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this idea is that one company would still have
an operating system monopoly. And even if this companyness
were limited to selling operating systems, presumably it could
still bundle other products with the operating system _ the very
problem that spawned Microsoft's current problems with the
government. Monitoring that would also require continuing
government involvement, something no one in state or federal
governments want.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, should the judge find Microsoft guilty and impose a
remedy, the company will certainly appeal. But the plaintiffs _ the
state and federal governments _ also have the right to appeal,
should they be unhappy with the judge's decision.

COMMENTARY: THE PALS AND PALETTES OF AL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO _ So Al and I are dishing about clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I figured if I covered politics long enough, I'd have
uncomfortable moments when a president or vice president would want
to hash over something I didn't know much about, like helium
reserves or the money supply.
</P>
<P>
   Nah. With this White House, I'm safe. The deeply important
issues are sex and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I ask the vice president about his new color palette. He's in
his casual uniform, a blue shirt to bring out his eyes, a heathery
brown sweater, khakis and black cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tipper picks out my clothes,'' he says quickly, before I have
a chance to mention That Woman Naomi.
</P>
<P>
   Don't his beta earth tones undercut his alpha message?
</P>
<P>
   Gore looks annoyed, even though a couple of his aides (dressed
just like him) have cut out the picture of an ape from a Times
story on alphas and are making jokes about ``going ape'' over
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   He points at my skirt. ``You like the greens and the reds,'' he
says, drolly. ``That's a good combination. D'you do that
yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has always kept his fun side hidden. Now he's trying to
show it. But he's doing it in a very deliberate way. He'll say some
amusing things off the cuff, but then he'll go someplace else and
say the same amusing things off the cuff in the same exact way.
Scripted fun.
</P>
<P>
   He went on the Don Imus radio show, wanting to prove he is not,
as Leno called him, the annoying kid in school who reminds the
teacher ``You forgot to give us homework!'' Asked about W.'s quiz
fiasco, Gore did not gloat, as he had at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing the names, I think that's kind of
understandable,'' he said. ``I mean the other day I was talking to
Otkir Sultonov, you know, the prime minister of Uzbekistan. And he
asked me, `Did you send a birthday card to Hamed?' That, of course,
is Hamed Karoui, the prime minister of Tunisia. ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Don Imus asked if he had stayed up late laboring over his
witticism.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is doomed to Try Too Hard _ that's why he
sometimes goes overboard on taking credit or butters up when he
wants to charm. He's too scared of making a mistake to be
mischievous. As George Stephanopoulos said: ``The questions posed
last week were: Does Bush know the world well enough to be
president? Does Gore know himself well enough to be president?''
</P>
<P>
   Their problems are tied to their famous fathers. W. did not want
to be good at the same thing his father was good at. Al did not
want to be a typical politician, so he dabbles in intellectual
self-improvement and New Age self-examination. Al Sr. played the
fiddle. Al Jr. had dinners at the vice president's mansion with
weighty lectures on the meaning of metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   The wacky Naomi Wolf embraced Gore's wackiness. He says he likes
``diversity in advice,'' but offbeat advisers make him seem flaky.
For Gore, deeper analysis does not always lead to keener judgments.
</P>
<P>
   As senator and vice president, he had a facilitator/management
consultant on his payroll, known as the ``office shrink,'' who
worked on group dynamics and team-building with the Gore staff.
</P>
<P>
   So why are his group dynamics a mess, with a staff and team of
consultants riven by rivalry and self-serving leaks? And how could
Gore not anticipate that giving a huge salary to a flashy Culture
Babe who urged women to be ``demon goddesses of lust'' would cause
a jealous meltdown with the other advisers?
</P>
<P>
   The search for authenticity creates comic moments. At a
fund-raiser in Hollywood, the vice president said he felt so at
home he would take off his jacket. But that made him the only man
in the room without a jacket. Then Gore stepped down off the little
stage to get closer to his audience and promptly disappeared from
view. A metaphor, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I absorbed a somewhat formal presentation from my
father's example when I was growing up,'' he says, adding: ``I'm
going back to the presentational style that I had as a congressman
and a senator. First of all, it's not a style. It's who I am. It's
not a presentation. It's who I am. And if somebody doesn't like it
or thinks it's manufactured, then that's their choice. But I'm not
going to change. I can't change who I am. I don't want to change
who I am.''

 &HT;    Donnan at a crossroad: Competitor within drives Georgia coach
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia coach Jim Donnan was the starting
quarterback at N.C. State. He also played No. 1 singles on the
tennis team.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he carries a single-digit handicap in golf, plays a mean
game of racquetball and is a certified yo-yo master.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, a yo-yo master. It means he has mastered every
yo-yo trick in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Those things help illustrate how competitive Donnan is. One does
not reach such a level of expertise in so many disciplines without
being extremely driven.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley and many
others think that Donnan eventually will make the Bulldogs a
championship contender once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a competitor, that's for sure,'' Dooley said this week.
``He likes to compete; he likes to compete at the highest level.
And he's getting close to being able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is 6-2, ranked No. 14 in the nation and in position to
make a run at a pretty good bowl game for the third year in a row.
But you'd never know it by the grousing among fans.
</P>
<P>
   Here are their beefs:
</P>
<P>
   _ For the third year in a row, Georgia is assured of finishing
no better than third in the SEC's Eastern Division.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia is 1-17 against Florida and Tennessee in the 1990s,
0-2 this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia has not won an SEC championship in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, in his fourth year at Georgia, is expected to change all
that. He hinted early this year that it might happen this season.
But lopsided losses to Tennessee (37-20) and Florida (30-14) proved
that feeling to be premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're not trying,'' Donnan said. ``There's no
magic formula. We know we were in a position to do it this year,
and that was encouraging. But you've still got to go out and do it
on the field. We'll just keep working hard until we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan garnered headlines in the preseason when he said
Georgia's talent level was on par with that of Florida and
Tennessee. Those words came back to haunt him the second week in
October when the Vols manhandled the Bulldogs in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan also spoke glowingly of some of Georgia's younger
players, some of whom have lived up to his expectations, while
others haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just coach Donnan's mentality,'' sophomore quarterback
Quincy Carter said. ``He believes in us. To have a coach who
believes in us like that, even though we don't have much
experience, we respect him a lot for that. But that's just what his
expectations are for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a winner; he's always been a winner,'' Carter said.
``We've just got to go out and get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan said the Bulldogs are better off now than they were four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our talent base is better, our facilities are better, our
recruiting is better. We've just got to keep working to beat the
top teams,'' he said. ``We haven't done that anywhere near as often
as everybody would like us to or I would like us to. But I knew it
was going to take a while to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as anything, Donnan and the Bulldogs have had the
misfortune of being in this place and time in SEC history. Although
Georgia dominated the league in the early 1980s and owned Florida
and Tennessee in that decade, those two teams have risen to
national prominence in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators won the national championship in 1996 and have played
for it two other times. The Vols won it last year. And Florida or
Tennessee has won the conference championship eight of the past
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Donnan is one of the best coaches in the league.
Unfortunately, he has to play those two teams every year, like we
did this year,'' said Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville, who brings his
4-5 team to Sanford Stadium on Saturday. ``That's a tough side of
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Jim's only been there (four) years. It took Spurrier three
years to get it going at Florida. And there was a lot of grumbling
at Tennessee until recently. . . . He'll get it done. They've just
got to give him time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My assessment is this is a tough league,'' Dooley said. ``At
this time, the teams of the '90s happen to both play in our
division. Not only do we play in the toughest conference in
America, we play in the toughest division in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that Georgia is getting close to overcoming its
position. The Bulldogs lose just seven senior starters off this
year's team and, barring early defections to the NFL, will return
almost every player of significance next season. On Saturday, they
will start eight underclassmen on offense and seven on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, indications are that Tennessee might suffer some
after this season. The Vols, who play Georgia in Athens next year,
will graduate 12 senior starters and could lose three underclassmen
to the NFL draft. Florida is similarly experienced, although mostly
on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia still has much to play for this year. If the Bulldogs
can win their last three games, a Citrus Bowl berth could await.
With unpredictable Auburn coming in and back-to-back road games
against 18th-ranked Mississippi and 13th-ranked Georgia Tech,
something far less glamorous could be in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to go out and play these last three games and
try to have as good a year as we can,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the philosopher, Carter probably put Georgia's plight best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher we get on the mountain, the harder the wind
blows,'' he said. ``We know that. We've just got to be able to
stand up to the strong winds once we get up there. We didn't do
that this year. But we're going to keep fighting until we do.''

ADVERTISING: COMPETITION IN MANHATTAN YELLOW PAGES BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three companies, including the nation's largest
independent publisher of yellow pages directories, are looking to
challenge Bell Atlantic's long dominance in yellow pages in the
Manhattan market.
</P>
<P>
   The latest company to join the fray is also the newest:
Ambassador Publishing, a privately held start-up begun by the owner
of Champion Locksmith, a big advertiser in the Northeast with Bell
Atlantic. Ambassador announced recently that it would publish a
Manhattan yellow pages directory next October.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bell Atlantic, Ambassador will be competing with
Yellow Book USA, the largest independent publisher of yellow pages
directories, which will produce its first Manhattan directory in
the first quarter of next year, and DAG Media, which specializes in
directories for the Jewish market and will publish its first
Manhattan yellow pages next March, which will be geared to the
general market.
</P>
<P>
   The heated competition for the Manhattan yellow pages business
is mirrored in large markets nationwide. The yellow pages
directories make up the fifth-largest advertising medium in the
nation, according to McCann Erickson, a unit of the Interpublic
Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kelsey Group, a consulting firm in Princeton, N.J., said
that of the $12 billion in yellow pages advertising generated in
1998, independent publishers accounted for $1 billion. Print
advertising sales of independent publishers have jumped 15 percent
to 20 percent annually the last few years, while those of the
regional Bell companies have increased only 4 percent to 6 percent,
said John Kelsey, the president of the Kelsey Group.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers view Manhattan _ where yellow pages ad sales
totaled $100 million last year, according to the Kelsey Group _ as
ripe for invasion because of what they describe as Bell Atlantic's
high rates. Consequently, they have developed similar strategies:
all are undercutting Bell Atlantic's rates and creating features
they contend will make their books superior to Bell Atlantic's.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo Howe, the vice president for marketing and customer
relations at the Bell Atlantic Directory Group said, ``We're
accustomed to having competition, particularly in the New York
market, which is very media- intense.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said Bell Atlantic created the greatest value for
advertisers, noting that ``seven of nine adult consumers use our
book.''
</P>
<P>
   How successful the independent publishers will be against Bell
Atlantic _ whose predecessor, AT&AMP;T, first published a Manhattan
yellow pages more than 100 years ago _ remains to be seen. In the
late 1980s, the telephone company easily fought off an incursion by
Southwestern Bell, which published only one edition of a Manhattan
directory before quickly retreating.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Book USA's directory, whose circulation will be 1
million, will contain a fold-out Manhattan map, community
information and restaurant menus. The publisher, which will use the
Postal Service for delivery, is charging rates as much as 50
percent below those of Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is not Yellow Book's first foray into the New York
metropolitan area. Established in Rockville Centre in 1930, the
company has published directories for Long Island since then; it
entered the Brooklyn and Queens markets 15 years ago and Staten
Island three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Book was bought in August for $665 million by British
Telecommunications, the British company's first entry into the
United States yellow pages business.
</P>
<P>
   DAG Media, a 10-year-old company based in Kew Gardens that went
public in May, publishes Hebrew-English and Jewish-interest yellow
pages for the New York metropolitan market.
</P>
<P>
   It will distribute 900,000 copies of its Manhattan directory by
mail and truck. The company's founder and chief executive, Assaf
Ran, said rates for the book, which will offer special discounts to
users who do business with advertisers, will run 70 percent below
those of Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador's directory will feature sections on parenting,
sports and fitness and pets; a restaurant guide; and a telephone
service that will refer users to advertisers while generating
revenue for Ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation will be 1 million, with delivery door to door;
advertising rates are also as much as 70 percent below Bell
Atlantic's.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Steitz, the founder and chairman of Champion Locksmith in
Queens and chairman and chief executive of Ambassador, said that
over the last decade he spent $35 million on yellow pages
advertising with Bell Atlantic, whose dominance he said stifled
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Pollard, executive vice president for marketing at the
Yellow Pages Publishers Association, based in Denver, said: ``A
market like Manhattan offers lots of exploratory opportunities for
multiple publishers. Their success will be determined by consumer
usage and advertiser support.''
</P>
<P>
   In places like Orange County, Calif., for example, he said it
``is not unusual to have six, seven or eight publishers, plus
ethnic products.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey, whose clients include Bell Atlantic, was less sanguine
about the prospects of Ambassador and DAG Media in particular.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by his company of 14 metropolitan markets found
that the percentage of local businesses that advertise in yellow
pages directories was lowest in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least two factors work against any new yellow pages in a
city the size of New York,'' Kelsey said. ``The reach of yellow
pages is dropping fastest in the largest cities. And usage is
dramatically lower among ethnic populations, which are growing much
faster than the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted Bell Atlantic and Yellow Book would ``do
everything they can to get and keep advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There just isn't room in the kitchen drawer for more than two
directories,'' he said.

INJURY-RIDDLED UCLA IN EXHIBITION TONIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ UCLA plays the first of two exhibition games
tonight in Pauley Pavilion with a new offense, a new scoreboard and
an injury-depleted roster reminiscent of the football team's
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have just seven scholarship players available for
tonight's 7:30 p.m. tipoff against Kraitene, a Lithuanian club team
that lost to Pacific and Santa Clara earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ryan Bailey is out with tendinitis in his foot. Forward
Matt Barnes is academically ineligible. Forward Todd Ramasar is out
three months following shoulder surgery. Center Dan Gadzuric is
doubtful because of aching knees, and guard Ray Young has a
sprained thumb and could miss several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Young's thumb is the most serious injury among projected
starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a better idea by the end of the week, when the
swelling goes down, about what's torn and the ligament damage,''
Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, forward JaRon Rush is questionable tonight because
of a strained right (shooting) elbow. If he can't play, the roster
dwindles to a skeletal six: guards Earl Watson and Billy Knight,
and forwards Jerome Moiso, Sean Farnham, Rico Hines and Jason
Kapono.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get everyone healthy and get our rhythm back,
everything will be all right,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   __ New look: The Bruins will unveil their new offense tonight _
a 1-4 set that's designed to funnel the ball to Moiso and Gadzuric
in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-4 alignment places an initiator 25 feet from the basket
and stations four players along the foul line extended. It's
similar to John Wooden's high post offense, Lavin said, and it
should create 3-point opportunities for sharpshooters Kapono and
Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been around for 50 or 60 years, so we're not reinventing
the wheel,'' Lavin said. ``The biggest thing is it creates good
spacing for Dan and Jerome.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Early review: The $1.5 million scoreboard, with four replay
screens, was well received last weekend at Preview Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked good and the players seemed to respond,'' Lavin
said. ``It's not just for fans, but recruits.''
</P>
<P>
   __ If you missed it: Former UCLA guard Baron Davis, now playing
for Charlotte, suffered cartilage damage in his left knee and might
miss several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's the same knee _ although a different injury _ Davis
hurt in the 1998 NCAA Tournament against Michigan.

   LOS ANGELES _ In the symphony of famous comic voices, Stan
Freberg's is a Stradivarius. To see his rubber mouth, off-center
jaw and wild eyes in person _ and hear that sonorous, ever-shifting
voice _ is to remember hours and years of laughter that began in
his head and went straight to your ear, and belly.
</P>
<P>
   A simple ``Hel-lo!'' in his hands seems faintly funny, a
rolling, nasal prelude to anticipated punch lines from a man who
once made a top 40 record sending up soap operas, in which the only
words heard were ``John'' and ``Marsha.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the sound of a soupy organ, the title characters (both
played by Freberg) repeatedly uttered each other's names in varying
tones of grief, reproach, anxiety, joy and lust.
</P>
<P>
   Now 73, Freberg is the grand old satirist of radio and records.
He began his career in the 1950s by puncturing the stifling
conventions of the Eisenhower era and lampooning the prevailing
pop-culture effluvia of everything from ``Dragnet'' to the wailing
androgynous singer Johnnie Ray. Part Spike Jones, part Fred Allen
and wholly original, Freberg went on to a second career as the
subversive who helped popularize humor in advertising, with
pathbreaking campaigns for products like Contadina tomato paste
(``Who puts eight great tomatoes in that little bitty can?'') and
Sunsweet pitted prunes (``Today the pits, tomorrow the wrinkles'').
</P>
<P>
   And in 1961, he began a masterwork that is still in progress:
``Stan Freberg (Modestly) Presents the United States of America,
Vol. 1,'' a 50-minute Broadway musical for the ear with songs and
sketches by Freberg, orchestrations by Billy May and the voices of
the Freberg stock company, including Jesse White (the original
Maytag repairman) and June Foray (Rocky the Flying Squirrel and
countless other cartoon characters).
</P>
<P>
   In this Capitol Records LP, which my college roommate played so
often it practically melted, George Washington argues with Betsy
Ross like a Madison Avenue art director, Christopher Columbus lands
at Miami Beach bent on opening an Italian restaurant, Benjamin
Franklin is worried about signing a seditious petition called the
Declaration of Independence, and the first Thanksgiving is the
result of a vote-hungry Pilgrim politician's hypocritical pledge to
``Take an Indian to Lunch This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Take an Indian to lunch this week
</P>
<P>
   Show him we're a regular bunch this week
</P>
<P>
   Show him we're as liberal as can be
</P>
<P>
   Let him know he's almost as good as we
</P>
<P>
   Make a feathered friend feel fed this week
</P>
<P>
   Overlook the fact he's red, this week
</P>
<P>
   Let him share our Quaker Oats
</P>
<P>
   'Cause he's useful when he votes
</P>
<P>
   Take an Indian to lunch(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   The album's legion of fans have included the onetime chief of
the Navajo nation and the likes of Steven Spielberg and Richard
Dreyfuss, who passed time during breaks in the filming of ``Jaws''
by singing its songs. History teachers have used it for years to
make the Founding Fathers come alive.
</P>
<P>
   Asked once where the Beatles got their sense of humor, Paul
McCartney told Playboy magazine that it probably came from
listening to Freberg and Lenny Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   These and scores of other gems from the Freberg canon are now
available in a four-CD boxed set from Rhino Records, ``Tip of the
Freberg'' (R2 75645), which also contains a videotape with
highlights from Freberg's television commercials _ including his
campaign for Heinz Great American Soups, featuring a tap-dancing
Ann Miller atop a giant soup can in a full-scale parody of a Busby
Berkeley production number.
</P>
<P>
   Still active, with a nationally syndicated show called ``When
Radio Was,'' Freberg resisted taking time out from writing Vol. 3
of ``The United States of America'' to compile the boxed set. (Vol.
2, which runs through World War I, was not released until 1996.
That long delay was caused in part by a dispute with the Broadway
producer David Merrick, who proposed to put on a live version, then
fell to feuding and, Freberg recalls in his 1988 memoir, ``It Only
Hurts When I Laugh,'' ordered him to ``take Lincoln out of the
Civil War _ he doesn't work!''
</P>
<P>
   But since Gen-X hipsters have discovered anew the pleasures of
Freberg's brand of bent comedy and the swinging, jazzy idiom of his
satirical songs, Freberg concedes that the compilation was an idea
whose time had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Billy May on the phone the other day, `Fortunately,
you're still alive when your era came back,''' Freberg said of his
old friend, who wrote arrangements for the likes of Frank Sinatra.
``He said, `Anybody but you, Stanley, and I'd be offended at that,
but you're absolutely right, but now I'm too old to go on the
road.'''
</P>
<P>
   Freberg himself spent time on the road as a solo concert artist,
and as an opening act for Sinatra on foreign tours. But he has
actually lived his whole life close to home, having grown up the
son of a Baptist minister in nearby South Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a child of radio,'' he said in an interview at Rhino's
offices here. ``When other kids ran outside to play baseball, I ran
inside to play the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   He broke into radio comedy and voice-over work for Warner
Brothers cartoons right out of high school, then appeared
simultaneously on ``Time for Beany,'' the children's television
puppet show he helped create, and ``Musical Chairs,'' a live local
television show in which he, Johnny Mercer and Bobby Troup wrote
instant songs from lines suggested by the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, his big break came with ``John &AMP; Marsha,'' and a string
of record parodies for Capitol quickly followed, including ``St.
George and the Dragonet,'' in which a knight, ``working out of the
castle on the night watch,'' gets a call about a dragon devouring
maidens.
</P>
<P>
   In his best Jack Webb deadpan, Freberg's knight intones: ``My
job: Slay him!'' The flip side was a fairy tale retold in
McCarthy-era idiom: ``The story of Little Blue Riding Hood is true.
Only the color has been changed, to prevent an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Freberg's career changed dramatically in the mid-'50s when he
agreed to put his antic wit in the service of an enterprise he had
loathed: advertising. Working as a freelancer, he developed
iconoclastic, attention-getting radio and television campaigns for
Contadina, Chun King and other also-ran brands that inverted the
prevailing hard-sell techniques of the day with alarming candor _
and not coincidentally boosted sales.
</P>
<P>
   One radio commercial for Chun King opens with a close-harmony
jazz chorus singing: ``Ninety-five percent of the people in the
U.S.A./ Are buying Chun King chow mein!'' only to have Freberg
interrupt with a whistle blast: ``Hold it, please! That's not
exactly true. Only 5 percent of the people are buying it; 95
percent have never bought a single can.''
</P>
<P>
   A worried announcer asks: ``You want us to say that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Freberg replies. ``Lay it on the line! Let's have a
little truth in advertising for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Chun King's owner, Jeno Paulucci, hated the spot, but when it
increased sales 40 percent he learned to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do something right, and it doesn't sound like the
normal kind of thing that people are hearing day and night, you've
got a chance of breaking through the barrier,'' Freberg explained,
contrasting his techniques with those of bigger advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But, he noted: ``I'm not just a guy who would see how much I
could get away with. The only reason I was allowed to stay alive is
that terrific results followed.''
</P>
<P>
   If Freberg tends to speak of himself in unblushing superlatives,
he has lots to be immodest about: 21 Clios, a Grammy and 18
international broadcasting awards. He also did his bit for one of
the most controversial causes of his time, creating devastating
radio advertisements in support of the 1970 McGovern-Hatfield
Amendment to cut off financing for the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, a Pentagon official brags of winding the war ``down
to an average loss of about 38 American boys a week, which poses no
overload problem,'' while a representative of ``American Business
Machine and Body Count'' brags about the efficiency of his
company's new ``Vietnamatic 3,'' which can count bodies even more
efficiently and give ``a quick rundown on left ears for April.''
</P>
<P>
   What I decided was that people were so turned off by the war it
was like advertising: they didn't want to hear any more about it,''
Freberg said of the ads, which ran in states where senators were
undecided. ``I had to re-sensitize people to the horrors of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment ultimately lost, but, Freberg added, ``In the next
book I write, I'll tell you about how Nixon and Haldeman tried to
interfere with the playing of these spots on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Freberg moves a bit more slowly, and his dark '60s
brush cut has been replaced by a headful of shaggy white ringlets.
He acknowledges that it is now ``tough to be more outrageous than
life itself has become.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he added, ``how could you possibly write a sketch
kidding the president fooling around in the Oval Office any wilder
and more unbelievably uncouth, let's say, than what really happened
in the Clinton administration?''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Freberg said, as he writes Vol. 3 of ``The
United States'' (which will feature ``a wonderful song called `It
Wasn't Such a Great Depression'''), he is sorely tempted by the
prospect of ``you know, doing something about Monica Lewinsky in
the middle of World War II.''

   WASHINGTON _ Seconds after the antitrust judgment against
Microsoft was released on Friday night, the news was powering
through fiber-optic and copper cables around the world to
electronic mail in-baskets and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders were selling the company's shares from dealing
floors, trading rooms and computers perched precariously on the
dining room table, and hundreds of thousands of copies of the
document were being downloaded on to hard disks or printed out.
</P>
<P>
   One person, more than anyone else, made this possible: William
H. Gates, the man who has defined the business of computing and the
New Economy of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the 1980s were about quality and the 1990s were about
re-engineering, then the 2000s will be about velocity,'' he says in
``Business At The Speed of Thought,'' his new book. ``About how
quickly business itself will be transacted. About how information
access will alter the lifestyle of consumers and their expectations
of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of this man, his vision and the company which he has
built from nothing to dominate totally the computer business is now
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the subject of a huge competition case, and if
Friday's statement from the court is to be believed, it is losing.
Bill Gates himself lost $20 billion, when the judgment affected
Microsoft share prices.
</P>
<P>
   And when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote his damning
conclusions about Microsoft, calling it a monopolist and charging
it with a massive abuse of its power in the market, he was not
speaking just of a company or a hierarchy: he was damning Gates.
</P>
<P>
   His credibility is on trial, as much as his company, as lawyers
and consumers come to terms with how one man sought to use American
capitalism, and to change it in the process.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in many respects, an unlikely figure to follow in the
footsteps of the pirate kings of American industry, the monopolists
who sought to dominate the explosive growth of American heavy
industry 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is worth billions, owns Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex
Leicester and has a house worth more than $20 million, Bill Gates
is not the man in the top hat and the frock coat, the classic
capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Tremulous and thin-voiced when he stood up to defend himself on
Friday night he sounded less plutocrat than plebeian: more like a
junior marketing executive caught out fiddling his expenses than
John D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be fooled. The Economist magazine has called Gates a
``paragon of industry'' and a ``ruthless predator,'' and both are
true: he has succeeded beyond all imagining in creating a behemoth
of American industry, but, as the antitrust trial has made clear,
it has not always been very pretty. It has succeeded primarily
through its ability to bring products to market and to outmaneuver
competitors. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates started with a program which linked together the
devices on primitive computers and allowed the user to control them
in a relatively easy way: a Disk Operating System.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in 1980 when IBM needed an operating
system for its new personal computer. Gates and his colleague Paul
Allen bought a rough working version from a local company for
$5,000 and sold it to Big Blue, which turned the machine into an
industry standard _ and MS-DOS with it.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM didn't own the program: Microsoft did. And within a few
years it was clear that the key to the new age of computing was not
the large boxes with which IBM had made its name, or even the
smaller ones that it was selling by the pallet-load: it was the
code which made them work, and that meant Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   From MS-DOS came Windows, the world's most widely used software
program and the foundation for the modern age, in which computing
power is widely dispersed and easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet is shifting that revolution into a higher gear.
And it was the internet which both crystallized Microsoft's
importance and inspired its current problems.
</P>
<P>
   For the user, the keystone of the Internet is the browser, the
program linking each individual to the vast range of network
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was faced with a stiff challenge from Netscape, the
upstart young company which was pushing its Netscape Communicator.
Microsoft, its opponents alleged, used its power to choke off
competition and establish its Internet explorer as the standard. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft claims that it is just competing like everybody else:
that by innovating, developing products and then selling them as
hard as it can, it is doing what capitalists do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users said to us, `we want to get on to the Internet...we want
to do that in a simple way where we just buy a Windows PC and it's
there. And we know that it works and Microsoft provides all of its
support services for us,''' Gates told the news service CNET in
1997. ``We delivered to that.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he stood up to defend himself on Friday, it was the
same argument: that he had delivered innovation. ``The court's
findings do acknowledge that Microsoft's actions accelerated the
development of the internet, reduced the cost to consumers and
improved the quality of web-browsing software,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit is fundamentally about one question: can a
successful American company continue to improve its products for
the benefit of consumers? That is precisely what Microsoft did by
developing new versions of the Windows operating system with
built-in support for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Judge Jackson has rejected this idea, conclusively.
``Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and
others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious
market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on
pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one
of Microsoft's core products,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's past success in hurting such companies and
stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and
businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft. The
ultimate result is that some innovations that would truly benefit
consumers never occur for the sole reason that they do not coincide
with Microsoft's self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are tempted to weep for Gates _ or are preparing to dance
on his grave _ think again.
</P>
<P>
   When Standard Oil was broken up, John D. Rockefeller's wealth
actually increased. Everything has moved on now, of course, at the
lightning speed described by Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is now owned by America On-Line, the Virginia company
which is the world's best-known provider of Internet services.
There are other challenges to Microsoft, from languages like Java
and Linux.
</P>
<P>
   The game is moving from the PC and the browser, down to handheld
devices like the Palm Pilot, or up and out on to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Vast new combinations are being spun from fiber-optic cable,
software, semiconductors and hard cash, labyrinthine webs of
corporate control aimed at capturing the largest share of the
largest markets for the longest possible time.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is right in there. The game is not over for Gates: in
some ways, it may only just be beginning. &QL;

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seconds after the antitrust judgment against
Microsoft was released on Friday night, the news was powering
through fiber-optic and copper cables around the world to
electronic mail in-baskets and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders were selling the company's shares from dealing
floors, trading rooms and computers perched precariously on the
dining room table, and hundreds of thousands of copies of the
document were being downloaded on to hard disks or printed out.
</P>
<P>
   One person, more than anyone else, made this possible: William
H. Gates, the man who has defined the business of computing and the
New Economy of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the 1980s were about quality and the 1990s were about
re-engineering, then the 2000s will be about velocity,'' he says in
``Business At The Speed of Thought,'' his new book. ``About how
quickly business itself will be transacted. About how information
access will alter the lifestyle of consumers and their expectations
of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of this man, his vision and the company which he has
built from nothing to dominate totally the computer business is now
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the subject of a huge competition case, and if
Friday's statement from the court is to be believed, it is losing.
Bill Gates himself lost $20 billion, when the judgment affected
Microsoft share prices.
</P>
<P>
   And when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote his damning
conclusions about Microsoft, calling it a monopolist and charging
it with a massive abuse of its power in the market, he was not
speaking just of a company or a hierarchy: he was damning Gates.
</P>
<P>
   His credibility is on trial, as much as his company, as lawyers
and consumers come to terms with how one man sought to use American
capitalism, and to change it in the process.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in many respects, an unlikely figure to follow in the
footsteps of the pirate kings of American industry, the monopolists
who sought to dominate the explosive growth of American heavy
industry 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is worth billions, owns Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex
Leicester and has a house worth more than $20 million, Bill Gates
is not the man in the top hat and the frock coat, the classic
capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Tremulous and thin-voiced when he stood up to defend himself on
Friday night he sounded less plutocrat than plebeian: more like a
junior marketing executive caught out fiddling his expenses than
John D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be fooled. The Economist magazine has called Gates a
``paragon of industry'' and a ``ruthless predator,'' and both are
true: he has succeeded beyond all imagining in creating a behemoth
of American industry, but, as the antitrust trial has made clear,
it has not always been very pretty. It has succeeded primarily
through its ability to bring products to market and to outmaneuver
competitors. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (275-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates started with a program which linked together the
devices on primitive computers and allowed the user to control them
in a relatively easy way: a Disk Operating System.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in 1980 when IBM needed an operating
system for its new personal computer. Gates and his colleague Paul
Allen bought a rough working version from a local company for
$5,000 and sold it to Big Blue, which turned the machine into an
industry standard _ and MS-DOS with it.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM didn't own the program: Microsoft did. And within a few
years it was clear that the key to the new age of computing was not
the large boxes with which IBM had made its name, or even the
smaller ones that it was selling by the pallet-load: it was the
code which made them work, and that meant Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   From MS-DOS came Windows, the world's most widely used software
program and the foundation for the modern age, in which computing
power is widely dispersed and easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet is shifting that revolution into a higher gear.
And it was the internet which both crystallized Microsoft's
importance and inspired its current problems.
</P>
<P>
   For the user, the keystone of the Internet is the browser, the
program linking each individual to the vast range of network
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was faced with a stiff challenge from Netscape, the
upstart young company which was pushing its Netscape Communicator.
Microsoft, its opponents alleged, used its power to choke off
competition and establish its Internet explorer as the standard. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft claims that it is just competing like everybody else:
that by innovating, developing products and then selling them as
hard as it can, it is doing what capitalists do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users said to us, `we want to get on to the Internet...we want
to do that in a simple way where we just buy a Windows PC and it's
there. And we know that it works and Microsoft provides all of its
support services for us,''' Gates told the neice CNET in
1997. ``We delivered to that.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he stood up to defend himself on Friday, it was the
same argument: that he had delivered innovation. ``The court's
findings do acknowledge that Microsoft's actions accelerated the
development of the internet, reduced the cost to consumers and
improved the quality of web-browsing software,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit is fundamentally about one question: can a
successful American company continue to improve its products for
the benefit of consumers? That is precisely what Microsoft did by
developing new versions of the Windows operating system with
built-in support for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Judge Jackson has rejected this idea, conclusively.
``Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and
others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious
market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on
pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one
of Microsoft's core products,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's past success in hurting such companies and
stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and
businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft. The
ultimate result is that some innovations that would truly benefit
consumers never occur for the sole reason that they do not coincide
with Microsoft's self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are tempted to weep for Gates _ or are preparing to dance
on his grave _ think again.
</P>
<P>
   When Standard Oil was broken up, John D. Rockefeller's wealth
actually increased. Everything has moved on now, of course, at the
lightning speed described by Gates.

IT'S A BAD TIME NOT TO PLAY `D'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a toast to rotten timing, the Los Angeles
Clippers and their staggering offense are required to spend a
couple of unhappy hours tonight at Staples Center with the San
Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' offense might sober 'em up enough as it is. In the
season's opening week, the Clips haven't exactly demonstrated a
capacity to perform lock-down procedures against Tim Duncan on the
low post. Or handle David Robinson from the elbow. Or limit Avery
Johnson's penetration. Or hop out in time to prevent Jaren
Jackson's spot-up jumpers against double-teaming tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the defensive muscle flexed by the defending NBA champs
that makes Clippers coach Chris Ford squirm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really concerned about their defense and their ability to
stop people,'' said Ford, whose team has been sensational at
stopping itself. After four games, the Clips are attempting to
scale the league's more-accessible 100-point wall for the first
time. In Monday's clouting by the Utah Jazz, they bruised the rims
at a bitter rate of 34 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from awful marksmanship, their offensive ills have been
enhanced by a youthful failure to recognize opportunities provided
by opposing defenses. Activity away from the ball has been limited
to vigorous watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've developed a bad habit of standing around,'' said guard
Derek Anderson, one of the many Clippers with enough one-on-one
skills to invite his buddies to spectate unwittingly rather than
cut to the basket. ``We're damn near like fans out there.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ford, the solution is awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is my defender doing?'' he said, taking the hypothetical
approach. ``Is my defender putting up a road block that could stop
my teammate from getting to the basket?''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, such a maneuver would be overkill. Who needs road
blocks when, in Duncan and Robinson, San Antonio can close the road
with the Twin Towers?
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast breaks: Ford's rotation again will be disrupted by the
lingering pain of guards Eric Piatkowski and Eric Murdock.
Piatkowski (bruised ribs), the Clippers' premier 3-point weapon,
will be kept in street clothes for the fourth consecutive game.
``That's one less bullet,'' Ford said. Murdock, who opened this
season as Ford's starting point guard, has a sore right knee that
will cancel his participation for the third successive game. ``I
certainly didn't think either one was going to be out this long,''
Ford said.

   LONDON _ Nancy Reagan was famous for consulting hers, and the
Princess of Wales reportedly never made a move without taking
advice from one. But now the world of business is using astrology
before making crucial boardroom decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses are renowned for making choices based on facts and
figures, and in an area where the bottom line rules it seems
unlikely that companies would turn to the stars before appointing
new members of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But a new website launched Tuesday claims it can warn businesses
of trouble in the boardroom by matching executives according to
their astrological compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   YAS Corporation says it could have predicted the fallout between
Alan Sugar, the former chairman of England's Tottenham Hotspur
Football Club, and Terry Venables, then his chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   By looking at people's birth dates the company produces detailed
character analysis and at Spurs it would have predicted ``constant
friction, if suppressed'' between the two men. The clue is to be
found in the alignment between Jupiter on Sugar's chart and Mars on
that of Venables.
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, the partnership between British leaders Tony
Blair and Gordon Brown, whose working relationship has often been
the subject of speculation, ``will share common ideas about ethics,
politics, and many social values. They will make an excellent
business team, especially in any endeavors that require reaching
out to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mackenis, chief executive of the California-based company,
said a number of businesses, including a mobile-phone operation and
a City of London bank, had approached him about the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford never launches a new car without checking the date first,
and it is interesting to note that Ford has the Orion, Aries,
Taurus and Mercury,'' Mackenis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as a bit of fun when someone showed me the program,
and then I ran a few friends and colleagues through it and realized
it was exactly right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have an instant rapport with some people and think
they would be good to go into business with, but then you find out
that you do nothing but sit about talking about your ideas without
actually achieving anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology helps you to decide whether you should
actually go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are often sniffy about astrology in public when they
think someone might hear, but when they can check things out in
private they go for it. This tool can just give you an extra
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackenis said the program's software, known as Seer, is more
accurate than star signs because it is based on a person's birth
date, which allows it to be more precise than simply using one of
the 12 signs of the zodiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have a way of predicting how a person's business day
will be and whether they should sign that contract or not, and we
will be developing group software that will allow a whole
department to decide if someone should join their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be used by venture capitalists and
consultants. In the same way that graphology is used increasingly
this will be just another tool,'' Mackenis said.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be free for the first few months while any
glitches are ironed out, and after that people will be allowed two
free consultations and then be charged $ 6.00 for the next.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan you can look up your own boss _ on
www.yourastrologysite.com _ and find out if he's going to have a
good day or whether you should pick up that phone and call in sick
right now. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: DOLLAR BILL COMES HOME TO THE GARDEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He knows the back corridors of the Garden as well as
he knew the intricacies of the backdoor play.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasions when he slips back into Madison Square
Garden, he recognizes enough familiar faces among the workers and
the fans to almost make him feel that a quarter of a century has
not passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a home of sorts,'' Bill Bradley said. ``It's the place
where I worked for 10 years, and it's got a lot of special
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Bradley did not capitalize on his old line of
work. In his first campaign for the Senate, he did not go around
telling people to work together like the Knicks used to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I avoided it unless somebody asked about it,'' Bradley said
Tuesday . ``But after four or five years, after I'd proven myself,
I became much more comfortable with that part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   True to himself, Bradley chose to play down the most obvious and
simple fact of his life, that he is one of the most celebrated
athlete-public servants of the century.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, he will indeed play the Garden card. The
former Knick and the former senator from New Jersey will stage a
fund-raiser in his old place of work.
</P>
<P>
   For those fans who have been too engrossed in watching the
Knicks take form this fall to pay attention to such trivialities as
presidential politics, the old forward whose No. 24 hangs from the
beams is running for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has enrolled many of his former teammates and opponents.
Sunday's highlight will be a re-enactment by Willis Reed of his
famous stiff-legged walk out to the Garden floor just before the
championship game in May 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out warming up,'' Bradley recalled Tuesday by phone
while campaigning in the Midwest. ``We had no idea if he could
play. The last we saw of him was in the locker room with the
doctors. Later, we found out they had given him a shot of Novocain.
It was a risky thing for him to do, but he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who provided such an emotional and physical boost to that
victory, still walks with a limp and is Captain for Life. When they
are all together, Bradley is still Dollar Bill, the man with the
Rhodes Scholarship and the minimal wardrobe. These pragmatic
athletes, many from hard corners of the country, were not buying
into Ivy League puffery. Clyde and Dick and Earl the Pearl and Dave
and Willis and Phil called him senator and president, just as
people had done since Bradley was a sophomore at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 19,'' Bradley said Tuesday. ``I was thinking about being
a history major. I knew I had a lot to learn and I also knew I
wanted to get involved in something, but I didn't do anything
because it might lead to something. That would be a sterile way to
live your life.''
</P>
<P>
   On numbing road trips, the Knicks were well aware that their
teammate would slip out to schmooze with people living in the real
world. It was not hard to miss his volunteer work, his lobbying
against apartheid in South Africa, his trips to American Indian
reservations, his education, his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   What is fascinating about Sunday's fund-raiser is the number of
former opponents coming back to the Garden. First names and
nicknames will suffice _ Kareem. Tiny. Cooze. Doctor J. Hondo.
Elvin. Moses. Bingo. Oscar. Russ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Cousy spent a whole day in New Hampshire recently, and
said he is an independent, but he gave a speech in front of 2,500
people,'' Bradley said. ``I knew I was getting somewhere when I saw
a bumper sticker that said, `Another Celtic Fan for Bradley.'''
</P>
<P>
   John Havlicek will be at the Garden despite his frequent claims
that he still has Bradley's fingerprints across his back. Bradley
denies it all. Maybe he stepped on a toe or two, or tugged a shirt
or two, but that was only to equalize the laws of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about their politics,'' Bradley said.
``But I've known these guys a long time. I've known Oscar Robertson
since he ran the Players Association. The first time I had anything
to do with Congress was around 1970, when John Havlicek and I
testified before the Judiciary Committee about the merger of the
two leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has rarely visited the Garden over the years _ ``usually
for a number retirement or something'' _ but even as a senator, he
could slip into a front-row seat and watch a game. He was reminded
Tuesday that the security demands of a presidential trip to a
sports event can inconvenience thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of work ahead of me,'' Bradley said. ``I'm not
even thinking about that. I'm sure a president can disrupt things.
I've seen it happen. But you could also say it means a lot to
players and fans to see a president at a game. I've got the feeling
that if it did happen, there'd be enough work that I'd be watching
most games on television.''
</P>
<P>
   A political response from a politician. On Sunday, Bill Bradley
comes looking for campaign funds. He will also hear old cheers
still echoing from the days when he wore shorts and ran the
backdoor play.

AMAZON.COM TO START SELLING TOOLS, VIDEO GAMES AND SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeding its audacious ambition to be the general store of the
Internet, Amazon.com said Tuesday that it would begin selling
tools, video games and software, beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has already moved far from its beginnings as a
bookseller, having added music, videos, toys and consumer
electronics. And it lets other merchants use its site to hold
auctions or run online stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of Amazon's model is to increase the share of
wallet they are getting from the people who come to their site,''
said Jamie Kiggen, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
``They are adding leverage to the investment in infrastructure they
are making.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company has said it would add many more
categories of merchandise in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Amazon stunned investors by saying it would triple
its marketing spending for the fourth quarter and raise its
spending on new business lines, pushing any expectations of profits
further into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has grown rapidly and is expected to post sales of about
$1.5 billion this year, but its losses have grown even faster,
raising investors' questions about the wisdom of its plan.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares fell by 20 percent in the days after it
said it was postponing profitability. On Monday, its stock surged
$13 a share, to $78, after Amazon scheduled a news conference in
New York, leading to speculation about its next moves.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, when Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos and other
top managers disclosed the company's new retailing sectors, the
stock fell $7.1875, to $70.8125.
</P>
<P>
   The tool business is a bit of a departure, because many of the
6,000 items are of greater interest to contractors and
professionals than to do-it-yourselfers. While the site will sell
the sort of cordless drills that are given as Christmas presents,
it will also sell an oscillating spindle sander used for
professional woodworking and priced at $1,649.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this opens up for Amazon.com is a whole new market of
contractors, welders, electricians, farmers and other people who
use these products for a business,'' said Amazon's president Joe
Galli. ``If you are on a job site, the last thing you want to do is
get in your truck, go to the store, and buy a tool or piece of
equipment. We will ship it right to your workshop or your work
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Galli was president of Black &AMP; Decker, the tool maker, before
joining Amazon this summer.
</P>
<P>
   To get a foothold in the tool business, Amazon bought Tool Crib
of the North, a large discount mail-order tool catalog that has an
Internet site. Amazon did not say how much it paid for the company,
which is based in Grand Forks, N.D. Amazon said it would continue
the catalog businesses _ its first non-Internet business. But it
did not buy Tool Crib's five retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said it hoped to offer a broad selection of tools,
including hard-to-find specialty items. Compared with Amazon's
6,000 tool products, Home Depot carries about 10,000 tools and
accessories in its stores as well as about 50,000 other items.
Amazon said it would not carry other home-improvement items, like
lumber, toilet seats and screws, at least at first. It also
declined to say if it would add these items later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tool business is much better than the home-improvement
business,'' said David Ezequelle, the former chief executive of
toolsource.com, an online tool store. ``The average order size is
high, and people don't return tools often. But when you're selling
screws and hinges, people will buy three sizes and return two.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the online tool business has been quite small. Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co. has been selling its Craftsman line on its Web site
for several years and is about to add other brands. Home Depot will
not start selling online until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its late start, Home Depot said it expected that its
network of local stores and its reputation would enable it to
compete with Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy for the Internet is designed to build on the
power of our brand,'' said Carol Schumacher, a spokeswoman for Home
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to tools, both software and video games are very
active and competitive markets online, and profit margins are slim.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said that it would compete by offering features like
product recommendations and customer reviews, as it already does
with books. Since it will stock these products at its own
warehouses, customers will be able to save money on shipping by
combining software, video games and other products in one order.
</P>
<P>
   Genni Combes, an analyst for Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, said that even
low-margin products were needed to make the company's $300 million
investment in warehouses pay off. ``It is important for them to
fill up their distribution centers so they can cover their fixed
costs,'' she said.

CITIBANK HEAD CONCEDES LAUNDERING CONTROLS WERE POOR 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The co-chairman of Citigroup testified before a
Senate subcommittee Tuesday that his bank had been slow to correct
years of weak controls over wealthy private accounts, and he lent
support to a proposal that would prohibit American banks from
accepting corrupt deposits from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But the official, John S. Reed, who is also a co-chief executive
of Citigroup, the parent of Citibank, said the bank had made
wholesale changes in its policies and culture since 1997, to learn
more about its wealthiest customers and to prevent them from
laundering money through the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a pattern of us being a dirty bank,'' he told the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which opened
hearings on the vulnerability of private banking to laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee, after having obtained Citibank records, showed
how hundreds of millions of dollars in questionable deposits had
moved through secret Citibank accounts held by foreign leaders and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the panel's ranking Democrat and
the initiator of the inquiry, said Citibank's inability to police
itself required legislative action. ``There were a lot of
self-adopted rules at the bank that were ignored,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed seemed to agree with one of Levin's proposals: bar American
banks from accepting the proceeds of corrupt acts abroad, like
looting a country's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, American laundering laws bar financial institutions
from handling the proceeds from a narrow group of crimes like drug
trafficking, kidnapping and bank fraud, but not corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning Reed, Levin asked: ``Do you think we should treat
bribes and looting government treasuries the same way we treat drug
money?''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said, ``I sure would.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent disclosures about the extensive flow of money out of
Russia through the Bank of New York have spurred some in Congress
to broaden the definition of laundering to include corruptly
obtained money.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed legislation that would
expand the definition of laundering to include the taking of
corrupt money from foreign customers. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Stuart E. Eizenstat said Tuesday that the proposals would give the
United States the ability to prosecute foreign officials who tried
to deposit illicit money here.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is chairwoman of the
subcommittee, read from critical internal Citibank audits from 1995
to 1997. She said a ``systematic pattern of deficiencies'' made the
bank vulnerable to laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Reed acknowledged that ``there was not an acceptable level of
standards in place'' for a ``three- or four-year period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' he added, ``I wish we had been more aggressive''
and taken corrective action ``a year earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   In private banking, wealthy and powerful customers receive
special discretion and care. Private banks within banks manage more
than $15 trillion in assets, the committee staff found. Citibank
Private Bank has 40,000 customers, with 350 of them officials or
their families.
</P>
<P>
   What disturbed Levin was what he called a ``rogues' gallery'' of
Citibank Private Bank clients. He said they included Raul Salinas
de Gortari, a brother of the former president of Mexico who is in
prison for masterminding a murder; Asif Ali Zardari, husband of a
former prime minister of Pakistan who is in jail for corruption;
Omar Bongo, president of the African nation of Gabon and the
subject of a French corruption inquiry; the sons of a former
military leader of Nigeria, Gen. Sani Abacha, one of whom has been
charged with murder; Jaime Lusinchi, a former president of
Venezuela; and two daughters of former President Suharto of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Salinas case, in which Citibank moved $80 million to $100
million around through secret accounts, is what galvanized much of
the initial interest in Citibank Private Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing included the first public testimony by Amy
Elliott, the vice president who handled the account. She
acknowledged failing to complete a business profile of Salinas, as
bank policy required, until after his arrest in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The senators asked about talks that she and other executives had
the day after the arrest. In those conversations she spoke about
having to talk to ``God,'' but she told the senators that she was
not referring to a specific person.

   U.S. SEEKS WAY TO OPEN OPERATING-SYSTEM MARKET
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal officials prosecuting the Microsoft
antitrust case say that their goal in any settlement or
court-imposed remedy will be to break up Microsoft's monopoly power
in personal-computer operating systems. The officials have not
decided how that should be done, but proposals range from forcing
Microsoft to publish the code for Windows so companies could design
competing systems to breaking up the company. Regulatory officials
in Europe most likely will wait until the Justice Department
resolves its case against Microsoft before taking any action
themselves.

   AMAZON ADDS TO ITS PRODUCT LIST
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, feeding its ambition to be the general store of the
Internet, said it would add tools, video games and software to the
list of products it sells over its Web site, but investors were
left wondering about the wisdom of such an expansion by a company
that does not expect to post a profit in the near future. Shares of
Amazon fell $7.1875, to $70.8125.

   MERRILL LYNCH HAS TRADING GLITCH
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks before its scheduled introduction of a
state-of-the-art online stock-trading system, Merrill Lynch is

about three hours, Merrill Lynch brokers could not process orders
for shares traded on the Nasdaq market.

   NASDAQ ENDS STRING OF RECORD HIGHS
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell as the rally in technology shares that drove
the Nasdaq composite index to seven consecutive records ended. The
Nasdaq fell 18.93 points, to 3,125.04. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 101.53 points, to 10,617.32, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index slipped 11.73 points, to 1,365.28.

Miller, who will continue as chairman of the retail chain. Ms.
Johnson, now vice chairman and chief operating officer of the

appointment takes effect on Feb. 1. The change was part of a
succession plan created two years ago and adopted by Proffitt's

 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was gone for 46 seconds. A sprained ankle kept
Marcus Camby, the former vanishing No. 2 draft pick, on the Knicks'
bench for under a minute on Monday night against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the wafer-thin, doe-eyed center was done for the
game after landing on Danny Manning's foot and falling to the floor
in agony. Watching at courtside was Michael Jordan, who forfeited
his own body to the team cause on many nights. ``He's sitting right
there,'' Camby said of Jordan. ``They put him up on the Jumbotron.
Everyone is going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby came off the bench after his ankle was retaped and helped
energize a Knicks comeback in the fourth quarter. In overtime,
there he was, flying down the lane with elan and grace, contorting
his 7-foot frame until the ball passed through the net and the
Knicks had won after trailing by nine points with six minutes left.
Camby was waving his arms and motioning for the crowd to stand and
roar with him. Madison Square Garden was apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy, no? The Patrick Ewing era still has a 2001 expiration
date, and this 25-year-old kid can't wait to propel this franchise
to a title.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Camby skip an exhibition game last season with a blister
on his foot? Didn't he ask out against Miami because of fatigue
after playing five minutes? Didn't Camby sit out a game as a
Toronto Raptor with a common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Camby was once perceived as the embodiment of a young star
without a career road map, an all-American caught up in the
sleaziness of Division I college athletics. Never mind that he
reimbursed UMass $150,000 in lost tournament revenue because he
took money and gifts from a prospective agent. No one wanted to
hear about Camby's accountability for his misadventures. The
assumption was, he was already living large and would never get it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no handicap for youth and immaturity in professional
sports; Tiger Woods, at age 20, was skewered for telling crude
jokes in a national magazine profile. Imagine if someone printed
your jokes and misdeeds at 20. Would they reflect who you are now? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We want these kids to grow up so fast, we won't cut them the
slack given to every other kid living in his parents' house. When
asked about the Chinese character tattoos on his right arm last
June, Camby was honest and said he fell in love with Asian culture
as a child by ``watching a lot of kung-fu movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, during the Knicks' improbable playoff run, the
new-found maturity and professionalism exhibited by Camby probably
saved jobs _ and not just Jeff Van Gundy's. With the Knicks close
to blowing up, Camby took his medicine on the bench, never
complained and became the X-factor in the Eastern Conference finals
against Indiana, helping vault the Knicks into the finals. Without
those playoff games in May and June would Dave Checketts still be
working at Penn Plaza?
</P>
<P>
   This season, Camby has this feel-good character about him that
transcends ability. His boyish exuberance is contagious to his
teammates the way Magic Johnson's was to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   While Ewing sits by his locker cubicle with headphones on before
each game _ a case study in stoicism _ Camby's 7-foot frame is
sprawled out across a rug. But unlike Ewing, Camby is quick to
acknowledge a teammate from across the room, to lift up his
earphones and listen. An approachable Big Fella?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just out there having fun,'' he said after getting 23
points, 13 rebounds and six blocked shots against the Bucks. ``This
is what I envisioned when I first came here, to come out here and
play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He's performing under the spotlight in the world's largest media
market, in front of the most vocal and capricious fans in the
league. He's working for the most demanding corporate entity in
American sports. A bottom-line company that needs victories to fill
its coffers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night Camby shook off a painful ankle under the
watchful eye of Jordan. Asked what he thought about the state of
the post-Michael NBA, how these youngsters were making out, Jordan
nodded and smiled. ``It's doing fine,'' he said.
</P>

   ``Where were you tonight?'' Jordan asked Thomas, who was dressed
in civilian clothes.

   ``My ankle; it's sprained,'' Thomas said.

<P>
   ``A sprained ankle?'' Jordan said, smacking his palm against his

don't want to hear about a sprained ankle. Go out and get yourself
some Air Jordans and play some basketball.''

RESTORER WHO FOUND 16TH CENTURY PAINTING IS PROSECUTED

   NEW YORK _ When a Long Island furniture restorer, Frank J.
Vaccaro, picked up a piece of wood in his shop and started to
remove an old print that was glued to its side, he made an unusual
discovery: a pair of eyes looked back at him, covered in black
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling off the paint, he found a nose, and suddenly he realized
that he was looking at a painting of Christ that, it turned out,
had been painted in the 16th century by the Venetian artist Jacopo
de' Barbari.
</P>
<P>
   Now the furniture restorer faces criminal charges, since the
valuable work was part of a cache of 13 pieces of artwork that had
been stolen from a castle in Germany by occupying American troops
at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, Vaccaro refused to return the painting
to its rightful owner, an art museum in Weimar, even after being
told that it was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   After an undercover sting operation conducted by the U.S.
Customs Service, in which several of Vaccaro's conversations with
the museum were secretly taped, he was arrested on Monday night and
charged with one count of possessing and trying to sell the stolen
artwork, which is valued at as much as $400,000, back to the
museum. The painting was also seized, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccaro was released on $10,000 bond by a federal magistrate
judge in Manhattan on Monday night. His lawyer, Michael Handwerker,
said: ``It was not, and is not, his intention to harm anyone. He
acted in good faith and we're going to try to dispose of the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaccaro, 38, of Wantagh, N.Y., did not return a call left at his
store seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said that Vaccaro, after tracing the
painting's ownership to the Kunstsammlungen zu Weimar, had
repeatedly refused to return it unless he was paid.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is elated at the recovery, said one of its lawyers,
Thomas R. Kline, adding that it ``certainly suggests that it may be
possible to recover some of the rest of the 13 that were stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the missing masterpieces had been a mystery ever
since their disappearance in the summer of 1945 from the
Schwartzburg Castle, where they and other artworks belonging to the
museum had been placed for safekeeping during the war.
</P>
<P>
   According to historical accounts cited in past court records and
the complaint filed by the office of Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, the paintings were stored during the end of
the war in a locked room in the castle, which Hitler had once used
as a summer retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1945, after U.S. military forces moved into the region,
the director of the museum showed them the paintings and asked that
they be protected.
</P>
<P>
   But when the director inspected the storeroom after the
Americans departed, he found that it had been broken into and was
in disarray and that 13 paintings were missing. Museum officials
ultimately concluded that the artwork had been stolen by American
soldiers stationed at the castle. Since then, the museum, with the
assistance of the State Department, has been able to recover only
three of the missing works.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, two 15th-century oil-on-wood portraits by Albrecht
Durer, each worth several million dollars, were found in the
possession of a lawyer in New York, who said he bought them from an
American soldier in 1946 for $450. A federal judge ultimately
ordered them given back to the museum. A painting by Johann
Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein was returned to the museum in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With the discovery of the de' Barbari this week, there are still
nine paintings missing, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccaro first called the museum in 1998, identifying himself as
a journalist or researcher interested in works by de' Barbari,
according to the federal complaint filed by Ms. White. A museum
official told him about the looting of the museum's collection
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Last Aug. 2, Vaccaro called again, telling the museum's director
that he had possession of the de' Barbari painting and offering to
return it for $100,000. The director, Dr. Ralph Bothe, said that
was too high for a finder's fee and offered $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   In describing how he had found the painting concealed under a
panel from a piece of furniture, which he had had for about nine
years, Varraro did not say how he had obtained the wood.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 31, in one of the recorded conversations, Vaccaro is
quoted as acknowledging that the painting belonged to the museum.
``It doesn't belong to me,'' he says.

 &HT;    Voinovich gives his support to Bush
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Sen. George Voinovich announced his
presidential endorsement Tuesday, staking his support for
Republican front-runner Gov. George W. Bush days before Bush heads
to Cleveland for his first fund raiser in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, the Republican from Cleveland, is co-chairing the
event, though he and his wife Janet won't attend because of a
family vacation planned for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich said he decided on Bush after watching him campaign
without having ``succumbed to pandering to the right wing of the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Voinovich is pleased that Bush isn't using
morally divisive issues such as abortion to score points with
political constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich praised Bush's ``independent streak'' and courage to
stand against prevailing wishes, two traits most commonly
associated with his presidential rival Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
whom Ohio's other Senator, Mike DeWine of Cedarville, has endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich said the big difference between the two is that
Bush has been an executive his whole life, not just a legislator
like McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush has had management experience in the private
sector and he's had management experience running the second
largest state in America,'' Voinovich said. ``People who come out
of legislatures have no idea what it is to manage and run a large
corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich met Bush when the former president's son was first
elected governor of Texas and Voinovich was leading the National
Governors' Association.
</P>
<P>
   At an orientation weekend for new governors the two spent time
together and ``you got to really see a person's soul,'' Voinovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a terrific, fine human being,'' Voinovich said. ``People
feel good when they're around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich is the last of Ohio's statewide officeholders to
endorse a presidential candidate. Bush has previously gained the
support of Gov. Bob Taft, Attorney General Betty Montgomery,
Auditor Jim Petro, Treasurer Joseph T. Deters and Lt. Gov. Maureen
O'Connor. Ohio's Secretary of State, J. Kenneth Blackwell, is
national campaign chairman for magazine millionaire Steve Forbes.

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Five years after a U.S.-led force of
20,000 troops invaded this island and restored constitutional rule,
the Haitian people are entering a new and uncertain era.
</P>
<P>
   While crime, insecurity and a crumbling infrastructure continue
to threaten residents, the Haitian government has been virtually
paralyzed for more than two years. Now, the last of the regular
U.S. military presence in the capital is set to end in January,
with the 400 troops replaced by shifts of reservists on short-term
training missions throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   That is yet another blow for a country that has made
dishearteningly little progress despite high expectations _ perhaps
unrealistic _ since the invasion. By the end of this year, police
trainers and human rights monitors from the United Nations and the
Organization of American States are also to leave, although U.N.
officials are seeking to maintain a smaller, ongoing mission.
</P>
<P>
   After Jean-Bertrand Aristide, then a radical Roman Catholic
priest, was elected in 1990 as Haiti's first democratically chosen
president in decades, an army-led coup drove him into exile in
1991. After three years of repression, he was restored to power in
a negotiated settlement backed by a U.S.-led occupation. The
current president, Rene Preval, was his hand-picked successor, but
Aristide, who resigned from the priesthood in 1994, remains Haiti's
leading political figure and is expected to run again next year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military's role in Haiti has gone from ensuring
security to carrying out the kind of work that brings tangible
relief to the residents of the hemisphere's poorest nation _
providing free medical care, repairing wells and building schools.
While thousands of Haitians have benefited from this assistance,
countless more have taken psychological comfort from the mere
presence of the U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, Anes Anis came home from her factory job to
find a U.S. soldier sitting behind his M-60 machine gun atop a
Humvee while another paced the side of her hilly dirt street. She
said she welcomed these silent sentries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We re happy to see them,'' she said. ``If something happens
now, we could call on them. Otherwise, we have nothing at all to
protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers were not there to bring peace to her
neighborhood. They had only come to secure the area while dozens of
U.S. sailors painted a local schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many Haitians had expectations that the intervention would solve
day-to-day problems. Now the departing forces leave behind a nation
that is still trying to create a democratic, functioning state.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian army was disbanded but not disarmed, contributing to
an increase in street and drug crimes. While a new police force
struggles to enforce the law, a dysfunctional judiciary has
hampered its efforts. People and cars crowd the streets in midday,
but few people venture out very early or late, lest they become
targets for bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment has been a trickle. With unemployment
hovering at 60 percent, factory owners have been closing their
doors as their clients shift their orders to nations with equally
cheap labor but more stability.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With regularity, residents in some neighborhoods vent their
frustration and try to get the government's attention by hauling
tires and trash into the street and setting up flaming roadblocks.
It has hardly helped.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government itself has been virtually paralyzed since 1997
while Preval fought with his opposition in Parliament over his
choice for prime minister. He finally named a de facto prime
minister earlier this year when the Parliament's term ended,
leaving the nation without a functioning legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the standoff, the government failed to pass either a
budget or laws that would have brought $500 million in
international aid to shore up its crumbling infrastructure and
reduce suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative elections have been pushed back from December of
this year to March 19, prompting fears of campaign fraud or
violence. International observers and diplomats have accused
Aristide's supporters of trying to wrest control of the civilian
police force to use it for their political advantage. Recently, a
daylong voter education event sponsored by the national electoral
council was disrupted by hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   The governmental paralysis has disappointed both Haitians and
other countries, which are coming to realize that they also had
unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of dictatorship under Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and
his son, Jean-Claude, left the country with scant experience with
democratic rule. Now, as Haiti continues the transition to
democracy that it began when the Duvalier regime ended in 1986,
other nations say they are willing to help but that the Haitian
people must take the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is for Haitians to come together and
address their past so they can come up with answers that will help
them create their future,'' said the U.S. ambassador in Haiti,
Timothy Carney. ``The political culture has got to change.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The years since the intervention have brought some improvements.
The United States, working through private contractors and
nongovernmental organizations, has provided $300 million for health
care, education and judicial reform. Inflation has been reduced to
single-digit figures, and the currency is stable.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the leaders of a coup that had ousted Aristide
and ushered in years of repression were removed. Diplomats say the
nation's human rights record has improved and individual freedoms
have grown.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the Haitian National Police from 5,300 mostly
raw recruits has also been seen as a positive development, although
the force is hampered by insufficient resources and inexperienced
mid-level commanders. Since its inception three years ago, more
than 800 officers have been dismissed for offenses ranging from
corruption to human rights violations. Yet even that is seen as
evidence that it is willing to ensure its integrity by rooting out
malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``On the human rights side, clearly a number of things have
improved,'' said Colin Granderson, the executive director of the
United Nations/Organization of American States International
Civilian Mission in Haiti. ``There is an emphasis on
accountability, which was unheard of before. Serious human rights
violations are no longer a policy of the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   But with every advance there have been setbacks that make Haiti,
in the words of one diplomat, ``a country of push-pull doors.''
While the police have been trying to enforce the law, they have
been stymied by an inept and backlogged judiciary: 80 percent of
all Haitian prisoners are awaiting trial. A school supported by
international donors has been training judges, and the government
recently increased judges' salaries to make them less susceptible
to bribes. But some feel the reforms did not address the
fundamental flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we're still functioning with an old justice
system we inherited from the days of the military dictatorship,''
said Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis.
</P>
<P>
   He added that despite the obstacles, the administration was able
to carry out some programs. Land reform has reduced supply costs
for farmers. Cooperatives have been established, he said. And while
the pace has been slow, the government is privatizing the
operations of ports and the airport.
</P>
<P>
   But much more could have been accomplished had it not been for
the paralysis that overtook the government shortly after the 1997
Parliamentary elections. Members of the opposition, the
Organization of People In Struggle, accused the governing Lavalas
Party of fraud. For two years, they blocked Preval's choice for
prime minister, and accomplished little else, said diplomats and
international officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 8 million people here and they're running out of
time and space,'' said one diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock has frozed $500 million in loans from the
Interamerican Development Bank, the World Bank, and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that money is going to be lost,'' Granderson said.
``That money is not going to be held for Haitians until they make
up their minds that they're ready to use it. The window is
closing.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue felt by donors is shared by ordinary Haitians.
Craters filled with mud and putrid sewage cover long stretches of
the National Highway that runs past the sprawling slums of Cite
Soleil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the government's problem,'' said Israel Domones, on a
recent day after he hit a hole and the bottom of his tractor
trailer, filled with sacks of flour, fell out, causing a huge
traffic jam. ``The water is deep and I did not see how big the hole
was. The road is stuck. The country is stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans first invaded Haiti in 1915, they stayed long
enough to build up the country's infrastructure. This time, their
focus has been on aid, like the free clinics where hundreds of
Haitian line up for hours to receive medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The military has also built many schools and repaired wells. The
U.S. soldiers speak enthusiastically about their mission, but they
also admit that the nation's impoverished social conditions can
seem overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they need roads or water now, or do they need education?''
said Lt. Comdr. Joseph Larry of the navy, chief engineer for the
American military support group. ``It's a tough nut to crack as to
what Haiti needs more of.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also little time remaining for elections, which are
seen as the only way out of the government's paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are clamoring for elections to take place as soon as
possible so we can get back to a government of parliamentary
normalcy,'' Alexis said. ``Democracy cannot be decreed, it can only
be built.''
</P>
<P>
   But with only four months to go, the logistical obstacles are
daunting in a country where phone lines, electricity and other
necessities for administrative efficiency are unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of setting up of 3,500 polling places, regional and
local electoral offices and a voter registration system is also
running up against time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and Haitians fear that the elections could be
delayed again, possibly combined with the presidential elections
scheduled for next November. They say supporters of Aristide, who
was succeeded by Preval when his last term was up, favor that
scenario, hoping to use his coattails to win seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and international observers also worry about reports
of intimidation by Aristide supporters and reports they they are
trying to gain control of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Yvon Neptune, a spokesman for Aristide's party, denied those
accusations. ``We hope the election schedule is going to be kept,''
he said. ``We also hope the conditions will be created so that
voters will feel comfortable to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake in the coming elections, and not just the
return of a functioning, daily government. The country is at a
point where it is being urged to find a national consensus on how
government can work for all sectors of Haitian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government itself has been the situation, in their total
lack of management, vision and honesty,'' said Georges Sassine, an
apparel factory owner and vice president of the Association of
Haitian Industries. ``You feel there are 200 different governments
and within each branch you have sub-branches and they all go their
separate ways. I'm not going to call it anarchy. Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke inside his vast, empty factory, where he had just laid
off 260 workers. While the government has been paralyzed, orders
from the United States dried up. He said that in the last two
months, 22 factories have closed, leaving nearly 5,000 people
jobless. This was not, he said, what he thought the intervention
would have accomplished. Sure, some people have done well,
including those who have taken advantage of governmental inaction
and desperate poverty to make fast money in contraband. But the
majority are still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haiti has not learned there is no individual salvation,'' he
said. ``If you're in a sinking boat and you jump out, are you
really saved? It's either everybody gets saved or nobody does.''

<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Texas Baptists voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to
ignore a 1998 amendment to the Southern Baptist Convention's
confessional statement asking wives to submit to husbands'
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The action came as the moderate-controlled Baptist General
Convention of Texas, which has 2.7 million members in more than
5,000 churches, concluded its annual two-day meeting at the El Paso
Civic Center. The vote by delegates supported the denomination's
1963 Baptist Faith and Message, a statement of commonly held
beliefs, and brought quick criticism from national convention
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as Texas Baptist leaders continued sniping at the
conservative-controlled Southern Baptist Convention. Moderates and
conservatives have been embroiled in a 20-year dispute over the
nature and interpretation of Scriptures. It also comes as a
national convention committee is reviewing the Baptist Faith and
Message for updating or changes.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also approved motions for especially appointed study
committees to examine the theological positions and philosophies of
the national convention, its seminaries and mission sending
agencies, such as the International Missions Board and the North
American Missions Board.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 family amendment to the confessional statement sparked
national controversy with several churches leaving the 15.7
million-member national convention because it asked wives to submit
to husbands. Conservatives said the amendment was based on the
Bible and the apostle Paul's teachings in his letter to the
Ephesians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible doesn't teach the husband is a general and the wife
is a private,'' said Charles Wade, the state convention's
designated executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly oppose the concept that women are inferior to or
in any way subject to males in their understanding of their
priesthood before God,'' said Phil Strickland, chairman of the
Texas convention's Christian Life Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Clyde Glazener of Fort Worth, newly elected president
of the state convention, described the 1998 amendment as
``Neanderthal.'' Glazener said the amendment emphasized
subservience by women.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to support only the 1963 statement was made by the
Rev. Bob Newell, pastor of Houston's Memorial Drive Baptist Church.
Newell said the vote ``was a statement in favor of our traditional
Baptist consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Newell said Paul's letter to the Ephesians included a call for
mutual submission between husbands and wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening now is the narrowing of the Baptist Faith
and Message and a misreading and misapplication of the
Scriptures,'' said the Rev. Phil Lineberger of Williams Trace
Baptist Church in Sugar Land, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Wade said the vote was sending a message to national convention
leaders that Texas Baptists ``are not pleased to hear of further
amendments.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all delegates voted in favor of Newell's motion. ``I believe
this motion was another statment of disunity with the national
convention,'' said the Rev. Tom Roberson of Longview.
</P>
<P>
   The approval brought quick reaction from national convention
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motion adopted by the BGCT is an intentional rejection of
a clear teaching of the Bible,'' said R. Albert Mohler Jr.,
president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kentucky.
``This is another lamentable sign of the determination of some
Texas Baptist leaders to alienate Texas Baptists from the Southern
Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language used by the new president of the Texas convention
is reprehensible and beneath the dignity of any Christian
minister,'' Moeller said. ``This is a deliberate act of
denominational grandstanding and I believe grass-roots Texas
Baptists will recognize it as such.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their problem is not with the Southern Baptist Convention,''
Mohler said. ``It is with the apostle Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Land, president of the national convention's Ethics and
Religious Liberty Commission, was equally critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baptist Faith and Message article on the family is an
accurate reflection and restatement of the scriptural teaching on
marriage,'' Land said. ``The husband is always to place his wife's
needs above his own and the wife is to willingly submit to the
sacrificial love of such a godly husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The successful motion to appoint study committees of national
convention seminaries and missions agencies will provide an
opportunity to state officials to examine the views of national
leaders, Wade said.

 &HT;    Small profit a ray of light for stumbling Sunbeam
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Sunbeam Corp. reported its second straight
quarter of modest operating profit and sales of more than $600
million. But the company still is losing money and missing
analysts' estimates _ and sparring with with securities regulators
who are investigating Sunbeam's accounting practices under deposed
Chairman and Chief Executive Al Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   The Boca Raton-based company, the largest U.S. maker of small
appliances, said Tuesday it scratched out an operating profit of $4
million for the three months ended Sept. 30. But interest expenses,
income taxes on foreign earnings and costs from Dunlap's
deal-making more than consumed the profit. The company posted a net
loss of $47 million, or 47 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's an improvement over the third quarter of 1998,
when the company lost $189 million, or $1.88 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the brighter side, its sales performance has improved _
$601 million this year compared to $496 million for the same
quarter last year, a 21 percent increase. Coupled with its $660
million in sales for the three months ended June 30, that's two
straight quarters of decent sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had good news on the operating front,'' said analyst Nick
Heymann of Prudential Securities in New York. ``What we are waiting
for is to see what steps (Sunbeam) takes to get out of intensive
care and back into the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The market was pleased with the numbers. Sunbeam stock (NYSE:
SOC) closed Tuesday at $5.81, up $1.31 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam has bled red ink in six consecutive quarters _ and in
seven of the past eight. And it's still not meeting analysts'
modest expectations. Wall Street was expecting a loss of 30 cents a
share, according to Zach's research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Through a company spokeswoman, Sunbeam Chief Executive Jerry
Levin cautioned investors about weighing the company's results, a
loss of 47 cents a share, against Wall Street's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunbeam has not been giving guidance, and what's out there by
analysts represents guessing,'' the spokeswoman said. Levin ``plans
a more active dialogue with analysts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probably would like
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam says in a filing to the SEC that it won't turn over
certain documents sought by the agency's investigators. The SEC
began investigating Sunbeam's accounting in July 1998, after Dunlap
was fired and after the company's auditors refused to sign off on
Sunbeam's financial results, which were part of an SEC registration
statement for debentures.
</P>
<P>
   The company spokeswoman said Sunbeam is refusing to hand over a
report by its law firm on the company's accounting, citing
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sunbeam also announced Tuesday that it intends to
sell its Eastpak unit in Massachusetts for $200 million and use the
money to pay down some of its $2.3 billion in debt. Eastpak, which
makes backpacks, doesn't fit into Sunbeam's plans, the company
said. It sales are through sporting good stores and college
bookstores; other Sunbeam products are sold in department and
discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the SEC investigation, the company faces two
major hurdles, according to analyst Heymann: how it deals with a
1998 shareholders lawsuit over doctored financial results and
whether it is capable of paying off its loans, starting next April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are two critical drawbridges,'' Heymann said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit and the loans could drain the company's cash.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam said it would use the money it receives in a deal for
Eastpak to pay down debt, but the sale has a downside, Heymann
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're selling from a position of distress, and some people
would say that (Eastpak) is one of your best assets. This company
is moving toward one that sells men's outdoor products,'' Heymann
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company acknowledges the outdoor market is strong, but says
its focus is on families and not on men only.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam, whose products include Sunbeam and Oster kitchen
appliances, Mr. Coffee machines, Coleman camping gear and First
Alert smoke alarms, said its Coleman and Powermate units, which
make power generators, had a strong third quarter because of
customer concerns about the weather and the so-called Y2K bug.

7 STUDENTS CHARGED IN A BRAWL THAT DIVIDES DECATUR, ILL. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It started as a melee among high school students in
the bleachers at a football game in the small Illinois city of
Decatur. But it has grown into a bitter debate over race and rules,
drawing in the likes of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Gov. George
Ryan. And it has closed high schools for two consecutive days and
resulted in charges against students.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the disagreement is whether school officials were
justified in handing down two-year expulsions to seven students,
all of them black, who were involved in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   The students, whose lawyer has threatened to file a federal
lawsuit against the school district, rejected an offer by the
school board early Tuesday to reduce the expulsions to one year,
with an option to attend an alternative school for troubled
students immediately. The students, who had not been arrested after
the fracas, were charged Tuesday with criminal behavior in what
school officials have described as a riot.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called the arrests another ``attack on the students,''
saying the students were already being punished too harshly by the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Arndt, the Decatur school superintendent, has made it
clear that the local authorities resent Jackson's interference.
Arndt ordered the city's three public high schools _ MacArthur,
Eisenhower and Decatur _ closed on Monday when Jackson planned a
protest march. The superintendent said he feared that the march
would result in a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rev. Jackson has done a lot of wonderful things for our
country, but I think he's really picked the wrong case here,''
Arndt said. ``This is not Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Decatur, a city of about 83,000 people in central
Illinois, have an enrollment that is about 35 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Around this blue-collar city, views about the standoff were
divided largely along racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   Cleopatra Sibley, who is black, described Decatur as a ``very
prejudiced town'' that needed someone like Jackson to bring
unfairness to light. If the students involved in the fight had been
white, she said, ``nothing would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Mehr, 17, a white student, said it was ridiculous to make
the incident a racial matter. ``No matter what color you are, you
can't get in a fight in the middle of a crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say the students involved in the fighting were
known as truants. Arndt described three of them as ``third-year
freshmen,'' and said the seven students, among them, had missed 350
days of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If education were such a high priority for these students,''
Arndt said, ``why wouldn't they have gone to school?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who led a rally at a church here on Monday night, said
the punishment was disproportionate for an incident that involved
no serious injuries. ``A fistfight is different from a knife fight
is different from a gunfight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called for the schools to allow the students to return
and submit to counseling, and said it was the obligation of
education officials to try to save troubled young men from going
further astray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do these 17-year-old youths go when they're left out of
school uncounseled?'' he said. ``They can't graduate, they can't go
to college, they can't get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Arndt said the school board would stick by its offer to allow
the students to return immediately to an alternative school.
``Hopefully, they'll avail themselves of that opportunity,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, the governor, had waived certain education requirements so
that the expelled students could attend an alternative school. A
spokesman for the governor, Dennis Culloton, said Ryan had left
Decatur after getting both sides together, saying there was little
more that he could do.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the students involved in the fighting, which occurred on
Sept. 17, were charged with mob action, a felony. One was also
charged with battery and resisting a police officer. The other
three were charged as juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the incident, taken by a parent at the football
game, was presented to reporters Tuesday by school officials.
</P>
<P>
   It showed a melee that swept through one end of the grandstands,
with kicking and punching, as some of the fighters tumbled over the
rails. A woman is shown trying to shield two young children from
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The game was stopped, as players stood and gawked at the
fighting in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bohem, the principal at MacArthur High School who attended
the game, described it as a riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared for the safety of our people _ my parents, my
students,'' he said, referring to the crowd in the bleachers. ``You
had people pushed through bars, people covering little children so
they wouldn't get hurt. It was violent.''

WITH 500 MINERS AS A CHORUS, BYRD ATTACKS COURT RULING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Robert C. Byrd rallied more than 500 coal
miners outside the Capitol on Tuesday, complaining that the White
House had reneged on support of his attempt to roll back a judicial
decision against the strip mining of mountaintops in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coal turns on the lights in that Capitol!'' the West Virginia
Democrat boomed forth, drawing cheers as he gestured at the
building and, with Congress nearing adjournment, urged an 11th-hour
override of the mountaintop mining decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely we can find a way to protect the environment without
destroying your jobs,'' the senator said in a stem-winding speech
he offered as the son of a coal miner and the husband of a coal
miner's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Charles H. Haden II of the U.S. District Court in
Charleston, W.Va., ruled last month that the state had for years
violated federal mining and clean-water laws by permitting the
blockage of hundreds of miles of vital valley streams with the
waste from the mining of dynamited mountaintops. Byrd and other
West Virginia officials, warning that the ruling could be ruinous
to the state's economy, have sought to block it in the closing days
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as the miners cheered outside, Sen. Larry E. Craig,
R-Idaho, said inside the Capitol that he was finding common cause
with Byrd on disparate mining issues.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt was being made to write into the $15 billion
appropriations bill for the Interior Department some provisions to
spare West Virginia the mountaintop ruling and also to ease
environmental standards out West and allow the dumping of thousands
of tons of mining waste onto federal and Indian land, according to
Craig, a sponsor of the Western mining proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics makes strange bedpersons,'' Craig declared amid the
rush to end the session, a hectic welter of legislative trading and
haggling, threats and sales pitches worthy of a flea market. ``I
would not be uncomfortable in Bob Byrd's bed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an open question whether the attempt at joining the
mining issues would make it into law. The final legislation was
being hurriedly written behind the scenes Tuesday evening for
action in a House-Senate conference committee, but the House
version of the Interior bill carried none of the mining easements.
Further, while the Clinton administration has declined thus far to
say how it would treat a bill that included the Byrd amendment on
West Virginia, it has firmly threatened to veto appropriations
measures carrying Republican-sponsored riders that it considers
anti-environmental.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Byrd beamed at the rally as he heard leaders from the AFL-CIO
and a dozen unions pledge solidarity with the coal miners. He said
he hoped the labor showing would cause second thoughts at the White
House, which has been heavily lobbied by environmentalists to
endorse the court ruling as a landmark protection of the Clean
Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day they expressed support for my amendment, the next day
it was a 180-degree turn, they were opposed to it,'' the senator
said of the administration. ``I hope they'll listen to reason. The
jobs of many people are involved here.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the crowd, miners vowed retribution on Vice President Al
Gore's presidential run if he supported the court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to shut our job plumb down, going to put us out of
work,'' Mark Davis, a 38-year-old mountaintop strip miner, said of
the ruling. ``The environmental stuff is an exaggeration; I hunt
right out my front door'' in Pineville, W.Va., and run a bulldozer
in strip-mining nearby mountaintops. ``We put the mountain back as
we go along. We take the dozers and smooth it up, grass and tree it
up.''

PICASSO NUDE BRINGS $45.1 MILLION AT CHRISTIE'S AUCTION

<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one in the audience at Christie's in New York
flinched when a Monet ``Waterlilies'' sold for $22.5 million on
Monday night. Or when a Pissarro cityscape fetched more than twice
its estimate. Or when a London dealer snapped up five paintings,
presumably for stock, and paid well above the high estimate on
every lot.
</P>
<P>
   All of that happened before Picasso's ``Nude on a Black
Armchair,'' a 1932 portrait of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter
asleep with her arms raised over her head, was sold Tuesday night
for $45.1 million, just over the high end of Christie's pre-sale
estimate of $35 million to $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   So blase have art buyers become that the high prices paid for
less-than-first-rate works seemed like business as usual at
Christie's, whose sales of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art
on Monday night and 20th-century art Tuesday night were the first
two rounds in the fall auction season.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 52 works offered on Monday, 48 found buyers; the sale
totaled $88.2 million, well above its low estimate of $79.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   (Tuesday night's sale took place too late for most prices to be
included in this story. Final prices include the auction house's
commission: 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the
balance. Pre-sale estimates do not reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's sale, Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's
in America, described the proceedings as controlled and orderly.
Fifty-four percent of the buyers were Americans, he said, and
several first-time buyers bidding for themselves tried to buy
multimillion-dollar paintings. Sometimes they succeeded; sometimes
they didn't. Surprisingly, Asians accounted for about 4 percent of
the buying, a significant increase from recent seasons.

   Classic Impressionist images were popular on Monday,
particularly the sale's star work, a 1906 Monet from the artist's
``Waterlilies'' series. Five serious bidders drove the price up to
$22.5 million, far above the $15 million estimate. The painting had
a pristine provenance: in 1909, it was acquired from Monet by the
famous Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris, and it had only three owners
before it was put up for sale by an anonymous collector. The buyer
was Simon de Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe,
whose Geneva-based business has been a major force in the market in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which included parts of several well-known
collections, got off to a brisk start with 23 works from the
collection of Akram Ojjeh, a Syrian-born financier and collector
who died in 1991. His widow, Nahed Tala Ojjeh, is selling a variety
of Old Master, Orientalist and 19th-century French paintings and
French furniture in a series of sales this fall in New York, London
and Monaco. On Monday night, Christie's was selling their
Impressionist and post-Impressionist art.
</P>
<P>
   The second-highest price in the sale was paid for van Gogh's
``Bridge at Trinquetaille,'' an 1888 depiction of an iron bridge
across the Rhone at Arles, painted with his signature heavy brush
stroke. Estimated at $20 million, it sold for $15.4 million. Three
people vied to buy the painting, which sold to an unidentified
telephone bidder. The price may have been well under Christie's
estimate, but Akram Ojjeh bought the painting at Sotheby's in New
York in 1980 for what was then considered a princely sum: $1.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   A more popular though less pricey painting from the Ojjeh
collection was Pissarro's ``Place Saint-Lazare'' (1893), from a
group of 10 paintings and two lithographs showing the hustle and
bustle of carriages, buses, carts and pedestrians navigating the
streets of Paris. Six bidders vied for the painting, estimated at
$1.4 million to $1.8 million. It finally sold to an unidentified
telephone bidder for $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sale also included works being sold by the heirs of the
French industrialist Auguste Pellerin, who died in 1929 having
amassed a collection of more than 100 Cezannes, along with works by
other Impressionist and post-Impressionist masters. For years,
relatives of Pellerin have been selling chunks of the collection at
Sotheby's and Christie's with mixed results; this season, they
chose Christie's. Up for sale on Monday were 12 works by a
selection of artists.
</P>
<P>
   The most important, ``The Orgy,'' an 1870 Cezanne image of a
drunken banquet, became the evening's biggest casualty. Estimated
at $7 million to $10 million, this early work had few takers. No
one was willing to pay more than $5.2 million, and it failed to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a Rodin sculpture from the Pellerin
collection set an auction record for the artist. ``Eve,'' the first
bronze in this series cast by the Rudier Foundry, brought $4.8
million, well over its high estimate of $4 million. Dating from
1897, it was initially conceived as part of an Adam and Eve group
to flank the artist's ``Gates of Hell,'' one cast of which is in
the Rodin Museum in Paris. Pellerin bought it directly from the
artist in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   Manet's ``Polichinelle,'' an 1873 portrait of Punch, of Punch
and Judy, was also up for sale from the collection. Punch was a
central figure in the artist's work in 1873 and 1874. On Monday
night, the painting carried an estimate of $2.5 million to $3.5
million; it sold to an unidentified collector bidding in the
salesroom for $2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   More private collectors were seen bidding for themselves than in
recent seasons. Another change: some dealers were obviously buying
for stock. Richard Green, the London dealer, dispatched his son
Jonathan to the sale on Monday night. The younger Green thought
nothing of paying top dollar for paintings by Corot, Boudin and
Fantin-Latour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectors were not afraid to pay well above the estimates for
the best pictures in the sale,'' said Franck Giraud, director of
19th- and 20th-century art for Christie's worldwide.

 &HT;    Bush bans affirmative action practices in Florida
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (p) Political categories.)

<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Hoping to cripple a petition drive to end
affirmative action, Gov. Jeb Bush Tuesday banned the use of
race-based preferences and racial quotas in state contracting and
admission decisions to all of Florida's public universities.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping policy changes, called the One Florida Initiative,
end decades of affirmative action programs in 15 state agencies,
and call for replacement programs to increase racial and ethnic
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than stamping out affirmative action, Bush said his
initiative ``transcends traditional notions'' of such programs
``without using policies that discriminate or that pit one racial
group against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with changing university admissions policies, the
governor's plan would guarantee high school seniors who graduate in
the top 20 percent of their class entrance to a state college,
beginning next fall.
</P>
<P>
   University Chancellor Adam Herbert, who supports the plan, said
he'll ask for its approval from the Board of Regents in two weeks.
Other parts of Bush's initiative will need legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   While drastically altering polices in more than half of the
state's agencies, Bush's plan would not change the racial
preferences and quotas for hiring women and minorities that are
used by water management districts and county and municipal
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement was embraced by House Speaker John
Thrasher, R-Orange Park, and hailed as a good first step by both
Democrats and the campaign of Ward Connerly, the Californian
leading the effort to pass a constitutional amendment banning
affirmative action throughout Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it is enough to persuade Connerly, a black
Republican businessman, to go back home is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our language provides a constitutional prohibition that solves
the problem forever. Governors can come and go,'' said Herb Harmon,
the Tallahassee political consultant in charge of Connerly's state
organization, the Florida Civil Rights Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said the organization will make a decision next week,
after evaluating Bush's plan and ``its total effect on ending
affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's organization has collected enough signatures for
Attorney General Bob Butterworth to ask the Florida Supreme Court
to review the ballot question. That should happen sometime next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for the campaign would be gathering 400,000
signatures to get an amendment on the ballot, a phase that Harmon
said could cost $1 million. So far, the campaign, which has
received significant financial support from building contractors in
South Florida, has reported raising about $117,000.
</P>
<P>
   But state GOP leaders are hoping Bush's announcement will
diminish Connerly's appeal, fearful that black and other minority
voters drawn to the polls by a referendum could hurt the Republican
Party's chances in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ward Connerly can come or not come,'' said Bush, who
characterized his plan as fulfilling a campaign promise. ``We're
going to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush created his plan with help from Sen. Daryl Jones, D-Miami,
the chairman of the Florida Black Caucus and a leader in the fight
against Connerly's effort. Jones is drafting separate language for
a petition drive to counter the anti-affirmative action proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue here is leadership,'' Jones said of Bush's
initiative. ``I've seen many programs that have had these kind of
goals, but I've never seen the leadership implement them. I hope
the governor has what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, Jones plays a part in meeting that goal: Bush
appointed him chairman of a 17-member task force that will look for
any patterns of inequities in how teachers are assigned and schools
are financed.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Leader Les Miller of Tampa said, ``While I
still have some general concerns about whether the governor will be
able to put this plan into action, I'm encouraged by this initial
step.''
</P>
<P>
   The contracting part of Bush's initiative would create a
statewide registration system to identify all minority vendors and
monitor how much business they do with the state. It would also
make agency procurement heads accountable to his office, not their
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said, until we came up with something better to
replace affirmative action, my support was for it. We have done
that with the governor's new initiative, and I embrace it,'' said
Department of Labor Secretary Mary Hooks. A former West Palm Beach
city commissioner, Hooks is a black Democrat who supported Bush
early in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would move the office of minority business advocacy
and assistance from her agency to the Department of Management
Services, a move Hooks said she initially suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The education component of Bush's initiative would eliminate
overtly race-based admissions policies at the state's 10
universities, as well, and replace them with criteria designed to
meet the same objective but without mentioning race.
</P>
<P>
   The state schools now can admit students who fall short of the
regular admissions criteria by considering the student's race and
ethnicity. Bush would replace that with a program to give automatic
state university admission to the top fifth of every high school's
graduating class _ both top-performing schools in predominantly
white suburbs as well as badly performing schools in poor, mainly
minority neighborhoods. Students in that top 20 percent would
receive priority when applying for need-based financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Universities would also be allowed to use factors such as
poverty and whether an applicant would be the first in the family
to go to college that often correlate with race.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the plan's goals are laudable, said Democratic Party
spokesman Tony Welch. But ``you don't pass a test because of a
press conference,'' he said. ``The governor said, 'Watch what I
do.' And we'll be watching.''

FORMER XEROX OFFICER GETS TOP AVIS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Addison Barry Rand walked away from a 31-year
career with Xerox last year, he promised himself two things: one,
that he would take his wife, Donna, and their two children on some
long-overdue vacations, and two, that he would land a job heading a
Fortune 500 company.
</P>
<P>
   Rand kept his word on both counts. Since last November, he has
taken his family sightseeing in England, Morocco and the Caribbean,
and he has played golf all over the United States; and on Tuesday,
he was named chairman and chief executive of Avis Rent A Car Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A copier guy running a car rental company?
</P>
<P>
   The idea does not faze Rand, who had been executive vice
president for worldwide operations when he left Xerox. As he sees
it, he helped Xerox move from a copier company with little
competition to a document-processing company that competes fiercely
in a multicompany arena. And now he can help Avis expand from the
rental car company it is to the transportation services company it
wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is managing change, not products, and I've always
been a change agent,'' Rand said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a poetic justice in Rand's landing at Avis. Rand, 55,
who was Xerox's highest-ranking black executive, was quite clear
about why he left Xerox: He wanted to run a company, and when Xerox
hired G. Richard Thoman away from IBM in 1997 as the heir apparent
to Xerox's chief, Paul A. Allaire, Rand knew he would have to go
elsewhere to be a chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is being superimposed on executives who had expected to
run Avis. In fact, just three months ago, Avis, which had been
seeking a new chief executive since R. Craig Hoenshell resigned
last December, said it would not fill the job after all.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Avis said it would let a triumvirate run the company:
Kevin M. Sheehan, president for corporate and business affairs; F.
Robert Salerno, president of the rental car unit; and Mark E.
Miller, president of the vehicle management services unit.
</P>
<P>
   The nucleus of that unit is the PHH Vehicle Management Services
Corp., the huge fleet management company that Avis bought in June
and expects will help it build a big business in buying, deploying
and maintaining corporate fleets of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P. Holmes, a vice chairman of the Cendant Corp. _ the
company that sold PHH to Avis _ and a member of Avis' board, said
Rand surfaced more through routine corporate networking than
through any formal search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Chenault called and said I should really meet this bright
guy,'' Holmes said, referring to Kenneth I. Chenault, president of
American Express. ``And it was immediately apparent that Barry's
experience and leadership skills could bring real value to Avis.''
</P>
<P>
   Avis, which had revenue of $1.9 billion in the first nine months
of this year, could use such skills right now. Avis paid Cendant
$1.8 billion in cash and stock for PHH and two other
fleet-management operations in a deal that gave Cendant control of
34 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors were furious. The company's stock, which had hit
nearly $38 right before the acquisition was announced in June, has
slid steadily since then. Shares of Avis fell 43.75 cents Tuesday,
to $18.9375, only about eight times earnings; the average price to
earnings ratio in the car rental business is 11.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avis' biggest issues now are figuring out how PHH fits in and
creating a new face for investors,'' said Meg Saegebarth, an
analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Rand's former colleagues at Xerox are pretty sure he can pull it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry was one of the most loved and respected leaders here,
and not just because he succeeded against the odds as an
African-American,'' said Anne M. Mulcahy, a Xerox executive vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mulcahy still remembers how Rand showed up at one internal
conference in a Superman costume and hired a stunt double to do
fancy acrobatics at another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could make himself the butt of jokes, he could make people
laugh,'' she said. ``He had a way of getting people to their feet
with excitement and spontaneous shouting and applause and
engagement that I've never seen happen anywhere else in corporate
America.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Rand intends to keep living in Stamford, Conn.,
commuting the 50 miles or so to Avis' headquarters in Garden City,
N.Y. Maybe that is another reason that Avis is a good fit. ``I
certainly expect part of my benefit package will be a good car,''
he said. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress cannot settle its financial and political
scores with the White House and abandoned hope Tuesday of
completing its budget and adjourning this week, Republican leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans instead turned to the year's fifth stop-gap
measure, keeping the government running without a formal budget for
another week, until Nov. 17. The House passed it Tuesday night, and
the Senate plans to pass it on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As if to symbolize the lack of progress, the Ohio Clock, the
12-foot-tall timepiece that has stood outside the Senate's central
doorway since 1816, stopped dead at 6:14 p.m. Tuesday night, while
Senate and House Republican leaders met without finding a way out
of their impasse with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Forty days and forty nights past their legal deadline, the end
of the last fiscal year on Sept. 30, they are unable to finish five
spending bills in a way acceptable to the White House, leaving
billions of dollars and a handful of crucial policy issues still
unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   There are still no clear signs that any of the major policy
issues in the spending bills that divide President Clinton and
Congress have been settled.
</P>
<P>
   They include Clinton's $1.4 billion measure to help hire 100,000
teachers and reduce class sizes, his demand that Republicans agree
to pay nearly $1 billion in dues the United States owes the United
Nations and his insistence on changes in measures that favor the
mining, oil and gas industries and dismay environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are not small,'' said Jack Lew, the White House
budget chief, who was summoned back to Congress for a third
straight evening of late-night negotiations that neither side
expected to end in harmony. ``There are lots of loose ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Though both sides agree that the financial issues separating the
two sides are relatively small _ only a few billion dollars in a
$1.75 trillion budget _ the political disputes remain
show-stoppers.
</P>
<P>
   And the players are exhausted. Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin,
the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said
his colleagues were ``falling asleep in the middle of the
conferences, because they're bone tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who is chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said each side was using the budget
battle to grapple for political advantage in the coming struggle
for control of Congress and the White House next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of politics in the issues being raised, and people
are looking long-term at next year's elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, said there were slow, but sure, signs of
some progress in the budget battle.
</P>
<P>
   He said congressional negotiators had agreed to add $625 million
to the $39 billion bill for the Commerce, Justice and State
departments, including most of the money that Clinton sought to
hire officers for local police departments and finance peacekeeping
operations in Kosovo. They were also modifying the measures in the
$14 billion Interior Department bill that offend the
environmentalists, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 billion bill for foreign operations, passed by the
House, remains hung up in the Senate. A bill with $429 million for
the District of Columbia is the only bill ready for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem remains the dispute over hiring teachers, part
of the $314 billion education, labor and health bill, to which
congressional negotiations plan to offer to add more than $1
billion requested by the White House, Republican aides said Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue looms. Almost every one of these compromises makes
the final cost of the bills rise, and the White House has still not
revealed the spending cuts or any other fiscal mechanisms it plans
to offer to offset those costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, show me the money,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the House majority whip. DeLay has insisted that the bottom
line of the spending bills will not require dipping into Social
Security funds or raising taxes in any form.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about closing legal loopholes in the tax code to help pay
for the bills, he said, ``That's raising taxes, if you're the guy
that has the loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership says it will insist on an
across-the-board cut of less than 1 percent in all the spending
bills to hold the line on Social Security. But they have not
emerged as a decisive force in this struggle.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., did not speak out. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., did not lead his fellow
Republicans to close deals with the White House. ``You have to look
at innovative and flexible solutions to reach a conclusion,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   But none are yet in play, all sides said Tuesday night. So
Congress will have to return next week to try to do the only big
job the Constitution commands of it: Pass the spending bills.

<P>
   PICKENS, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Tuesday that
American military veterans were getting less than they deserved
from the country they had served and should be given better health
care and relief from a tangled, tortuous bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers once ordered by their government to stand in the line
of fire should not be asked to stand in line at the nearest
bureaucracy, with hat in hand,'' Bush said in a speech here Tuesday
morning that was as draped in patriotic bunting as the courthouse
where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush did not offer specific remedies, he called for
change and sounded robust notes of gratitude and reverence for all
that veterans had done for their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's veterans today only ask that their government honor
their commitments as they honored theirs,'' Bush said. ``They ask
their interests be protected, as they protected their country's
interest in foreign lands.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his remarks during the first of nearly a half dozen
events involving veterans that are on his schedule in South
Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan and Ohio this week, and the
sustained theme reflected more than the approach of Veterans Day on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It also illustrated Bush's desire to compete for the support of
a set of voters to whom his chief rival for the Republican
presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, has special
appeal. McCain was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, a harrowing
experience at the center of his best-selling autobiography, ``Faith
of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's military experience, which also came during the Vietnam
War, was confined to a stint as a fighter pilot with the Texas Air
National Guard, a slot that pretty much guaranteed that he would
not be sent into combat overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In informal comments after his speech at the courthouse, Bush
praised McCain for his character and his history of service but
described himself as more fit to lead the nation and oversee its
military and its commitments abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think voters are going to say I'd be a better commander in
chief because I've had chief executive experience,'' Bush said,
referring to his nearly six years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's credentials on foreign policy came into question last
week after the widespread broadcast of a television interview that
showed him failing, in a pop quiz, to answer correctly three of
four questions about the leaders of three foreign countries and a
Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeatedly made a joke of that performance on Tuesday.
Outside a restaurant in Easley, S.C., he said that as he was
leaving home, his wife, Laura, told him, ``Don't get out there and
try to show off, naming all those leaders in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in Jacksonville, Fla., Bush said he thought the
fallout from the test was positive, apparently referring to his
straightforward acknowledgment about what he did and did not know.
He had said: ``I think a lot of Americans are saying, `You know
something? I kind of respect old George W. I appreciate the way he
handled it.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People interviewed at his stops in South Carolina on Tuesday
said the incident had barely caught their notice. To the extent
that it had, they said they were not concerned about any gaps in
Bush's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing South Carolina as the place to depart from his
standard stump speech and to talk extensively about veterans for
the first time in this campaign, Bush was acknowledging the heavy
concentration of veterans in a state that has an early primary next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain is also concentrating on enlisting support
of veterans here as well as in New Hampshire. On Veterans Day, the
senator will be traveling throughout South Carolina with other
veterans to attend parades and memorial services.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A phalanx of veterans stood beside Bush on Tuesday on the steps
of the Pickens County Courthouse, a building fronted by four tall,
white columns. A high school marching band also fanned out around
him, and in the front yard lay a newly engraved stone memorial to
the county's four Medal of Honor winners.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers hope that veterans will respond to Bush's
promises to increase pay for members of the armed forces and to
spend more in general on the military. Bush reiterated those
pledges Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us resolve never to multiply our missions while cutting
our capabilities,'' Bush said.

RESTAURANT'S ADDED GRATUITY LEADS TO DISCRIMINATION CLAIM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ Charles Thompson was so angry about the
automatic 15 percent tip added to his dinner of sizzling fish and
spring rolls that he called 911.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual in trendy, often pretentious South Beach to
see an automatic gratuity added to one's check. But what made his
blood boil, Thompson told a Miami Beach police officer, was the
reason for the built-in tip.
</P>
<P>
   It was added, he told the officer, because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 40, told the officer that when he asked the owner of
the Thai Toni restaurant why he had been assessed an automatic tip
on his dinner that Oct. 23 evening, he was told, ``Black people
don't tip well.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Florida attorney general, Bob Butterworth, filed
a lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court against the owner, Hiromi
Takarada, a well-known Miami Beach restaurateur whose business has
become a favorite for its duck curry with coconut milk, shrimp soup
and crispy spring rolls. It is one of South Beach's most popular
restaurants, frequented by fashion models, entertainers and the
other beautiful people who live, work and play in the city's Art
Deco District.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks a penalty of up to $10,000 for violating the
state's Unfair Trade Practices Act, and unspecified compensation
for Thompson and his dinner companion, Theresa White. Thompson and
Ms. White have also filed a civil rights complaint with the Florida
Commission on Human Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Takarada could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Kent
Harrison Robbins of Miami, said Tuesday that the case stemmed from
a simple misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all it was,'' Robbins said. ``There was no
discrimination as a matter of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth disagreed. ``In all my years'' of prosecuting
discrimination cases, he said, ``this one is the most flagrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the case has yet to be heard by a judge, the
discrimination charges have already cost the restaurant its
membership in the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant will not be mentioned in the bureau's future
vacation planners and hotel and restaurant guides, and it has been
dropped from the organization's Web site, said the bureau's
president, Bill Talbert.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth said Thompson, who is a travel consultant for
American Express, had dined at the restaurant before and had not
been assessed an automatic tip.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thompson asked a white couple sitting nearby to see
their bill, and found that they had not been assessed a built-in
tip.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, incensed, called 911. In his eyes, he was the victim
of a crime, said Steven Kozlowski, the lawyer who is representing
Thompson and Ms. White.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients were charged extra, merely for the color of their
skin,'' Kozlowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth said that when the police officer arrived, the
officer asked Takarada why the tip had been included in the cost of
the meal. Takarada told the police officer the same thing he told
Thompson, that ``black people don't tip well,'' Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Takarada apparently thought the officer would back him up,
Kozlowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer is now the main witness for the state in its
charge, Kozlowski said.
</P>
<P>
   South Beach restaurants, which get much of their business from
tourists from abroad, often add built-in gratuities for large
parties, and some restaurants add the gratuity to all bills. That
protects restaurant workers from being neglected by foreign
visitors who expect the tip to be included.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth found out about the incident from media coverage,
and filed the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made great strides in this country to make sure that
restaurants, public places, are open to everyone,'' he said. ``This
is like being told to move to the back of the bus all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, though popular with models, is not exorbitantly
priced, and also draws less glamorous people out for a fine meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of ironic,'' Butterworth said. ``This guy has
benefited because of the openness of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, reaction to the lawsuit ranges from anger to
incredulity. Some people here have called it overkill of the
highest order.
</P>
<P>
   But Butterworth does not see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami is such a diverse community, and the minority is the
majority,'' said Butterworth. ``This is something right out of the
rural South, not something from Miami, two months before the year
2000.''

 &UR; DELMONTE  &LR; _ Del Monte Foods Co. is preparing for a slight increase
in year-end sales as shoppers worried about possible Year 2000
computer problems stock up on canned fruits and vegetables. San
Francisco's Del Monte, the country's largest producer of canned
fruits and vegetables, said it may sell 1 million to 2 million more
cases of goods because of Y2K fears, according to the company's
latest quarterly financial statement filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Each case holds from 12 to 48 cans. That's
a lot of green beans and pineapple, but the increase is a sliver of
the 100 million cases of canned food Del Monte sold last year. By

 Cisco Quarterly Revenues Surge 49%  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Cisco Systems Inc. felt some quarterly effect from its numerous
acquisitions, but the company's revenues soared 49 percent as the
No.1 computer networking firm continued to benefit from explosive
growth in Internet traffic.
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges, Cisco earned $839 million (24 cents
per share) for the quarter ended October 30, compared with $561
million (17 cents) from the same period a year earlier. The company
reported revenues of $3.88 billion for the quarter, compared with
$2.67 billion for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The company beat Wall Street estimates of 23 cents per share,
according to First Call /Thomson Financial, and met the ``whisper''
estimate of 24 cents.
</P>
<P>
   However, including one-time charges, Cisco generated less profit
than last year as it absorbed high acquisition costs. Net income
fell 14 percent in the quarter to $438 million (13 cents) from $512
million (15 cents) for the same period last year. The computer
networking company completed the acquisitions of Monterey Networks
and MaxComm Technologies for a combined purchase price of $590
million and took a one-time charge of $381 million as a write-off
of research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco has used acquisitions to grow its business and get
technology that it does not have or does not foresee itself
developing. It has completed more than 30 acquisitions during the
past few years, and officials have said they plan to do at least 20
more in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Cisco said it agreed to buy Aironet Wireless
Communications Inc. for about $800 million in stock. The company's
products let computer users check e-mail and surf the Net
wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   John Chambers, Cisco's CEO, said the growth in the first quarter
was driven by demand from telecommunications companies, which are
buying gear that helps route Internet traffic faster and more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said sales to service providers, such as phone
companies, increased 80 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, which makes gear that links computers and routes and
manages data traffic, has benefited from companies that need to
build state-of-the-art networks to keep up with soaring Internet
usage. As more people opt for high-speed links to the Internet,
companies are turning to Cisco for the plumbing _ routers and
switches _ that direct traffic on the Net and other networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fueling it is the growth of the Internet and Cisco's
leadership in that area,'' Chambers said. ``We had very good
balance ... and we continue to gain market share in almost every
category.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said with the exception of Japan, Cisco's overseas
sales continue to be strong as emerging markets like Latin America
and Asia buy gear from the networking giant.

MERRILL LYNCH HAS TROUBLE PROCESSING TRADING ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just three weeks before its scheduled introduction of an
advanced online stock-trading system, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is
struggling to handle customers' trades the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   For about three hours Tuesday, Merrill Lynch brokers could not
process orders to buy or sell stocks of companies traded on the
NASDAQ Stock Market during that exchange's busiest day ever.
Brokers who entered customers' orders to buy or sell NASDAQ stocks
near the 9:30 a.m. beginning of the trading day in New York did not
find out for two hours or more what prices their customers
received.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, brokers entered orders to sell stocks they
thought they had bought at lower prices earlier in the day, only to
find out later that they had unintentionally sold for less than
they had paid.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Merrill's 14,000 brokers complained that the failure was
the latest of several technical problems the firm has had as it
prepares for the start of the new service, Merrill Lynch Direct on
Dec. 1. The new system, a radical departure for Merrill, the
nation's biggest brokerage house, will allow investors to trade
stocks electronically without the help of a broker for $29.95 a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, brokers reported that the computer workstations they
use to place orders and monitor stock prices and customers'
accounts suffered sporadic failures through most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect you've had pretty significant diversion of
resources'' to ensure on-time introduction of online trading, said
Steve Galbraith, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. Galbraith
said that David Komansky, Merrill's chairman and chief executive,
assured him last week that Merrill would meet the Dec. 1 deadline,
although the system would remain a work in progress after that
date.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman attributed Tuesday's problem to a ``normal,
scheduled, upgrade'' of a mainframe computer. She said it was
unrelated to any other technical problems and would have no effect
on the firm's effort to introduce online trading next month.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman said that the problem affected several thousand
NASDAQ stock trades from about 9:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. Once the
problem was cleared up, she said, all pending trades were executed.
Customers unhappy about the prices they received for the stocks
they bought or sold ``absolutely'' will get the prices they would
have received without the delay, she said.
</P>
<P>
   That will be good news to one Merrill broker who watched in
agony Tuesday as an order to sell a NASDAQ stock lingered on his
computer screen, flashing the word ``sending'' as the stock's price
quickly retraced its morning rise. The stock already had risen more
than $5, or 15 percent, since the broker placed an order to buy
several hundred shares of it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to capture that profit, the broker entered an order to
sell the shares he believed he had bought. He later learned that
the shares had been bought for about $4 more than he expected and
sold for about 25 cents less, turning an apparently profitable
trade into a loser.
</P>
<P>
   That is the type of glitch more commonly associated with online
trading operations, whose systems are more dependent on technology.
The Charles Schwab Corp., the leading electronic brokerage firm,
has suffered through a variety of technical problems in the last
few weeks, ranging from slowdowns of its order-taking systems to a
two-hour failure two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is everybody's site crashes about once a week,''
Galbraith said of online brokerage firms. ``That's actually one of
the risks these traditional firms are taking in going on the
Internet. When you have an outage now, it's really public. When
Schwab crashes, it's all over the Internet.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Security For Kaiser Workers  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Kaiser and the AFL-CIO announced a historic pact yesterday that
gives 60,000 Kaiser workers nationwide, about half of them in
Northern California, a strong package of job security measures to
prevent layoffs.
<P>
   The announcement by Kaiser Chief Executive Officer David
Lawrence and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney is the biggest dividend
so far to emerge from the 2-year-old two-year-old &LR;   &LR; partnership
between the giant HMO and eight unions representing most of
Kaiser's 90,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Though criticized by rival rivals  &LR; labor organizations like the
California Nurses Association, the partnership unions hailed the
pact as proof that peace with Kaiser was best for the rank and
file.
</P>
<P>
   ``This employment security agreement virtually guarantees there
will be no involuntary layoffs, reductions in hours or economic
demotions,'' said Sal Rosselli, president of Service Employees
International Union Local 250 in Oakland, Kaiser's largest single
 &LR; union.
</P>
<P>
   The six-page document spells out in some detail how Kaiser and
its partner unions will look for comparable positions, with the
same hours and pay, for workers whose current jobs get phased out
if Kaiser makes changes at its hospitals or medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement stops short of offering lifetime job guarantee and
leaves Kaiser free to make layoffs by seniority in ``extraordinary
circumstances'' such as the shutdown of an isolated facility or in
the event of ``severe'' financial or membership losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to reassure workers there is a place for them,''
said Kaiser spokeswoman Beverly Hayon.
</P>
<P>
   When Kaiser formed the partnership with the AFL-CIO two years
ago, the two sides promised to settle their differences on the
negotiating table rather than on the picket lines. Part of this
agreement called for rank-and-file rank and file  &LR; members to help
the HMO operate more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser hopes yesterday's job security pact will make union
workers willing participants in such discussions by removing the
fear that changes will cost them jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts say this notion of involving workers in
redesigning health care delivery is novel, but the job protection
language is similar to a pact that already covers 70,000 health
care workers in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Tarpinian, a consultant with Labor Research Associates in
New York, said that 1998 agreement, negotiated by SEIU Local 1199,
guarantees a union member laid off by one hospital the inside track
on any job, open at any of the other 70 hospitals that signed the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpinian said the job security pact has been a powerful tool to
help organize the more than 80 percent of private health care
workers who are not members of any union. The New York agreement,
for instance, was announced on the eve of a union election in which
1,000 hospital workers in upstate New York narrowly approved a
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave the union the swing vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where most Kaiser workers are employed, the job
security pact is integral to an SEIU strategy to focus on
organizing new hospitals unions, rather than fighting Kaiser, which
is already heavily unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Even CNA, which has never joined the Kaiser partnership, had
kind words for the job security pact. ``This is positive that
people are guaranteed employment,'' said Jim Ryder, who represents
8,600 CNA nurses who work for Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryder said CNA continues to think it is better to negotiate
job security through collective bargaining rather than partnership
agreements.

 Venture Capital's Hot Net Game  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The venture capital game is looking a lot like a basketball game
these days with many investors shooting for nothing but Net.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the online times, 439 Bay Area Internet-related
companies got financing from VC funds in the first nine months of
this year, compared to 357 during all of 1998, according to
VentureOne, a San Francisco venture capital research firm. These
startups raised a combined $5.5 billion _ double the total raised
in all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past quarter alone, 250 Bay Area companies received a
record $3.5 billion in private equity financing from venture funds
and their institutional partners. That was about 40 percent more
than was raised in the previous quarter and triple what was raised
in the like quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 70 percent of the latest deals and dollars ``involved
hardware, software and services to support the Internet,''
according to VentureOne Research Vice President Jean Yaremchuk.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest private financing of any U.S. company involved
Webvan, the Foster City online grocery delivery  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; c,12p2  &LR; service that went public last week and raised $275 million
in the past quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was RealNames, a San Carlos company that is
developing an Internet service that lets users enter plain English
keywords instead of the formal URL Web address. It raised $70.55
million.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, San Francisco's Petopia.com, which is fighting a pack
of companies to become top dog in the online pet food and supply
market, raised $66 million from corporate investors.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, venture capital financing was moving at a
record-setting pace the past quarter. There were 751 VC deals,
about a third more than the like quarter last year. The total $8.6
billion raised was 14 percent ahead of the previous quarter and 140
percent higher than last year's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With San Francisco and Silicon Valley the center of Internet
innovation, Bay Area startups accounted for a third of all U.S. VC
deals in the past quarter and better than 40 percent of the
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital firms are placing increasingly large bets on
Internet companies, especially ones vying to become the next
Amazon.com in their retailing niche. The median investment in
Internet companies jumped to $9 million in the past quarter from $5
million a year ago, according to VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VC10 (77756 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The reason is simple. It is extremely costly to build a national
delivery network and turn a brand into a household name. (Webvan,
for example, plans to spend close to $750 million to build up to 26
distribution centers.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other large investments by venture capital firms
flowed to information technology and retailing companies with a
strong Internet component.
</P>
<P>
   The exception: USI Holdings, the largest Bay Area deal after
Webvan and the fourth-largest national financing. The San Francisco
insurance brokerage, which has acquired more than 100 independent
insurance brokers in five years, raised $125 million to continue
its expansion campaign. (It already says it is the world's
sixth-largest insurance brokerage.)
</P>
<P>
   VCs and their pension fund and other institutional partners are
not the only ones pouring money into startup companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy individual investors, known as angels, are investing
hundreds of millions of dollars into local startups both
individually and by participating in organizations like Band of
Angels in Palo Alto and the $100 million Angel Investors Fund in
Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Startups now require larger amounts of money to get to market
quickly, and the first investment by venture capital firms is often
$5 million,'' said David West, a Los Altos management consultant
and angel investor. ``Fortunately, angel investors are filling the
`seed' investment hole between $500,000 and $3 million to $5
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Big companies such as Cisco Systems, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and
Microsoft also have set up large funds of their own to invest in
promising concepts. The corporations often have the expertise to
identify hot prospects and want to hit financial jackpots outside
their core businesses. They also see their startup stakes as a way
to keep tabs on important technological discoveries and develop
valuable partners.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tracking investments by VC firms in the past
quarter, VentureOne tracked nine corporate deals worth $330
million. That was more than the $203 million total that corporate
investors pumped into 27 local deals all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of VC10 (77756 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  High-tech companies are not the only ones investing in startups.
So are consumer products companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, France's Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton joined Petco
Animal Supplies in investing $66 million in San Francisco's Petopia
last July. The San Francisco company is vying to become the leading
online pet products retailer, forum for expert advice and community
of pet lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Like other dot-com companies, Petopia is a utopia for the pets
of employees. Its headquarters features a dog park where cable TV
show ``Main Floor'' filmed a holiday pet party this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the past quarter, a bunch of other local startups received
corporate cash infusions. Replay Networks, a Mountain View maker of
products to personalize TV viewing, raised $57 million from Time
Warner, Disney and two VC firms. Della &AMP; James, a San Francisco
online wedding gift registry, raised $45 million from Amazon.com,
Neiman-Marcus, Williams-Sonoma and Crate &AMP; Barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the torrid pace of Internet investing, no slowdown
appears imminent. Redpoint Ventures, the Menlo Park firm formed by
the partners of Brentwood Venture Capital and Institutional Venture
Partners two months ago, announced on Monday that it has raised
more than $600 million to invest in new Internet and TV
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   x Three weeks ago, Convergence Partners of Menlo Park announced
a new $125 million fund to focus just on the business-to-business
e-commerce market. (Some expect this ``B2B'' market to reach $1.5
trillion and be 10 times the size of the business-to-consumer
market in five years.)
</P>
<P>
   uncx ``Without question, more money is going to more companies
in the Internet area,'' said Gill Cogan, general partner of Weiss,
Peck &AMP; Greer in San Francisco, which has raised about $1 billion
and specializes in Internet infrastructure companies. He noted that
7 of the 10 most successful initial public offerings this year were
companies that increase ``the bandwidth'' (capacity and speed) of
data networks and their reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Cogan added that ``Most companies will have to have some kind of
Net-related strategy, or competition will give them a very
difficult time.'' But he acknowledged there are risks, especially
in the increasing crowded online retail sector.
</P>
<P>
   Just as there was a shakeout in the early 1980s when more than
50 Winchester 51/4-inch disk-drive companies were going after the
same market, Cogan figures there could be consolidation. While
there's room for a few successful online companies in pet supply,
grocery delivery and other niches, he said, ``I doubt you'll find
10.''

 GROW A BUSINESS/PETER SINTON  &HT;     Lucky Time to Be Late Paying Payroll Taxes 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: My company did not pay all employee payroll taxes on time and
now we are facing an IRS penalty. Are there ways to get around this
or get it reduced?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You might be in luck. For payroll deposits made after January 18
of this year, a new law allows you to recalculate penalties on
missed payroll deposits in a way most advantageous to you rather
than to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS automatically applies payments to the oldest outstanding
payroll tax liability of a business. That means if an employer
doesn't make up for an initial underpayment, subsequent deposits
also will be insufficient and will be assessed penalties. As a
result of this ``snowball effect,'' IRS spokesman Jesse Weller
said, a single underpayment can lead to ``multiple penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact on small businesses, which are usually the ones
scrambling to make payroll, can be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS will send more than 3 million deposit penalty notices to
businesses this year. The average penalty is about $1,000. But in
91 percent of the cases, businesses will be overpenalized because
of the traditional IRS assessment method, according to
TaxPenalty.com.
</P>
<P>
   This relatively new Web site, started by a former IRS executive
and tax experts at TimeValue Software in Irvine (Orange County),
offers a quick, easy and often free way to recalculate payroll tax
penalties for businesses of all sizes. Under the new law,
businesses can designate payroll deposit payments for the periods
for which they really apply rather than having them used to correct
earlier underdeposits. TimeValue President Michael Applegate says
about 500 users have utilized the new service (www.taxpenalty.com)
since June, and 9 out of 10 have saved an average of about $1,000
each, or 43 percent of their assessed penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your business has made no payroll deposits at all, we can't
help you,'' Applegate notes. But if a business has made some
deposits, TaxPenalty.com's computer program can run about 100
different calculations to figure the lowest penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Results are forwarded to the customer within 24 hours by e-mail.
Additional documentation needed for the IRS is provided free to
businesses that save less than $500. Only businesses that save more
than $500 pay a $49 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate figures businesses could save $1 billion a year or
more by recalculating deposit penalties.
</P>
<P>
   (A penalty can apply to any business that has at least one
employee. Amounts withheld from employees' paychecks must be
deposited regularly with the Treasury. If a deposit is late, the
IRS sends out a penalty notice. Penalties range from 2 percent to
10 percent of the unpaid amount depending on the number of days
late within the quarter and an additional 5 percent if paid after
getting a penalty notice for nonpayment.)
</P>
<P>
   The TaxPenalty.com service is great, says Oakland CPA Larry
Kuesel. But there's a problem. The IRS is not yet able to make the
corrections speedily.
</P>
<P>
   Kuesel says one of his clients deserves a $780 refund but it
took the IRS 45 days just to answer his letter about the case. IRS
agents can make payroll deposit corrections over the telephone, but
just one transaction per quarter. That does little good, since most
corrections involve multiple deposits, according to Kuesel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Retirement Plans
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1999, I worked through June as a full-time employee for a
company and contributed 10 percent of my salary to a 401(k) 401-k &LR; 
 &LR; (about $4,000 for six months). I am also planning to contribute
$2,000 to a nondeductible IRA. May I also contribute to a Keogh
plan Plan  &LR; for consulting work completed July through September? If
I earned $4,000 in consulting fees, may I contribute the entire
amount to a Keogh plan?  &QL; 
A: Contributions to a Keogh plan are limited to specific percentage
of the ``net earnings from self-employment,'' according to CPA
Craig Malmgren of Lautze &AMP; Lautze Accountancy in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, you would establish a profit-sharing Keogh plan
where the maximum contribution is 15 percent of net earnings. (It
actually works out to be about 13 percent because the contribution
itself has to be subtracted from net earnings.) Therefore, can can
shelter only about $520 of your $4,000 in of &LR;   &LR; consulting fees in a
Keogh account.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an IRA account, a Keogh retirement account must be
established before December 31, though it can be funded after the
end of the year but before the due date of the tax return
(including extensions). In addition, instead of making a $2,000
contribution to a nondeductible IRA, Malmgren suggests you consider
contributing it to a Roth IRA instead (if you meet the income
requirements). The advantage is that the earnings grow tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Reader Comments
</P>
<P>
   Tax consultant Larry Jacobs of Jacobs &AMP; Montgomery in Oakland
disagrees with CPA Chris Yahng's recommendation of a SEP last week
for a self-employed individual last week. He notes you can put more
money in a Keogh than a Simplified Employee Pension (actually about
19 percent versus 13 percent) and ``the only additional paperwork
is an annual one-page 5500EZ form that can be completed in about 90
seconds and only required when plan assets total more than
$100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reader, Barbara Turner, points out that a number of
financial institutions including mutual funds will set up SEP
accounts, not just stockbrokers.

 Del Monte Planning on Y2K Cornucopia  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Del Monte Foods Co. is preparing for a slight increase in year-end
sales as shoppers worried about possible Year 2000 computer
problems stock up on canned fruits and vegetables.
<P>
   San Francisco's Del Monte, the country's largest producer of
canned fruits and vegetables, said it may sell 1 million to 2
million more cases of goods because of Y2K fears, according to the
company's latest quarterly financial statement filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Each case holds from 12 to 48
cans. That's a lot of green beans and pineapple, but the increase
is a sliver of the 100 million cases of canned food Del Monte sold
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Del Monte representatives were careful yesterday to note that
the company isn't forecasting year-end panic buying and mass
hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not forecasting any kind of big run, and we certainly
aren't going to start a big run,'' said Bill Spain, Del Monte's
vice president for corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from a computer programing shortcut
that could cause computer systems and microchips to misread the
year 2000 as the 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies and community groups like the American Red
Cross are advising people to keep a three- to seven-day supply of
food and water on hand to weather power outages, food shortages or
other calamities that could crop up if computers go kablooey on
January 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we've said from the get-go is we're not
going to try to exploit (Y2K), try to turn it into a sales event,''
Spain said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst David A. Goldman of Banc of America Securities said not
many food producers are forecasting similar Y2K increases.
</P>
<P>
   Local supermarket chains say they haven't seen a noticeable rush
by Y2K-worried customers and are not sure what to expect as New
Year's Day approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to attribute to Y2K,'' said Albertson's spokeswoman
Judie Decker. ``If you sell 12 more cans of green beans, does that
mean people are stocking up? Maybe it means there's a sale, or
maybe they had a recipe calling for more green beans.''
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket chain hasn't decided whether to order extra
goods. ``We're looking at products and determining what we feel the
consumers might be interested in,'' Decker said.
</P>
<P>
   John Nowacki, plant manager for Calistoga Mineral Water Co.,
said earlier forecasts of a big demand for the company's bottled
water so far have fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three months ago, we were anticipating a huge run at the end
of the year, but as we kept getting closer and closer to it, there
isn't much going on,'' he said. ``The Lucky's, Safeways and the
Targets of the world are all asking about extra availabilities for
Y2K, but nobody's committing to ordering extra inventories.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Costco Wholesale Co., the big-box  &LR; warehouse retailer that
has made stocking up an art form, hasn't noticed any huge Y2K
surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gut feeling is there will be a certain amount of increased
business on certain items on the grocery side,'' said Costco
spokesman Bob Nelson. ``But I don't think we're planning for a
dramatic increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Nomi Ghez of Goldman, Sachs estimated that Del Monte's
projected sales increase could be worth about $25 million for the
$1.5 billion company.
</P>
<P>
   And analyst David A. Goldman of Banc of America Securities said
such an increase would translate to an extra penny of quarterly
earnings per share.
</P>
<P>
   But any increase would be negated by an equal decrease in sales
for the following quarter because if Y2K does not cause any massive
problems, consumers who stocked up would have all the canned corn,
peas and peaches they need.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Del Monte rose 50 cents, to $14, in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.

EDUCATION COLUMN: DOES SOCIAL CLASS MATTER IN SCHOOL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dangerous myth was once conventional _ that disadvantaged
children could not learn. So poor children were assigned to tracks
and taught less challenging lessons. Educators took little
responsibility for low achievement, blaming children's poverty and
home lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools still deliver diluted curriculums to poor and
minority children, from whom teachers expect little.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there has been a reaction. The New York Regents now insist
that children of all backgrounds show similar achievement. Parents
today, by a ratio of three to one, tell pollsters that all children
should be held to identical standards. We have gone overboard. To
counter the earlier myth, we have developed a new, equally
dangerous one: that social class no longer matters in education and
that all children, regardless of background, can achieve to the
same high standards if only schools demand it. We term schools,
regardless of who attends them, ``successful'' if average test
scores are above the median (typically termed ``grade level''
performance), and ``failing'' if below.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot seriously believe this. Consider how typical
middle-class families raise children. Infants' first toys are
``touch and feel'' books. Toddlers soon ``read'' stories from
memory. Magnetic letters decorate refrigerator doors. Sitting on
parents' laps, children ``help'' compose on computers before they
can talk.
</P>
<P>
   These children then attend preschool with equally verbal
toddlers. They adopt family assumptions that someday they too will
become professionals. Expected to attend college, the only question
is how selective it will be.
</P>
<P>
   But other children's homes are without books, magnetic letters
or computers. These children have day care, not preschool. Some
enter kindergarten not knowing how to hold pencils. Their poorly
paid parents are unlikely to have attended college. Television, not
newspapers, dominates their homes. In economically and racially
segregated neighborhoods, their play and schoolmates have similar
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Do we really expect typical children in poor communities, even
in good schools, to achieve just like typical children in schools
where most had a middle-class ``head start?'' In truth, schools
with privileged children should be termed failing if they test only
at the 70th percentile. Though already well above grade level, they
should do even better. A school with many poor children, scoring at
the 35th percentile, could be highly successful, though it tests
below average. Nothing could be more dangerous to education reform
than schemes to reward the first and penalize the second. By
labeling all schools in poor communities with below-norm
achievement failing (and all suburban schools successful), we
paralyze our ability to distinguish good schools from bad.
</P>
<P>
   Demography is not destiny. Some poor children will, with effort,
natural ability and good schooling, achieve more than most
privileged children. ``Rags to riches'' stories abound _ some
disadvantaged children excel in school and became leaders. But
these stories are not universal. On average, with equal school
quality, children with more academic support at home will have
higher achievement. The power of social class will not disappear if
we pretend it does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Can we avoid the defeatist myth, that schools make no
difference, without bouncing to the other extreme, that they make
all the difference? From taking too little responsibility, must
schools now take too much?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, South Carolina sought a middle ground, holding all
schools to higher standards _ but not the same standards. It
categorized schools in five bands, based on average poverty, and
gave bonuses to the best performers within each band. To win, the
best schools serving children of textile-mill workers did not have
to outscore schools serving children of urban professionals.
Schools were rewarded when teachers evoked higher achievement than
was typical in similar communities. The state later abandoned this
daring but controversial program. But it was the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   With similar insight, the advocacy group Education Trust this
year identified schools where most children were poor, but where
scores were higher than in other high-poverty schools. It described
practices that might have caused this achievement _ more attention
to standards, or better staff training, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Better schools can narrow the gaps between typical achievement
of poor and middle-class students. But significant gaps will
remain. To figure out how these schools succeed, and to imitate
them, we will have to understand the gaps we have closed, not focus
only on those that remain. If we want schools to make a difference,
we will need more sensible assessments of how much of a difference
it can be.

 Microsoft Tests Software Rental Arena  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft Corp. next year will begin to dramatically alter the way
its software is bought and sold.
<P>
   The company said yesterday that it's moving its Office software
suite _ which includes word processing, spreadsheet and
presentation applications _ onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trudging off to a local retailer and paying upwards
of $400 for Office, customers will be able to rent the software on
a monthly basis over the Net. Microsoft hasn't disclosed how much
the fee will be. Along with the software, customers could
potentially receive other services such as online technical
support. Microsoft is not the first big player to jump into the
software rental market.
</P>

   Sun Microsystems lent huge credibility to the notion of rental
software in August when it said it would offer word-processing and
spreadsheet software applications for free over the Internet. This
was a direct attack on Microsoft's stranglehold on desktop computer
software. The Office suite has about 100 million users and accounts
for approximately 40 percent of the company's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Sun originally planned to launch its program at the end of this
year but has pushed back the start date to the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which dominates the market for productivity software,
has further validated the software rental concept. Its Office
software will reside on a remote server in cyberspace and will not
need to be loaded onto the individual's computer desktop. Starting
sometime next year, users will be able to access the software
through Microsoft's bCentral Web site, an Internet destination that
provides products and services for small and mid-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also will offer the software through
telecommunications partners and so-called application-service
providers, including British Telecom, Futurelink Corp. and
Concentric Network Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said its new program, called Office Online, has been
in the works for two years. But critics charge it is merely a
knee-jerk reaction to increasing competition in desktop software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is trying to cover its bet by offering Office over
the Internet,'' said David Cearley, an analyst with the Meta Group.
``They needed to do something quick to respond to the Sun threat.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several key advantages to renting software on the Web.
Most important, the software will be easily updated online, which
means customers will no longer have to worry about upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The move also makes sense for Microsoft. ``It's becoming harder
and harder to give people a reason for buying yet another
upgrade,'' said Jeff Tarter, publisher of Softletter, a computer
industry newsletter. ``The software rental model gives Microsoft a
chance to generate ongoing revenue from their installed base.''
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, industry observers says software rental is not
yet ready for prime time. The first problem is slow and spotty
Internet access. Critics argue that most business just won't
tolerate waiting minute after minute to access an Internet-based
spreadsheet document. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Also, since the applications reside only on Web servers, workers
will not be able to access the applications when they're, say,
traveling on an airplane or anytime they are not online.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft is less than effusive about its Office Online
offering. ``Customers will have to evaluate for themselves whether
software rental is right for them,'' said Andrew Dixon, lead
product manager for Microsoft Office. ``We don't anticipate the
world will change overnight or that this program will make a
significant difference in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most analysts believe software rental is inevitable, they
say it won't be a reality for another three to five years. By that
time, it's expected that most people will have high-speed access to
the Internet and that network connections will be more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, of course, Microsoft will continue to offer its
Office software through traditional retail distribution channels.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft remains tight-lipped about pricing for Office Online,
but analysts expect that, over a two-year period, it would cost
about the same, or even slightly more, than a onetime, up-front
fee.

FOR JOB STRESS, ERECT FIRE WALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LISA BELKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``How was your day?'' my husband, Bruce, asks me every night
when he is finally home from the hospital. On my bad days _ ones
that involve deadlines, or spats with editors, or sources who won't
cooperate _ I grumble and grouse in reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was (italics)yours?''(end italics) I remember to ask when
I've finished ranting. On his bad days he'll say something like,
``We lost a patient.'' Bruce's patients are children with heart
disease, many of whom are waiting for transplants and some of whom
don't receive one in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``How old?'' I ask, because I've come to understand that there
is little else to say. He answers, then seeks out our two boys for
an extra hug or bedtime story. And I vow silently (and for the
umpteenth time) never to lose perspective again.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who think we have hard jobs can learn a lot from
those who really do. Lessons about separating work from life and
about how much of ourselves we can give at the office so that we
still have something left to give at home.
</P>
<P>
   How do some people counsel rape victims, investigate murder
scenes or dive for airplane wreckage all week, then have the energy
to cheer for the high school soccer team on Sunday afternoon? How
does a pediatric cardiologist, a paramedic or an AIDS doctor lose a
young patient during the day, then calmly and sanely tuck his own
sons in that night?
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of us can't keep the stress of work from oozing over
and staining the rest of life, how can they? More to the point: If
they (italics)can,(end italics) why on earth can't we?
</P>
<P>
   Ask them for the secret and they talk about perspective. ``This
ward is a trip to hell,'' says the Rev. Carolyn Yard, the chaplain
at the burn center of the New York Weill Cornell Center. Ms. Yard
remembers spending her first day cradling a 4-year-old whose
dripping wounds had been caused by lye thrown by his mother. ``When
you've seen hell, you don't mind a few earthly problems,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, they talk about building walls and creating
distance. When I began writing about hospitals years ago, a young
pediatrician told me she had chosen her specialty of treating
premature babies rather than cancer-stricken toddlers because the
older patients reminded her too much of her little brother, while
the tiny newborns looked more to her like patches of flesh than
people. ``You draw a line and say: I'll give this much of myself,
but no more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the kind of talk we want to hear from our doctors or
chaplains or, for that matter, our baby sitters, schoolteachers or
politicians. We want them to care about the job _ about us _
completely, and to take it home with them, to be consumed. We feel
entitled to this because we don't often leave ourselves room for
walls, either. Work lays claim to our time and emotion, possessing
us as completely as any spouse or child.
</P>
<P>
   But those who do the hardest jobs know that walls are the secret
to coping with the pain. Not just because they are the only way to
carve out space for a (italics)life,(end italics) but also because
they are the only way to do the (italics)job.(end italics) Anne
Wilde supervises volunteers at Help-Line, the oldest telephone
crisis counseling center in the city, where callers often spend
hours threatening to pull the trigger or swallow the pills.
Sometimes, they hang up abruptly, leaving the counselor imagining
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   New volunteers will scour the newspapers for days afterward, Ms.
Wilde says, terrified that they will find a mention of their lost
caller. The people who last longest are the ones who stop looking.
On the bad days, Ms. Wilde goes home and cooks an elaborate dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chop and mince; it smells wonderful; it tastes wonderful,
and it means I have something left to give when I go to work the
next day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the lesson for the rest of us, those for whom work
is not a matter of life and death but has the ability to use us up
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   If you immerse yourself, you can drown, and the only way to get
the work done is to come up for air periodically. To shut the door
and cook, even if you have lost a caller. To smile for your sons,
even as you mourn a patient. To turn off the computer, even on
deadline, and simply be there for your husband, so you can both go
back out tomorrow and do it all again.

OVERSIGHT OF DERIVATIVES SAID TO BE SUFFICIENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the collapse of a giant hedge fund last year that
required a rescue arranged by the Federal Reserve, top government
regulators have concluded that they do not need to supervise the
use of complex financial contracts by hedge funds or other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Four government agencies that oversee banks, brokerage houses
and financial markets dismissed the idea that regulators need fresh
power to police financial derivatives that are traded privately, or
over the counter. The conclusion was contained in a report to
Congress, which had requested the review. It strikes a blow against
those who had sought more official oversight of the multitrillion
dollar derivatives market.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had asked a working group of four agencies _ the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department _ to
consider the issue even before the rescue of Long-Term Capital
Management, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn., that nearly
collapsed, roiling financial markets in September 1998. But the
fund's near-collapse added urgency to the study, with some in
Congress and the academic world expressing concern that loose
regulation of derivatives might have contributed to the troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital lost about $4 billion when bets it had placed
in stock and bond markets _ most through private derivatives
contracts _ went bad. Wall Street banks and brokerage firms saved
the hedge fund to prevent what some feared would be global
financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   The same working group made recommendations on supervision of
hedge funds earlier this year. The group said then that hedge funds
should reveal more about their risk profile to the public, and that
banks and brokerage houses that deal with hedge funds should take
steps to make sure that the use of borrowed money does not get out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the latest report the regulators sided with people in the
financial industry in recommending against any direct supervision
of derivatives, which are contracts based on stocks, bonds,
commodities and currencies. Privately traded derivatives are a
major part of everyday business for banks, securities firms, hedge
funds, and many companies looking to protect their assets against
some future financial event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a small number of people who wanted any kind of
new regulation,'' said Bradley P. Ziff, an expert on derivatives
and risk at the consulting firm Arthur Andersen.

CBS PRODUCER REMAINS FREE IN JASPER CASE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A CBS producer threatened with jail for refusing
to surrender tapes and transcripts of a jail house interview with
capital murder defendant Shawn Berry remained free Tuesday night as
her lawyers negotiated with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based producer Mary Mapes was threatened with jail
Tuesday after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied without
comment her request to overturn two contempt-of-court citations by
state District Judge Joe Bob Golden.
</P>
<P>
   The high court also revoked the $2,000 bond Mapes had been
allowed to post to remain free from jail while her appeal was
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Given the court's ruling Tuesday, Mapes' attorney said she had
little choice but to try and compromise with prosecutors who have
subpoenaed the out takes from a September interview of Berry by
news anchor Dan Rather. Mapes had resisted the court order, saying
such a requirement would hamper journalists' ability to gather
news.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Owens, one of Mapes' attorneys, said the television
producer could not continue her fight of a subpoena by the Jasper
County District Attorney's office. Mapes had said requiring her to
turn over the documents hampers her ability to gather news.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we have gone to the highest court in the state
of Texas. That court has spoken. Our best position now is to be
here and try to work something out with prosecutors,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Mapes as well as the Jasper County District
Attorney's office and the U.S. Attorney's office said they would
continue talks Wednesday. Lawyers on all sides agreed the
negotiations involving Mapes would not delay the start of testimony
in Berry's trial Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Babcock, another of Mapes' lawyers, said much of Tuesday
was spent talking with Assistant U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston and
Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray to ``work out out
some arrangement where we can keep her out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Featherston said talks broke off because of the late hour and
not because the two sides had reached an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just ran out of time,'' Featherston said. ``I hope
something gets worked out (Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said Mapes _ who did not report to the Jasper County
jail after her appeal was denied but remained in Dallas awaiting
word on the negotiations _ is willing to turn over a transcript of
Rather's interview with Berry, including portions that were not
broadcast. But Mapes does not have videotapes in her possession and
could not produce them even if she wanted to, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for CBS in New York declined to comment on the
negotiations until the matter is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Golden twice ordered producer Mapes to jail unless she gives up
either a transcript of the almost three-hour interview Rather
conducted with Berry or videotapes of portions of the interview
that were not aired.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Berry, 24, told a different story about the
June 7, 1998, murder of James Byrd Jr. when interviewed for the
news magazine ``60 Minutes II'' than he did in seven written
statements to investigators. Only about 18 minutes of Rather's
interview were broadcast, and much of it was Rather's paraphrasing
of Berry's story.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County's Gray said the transcript was important to the
case. He also said he wants Mapes to testify during Berry's trial
and confirm the accuracy of the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted at the Jasper sheriff's office
during co-defendant Russell Brewer's trial. Gray admitted he should
have had investigators make their own tape of the interview. He
said he and Sheriff Billy Rowles didn't realize Berry would tell a
different story than during previous interviews with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't smart enough,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Featherston, who has been assisting as a prosecutor, said he was
happy that the high court ruled so quickly. Mapes filed her appeal
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for Mapes to follow Golden's ruling, Featherston
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in time you have to accept the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high court gave no explanation for why it declined to hear
Mapes' case. Court Administrator Rick Wetzel said the court
``generally does that because the claims presented have no merit.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations came the day before testimony is to start in
the third and final trial of one of the most infamous racially
motivated crimes in East Texas history. Byrd's dismembered and
mutilated body was found on a back country road. Prosecutors claim
Byrd was beaten and then drug for three miles behind a pickup
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's two co-defendants, John William King, 25, and Russell
Brewer, 32, were earlier sentenced to die by juries in Jasper and
Bryan.

NOT EXACTLY HOMECOMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ He was UCLA's quarterback in the 1984 Rose Bowl
victory. As an assistant coach, he talked quarterback John Barnes
through one of the greatest games in UCLA history. For years, he
was considered a top candidate to succeed head coach Terry Donahue.
He was admired, respected and loved on campus and throughout
Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Rick Neuheisel returns to the Rose Bowl on
Saturday for the first time (competitively) since his bitter
departure from UCLA following the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be special, although it'll be a little different not
being on the UCLA sideline,'' Neuheisel said. ``The opportunities
UCLA afforded me are too numerous to count. I'm very, very fond of
all my experiences there.''
</P>
<P>
   A former walk-on, Neuheisel passed for 298 yards and four
touchdowns in the 45-9 Rose Bowl victory over Illinois. He was a
volunteer assistant in 1986, then a full-time assistant for six
seasons. But he bolted for Colorado in 1994 when Donahue picked Bob
Toledo, who had just been fired from Texas A&AMP;M, as UCLA's offensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Donahue resigned. The Bruins called Neuheisel,
who had just finished his first season as Colorado's head coach. He
wasn't interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody had told me I'd get offered the UCLA head coaching
job and turn it down, I'd have said they were absolutely nuts,''
Neuheisel said. ``But the timing of what took place made it very
difficult to consider it because of the great leap of faith
Colorado had taken in giving me an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gotten off to a good start and there was no reason to
think Colorado was not going to do well. Because of all that, I
felt the right thing to do was stay and I don't regret that
decision at all.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the mend: Without detailing the demise of their
relationship, Neuheisel said he and Donahue are friendly again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've rekindled our relationship and I'm thankful for it,'' he
said. ``We ran into each other at the airport in Dallas. I was
recruiting. He was considering the Cowboys job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great conversation. There was stuff that happened
that neither of us had any control over and that made it seem a
little bit strained at times. But I owe him a great deal for the
opportunities and I wanted him to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Familiar staff: Neuheisel won't be the only former Bruin on
Washington's sideline. Five of his assistants have UCLA ties:
</P>
<P>
   __ Offensive coordinator Karl Dorrell played at UCLA in the
mid-'80s and was a graduate assistant for one season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Defensive coordinator Tim Hundley was the Bruins' linebackers
coach from 1990-95.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quarterback coach Steve Axman was UCLA's offensive
coordinator (and Troy Aikman's tutor) in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
   __ Safeties/special-teams coach Bobby Hauck spent three seasons
on Donahue's staff.
</P>
<P>
   __ Running backs coach Wayne Moses held the same position at
UCLA from 1990-95.
</P>
<P>
   What impact will their Bruins backgrounds have? Not much. They
aren't familiar with UCLA's personnel, and Donahue's system was
nothing like Toledo's.
</P>
<P>
   __ Common interest: At Colorado, Neuheisel recruited several
current Bruins, including quarterback Cory Paus and safety Audie
Attar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great recruiter,'' Attar said. ``He's a player's
coach and it was a great experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if recruiting fervor caused Neuheisel to disparage his
alma mater, Attar said: ``He didn't say anything really bad. I
could tell deep down in his heart that he loved UCLA. I don't think
he would ever dog his old school.''

NEUHEISEL'S STRANGE HOMECOMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA Bruins fans always knew the day would come
when Rick Neuheisel, MVP of the 1984 Rose Bowl, would be the head
coach of a Rose Bowl-bound team.
</P>
<P>
   Only thing is, they thought it would be the Bruins he was
coaching, and certainly not the Washington Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   They had every reason to believe this because Rick Neuheisel is
a mythic figure at UCLA, the guy who starred in one of the sweetest
of seasons, 1983, someone who embodied the best traits of the hoary
gutty little Bruin legacy, someone who, once he became an assistant
coach, appeared to be the logical heir to Terry Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   So the visage of the eternally young-looking Neuheisel on the
wrong sideline Saturday is sure to stir some feelings. Neuheisel
will have to check his own emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be strange,'' Neuheisel said. ``I've thought
about it a lot, of being on the other sideline, seeing the blue and
gold uniforms and (ital) not (end) rooting for them. I have nothing
but great feelings for UCLA. I'll have a montage of memories going
through my mind Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The memories of '83 still seem fresh. Steve Bono, then a hot
young recruit, was favored to replace the graduated Tom Ramsey at
quarterback. But after fall drills, Donahue gave the job to
Neuheisel, a former walk-on and fifth-year senior.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel struggled, losing two games in the most daunting of
college football locations, Georgia and then top-ranked Nebraska.
After the Nebraska loss, Donahue switched to Bono.
</P>
<P>
   Two games later, Bono hurt himself against Stanford, putting
Neuheisel back on the field. He won the Stanford game and then five
of the next six, including USC. He put on a virtuoso performance in
a stunning 27-24 win over Washington, completing 17 straight passes
and a NCAA record 23-for-25 on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a few upsets elsewhere, the 6-4-1 and unranked Bruins
got a Rose Bowl bid, where they hammered No. 4 Illinois 45-9,
Neuheisel throwing four touchdown passes and winning the MVP trophy
despite a hangover from food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how other people remember it,'' said Neuheisel.
``I remember being sick as a dog and my receivers being wide open.
But it was a great moment.''
</P>
<P>
   From here, Neuheisel's story takes on themes worthy of
Shakespeare father figures, opportunities won and lost, tough
lessons, redemption, reconciliation, and ultimately Saturday's
intersection of past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel turned to coaching as a volunteer assistant at UCLA in
1986 and became a full-time aide in 1988, working with quarterbacks
and receivers and contributing to the game plans of Donahue and
then-offensive coordinator Homer Smith.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1993 season, Smith retired and Neuheisel seemed the
public's choice to replace him. Donahue, feeling the
then-32-year-old Neuheisel wasn't ready to be a coordinator, hired
Bob Toledo. Angry and disappointed, Neuheisel left UCLA and became
an assistant to Bill McCartney at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, McCartney resigned after the 1994 season
and Neuheisel was named head coach. Fate returned a year later when
Donahue resigned. UCLA Athletic Director Pete Dalis had Neuheisel
on his list, but as much as Neuheisel might have wanted to coach
his alma mater, he felt he couldn't leave Colorado after just one
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick was the quarterback the first year I was athletic
director, and it was a year you'd never forget,'' said Dalis. ``As
far as his coaching, Terry predicted long before (Neuheisel) left
that he would be a better head coach than an offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we talked (about the UCLA vacancy), Rick felt he
couldn't leave after one year. As far as what he's done at
Washington, nothing really surprises me. He was a good coach at
Colorado and he's having good success this year.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several years of bitterness on both sides over the
departure. But a chance meeting of Donahue and Neuheisel at a
Dallas airport last year put an end to any lingering emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great cleansing for me,'' Neuheisel said. ``I wanted
him to know why I was hurt. I wanted him to be proud of what I had
accomplished, because I was one of his offspring. For us to be
anything other than close was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue was proud, immensely. Without Neuheisel knowing it,
Donahue had recommended Neuheisel to Colorado after McCartney
resigned, and encouraged Dalis to pursue him for the UCLA job, even
though he knew Neuheisel was unlikely to leave Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Neuheisel has created his own unique programs at
Colorado and now Washington, ones that feature fraternity-like
excursions and a more touchy-feely relationship between coach and
player, he acknowledges that a lot of what he does he learned from
Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sorts of things,'' he said. ``Organization. Preparation
for bowl games (Neuheisel is 3-0). I'm a by-product of his
success.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado experience had its downside. He went 10-2 in his
first two years but 5-6 and 8-4 the last two. Some players took
advantage of the freedoms Neuheisel provided them. Critics who
hailed his methods his first two years carped about a lack of
discipline the last two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a happy ending type of guy,'' Neuheisel said. ``I'd like
every player to have the same kind of ending to their career like I
had. Trying to accomplish that is the right idea, but you can't
slow down the team's progress for the one guy who's deviated from
team policy. That was a mistake. The team was frustrated that guys
like that received so many chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``My least favorite thing to do is be the hard guy. But it's
necessary to run any corporation or football team.''
</P>
<P>
   His current football team is two wins away from its first Rose
Bowl trip since 1992, and in a season that didn't exactly start
with a smile. There were tough losses to BYU and Air Force before
an emotional win against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Now he comes home to face his alma mater, needing a win to stay
alive and wary of the Bruins despite their record, because he knows
too well that there is a Bruin tradition, that a season lost could
be won back a bit, that Cory Paus could go from losing to winning
in the time it takes to four quarters, because he did it himself,
in the exact same uniform, in the exact same stadium.

RESIGNATION OF IMF CHIEF SETS OFF STRUGGLE FOR SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change Camdessus' age to 66 in 3rd graf.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michel Camdessus resigned Tuesday in the middle of
his third term as chief of the International Monetary Fund, setting
off a behind-the-scenes struggle involving the Clinton
administration and big European nations over who will direct the
agency that is in effect dictating national economic policy from
Russia to Indonesia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus, who has steered the IMF for nearly 13 years through a
succession of economic crises, said Tuesday that ``entirely
personal reasons'' had prompted his resignation two years before
the end of his term. Colleagues said constant travel and a
succession of international crises had exhausted him.
</P>
<P>
   But in a half-hour conversation in his office here Tuesday
afternoon, the 66-year-old former central banker in France appeared
vigorous, telling tales of political intrigue, responding to
attacks from conservatives in the U.S. Congress who had accused him
of wasting billions in bailing out Russia, and arguing that his
much-attacked prescriptions saved Asia from a far worse economic
fate.
</P>
<P>
   And in discussing the fund's growing political impact throughout
the world, he acknowledged for the first time that its actions in
Indonesia served as a catalyst in forcing out the man who led the
nation, the world's fourth-most populous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created the conditions that obliged President Suharto to
leave his job,'' Camdessus said. ``That was not our intention,'' he
said, but quickly added that soon after Suharto's resignation he
traveled to Moscow to warn Russian President Boris Yeltsin that the
same forces could end his control of Russia unless he acted to
contain them.
</P>
<P>
   Because the IMF has become such a tremendous political force on
the world scene, the struggle over who will occupy Camdessus'
spacious office, situated almost exactly halfway between the White
House and the Federal Reserve, will likely be a fierce one.
Traditionally the fund has been run by a European, and for 30 of
its 51 years the top job has gone to a Frenchman. And Washington
has usually had only a bit role in selecting the head of the fund
because it has sole discretion to choose the head of the IMF's much
larger sister institution, the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank focuses on alleviating poverty and promoting
development, while the fund's mission is economic stabilization,
particularly in time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   All that may change. Europe appears divided on the question of
who should succeed Camdessus when he steps down in February, and
the administration has signaled that it intends to play a much
bigger role in the selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important decision for the fund at a very
important time,'' a senior Treasury official said Tuesday evening.
``The stakes are higher now because the fund's profile is so much
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the United States was looking for a
candidate ``who will have strong credibility in the markets,'' and
that the United States was not necessarily ready to back a European
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top candidates for the job are Caio Koch-Weser, the
state secretary of finance in Germany and former managing director
of the World Bank, and Andrew Crockett of Britain, who heads the
Bank of International Settlements in Switzerland. Other possible
successors include the current head of the Bank of France,
Jean-Claude Trichet, who is scheduled to be the next head of the
European Central Bank; Mervyn King, deputy governor of the Bank of
England; Nigel Wicks, a top official in Britain's treasury
department; and Horst Koehler, head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
   In his nearly 13 years at the fund, Camdessus earned praise _
particularly from American officials _ as a savvy political
operator who could cajole, wheedle and threaten foreign leaders who
were reluctant to enact economic reform. ``Damn right he can be
tough,'' former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen once said of him,
though he added ``sometimes you have to lean on him real hard to
get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Washington called for help, he was almost always there
_ particularly in 1995, when an early-morning call from Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin with the news that Congress would not back a
bailout of Mexico, led him to take extraordinary unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
   He committed $18 billion without the usual round of negotiations
with the board that directs the fund. He later told them,
``Gentlemen, I don't ask your permission because you would have to
speak with your ministers or governors. And you have no time for
that.'' The bailout worked.
</P>
<P>
   His critics, and they were legion, have had many complaints.
They have viewed Camdessus as arrogant _ ``I am French,'' he once
said in an interview during the Asian financial crisis, ``and what
Frenchmen is not accused of that?'' _ and far too quick to urge the
devaluation of currencies and fiscal austerity. In fact, that is
what the IMF did when the Asian crisis started in Thailand and
Indonesia, but within months it backed away, restoring subsidies
for fuel and rice to contain growing street protests.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, conservatives have complained that the fund wasted
billions, particularly with a $17 billion bailout of Russia last
year that collapsed in months _ and which has spurred ongoing
investigations into where the fund's money went. Camdessus repeated
Tuesday that ``the charges are completely unsubstantiated,'' and
said that ``we must not loose sight of the fact that Russia is now
a democracy and a market economy, even if it is blurred by
corruption and cronyism and mistakes in Chechnya.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What undercut some of Camdessus' credibility on Capitol Hill,
where funding for the IMF is perpetually under attack, was his
tendency to act as a public cheerleader for countries in trouble.
Speaking of the capital flight from Russia in the spring of 1998,
for example, he said: ``Contrary to what markets and commentators
are imagining, this is not a crisis. This is not a major
development.'' It became one quickly, spurring one of the fund's
biggest and least successful stabilization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Camdessus said he was resigned to the fact that
Europeans and Asians view him as a lackey for the United States _
``they call me a damn U.S. neoliberal in Europe,'' he said _ while
in Congress he is viewed as not doing enough to advance the U.S.
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the American influence in the IMF is strong,
very strong, and for good reason,'' he said. ``America has a
systemic vision of the world. The problem is that America does not
always put its money where its mouth is. When my countrymen in
Europe complain about that, I say that if you had the guts to stand
united, you would have more power than the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he ushered a visitor past his collection of sculpture,
including one of an Indian goddess who ``dances on ignorance and is
the force of creative destruction,'' to a favorite painting. It
shows a blur of hands reaching into the pockets of a pinstriped
suit. The painting is titled: ``Sorry, no funds.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It takes only two big spenders to push the price of
an artwork to stratospheric levels, but three determined telephone
bidders declared war Tuesday night at Christie's sale of
20th-century art.
</P>
<P>
   So eager were they to take home Picasso's ``Nude on a Black
Armchair,'' a 1932 portrait of his mistress Marie Therese-Walter
asleep with her arms stretched over her head, that they were still
fighting it out at $36 million. In the end, the winner paid $45.1
million, nicely above Christie's high estimate of $40 million. So
tense was the bidding that the salesroom burst into applause when
the winner was declared.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 53 works offered, 38 found buyers. The sale totaled $99.9
million, well above Christie's low estimate of $89.2 million. The
sale exceeded Christie's auction of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist art on Monday night by more than $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Picasso was one of 12 works being sold from the estate of
Madeleine Haas Russell, one of San Francisco's most important
philanthropists, who died in April at 84. Throughout her life, Mrs.
Russell was a great-grandniece of Levi Strauss, and the Picasso was
the jewel in her collection.
</P>
<P>
   Painted in just one day _ March 9, 1932 _ it is the first in a
series of portraits of Walter that the artist made that year while
he was living in Boisgeloup, outside Paris. At 65 by 53 inches, the
painting is the largest of these works, and the most sensual. Over
the last four years, Christie's has sold two other Picasso
portraits of Walter painted the same year. ``The Mirror'' was sold
in 1995 for $20 million, and ``The Dream,'' from the estate of the
New York collectors Victor and Sally Ganz, fetched $48.4 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The minute ``Nude on a Black Armchair'' sold, speculation about
the buyer began. Many said Steven A. Wynn, the casino owner who
founded a mini-museum at Bellagio in Las Vegas, was the buyer.
Others weren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Sotheby's is auctioning a $40 million Picasso:
``Seated Woman in a Garden'' (1938), showing another of Picasso's
mistresses, Dora Maar, regally seated on a thronelike chair
surrounded by naively-rendered flowers. It is part of a
20th-century art collection from the estate of Eleanore B. and
Daniel Saidenberg, the Manhattan gallery owners who represented
Picasso in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the fi,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the evening had its ups and downs. For certain
works, prices exceeded all expectations; for others, the salesroom
went dead and there wasn't a bid in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is selective,'' said Abigail Asher, a partner in
Guggenheim Asher, an art advisory business. ``People were willing
to stretch for good things, but they weren't touching things of
lesser quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's cleverly began the sale with Mrs. Russell's property.
Estate property is generally appealing because it has been off the
market for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Another high flier was Giovanni Segantini's ``Springtime in the
Alps,'' a large oil, 47 by 90{ inches. Paintings by the Italian
artist rarely come on the market. This 1897 landscape was
commissioned by Mrs. Russell's father, Jacob Stern, the year it was
painted. It has been hanging at the California Palace of the Legion
of Honor in San Francisco since 1928, and many experts said it was
a shame it hadn't been given to a museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last one of that scale and quality in private
hands,'' said Franck Giraud, director of 19th- and 20th-century art
for Christie's worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Two telephone bidders tried to buy the Segantini, which ended up
selling for $9.5 million, far above its $6 million high estimate.
After the sale, it was announced that Martin Zimet, the Manhattan
dealer who runs French &AMP; Co., was the buyer _ for himself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other works from the Russell estate brought astonishing prices.
A Matisse sculpture, ``Reclining Nude I (Dawn),'' conceived in 1907
and cast in 1912, was expected to fetch $2 million to $3 million;
it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $9.2 million, a
record for a sculpture by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Another sculpture from the Russell estate matched the artist's
record. Henry Moore's ``Two-Piece Reclining Figure: Points,'' a
1969 abstract sculpture, was estimated at $2 million to $3 million;
it sold for $4 million to Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan dealer.
</P>
<P>
   After the Russell estate property, the sale went through some
rocky patches. Cy Twombly's ``Untitled,'' one of the artist's
famous blackboard series from 1971, failed to sell. This
118-by-184{-inch sprawl of white scribbles on a gray background was
being sold by Shigeki Kameyama, the Japanese dealer and collector
who sold Picasso's ``Mirror'' at Christie's for $20 million four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Twombly was estimated at $5 million to $7
million, but Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in America
and the evening's auctioneer, could not milk a bid out of the
audience. He finally gave up at $4.5 million. Kameayma had paid
$5.5 million for it at Sotheby's in New York in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Another failure was a Matisse painting, ``Woman With the Green
Umbrella.'' Bidding started at $2 million and ended at $2.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were lots that went so far above their estimates that
even the experts seemed baffled. , Robert Rauchenberg's
``Untitled'' (1954), one of the artist's earliest examples of his
Combine series, was estimated at $180,000 to $250,000. It sold to
Barney A. Ebsworth, a St. Louis collector for $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   As dealers were leaving the sale, many said they were confused
about the evening's results. ``It was too bad the estimate on the
Twombly was so greedy,'' said Charles Cowles, the SoHo dealer.
``But the market is sure strong for good pictures.'' &QL;

HOUSE VOTES TO LET SATELLITE TV CARRY LOCAL STATION PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Tuesday that
would allow satellite television companies to compete better with
the cable industry by permitting them to carry local television
channels for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has attracted vast numbers of lobbyists and
spurred volumes of postcards from angry television viewers, passed
by a vote of 411-8.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lopsided House vote, the legislation faces
considerably rockier prospects in the Senate on Wednesday, where
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who heads the banking committee, has
threatened to filibuster. Gramm is embroiled in a turf war over a
particular loan provision that was not approved by his committee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the bill, which has the support of most senators,
would become law this year, Gramm replied, ``Not in this
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is not expected to oppose the bill.
</P>
<P>
   For the 10 million households with satellite television that
have gone without local news and network programming from NBC, ABC,
CBS and Fox _ or endured fuzzy reception with their home antennas _
the bill comes as a relief. Viewers in many major cities, beginning
with New York and Los Angeles, could receive satellite feeds of
local programs at some point in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   But, more important, lawmakers said Tuesday, it would give
people an alternative to cable, which controls 85 percent of the TV
viewing market and has been criticized for its steep rate
increases. The cable industry was freed in May from most
price-control regulations set by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., the senior Democrat on the House
telecommunications subcommittee, said that ``millions of Americans
... may have the opportunity of deciding to disconnect their cable
and get their local programming from a new place _ a satellite
dish.''
</P>
<P>
   Current law permits satellite companies to beam network signals
from distant cities only to those customers who cannot receive
local stations using rooftop antennas, so that a viewer in Iowa,
for example, may wind up watching local Chicago programs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give satellite television companies a six-month
grace period to work out retransmission agreements with the
networks to broadcast local programming. By the end of the six
months, the deals must be in hand for satellite companies to
continue showing local programs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the legislation requires that by 2002 satellite
companies carry all local stations in a market if they carry some
of them.

GIULIANI STRESSES REPUBLICAN IDEALS TO NATION'S CONSERVATIVES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was the featured speaker at
a benefit dinner here Tuesday night for The American Spectator
magazine, whose 400 guests represent the nation's conservative
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Tables at the benefit, which was held in a ballroom of the Four
Seasons Hotel in Georgetown, were purchased by such groups as the
Heritage Foundation, the National Rifle Association, Forbes 2000
Inc. and a number of corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor used his 20-minute speech to boast about his record,
stress his Republican ideals and charge up his presumed campaign
for the U.S. Senate by taking a few shots at the Democrats in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani described his potential race against Hillary Rodham
Clinton next year as a golden opportunity to draw contrasts between
Republican and Democratic political philosophies, and he told the
appreciative audience that he believed his Republican ideals would
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really looking forward to this race,'' he said. ``I hope
she doesn't disappoint me.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the standard topics that Giuliani mentions in
most of his political speeches, including his imitation of a
mobster and the recitation of New York's reduced crime statistics,
the mayor talked about his frustration with New York City's school
system, an issue on which his critics say he is particularly
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani was expressing long-held views _ criticizing
tenure for school principals and advocating increased school-choice
options for parents _ his comments seemed to indicate that the
issue will figure prominently in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans, Conservatives and others should not in any way be
walking away from the education issue,'' he said. ``We should be at
the forefront of it because we have the better answer to it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor also took a rare jab at Vice President Al Gore.
Telling the dinner guests that New York and Washington have some
things in common, the mayor said: ``We have 412 expressionless
statues in Central Park. You have Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   And he repeatedly chided Mrs. Clinton for planning to run for
office in a state in which she has never lived. ``I spent a day
today in Washington,'' the mayor said. ``I was on a listening
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did spend the day in Washington but his actual mission
was a series of meetings with industry groups and a luncheon
fund-raiser for his campaign committee that aides said raised about
$65,000. Upon leaving the lunch, at La Colline, near the Capitol,
Giuliani had to pass by picketing workers from the restaurant
employees union who are involved in a long-running dispute. Asked
about the pickets, the mayor said, ``I felt right at home.''
</P>
<P>
   In meeting with the industry groups representing companies in
real estate, finance, health care, insurance and agriculture,
Giuliani hoped to develop contacts that would lead to future
campaign contributions from executives or political action
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went on to the dinner to help raise money for The
American Spectator, a conservative monthly. Guests included some of
Giuliani's colleagues from the Justice Department during the Reagan
administration, and well-known personalities like William F.
Buckley, Jr.; Ben Stein, the game-show host; Michigan Gov. John
Engler; and Robert Bork, the former federal judge.

ROBERT KENNEDY SAYS NEW YORK MAYOR PLAYS POLITICS WITH WATER 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert F. Kennedy Jr. inserted himself into the race for U.S.
Senate on Tuesday by accusing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of
jeopardizing the city's water supply in order to ``court political
favor'' with upstate Republican leaders and developers crucial to
Giuliani's unannounced campaign. Last month, Kennedy met privately
for more than an hour with Giuliani's all-but-certain opponent,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kennedy has criticized the Giuliani administration for
years for failing to control development along the upstate
reservoirs that supply the city's drinking water, Tuesday was the
first time that Kennedy said the city's mission to protect the
watershed is controlled by the mayor's political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem has been compounded since the mayor began
contemplating a Senate race,'' Kennedy said. He added, ``I've
become increasingly disturbed that in every aspect of watershed
protection, the city is in retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's charges are detailed in a report to be released
Wednesday by his environmental group, Riverkeeper Inc. Kennedy is
the group's chief lawyer and an author of the report, which is the
second in a series of five on how the city has responded to the
1997 agreement to protect the city's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, which other environmentalists termed a catalog of
existing concerns, Kennedy says that the engineering staff of the
city's Department of Environmental Protection had allowed itself to
become ``an agent of destruction in the New York City watershed.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's commissioner, Joel A. Miele Sr., responded by
issuing a statement saying that ``rather than seeming to
accommodate developers at every turn, the city has followed a
course of vigorous enforcement of environmental laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's two major charges are that the city has allowed
developers to build new septic systems on steep slopes around
reservoirs, risking contamination, and that it reversed itself on a
decision earlier this year, ultimately concluding after protests
from Republican officials that wetlands around upstate reservoirs
need no special protection.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said Tuesday
that Kennedy's report ``is nothing more than a cheap political
document focusing on his public relations and not substance.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the city was in ``full compliance'' with the
1997 watershed agreement, and that ``Bobby Kennedy has
unfortunately released this report to the press and not to the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that Kennedy had recently met with Mrs. Clinton, Lhota
replied, ``good. Then it is political.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy countered that his meeting with Mrs. Clinton, at his
offices at Pace University in White Plains, was informational.
``She didn't come and say, `I've heard about this report,'''
Kennedy said. ``She wanted to meet and talk about the watershed.
The Senate race was in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday night in Washington, Giuliani said
of Kennedy's report: ``I think that's dusting off a report of about
six months ago. We are doing everything we can to protect the
watershed. We are doing a very good job.'' He added, ``We have the
best water in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that one of his motivations in releasing the report
was to make the watershed a source of debate in the unannounced
Giuliani-Clinton campaign. ``I'll do whatever I can to make it an
issue,'' Kennedy said, adding that ``I'm not running for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kennedy withdrew from consideration for the Senate
seat that was once held by his father, but said then that his
decision ``was for this time around'' and that ``if I wanted to run
for something, there's always something to run for.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Kennedy was a chief architect of the watershed
agreement that empowered the city to regulate development around
the upstate reservoirs that supply 10 million New Yorkers with
high-quality drinking water. But in the last year, he has
increasingly criticized the city for not enforcing the deal
aggressively enough. ``They are AWOL in the process,'' Kennedy
said.

 &HT;    Griffey deal: Braves balk
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves, considered a likely front-runner to trade
for Ken Griffey Jr., have apparently balked at the Mariners'
initial asking price, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of giving up either center fielder Andruw Jones or
pitcher Kevin Millwood or both would be more than the Braves are
willing to do, and Jones, the 22-year-old budding star in center
field, is probably the deal clincher.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are believed to have met Tuesday with the Mariners to
discuss their level of interest in Griffey, considered one of the
best players in the game. But Braves general manager John
Schuerholz was typically mum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk about another team's players,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners general manager Pat Gillick had told reporters Monday
he had received five tangible trade offers for Griffey but none the
Mariners liked. The Braves are one of a dozen teams expected to
have met with the Mariners by the end of the day Tuesday, though
Gillick said not all of talks were centered around Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds have been the most vocal about their
interest in Griffey. But Tuesday general manager Jim Bowden told
the Cincinnati Enquirer, ``We still have interest . . . but not at
the present asking price.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees are the closest to the Braves in terms of
what they have to offer, including shortstop prospect Alfonzo
Soriano, as well as having the ability to sign him long term.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is expected to win his second consecutive Gold Glove
when the National League winners are announced today, has played
only three full years in the majors and already has emerged as
possibly the best defensive center fielder in the game. His
progress at the plate has been slower, but he flirted with 30 home
runs and 30 steals in a season each of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Braves' top four starting pitchers, Millwood is the only
one who is tradable because Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John
Smoltz all have the right to, and undoubtedly would, veto trades
after playing 10 years in the major leagues, including the past
five with Atlanta. Millwood, at 24, made a run at the National
League Cy Young award this year by winning 18 games. He's the
future of the Braves' pitching staff.

BOXING REALIZES CREDIBILITY FALLING BECAUSE OF BAD DECISIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Controversial decisions have been as much a part of
boxing as the left hook.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed draw in the first Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield
bout in March simply brought this plague to a more insidious level,
a level that disgusted the public just enough for the sport to take
another hard look at judging.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to agree that a serious problem exists as
Holyfield and Lewis prepare to give it another try here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the sport of boxing,'' said Marc Ratner, director of
the Nevada State Athletic Commission. ``. . . I want people to look
at the sport and say, `What a great fight that was.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, they call me on Monday and ask, `What happened this
time?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The most significant concern is corruption or the perception
thereof. No one will come out and say that judges are paid off by
promoters who want to give their fighters every edge possible.
</P>
<P>
   That goes even for Eugenia Williams, the one judge who had
Holyfield beating Lewis even though Lewis seemed to dominate the
fight at Madison Square Garden in New York. No one has accused her
of taking a direct payment.
</P>
<P>
   However, many WILL suggest that judges are subject to undue
influence from promoters who lobby for them and the sanctioning
bodies _ the WBC, WBA and IBF, among others _ that choose the
judges in most states.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple, according to many: You give the promoter and
sanctioning body the result they want and you continue to get work.
</P>
<P>
   Judges are often flown to conventions and seminars or the site
of a fight and enjoy first-class accommodations. They're also paid
well: The judges for Saturday's bout will earn a reported $7,500
each.
</P>
<P>
   It's not bad work if you can get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to bribe them with money, you bribe them with
future assignments,'' said promoter Bob Arum, whose fighter Oscar
De La Hoya was on the wrong end of a controversial decision against
Felix Trinidad in September.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, fighters never know going into a bout whether they'll
receive a fair decision. Lewis is the most compelling example at
the moment. His trainer, Emanuel Steward, believes Holyfield won no
more than three of 12 rounds yet kept his IBF and WBA
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good at all,'' Steward said. ``Judges are coming in
with their minds made up. Williams made up her mind. The fifth
round (which Lewis thoroughly dominated but which she scored for
Holyfield) was evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevada is dealing with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Judges here might be recommended by a sanctioning body whose
championship is at stake, but the five-member commission makes the
final decision on who will be filling out scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who one might think would be leery of ANY judge after his
first meeting with Holyfield, has said numerous times that he takes
comfort in the fact the fight is in Nevada. The state has had its
share of dubious decisions but has a reputation for fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner hopes Nevada's diligence will serve as an example for
other states. Especially in light of the fact the Association of
Boxing Commissions, of which Ratner is vice president, is putting
together a data base with which commissions can better screen
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a concerted effort by all state commissions to
better critique (judges). That's the key,'' Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
   The competence of judges also is being questioned. Typically,
judges rise through the ranks. They normally start in the amateurs
and then progress upward from four-round professional bouts to as
high as their ability takes them. That's not good enough to some.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, judging, even at its best, is subjective. As Ratner
said, ``It's an inexact science and always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a common complaint is that there is lack of
specific standards. Some judges might reward damaging blows over
the number of punches landed while others might prefer ring
generalship over aggression.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on the judge, one apparent reason judges often
score the same fight so differently. Again, Nevada is taking steps
to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really trying to do in Nevada is establish a
commonality of philosophy,'' Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
   That might be a short-term solution.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen, head of America Presents, has a long-term plan he
believes could change the scoring system dramatically: He's
advocating a school for both judges and referees as part of a
national commission that would oversee the sport. Under his plan,
all judges would be required to graduate from the school before
they would allowed to enter the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``In (major) sports, officials must attend a school, they're
evaluated regularly during the season and they earn the right to
work the biggest games and events based on merit, not who they
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the same parameters in our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Lewis, have suggested open scoring, which has
been tested on a few occasions but hasn't caught on. The idea is
announce the scores round-by-round, so judges couldn't spring any
surprises on anyone. Presumably, they would be less inclined to
cheat with the whole world watching.
</P>
<P>
   Critics counter that a fighter who builds a commanding lead
early in a fight would run from his opponent the rest of the way,
thereby sucking any drama out of the event. Others aren't inclined
to give up the announcement of the decision, often one of the most
compelling moments in sports.
</P>
<P>
   So, for now, we're stuck with an imperfect system. We can only
hope that closer-than-ever scrutiny will keep judges and those who
might corrupt them in line until meaningful change can be
implemented.

NYC BLOCKS STUDENT ACCESS AT SCHOOL COMPUTERS TO SOME WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (bl)  
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Board of Education has installed a filter on its
computer system that blocks students in city schools from gaining
access to any Web sites that include categories like news and sex
education, including those of major news organizations, policy
groups and scientific and medical organizations, officials
acknowledged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Students, parents and teachers at Benjamin Cardozo High School
in Queens, one of the city's most prestigious and competitive
schools, said Tuesday that they had complained to the New York
Civil Liberties Union, because the blocking program made it almost
impossible for them to conduct sophisticated research projects on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Shakofsky, a humanities teacher at Cardozo, said her
students discovered the filter when they tried to carry out an
assignment on ``researching the pros and cons of an issue.'' When
they tried to determine how members of Congress had been rated by
the National Rifle Association, they received a message saying,
``Access Denied.''
</P>
<P>
   They were given the same message when they tried to call up
sites about breast cancer, anorexia and bulimia, child labor, AIDS
and organizations that support abortion _ but not those that oppose
it _ because they contained censored words. Even the last chapter
of John Steinbeck's ``Grapes of Wrath'' was forbidden, students
said Tuesday, because of a passage in which a woman lets a starving
man suckle at her breast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you, I'm not a true civil libertarian,'' Ms.
Shakovsky said. ``I'm the mean person who asks them to delete
solitaire, Free Cell, hearts and minesweeper from their computers.
I don't think they should have pornography. But I felt they should
be able to do research.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers said the censorship was not unique to Cardozo, but had
plagued schools throughout the city that had recently expanded
their computer programs, using a federal grant that has allowed
every school in the city to be connected to the Internet through
the Board of Education's server at Metrotech in Brooklyn. The same
server, officials said, is used by many computers within the Board
of Education bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than create its own policy on student access, teachers
said, the board purchased a commercial filtering program, I-Gear,
and let it set the standards. I-Gear, made by Urlabs, a subsidiary
of Symantec Corp., is one of the most popular filtering programs,
school officials said, and is used by school systems across the
country and in Canada. Officials at Symantec of Cupertino, Calif.,
did not return messages late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the civil liberties group,
faxed a letter to Chancellor Rudy Crew on Tuesday, complaining that
the board was engaging in ``broad censorship of Internet access,''
by blocking entire categories of Web sites based on forbidden words
and phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blocking program sweeps far too broadly,'' Siegel said in
his letter. ``It significantly undermines teachers' ability to
conduct their lessons and students' ability to complete their
classroom assignments on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The board has the right, Siegel said in an interview, to
exercise judgment about what information is available to students,
but he said it made no sense to adopt ``a software company's one
size fits all standard,'' regardless of educational considerations,
for all students from kindergarten through high school.
</P>
<P>
   Pam McDonnell, a spokeswoman for Crew, said the Board of
Education is drafting a policy on Internet access, which will allow
schools to ``tweak'' the I-Gear filter. The policy, she said, will
attempt to be sensitive to the concerns of parents and communities,
and will be tailored to the ages of students.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, many schools had used their own servers, and
officials in those schools or in the local districts decided what
information to restrict.
</P>
<P>
   Some school officials said yesterday that the Board of Education
had also made it difficult for children to use e-mail in class as a
tool to exchange notes about homework, or to communicate with
experts for class projects.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts can be set up in the names of teachers, but not
students, they said, and must go through the Board of Education.
Teachers who have tried to set up free e-mail addresses for their
students, through Yahoo, for example, have found those services
blocked, they said. Teachers said that even setting up a school Web
site can be difficult, because parents must sign a release form
before schools can display students' work.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sobotka, whose daughter, Kathryn, is a junior at
Cardozo, said he objected to any form of Internet screening,
because children were being denied the tools to investigate both
sides of an issue and think for themselves. Sobotka, an importer of
dental instruments, said school officials were overreacting when
they perceived the Internet as more dangerous than traditional
media, like print or television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is unconscionable that our children are told what
they can or what they cannot read or see,'' he said. ``Once you
block one thing, you are agreeing that in essence, censorship is
OK, and I don't think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lieberman, director of the civil liberties union's
Reproductive Rights Project, said that until about a week ago,
students could see the Web sites for Right to Life and Operation
Rescue, which oppose abortion, but were denied access to Planned
Parenthood and the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which support
abortion rights. She said that all sites dealing with abortion, pro
and con, had been blocked after her office complained to the Board
of Education.

NO. 1 UCONN GROWS TALLER FOR NEW SEASON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Conn., N.C., N.J., Tenn.)   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Check the rings carefully and note the rotund point guard. It is
about all that will seem familiar about the Connecticut Huskies,
who begin the defense of their first national championship Thursday
at Madison Square Garden in the first round of the Coaches vs.
Cancer/Ikon Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the three-guard lineup that featured the lithe Richard
Hamilton, who is now ensconced in the NBA with the Washington
Wizards, and Ricky Moore, the defensive gem lost to graduation.
While familiar faces like Khalid El-Amin, the chubby floor leader
who is the Big East's preseason player of the year, forward Kevin
Freeman and center Jake Voskuhl return to the team that is the
preseason pick to win it all again, you may strain to see what is
different about the team that will face Iowa, and its new coach,
Steve Alford, in a game that begins at 8:30 p.m. You will strain
your neck from looking up.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are a much bigger group this season. Freeman, 6-7,
who played power forward last year in a lineup that had El-Amin and
Moore in the backcourt with Hamilton freelancing between a shooting
guard and small forward, is now adjusting to playing small forward,
where coach Jim Calhoun is hoping to take advantage of Freeman's
superb scoring skills. Last season, he averaged 12.2 points while
shooting 58.8 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is caught between being incredibly strong and using his
power and, as a small forward, using his finesse and skills,''
Calhoun said. ``He can defend at that position. He can run and pass
at that position. We need to find a better way in which he can
score more points.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-11 sophomore Ajou Ajou Deng, a source of curiosity around
the program since he sat out last season, has a reach of 7 feet 3
inches and can shoot the 3-pointer. He can also play on the wing.
``He has to develop the stamina to play at this level,'' Calhoun
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are extraordinarily deep in the low post. Backing up
Voskuhl, a 6-11 senior, at center is Souleymane Wane, another 6-11
senior. ``If we're going to be big and physical, let's stay big and
physical the whole game,'' Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Connecticut-Iowa game _ a rematch of the Round
of 16 game that the Huskies won in last season's National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament _ will play the winner
of a first-round game between Duke and Stanford Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, of course, was the heavy favorite to defeat Connecticut in
the championship, only to lose one of the most dramatic title games
in history. The Blue Devils have suffered losses: Elton Brand,
William Avery and Trajan Langdon _ all starters last season _ are
in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ALL-STAR WOMEN'S FOURSOME
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers women's team, preseason ranked fourth in the
Associated Press poll following a season in which it made it to the
final eight of the women's tournament, will open its season Sunday
against No. 20 North Carolina State as part of the Tip-Off Classic
doubleheader in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The other game features No. 2 Tennessee _ in its first game of
the post-Chamique Holdsclaw era _ against No. 6 Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, which has made a steady climb up the polls in recent
seasons, seems primed to crack into the Final Four this season,
with four starters returning, led by two first team all-Big East
players: point guard Tasha Pointer, who led the Big East in
assists, and Shawnetta Stewart, who led Rutgers in scoring with a
14.3 points per game. Still, Coach C. Vivian Stringer is cautious
about the preseason expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know polls don't mean anything,'' Stringer said.
``We're anywhere from one to seven. The lights are on. It's a
different position. We're not going to worry about the bottom line.
We're going to concern ourselves with the execution of the
fundamentals. It would be special to get to Philadelphia.''
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A PACKAGE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   If you're hoping to buy a ticket to see St. John's game against
Connecticut in Madison Square Garden Feb. 21, you may also have to
pay for tickets to games against Hofstra and Sacred Heart. St.
John's is selling tickets to what is typically a blockbuster game
against its Big East rival only as part of season ticket packages.
</P>
<P>
   Individual game tickets to the Connecticut game will eventually
go on sale and the move, according to St. John's, is an effort to
boost season ticket sales. But it also will, at least temporarily,
prevent Huskies fans, who typically turn out in numbers equal to or
exceeding the number of St. John's fans for the game, from buying
up large blocks of tickets.

CALIFORNIA HMOs AND DOCTORS REACT TO UnitedHealth Group DECISION 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- United Health Group's decision to give doctors,
and not health plan administrators, decision-making power over
patient care received mixed reviews Tuesday from doctors, HMOs, and
Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ataoliah Kashani, whose Reseda-based practice works with
Blue Cross of California, said he didn't believe the change in
United's policy would improve patient care. ``These people (HMOs)
are only there to line their pockets, they don't care about
patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And William S. McKeever, a health care industry analyst with
Paine Webber in New York, said the change in policy is more of a
marketing tool than anything else. ``This is a United story, rather
than an HMO story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the cynicism and mistrust of health maintenance
organizations and the managed-care industry. And reactions like
that put into context United's announcement Monday that it would
now let doctors have the final say in everything from admitting
patients to hospitals to ordering diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   United, which insures 14.5 million people nationwide, including
800,000 in California, said the new policy would go into effect for
most patients on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis-based company will still ask doctors to justify
such decisions as ordering surgery or expensive diagnostic tests
and reserves the right to remove a doctor from its approval list if
the doctor's costs continue to be higher than similar physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Silverstein, the company's chief marketing officer, said the
change was a dollars-and-sense decision: It'll save the company an
estimated $25 million each year on staffing administrators for its
medical reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation Health Systems spokeswoman Lisa Haines said her
company puts the decision making in the doctors' hands by paying
groups of doctors a pre-determined amount of money based on the
expected number of patients and procedures that will be performed
by those doctors.
</P>
<P>
   By giving doctors the money upfront in a process that's known in
the industry as capitation, the doctors decide what's medically
necessary while still within budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capitation puts the final decision in the physician's hands,''
said Haines, who's Woodland Hills-based company is the nation's
fourth-largest HMO. ``That's a situation that we've had in place in
California for a number of years. It's something we strongly
advocate, and something we're doing already.''
</P>
<P>
   But J.C. Pickett, president of the California Medical
Association, a doctors' lobbying group, said that what capitation
really does is encourage doctors not to see their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor receives a certain amount of money per month for
every patient he has on his rolls. The less he sees these patients,
the better off he is,'' Pickett said. ``I'm against it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a better system would be to pay doctors a discounted
rate based on actual services performed. The idea of involving
physicians in decision making is a good one, but Pickett said he
will reserve judgement until he knows the specifics of United's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francis J. Crosson, executive director of Kaiser Permanente,
the nation's largest nonprofit HMO, said his health maintenance
organization has been allowing doctors to make the final decision
for years. Kaiser is a unique in the managed-care industry,
however, since most of the doctors it works with are actually on
Kaiser's payrolls and working in Kaiser-owned hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marvin V.H. Kanter said United's decision to change its
policy may be in response to several class-action lawsuits against
others in the industry that allege improper denial of benefits by
health maintenance organzations.
</P>
<P>
   Kanter is chief executive officer of Calabasas-based Progressive
Healthcare Systems LLC, which provides management services for
medical groups and independent doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that puts decision making back into the hands of
doctors can only be a good thing for managed-care,'' Kanter said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein said the litigation played no role in United
changing its policy.

KAISER, UNIONS REACH PIONEERING PACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Kaiser Permanente and a coalition of labor unions
announced a groundbreaking employment and income security pact
Tuesday that officials said should serve as a model for other
health care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Kaiser committed itself to ``redeploy, not
lay-off'' employees who are displaced by corporate restructuring,
providing a one-year transition period and training opportunities
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the unions agreed to negotiate changes in the
workplace, including the elimination of some job classifications
and ``flexibility'' in union contract language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to do everything possible to retain these valuable
employees in the face of changes in the health care sector,'' said
David Lawrence, chairman and chief executive officer of Kaiser
Foundation Health Plan, in a conference call Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The pact covers 60,000 full- and part-time Kaiser employees with
union contracts, including those represented by the Service
Employees International Union at Kaiser facilities in Panorama City
and Woodland Hills. It excludes managers and some workers whose
unions have not joined the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Under the first-of-its-kind pact, Kaiser said it will try to
find jobs for ``displaced'' employees with similar duties, pay,
benefits and hours within a ``reasonable geographic area.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is not possible, Kaiser will put affected workers in
``transition status'' at another position with at least a year at
current pay levels. And if an employee's previous position is
phased out, the employee ``is expected to actively seek education
and training to qualify for a different position.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is an outgrowth of a partnership that Kaiser and
the unions formed in 1997. At that time, the unions agreed to help
Kaiser, the nation's largest nonprofit health maintenance
organization, market its services to union members in exchange for
flexibility in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said the new pact would give
workers a role in management restructuring in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will hopefully be a model for other employers and will
reflect the concern that workers have for good patient care,''
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   But some unions that represent Kaiser workers said they are
uneasy about the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although he agreed that employment guarantees are important, an
official with the California Nurses Association _ an independent
union representing 8,600 nurses in Northern California _ said the
management-union partnership hurts employees' ability to oppose
poor management decisions such as the replacement of registered
nurses with less-trained workers. The CNA is not part of the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see how it's possible for registered nurses to
advocate for patients and at the same time market the plan as the
best plan,'' said Jim Ryder, director of the union's Kaiser
division. ``There are times when you have to advocate against what
an employer is doing.''

GRAY CEILING A BARRIER FOR OLDER WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Older job seekers have a hard time finding good-paying work in
the Phoenix area, despite the area's roaring economy and historical
low unemployment, employment experts say.
</P>
<P>
   And many graying workers say they identify with the employees
behind the settlement in AlliedSignal's age discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are a zillion $6 to $10 an hour service jobs that
we fill every day, we run into a brick wall when we try to place
mature, experienced workers in the major corporations in the
Phoenix area,'' said Helen Blankenship, 70, executive director of
Plus-50 Placement Center, the Phoenix area's largest older worker
employment agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top executives of large corporations tell us they want older
workers, but the message isn't being filtered down to their human
resource departments,'' Blankenship said.
</P>
<P>
   She says she gets announcements for jobs paying $20,000 to
$60,000, but her mature clients with the right experience and
skills often don't get the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Quinn of Tempe says he has experienced the gray
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an anti-older person attitude in the marketplace,''
Quinn said. ``As soon as the interview begins you are off the list
_ once they realize your age.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn retired early but is seeking work again as an executive in
the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, especially at 64,'' he said. ``The toughest part
is getting in to talk with the people to show that you are capable
of doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is chairman of AzPEN, the Arizona Professional Employment
Network, a non-profit corporation for unemployed and underemployed
professional people.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is amazed at all the bogus reasons why older professionals
aren't hired. He keeps a list, gathered from interviews of members
of his group: ``Skills are outdated; would not likely adjust to a
new corporate structure; would not know how to handle or manage the
younger employees; not flexible to new ideas; impact on the health
plan; grouchy due to age; would find it difficult to work for a
younger person.''
</P>
<P>
   Every excuse for rejecting the older worker is perception, not
fact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this is understood, we will continue to waste a valued
resource,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Membership has dropped in AzPEN the past year, but he speculates
it could be because many former professionals were forced to take
lower-paying jobs to get medical coverage and to get a cash flow of
some sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they do that, they no longer have time to hunt for a
serious professional job,'' Quinn said. ``And when they tell a
potential employer what they have been doing, they hurt their
chances of getting a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship believes that, in many cases, employers aren't aware
that they're discriminating against older people. Unlike racism and
sexism, ageism is more subtle and often goes unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   Still, age discrimination is the third most common complaint
received by the EEOC office in the Phoenix area. Employees 40 years
and older are protected under the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act (ADEA).
</P>
<P>
   The Plus-50 employment agency has better luck getting people
placed in smaller organizations of less than 100 employees, though
they are beginning to confront more of the bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Dennis of Redondo Beach, Calif., a specialist in aging and
mature employment and the author of ``Fourteen Steps in Managing an
Aging Workforce,'' said the chances of being called back from early
retirement or layoff depends on having an exact match of skills for
the job. The better the match, the less important the gray hairs
will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, not everyone in the unemployment line is a key
decisionmaker, a great manager or someone with valued technical
skills,'' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe security guard Louis Shire sent out 100 resumes when he
and his wife, Lois, moved to the Phoenix area three years ago, when
he was 59. They had their own sales business and he thought it
would be easy to get a job in sales. It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he found a job in sales but was laid off. And then
the search began again in March 1998. It took him five months to
find his current job as a school security guard. He likes the job,
but it is not the job he thought he would have at this stage of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard all the excuses. Several employers said they
couldn't offer him enough money _ even though he said he didn't
want a lot of money, just enough to get by.
</P>
<P>
   He heard the word ``overqualified'' more than a few times.
</P>
<P>
   But Blankenship predicts that changes are ahead, favoring older
workers in the job market.
</P>
<P>
   Workers 55 and older already are the fastest growing segment of
the workforce, with the median age of the workforce projected to
reach 40 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   When 2001 rolls around, the baby boomers start turning 55, which
classifies them as ``older workers,'' according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Some believe it could lead to a boom in lawsuits
if workplaces don't become more attuned to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers will put the push on it like no one
imagined,'' Blankenship said. ``In the next 20 years, the workplace
is really going to have to change.'' &QL;

GREEN IS TALK OF TEMPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rabbi Aaron Kriegel heard worshipers Monday
evening at Temple Ner Maarav in Encino chatting about one topic and
one topic only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, I believe, three bombs went off in Netanya, in
Israel. (Fourteen) people were injured,'' Kriegel said Tuesday.
``But to listen to my congregation last night, you'd have thought
the major news of the day was Shawn Green.''
</P>
<P>
   -0- -0- -0-
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Donald Goor of Temple Judea in Tarzana went to dinner
Monday at the West Los Angeles home of friends who are big baseball
fans. The television report of the Dodgers' trade for Green _ and
his new $14 million-a-year contract _ brought a boisterous
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first comments was, `Jewish boy makes good!' ''
Goor said Tuesday, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   -0- -0- -0-
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Journal, a Los Angeles-based weekly, published an
article on Green and other Jewish major-leaguers last summer, the
first sports-related cover story in the newspaper's 14-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a huge reaction to our cover, probably one of our most
popular covers ever,'' managing editor Rob Eshman said Tuesday.
``There's just a large, latent pool of Jewish pride over Jewish
ballplayers. We got letters (saying), `What about Jewish HOCKEY
players?' ''
</P>
<P>
   -0- -0- -0-
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters, typically squeamish about topics like religion,
ethnicity and nationality, might not be sure how to address the
fact that Shawn Green _ the 27-year-old right fielder the Dodgers
acquired Monday in a four-player trade sending Raul Mondesi to the
Toronto Blue Jays _ is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't sure Tuesday morning. So I asked some L.A. Jewish
community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Now I think we'd be wrong if we attach too much significance to
it, and worse if we attach too little.
</P>
<P>
   Green's arrival is, yes, a significant moment for many of the
approximately half-million Jews in Los Angeles, bringing nostalgia
to those who are old enough to remember Sandy Koufax and the Sherry
brothers, Norm and Larry, and bringing a novel sense of pride to
those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
   What Fernandomania meant to Mexican-Americans, what Nomomania
meant to Japanese-Americans and what Chan Ho Park means to
Korean-Americans, Green can represent to another slice of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Eshman quoted from the editorial that accompanied the Jewish
Journal story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote . . . `Who knows why it's important to people?'
There's something mysterious about it,'' Eshman said. ``But it has
to do with identity. It has to do with self-esteem. It (can be)
inspiring for young Jewish kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the United States, where there isn't this Jewish
macho ethic, they look more to ballplayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Eshman spoke from personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up as a Sandy Koufax fan,'' he said. ``I used to wander
back and forth in front of his house in Malibu. I didn't even know
if it WAS his house. Someone told me it was. I just hoped to catch
a glimpse of him.''
</P>
<P>
   For Goor, the significance lies in the old joke about the book
of Jewish sports heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, the book is pretty thin,'' he said. ``That
makes it all the more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Goor said what's important isn't only whether a successful
athlete was born with Jewish blood, but whether he or she lives by
Jewish principles and tradition, as Koufax did famously when he
refused to pitch a World Series game on Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be a model for what it means to be Jewish,'' he
said. ``Being involved in the community and caring about the world
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   What excites Kriegel is the fact that Green, a Tustin native,
seems to have embraced that role as his fame has increased and
asked to be traded to a U.S. city with a large Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's trying to live into that position. I think he
recognizes he's walking in the shoes of Sandy Koufax,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kriegel pointed out the downside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're always hurt when we have someone who's famous
who acts against the law or in an immoral way,'' he said. ``So if
he does something bad, every Jew will take it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   One man said the topic made him uncomfortable, fearing that by
talking about ``the great Jewish athlete,'' he would sound
defensive, ``as if we need to say, `Look at us, we're not all _
what? _ doctors and lawyers or whatever it is we're supposed to
be.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another, Rabbi Jim Kaufman of Temple Beth Hillel in Valley
Village, wondered why a Jewish ballplayer should be held up as a
greater role model than a Jewish teacher or Jewish policeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will (Green) be an inspiration to Jewish kids? I don't think
they need inspiration,'' Kaufman said. ``I've got kids in my
congregation who want to be ballplayers. I don't think they need a
green light.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``As a Jewish leader, I would say it's
neat.'' &UR; !dlim!!end!

MATTHAEUS IS THE LATEST SAVIOR OF THE METROSTARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Italy)   By ALEX YANNIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In signing Germany's Lothar Matthaeus, the MetroStars
and Major League Soccer gained a star of the first light. At his
first news conference as a member of the MetroStars in midtown
Manhattan Tuesday, everyone seemed to bask in his glow.
</P>
<P>
   His introduction resembled the fanfare generated by Pele and
Franz Beckenbauer of the Cosmos two decades ago. Television
cameramen and still photographers jostled for position, a crush of
reporters asked questions in several languages and even the food
was up to Cosmos' vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus comes with the mandate of helping to establish
professional soccer in this country, a challenge he accepts
enthusiastically. ``I don't feel one player alone can make a
difference,'' he said Tuesday. ``But together with a new
commitment, we will be able to turn this around and accomplish as
much success as I have accomplished in my 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pele and Beckenbauer said basically the same thing when
they came to play with the Cosmos. The comparisons to the
superstars that preceded Matthaeus onto the New York stage only
begin here.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pele and Beckenbauer, who came to the United States from
Brazil and Germany in the latter stages of legendary careers,
Matthaeus will make his MetroStars debut at Giants Stadium this
spring at age 39. Like Pele and Beckenbauer, Matthaeus plays soccer
with the vigor and exuberance of a teenager and can accelerate as
well as he did nine years ago, when he captained Germany to the
World Cup triumph in the 1990 World Cup in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pele and Beckenbauer, Matthaeus answers all questions with
ebullience and eye contact. The 5-foot-8-inch, 155-pound Matthaeus
has lost little, if any, of his physical gifts at this stage of his
career. He was named the player of the year last season in the
Bundesliga, one of the strongest and most demanding leagues in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main things is that I'm having fun,'' Matthaeus said
simply when asked how he had been able to maintain his remarkable
level of performance. ``The attitude I have is that soccer is my
hobby, not a job. If you have that attitude, you can succeed at any
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus has enjoyed success throughout his career, which
started in the Bundesliga with Borussia Moenchengladbach 21 years
ago. He moved to Bayern Munich in 1984 and played four seasons
there before going to Inter Milan for four years, leading Inter to
the Italian championship in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus returned to Germany in 1992 and has played with Bayern
Munich since. Bayern's current president is none other than
Beckenbauer, the man they called Kaiser in Germany. Like
Beckenbauer did two decades ago for Bayen, Matthaeus helped Bayern
Munich capture its 15th German title and reach the European
Champions' League final last season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest triumph for Matthaeus was in 1990 in the
World Cup in Italy, where he captained Germany to its third World
Cup victory. Beckenbauer, who was the captain of West Germany in
1974 in West Germany's second World Cup triumph _ the first came in
1954 _ was the coach of Germany in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus would like to follow Beckenbauer's steps in the United
States. Beckenbauer came to the Cosmos from Bayern Munich in 1977
and, with a great deal of help from Pele, led the Cosmos to the
championship that year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pele and Beckenbauer, who lived on Manhattan's East Side,
Matthaeus prefers the West Side for the simple reason that ``it's
closer to New Jersey,'' he said with a laugh, ``and that's where I
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus was followed by about 40 European journalists on his
trip to New York. He will be returning to Munich Wednesday morning.
He said the thing he disliked the most about New York City was the
traffic. The thing he liked the most, Matthaeus said, was that he
went around asking people if they knew the name Lothar Matthaeus
and they said no.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that his name would go unidentified in most of
the rest of the world. Matthaeus, after all, is the only field
player in the world to have played in five World Cups, the other
being Mexico's legendary goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal. He has played
142 games for Germany and has been named player of the year twice
in his native country and world player of the year once, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present is what matters now,'' Matthaeus said. ``I want to
help the MetroStars. One player cannot do it, but I saw two games
of the team on video and I think we have some good young players.''

COMMENTARY: THE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REMOVES ``the'' from before ``Israel proper'' in 9th graf) (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who have spent the past decades tracking the
Arab-Israeli peace process, this is indeed an auspicious week.
Finally, finally, finally, we are really at the final negotiations,
which began Monday in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   As the moment arrives, however, we find a surprise waiting for
us. People are focused on the huge territorial gap between the
Arabs and Israelis. But that's not the key issue. The key issue is
what to do with two core groups of people _ the 100,000-plus
Israeli settlers living inside the West Bank, who want to stay, and
the roughly two million Palestinian refugees living outside the
West Bank, who want to return there and to Israel proper.
</P>
<P>
   How the refugees and the settlers are dealt with is the key
because these two groups symbolize the original causes of the
conflict. The Palestine Liberation Organization was formed to
galvanize the refugees into an armed movement to reclaim their
homes _ in the West Bank and Israel. And the West Bank settlers
were galvanized to take Zionist ideology about reclaiming the Land
of Israel to its logical conclusion, by seeking to settle all the
land of biblical Israel between the Mediterranean and the Jordan
River.
</P>
<P>
   Without addressing _ or explicitly limiting _ the claims raised
by these two groups it will be impossible to say that the core of
this conflict has been resolved. There is no way for the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, or Israel's prime minister, Ehud
Barak, to deal with the end of this conflict without dealing with
the beginning. But this stuff is political dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two groups of people in this negotiation who are
totally indigestible by the other side _ the settlers and the
refugees,'' says Stephen P. Cohen, of the Center for Middle East
Peace. ``Barak wants a deal whereby Arafat has to digest most of
the settlers and Arafat wants a deal whereby Barak has to digest
most of the refugees. How they balance the two is going to be the
key to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, for now, are demanding the right of all
Palestinian refugees to return to their original homes in the West
Bank, Gaza or Israel, and to receive compensation. Arafat feels he
must make this demand to prevent the refugees now living in
Lebanon, Syria and Jordan from scuttling any final peace. And
Barak, for now, is offering a deal in which the vast majority of
settlers will get to stay where they are in the West Bank _ and
only a few isolated settlements would be uprooted. Barak hopes that
by letting most of the settlers stay they won't block a deal to
create a Palestinian state in the rest of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak refuses to accept any Palestinian refugees back into
Israel. He is counting on
</P>
<P>
   Arafat absorbing some of them into the West Bank and Gaza, and
the rest being taken by the Arab states. What Barak seems to be
figuring is that in the crunch, with the balance of power so much
in Israel's favor, Arafat will have to eat most of the Jewish
settlers in the West Bank, without Barak having to eat any of the
refugees inside Israel. But it is not going to be so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the painful conversation Barak and Arafat are about to
have. Barak will say to Arafat: ``If you want to get a state, you
need to help me with my political problem, and that is the
settlers. You've got to eat most of them. And anyway, that's the
price you have to pay for launching a war against us in 1967.'' And
Arafat will reply: ``If you want me to help you with your political
problem, you have to help me with mine. You have to radically
reduce the number of settlers in the West Bank and the amount of
territory you keep there for security so that I have room to settle
the refugees. And you are going to have to take at least a symbolic
number of refugees back into Israel proper _ if I have to take some
settlers. I can't help you solve your political problem if you
can't help me solve mine.``
</P>
<P>
   As Cohen notes: ``Either Arafat and Barak agree that both the
settlers and refugees are not going to be accommodated very much in
a final deal, or they will have to acknowledge that the final deal
is going to go beyond pragmatic partition and include some
recognition of each other's original ideological claims _ that the
Jews are connected to all of the Land of Israel and the
Palestinians are connected to all of Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the core trade-off, and, as I said, this is dynamite.

<P>
   To keep guests from plugging in their laptops for hours and
tying up trunk lines, a growing number of hotels are imposing new
fees on extended use of local and toll-free telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheraton, Westin and Four Points hotels, all Starwood Hotels and
Resorts Worldwide chains, are the latest to charge these fees. The
three companies impose a surcharge of 10 cents a minute on
toll-free calls that last longer than 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hilton Hotels Corp. set a similar policy; its hotels
charge 10 cents a minute for local and toll-free calls longer than
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In most markets, Wyndham Hotels &AMP; Resorts, a unit of Wyndham
International, is charging between 25 cents and 95 cents for both
local and toll-free calls, regardless of length. Wyndham Hotels
president Les Bentley said, though, that this policy is not
enforced in many suburban markets, or if guests complain.
</P>
<P>
   Hyatt Hotels Corp. is now conducting a trial at the Hyatt
Regency Chicago in which it is charging a fee of 10 cents a minute
for toll-free calls that are longer than 20 minutes, according to
Gary Ross, a spokesman for Hyatt. He said that the test would last
another few months, but that he could not comment on findings so
far.
</P>
<P>
   And Jennifer Ploszaj, a spokeswoman for Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts, a
division of Bass PLC, said that United States hotels operated under
the Bass Inter-Continental brand could charge a fee for toll-free
calls if desired for competitive reasons. But she said that other
Bass hotel brands _ which include Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express
and Crowne Plaza Hotels &AMP; Resorts _ were not charging such fees.
</P>
<P>
   Julieann Knudsen, manager of telecommunications for Carlson
Hospitality Worldwide, which operates Radisson and Country Inns and
Suites hotels, said the company had considered imposing fees on
lengthy toll-free phone calls, but so far had decided not to charge
them. And a spokesman for Marriott International said that his
company _ whose chains include Marriott, Courtyard by Marriott,
Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn and Renaissance hotels _ has no plans
to impose such fees.
</P>
<P>
   Many hotel companies say that once they offer high-speed
Internet access in guest rooms _ something many are in the process
of installing _ the phone-line problem caused by laptop users will
end.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Rutstein, an analyst with Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., disagrees. He said it would ``probably be another
couple of years before employees of the majority of U.S. companies
can use the Internet for a secure connection to their home network.
In the meantime, a lot of companies will still require employees to
dial up directly to get their e-mail or contact headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Hanson, who heads the lodging practice at
PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that an even greater number of hotels
independently impose phone surcharges than their management
companies realize; he believes almost half of all hotels in the
United States impose such fees. And he predicted that 65 percent of
all American hotels would charge these fees in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels have imposed these fees _ along with new or higher fees
for parking, minibar items and business center services _ to
generate revenue as occupancy rates decline, he said. And he said
that they are not always using income from the telephone fees to
upgrade their telecommunications systems.
</P>
<P>
   Rutstein said such upgrades are actually not necessary in the
long run because travelers will eventually be able to access their
corporate network through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Parking at Newark Airport  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is eliminating 540
parking spaces in the parking lots of Terminal C at Newark
International Airport as it begins a $1.5 billion redevelopment
program there.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate parking for travelers who normally use Terminal C's
daily parking lot is available in the daily parking lots of
terminals A and B; in the valet parking next to monorail station E;
and in monorail parking lots D and E.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials are advising travelers to allow an
extra 30 minutes to park while the redevelopment program is
underway. It is slated to be completed in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines is giving small businesses special benefits
if they spend a minimum of $7,500 a quarter traveling on the
carrier. Benefits include upgrades on domestic flights, free
domestic tickets, membership in TWA's airport lounges, and elite
status in its frequent-flier program. A maximum of 10 employees of
each company can participate in the program; all must join TWA's
frequent-flier program.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways is showing programming from the FOX News Channel on
its A320 shuttle flights between LaGuardia Airport in New York and
both Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington and Logan
International Airport in Boston.

SEEKING A HIT, SOMETIMES WITHOUT HIS BAT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAN HOFFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An argument could be made that Steve Friedman has
mellowed. It was already 7:20 a.m. and he had downed only his
second Diet Coke. He had left his favorite prop, a baseball bat, at
the office, rather than lugging it into the control room of his
latest network morning show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe that the place I said didn't have a brain
or a pulse is saving my career,'' Friedman remarked. For him, that
passed for abject humility.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman was referring to CBS, which has poured $30 million into
its latest plea for morning viewers, ``The Early Show,'' which made
its debut last week. It reunites the smart and smug Bryant Gumbel
with his buddy and executive producer from NBC's ``Today,'' the
smart and smug Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after Monday's show in the General Motors building in
Manhattan, Gumbel said that in the 27 years he had known him,
Friedman had not changed _ expanding waistline excepted _ at all.
</P>
<P>
   Many are the walking wounded in television who find that
observation not only true, but terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   For Friedman may be a deft maker of his own myth _ ``I might be
an egomaniac but I don't know how raving I am'' _ but his behavior
is still as obstreperous as everyone, himself included, reports it
to be. He did greet the demoralized veteran staff of CBS's
perennially third-place morning show with a ``my way or the
highway'' speech. Badmouths the competition, loudly and often.
Slams phones and doors. Bangs the baseball bat on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Reality check: that old tale about his smashing a TV monitor
with a bat? False. He used a cowboy boot.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the craziness is calculated. Friedman has also inspired
legions of loyalists. Later that morning, while planning segments
with producers _ a soccer player with a walker? John McCain? Jada
Pinkett? _ he was firm but not rigid, bowing to collective
pressure: ``OK, OK! You can have the pandas!''
</P>
<P>
   There is, perhaps, less at stake for Friedman this time around,
for he has already made his mark in television history. He turned a
reflective morning show into a spot news gatherer for viewers
hungry for emerging details about assassinations and natural
disasters. He married Gumbel improbably and well to Jane Pauley,
and sent them on eye-filling trips around the world. Years later,
during a second tenure at ``Today,'' his was among the voices that
persuaded the network, at long last, to approve a $15 million
studio that allowed Gumbel and Katie Couric to interact with crowds
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also been associated with spectacular flops. He left
``Today'' the first time to turn USA Today into a television show _
a $40 million disaster. In the four years since he rejoined and
again left ``Today,'' unpleasantly, he has held more modest
positions, most recently as vice president of WCBS-TV, the
network's New York station.
</P>
<P>
   It could be said that at 53, Friedman wants to prove he can
still lure viewers with his uncanny ability to package news and
entertainment, live.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect is expensive and daunting; there is a new caution
in his customary bravado. Friedman said he would be happy if he
could turn ``The Early Show'' into ``a competitive third'' by next
May, when he expects ``Good Morning America'' to be vulnerable
because Diane Sawyer has said she wants to leave then.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is happily back scanning 40 monitors simultaneously
at dawn in the control room. On Monday, he rocked side to side,
gnawing his key chain, barking orders: ``OK, after this answer we
move on! Come to a full shot on Janie!'' _ Jane Clayson, the
co-anchor _ ``Keep 'em to time!''
</P>
<P>
   An aside: ``It's relentless, and I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   A true creature of the medium, he relaxes at his Manhattan
apartment with his wife of 30 years, ``the lovely Ms. Beverly,''
watching TV. Restlessly tossing a Wrigley Field baseball in his
office after the show, he proudly identified himself as a fan of
``Providence,'' the NBC sap-opera. ``In my personal life, I'm a
soft, sensitive guy,'' he crooned, an observation that, in fact,
has been seconded by others.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman came by his bullish confidence as the firstborn son who
could do no wrong in the eyes of his father, a Chicago grocer, and
mother, who toiled in a bakery. They applauded his smart-mouth
remarks, his escapades, his racetrack bets. From his Hungarian
grandmother he learned to be brazen and fierce: Seeing her
12-year-old grandson, then a hulking athlete larger than the other
boys, buried under a backyard football tackle, she yelled, ``Don't
hurt my Stevie!'' and flung boiling water at his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that at 16, Friedman, angry at a baseball coach,
deliberately pitched at the man's son, breaking his arm.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he stayed up late watching Jack Paar. He majored in
radio and television at the University of Illinois and then landed
at KNBC-TV in Los Angeles as a news writer. There he met Gumbel and
Tom Brokaw, and began his ascent.
</P>
<P>
   In the television business, he is known as a ruthless competitor
whose recklessness is a strength and a weakness. Even Gumbel, whom
Friedman calls ``B.G.,'' has said he's the type who throws a bomb
first and then checks to see if there's anyone in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman shrugged happily. ``I've been fired before and I'll be
fired again,'' he said.

HASKEL FRANKEL, AUTHOR AND THEATER CRITIC, DIES AT 73  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haskel Frankel, a prolific author and theater critic, died last
Wednesday in Chester, Conn. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who had suffered several strokes over the last decade,
died after a short illness, said his nephew, Seth Wolk.
</P>
<P>
   A theater buff who pursued acting early in life, Frankel
abandoned the stage for writing shortly after World War II, during
which he had worked on an Army base newspaper. His first job was
writing synopses of submissions to the office of Harold Freedman, a
New York literary agent, a job that eventually led to Frankel's
writing fiction himself.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, he wrote what he described as ``trashy
paperbacks'' under the pseudonym Frank Haskel, turning out pulpy
prose with titles like ``Backstage Doctor.'' He also wrote a series
of books for young readers for Doubleday's Signal Books on
everything from championship football games to rodeos. He wrote,
with Basil Davidson, ``A Guide to African History'' (1965).
</P>
<P>
   Frankel worked as a freelance book and theater critic for
publications including The New York Times, The Saturday Evening
Post, The Saturday Review, Show magazine and Playbill. Between 1974
and 1982, he served as theater critic for the Westchester and
Connecticut Weekly sections of The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel also helped write several works credited to prominent
performers, including ``Respect for Acting'' (1973) by Uta Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth E. Frankel of Essex,
Conn., and a sister, Fredda Frankel Wolk of Baldwin, N.Y.  &QL;

MCMURTRIE GODLEY, 82, ENVOY TO LAOS DURING VIETNAM WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARTH HEALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   G. McMurtrie Godley, a U.S. ambassador to Laos during the
Vietnam War who played a central role in American efforts to defeat
Communist forces there, died on Sunday in Fox Hospital in Oneonta,
N.Y. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   His position in Laos, from 1969 to 1973, hampered his diplomatic
career. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee rejected his
nomination to be an assistant secretary of state for Far East Asian
affairs when he returned from Laos as American troops were pulling
out of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual statement, the committee chairman, J.W. Fulbright,
said Godley had been too closely identified with a failed policy in
Indochina to supervise American diplomatic efforts in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard M. Nixon instead appointed him to be
ambassador to Lebanon. He had earlier been ambassador to Congo as
part of a 35-year career in the foreign service.
</P>
<P>
   In Laos, Godley helped direct tens of thousands of Laotian and
Thai guerrillas who were fighting the Communist Pathet Lao and
North Vietnamese troops who used Laos as a base. Though Laos was
officially neutral, the guerrillas were organized and financed by
the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   His service there was examined again in August 1992, when the
Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs reviewed reports
that the United States had pulled out of Indochina without
accounting for all American prisoners of war. The Defense
Department and Senate investigators said as many as 135 American
service personnel might have still been held when the United States
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearings, Godley and other former members of the Nixon
administration insisted that they had all done their utmost to
account for all POWs, and that they believed that none remained in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   George McMurtrie Godley, known as Mac, was born in New York City
on Aug. 23, 1917. He graduated from the Hotchkiss School and Yale
and did graduate work at the University of Chicago before joining
the Foreign Service in 1941. He served in France, Switzerland,
Belgium, Cambodia and Congo before being named ambassador to Congo
in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his service in Lebanon ended in 1976, Godley received
a diagnosis of throat cancer, and his voice box was removed.
Despite that, he went on to become a founder and president of the
Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., and was chairman emeritus
when he died. He was also chairman of Hartwick College in Oneonta
and Fox Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He married Livia Paravicini, a former sergeant major in the
Swiss Army Ambulance Corps, in 1946. They were divorced in 1963. In
1966 he married Elizabeth McCray Johnson. She survives, as do their
children, George, of London, and Nicholas, of Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   Also surviving are a brother, Frederick, of New Canaan, Conn.,
and a sister, Anne St. Goar of Brookline, Mass., and seven nieces
and nephews.

MOM: `NO, NO!'

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Shannon Whittle sobbed and cried, ``No, no!'' as the
verdicts were read Tuesday, one after another, finding her guilty
of shaking her tiny quadruplets so hard that she damaged them for
life.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day of deliberations, a weary jury found Whittle
guilty of 13 of 14 counts of child abuse. At her sentencing Dec. 9,
she faces a minimum of 126 years in prison, because each term must
be served consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   She was found not guilty of causing a second brain injury to one
of her infants between March 9 and April 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Whittle's husband, Anthony Perez, heaved with sobs as it was
announced that the jury had found him guilty of four counts of
failing to protect his children. He faces up to 35 years in prison,
but he could get probation.
</P>
<P>
   The Perez children were 4 months old when they were violently
shaken in the spring of 1998. They suffered fractured skulls,
retinal hemorrhages, broken bones and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   As the verdicts were read, Whittle turned to her stone-faced
mother and whispered, ``I love you, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   No juror looked at the couple as the verdicts were read.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot harder than people will ever know to sit there
and know that these people's lives are in your hands,'' juror Audry
Royse, 35, said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, nobody was a winner. But we felt we did the best
for the kids that we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Before excusing the jurors, Judge Roger Kaufman of Maricopa
County Superior Court offered them counseling services,
acknowledging that the six-week trial had been highly emotional.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdicts were read, Whittle, tears streaming down her
flushed face, asked her mother, ``All of them? All of them?'' Her
mother, dressed in black, simply closed her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Whittle dropped her head and told her attorney, ``They're so
wrong. They're so wrong. God knows I didn't hurt my children.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kaufman ordered the Avondale couple taken into custody,
Whittle again turned to her mother and said, ``Mom, I'm so
scared.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple stood and hugged tightly before each was handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Whittle asked the deputy, ``Can I give my Mom a hug first?''
</P>
<P>
   But she was led away with no hug from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad justice has been served for those babies,'' said
Kathi Norton, the children's court-appointed special advocate.
Norton sat silently in court every day during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy county attorney Karen O'Connor was on a field trip with
her son's third-grade class when she learned that the jury had
reached its verdict.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, a mother of two, said the case was particularly hard,
not only on her, but on the jurors who were repeatedly subjected to
pictures of tiny battered bodies and gory details of the babies'
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about the children all along,'' O'Connor
said, ``and as they were reading the verdicts, I was feeling relief
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The quads, now nearly 2, are in foster care, as is Whittle's
daughter, Erica, 8. The children probably will remain there and
potentially could be adopted by their foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Jr. is blind, deaf and will never talk or walk. His
sister, Megan, and brothers, Robert and Damian, weren't shaken as
hard, although their injuries have left them with developmental
delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beautiful kids,'' O'Connor told a news conference
after the verdict. ``They deserve closure and stability in their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She was hesitant to paint Whittle and Perez as monsters, saying
only, ``They did not live up to their responsibility as parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said she wasn't surprised by Whittle's courtroom
displays of disbelief. Throughout the trial, she sobbed and claimed
her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   And parents accused of child abuse rarely admit what they did,
said O'Connor, who is head of the County Attorney Office's family
violence division.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Whittle and Perez huddled protectively around
their distraught clients and refused to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   However, Whittle's lawyer, Jay Bloom, suggested in court that
they may appeal. He referred to several protests filed during the
trial, including the prosecution's use of Whittle's mental health
history as evidence that she hurt her children.
</P>
<P>
   Whittle's mother, Anita Whittle, declined to comment as she left
the courtroom, fighting back tears and waving away cameras and
microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Silverman, the founder of a shelter for battered women who
posted bail for Elizabeth Whittle and let Whittle live with her,
says Whittle was wrongly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a dangerous person,'' said Silverman, founder of
New Beginnings Transitional Home in Phoenix and Glendale. ``She is
a kind and loving person. A kind and loving person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terrified to see that you can be innocent and still
convicted. The jurors only got half-stories and lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverman believes the defense argument that Erica Whittle, who
has Down syndrome, hurt the babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she lovingly picked up the baby and squeezed it like a
doll and dropped it down,'' Silverman said after the verdict.
``Remember, we're talking about a child of diminished capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors contended that a 6-year-old isn't strong enough
to inflict such severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley said
the trial was one of the most difficult he and his prosecutors have
ever tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hurt their children, they need to be held accountable
for these horrible, horrible injuries,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   &LR; LAS VEGAS _ Lennox Lewis, who most believe dominated Evander
Holyfield in their first meeting in March, is certain Holyfield
knows it will happen again in the rematch here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knows he's going to get hurt. I think he just wants
to leave with all his faculties,'' a beaming Lewis said after a
public workout Tuesday before about 100 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Lewis is confident. Overly confident? No way.
</P>
<P>
   He knows from experience that one's plans could go awry in a
single moment: Oliver McCall, a journeyman heavyweight, stopped him
with a single, shocking punch in two rounds to take his WBC title
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who came back to KO McCall and regain the championship in
1997, insists the defeat doesn't haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he did learn a lesson: You don't throw caution
to the wind as he did in that fight. His dream is to unify the
heavyweight titles _ Holyfield holds the IBF and WBA belts _ and he
doesn't plan to blow it by fighting stupidly.
</P>
<P>
   Expect him to be more aggressive than he was in March _ but not
reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Larry Holmes once said, `You get them drunk and
!ital!then you take them out.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Add Lewis: Lewis thinks the IBF rankings-fixing scandal
shows he was right to be suspicious about his draw against Evander
Holyfield on March 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten it on good account that before the first
Holyfield-Lewis fight, Bob Lee said he had Holyfield as his
champion,'' Lewis said. ``He's the one who put Eugenia Williams
into my fight. Now everything is coming out and it just confirms to
me our suspicions of skullduggery going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams voted for Holyfield in the fight, which most observers
thought Lewis clearly won.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the IBF president, and three other men were indicted by a
federal grand jury last Thursday at Newark, N.J., on 32 counts of
soliciting and accepting bribes to fix rankings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Lost respect: Lewis has called Holyfield a hypocrite for
preaching a pious life while fathering children out of wedlock.
Tuesday, he took a few more cracks at Holyfield's character.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield refused to admit after their controversial draw in
March that he had in reality lost the fight. On top of that,
Holyfield attributed his mediocre performance in part to stomach
pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just making silly excuses,'' Lewis said. ``I didn't make
any excuses after the Oliver McCall fight. He hit me with a great
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said it would never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Candid comment: Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, believes
wholeheartedly that his fighter is the best heavyweight in the
world. At the same time, he understands why the public has yet to
embrace him as such.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tremendous potential,'' Steward said, ``but he hasn't
had that one great performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to win this fight with Holyfield very big to get that
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; No sparring: Steward is not allowing Lewis to spar this
week even though the fighter was inclined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Steward was concerned about the possibility of a cut or another
injury. Also, Lewis has sparred over 100 rounds in 10 weeks of
training, which is a big workload. Enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manny said, `No way,' &UR;  &LR; '' Lewis said. ``Anything can happen.
We don't want to take any risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world wants to see this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Nocturnal: In the past, Holyfield has trained at typical
hours, early in the morning and then again in the afternoon in the
weeks before a big fight.
</P>
<P>
   After the first Lewis fight, he made some logical adjustments:
He trains in the afternoon and again in the evening, around the
time he expects the fight to take place, so his body will be
ideally acclimated.
</P>
<P>
   He gets to sleep at 2 or 3 a.m. and begins his day around 11
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've done this,'' he said. ``It's
easier to train this way and I'll have the right body clock.''
