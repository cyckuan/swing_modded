<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even in the self-congratulatory sparkle of the East
Room of the White House, the words of caution rang loud and clear.
If it took 19 months of blood and insult and nine days of
extraordinary round-the-clock wrangling just to do things that were
supposed to have been done months ago, what superhuman intervention
would be required to surmount the truly formidable issues of
refugees, Jerusalem, water?
</P>
<P>
   The very name of the document that was signed by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat and
President Clinton after the wrenching talks at the Wye Plantation
had a hesitant ring _ ``Wye Memorandum.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke of ``a way station
on the path toward peace.'' Clinton warned that ``the forces of
hate will come again.'' Netanyahu declared that he was ``brimming
with some confidence, but not overconfidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet among the exhausted Israeli, Palestinian and U.S.
participants, there was a distinct sense that, however technical or
tentative the actual arrangements they had made, however certain
the knowledge that they would be disputed and violated, both
Netanyahu and Arafat had crossed a painful and fateful political
threshhold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This peace agreement represents not just the drawing of a new
territorial map, but the reconfiguring of the political map for
both side Oslo process
that both men had accused the other of undermining. The underlying
theory of the agreement, which devisd a staged process of
reconciliation leading slowly to a final settlement, was to allow
Jews and Arabs time to changetheir mutual perceptions, to cease
seeing the other as an existential threat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the architects of the treaty were optimistic in their
estimate of the time it would take, and the past 19 months will be
viewed as the time it took for Israelis to step back and take a
deeper breath and for Palestinians to adjust their expectations.
History may also judge that the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by
an extreme nationalist exposed so yawning an ideological divide
among the Jews that a whole new approach was required, with a
conservative at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Wye conference represented a gamble by Clinton
and Ms. Albright that both sides were ripe for a change. The fact
that a difficult election loomed close obviously contributed to the
calculation, though it also raised the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   After trying virtually every other negotiating approach, Clinton
went for the pressure cooker, summoning the principals and all
their top aides to an isolated farm, and devoting scores of his own
hours and sleepless nights to cajoling, mediating, nudging and
promising.
</P>
<P>
   Given the huge political risk to each leader, , both Netanyahu
and Arafat struggled mightily for the concessions that would
demonstrate to their people that their political shift carried
tangible benefits. The Israelis demanded concrete, guaranteed steps
against specific terrorists; they insisted on a public renunciation
of the vows to eradicate Israel in the old Palestinian Charter.
Arafat battled for a Palestinian airport, seaport, for safe passage
between Gaza and the West Bank, for the release of Palestinian
prisoners, for assurances that Israel would cede more land.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the last concession on which success hinged was
asked not of Netanyahu, not of Arafat, but of Clinton. With the
package almost tied up, Netanyahu required one more achievement he
could bring home to his right wing, and late Thursday, Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon came up with the key _ the United States
would release Jonathan Pollard, a convicted spy whose release has
long been demanded by Israel and who had taken Israeli citizenship
in prison. Arafat liked it, too: if Pollard were released, Arafat
would not be compelled to jail or extradite a Palestinian wanted by
Israel who now serves in the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently the U.S. intelligence agencies balked, adding
another several hours to the ninth day and leading Clinton to
insist at the ceremony that he had agreed only to review Pollard's
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The need by both Netanyahu and Arafat to assuage their critics
was clear in their comments. ``Today is a day when Israel and the
entire region are more secure,'' declared Netanyahu, while Arafat
went through the entire list of what he had gained, from the
airport to the prisoners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But to many who watched the ceremony, the more telling message
was not in the words, but in some of the images. Most striking was
the picture of the two Arab veterans, King Hussein of Jordan and
Arafat, both small, feeble and obviously ailing after lives spent
in struggle. Hussein, undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, was thin
and hairless, while Arafat's lower lip trembled uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the tall and hale president and Israeli, they hardly
looked like the existential threat to Israel they were supposed to
be. Netanyahu, for his part, seemed to struggle to keep his eyes
open after a sleepless night. After 29 months of bluster,
maneuvering and political struggle, he seemed tired and subdued.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was not any concrete concession or agreement, but
the cancer-ravaged king who was singled out by all sides as the
force that broke the deadlock. Though his words on Thursday night
were not made known, they seemed to render both Clinton and
Netanyahu misty-eyed when they recalled it. A man who obviously had
no agenda of his own left, and who had known this fray from the
beginning, the king added just the right dash of human and
historical perspective to an exercise that until then was purely
political and technical.

MAN IN IMMIGRANT SMUGGLING NOW DENIES GROUNDING SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man accused of masterminding the Golden Venture
voyage, an ill-fated effort to smuggle hundreds of Chinese
immigrants into the United States on a crumbling freighter, sought
Friday to take back a major part of the statement he made when he
pleaded guilty in the case.
</P>
<P>
   On the day that the man, Lee Peng Fei, was to be sentenced in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, his lawyer told the judge that
although Lee stood by his statement in March that he was an
organizer of the smuggling scheme, he was repudiating the part of
the statement in which he said he had directed that the ship be
grounded off Queens.
</P>
<P>
   After the ship was run aground off the Rockaway Peninsula on
June 6, 1993, it ended up on a sandbar, and many of the nearly 300
passengers leapt off to swim to shore in the early morning
darkness. Ten of them drowned or died of hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyer, James Moriarty, told Judge Reena Raggi that his
client now says he did not issue the order to ground the vessel.
When Lee said in court last March that he had done so, he had been
``extremely frightened'' that if he did not plead as he did he
would face 50 years in prison instead of a much shorter term,
Moriarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Moriarty maintained that the plea to the manslaughter and alien
smuggling charges was still valid, despite his client's withdrawal
of an important part of his plea statement. But the lawyer also
contended that if his client had not given the order, he should be
sentenced less harshly.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Raggi expressed reservations that the plea remained
valid, suggesting that if Lee was taking back a central portion of
his plea statement, the entire plea deal might have to be scrapped
and a trial held.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the judge, growing increasingly exasperated, said
that she did not understand what actions the defendant had admitted
to in his plea statement. She declined to sentence Lee, instead
ordering Moriarty, who was not his lawyer when he entered his plea
in March, to submit papers specifying what his client stands by in
the plea and what he repudiates. She scheduled another court
session for Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 46, a citizen of Taiwan, did not say anything during the
court session while an interpreter translated the proceedings for
him. Under the basic federal sentencing guidelines, Lee faces up to
three years in prison, but the judge may impose a significantly
harsher sentence if she finds that Lee was the leader of the
smuggling scheme and that his order led to the deaths. At Lee's
March plea, the judge suggested that she would impose a sentence
more severe than the guidelines, though she gave no specifics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say that Lee was not aboard the ship,
but ordered its grounding by telephone from Manhattan. They say the
deliberate grounding was a desperate attempt to land the passengers
after plans had gone awry for the freighter to be met at sea by
smaller craft that were to ferry the immigrants to shore.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmarish four-month voyage of the Golden Venture and the
deaths of some of its passengers threw a spotlight on the
widespread and lucrative smuggling of Chinese immigrants to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In court Friday, Moriarty also seemed to make differing
statements about his client's role in the smuggling scheme. In a
written statement to the judge, he denied that Lee, who is also
known as Char Lee and Charlie and Ma Lee, was the mastermind,
saying ``he was not the main organizer of this enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Moriarty told the judge that Lee ``clearly admits he
initially organized'' the venture and that ``the only thing'' he
repudiates is that ``it was he that directed that the ship come up
on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the 22nd person to stand convicted in the case. The
others, all of whom pleaded guilty to various charges, include
smugglers, so-called enforcers on board the vessel, and members of
the crew. They have received sentences ranging from less than a
year to 10 years in prison.

   BIRMINGHAM, England _ The chairman of Jaguar Cars Ltd., Nicholas
Scheele, put on a grand party this week on the eve of the British
International Motor Show here. It was a beautifully choreographed
affair inside a renovated factory in Castle Bromwich, a suburb a
few miles up the road. Nearly 1,000 luminaries attended from the
worlds of entertainment, sports and Ford Motor Co. _ Jaguar's
parent since 1989. There was excellent food and fine wines.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the spectacular affair was keyed to the
unveiling of a new midsize luxury sedan, the S-Type, which takes
direct aim at the BMW 5-Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. But
the event had another, unstated purpose: Ford was thumbing its
corporate nose at the rivals that had snickered that it paid far
too much _ $2.5 billion _ for Jaguar in the late 1980s. The cat is
back, and Ford wants the world to know it.
</P>
<P>
   The early skepticism was understandable, as Ford's next chief
executive, Jacques Nasser, acknowledged at the party. ``We suffered
buyer remorse after the sale _ a little sticker shock,'' he
conceded. The purchase price was only the beginning: Jaguar was
soon losing $1.5 million a week, its factories were dilapidated and
its pipeline of new models was bone-dry. Ford ended up pouring as
much $6 billion into the floundering British automaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tremendous ride over the past nine years,''
Alexander Trotman, Ford's chairman, told the gathering. Scheele
added, ``I don't think any of us would want to go down that road
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type symbolizes the turnaround under Ford, and it puts
Jaguar into the lower end of the luxury market, a segment it had
abandoned decades ago. Today, Scheele said, ``Jaguar can be fully
competitive with our German and Japanese rivals on any measure you
care to mention.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will sell a record 50,000 cars this year _ double
its sales of the early 1990s _ and executives expect sales to
double again once the S-Type reaches American showrooms in April. A
yet smaller Jaguar, known internally as the X400, is expected to
double Jaguar's annual sales again after it is introduced in 2001,
to more than 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new S-Type looks as slippery as a bar of soap. Its rounded
grille and wavy hood are obvious styling cues of the Mark II and
S-Type of the 1960s. ``If you have to read the badge, we've
failed,'' said Dave Szczupak, chief program engineer for the car.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar says prices will be competitive with the 5-Series, or
roughly $40,000 for the most basic V6 to $55,000 for the V8.
</P>
<P>
   An all-new 3-liter, 240-horsepower V6 is an example of the
cost-sharing benefits enjoyed by Jaguar under Ford's ownership; it
will be made at a Ford factory in Cleveland. The automatic
transmission is a new Ford unit, too. The 4-liter V8, which
produces 281 horsepower, is already used in the larger XJ8 sedan
and XK8 roadster and coupe.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest example of cost-sharing can be found in
the S-Type's platform, which is also being used for the new Lincoln
LS and the next Ford Thunderbird.
</P>
<P>
   It all goes a long way toward explaining the celebratory mood
here. Scheele said, ``The S-Type represents the first stage of a
dramatic, product-led expansion of the company over the next four
years, which will attract a new generation of customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type was not the only important newcomer at the Birmingham
show. The Rover Group pulled the wraps off its 75 sedan, a
potential rival to the S-Type and the first Rover to be fully
designed and developed under the ownership of BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The European luxury market is getting yet another contender from
Toyota's Lexus division, which has been unable in Europe to
duplicate its success in the United States. The Lexus IS 200, a
small, sporty sedan aimed at the BMW 3-Series, the Audi A4 and the
Mercedes-Benz C-Class, goes on sale in the spring. Neither Rover
nor Lexus would say whether they would bring the new models to
North America.

EDITORIAL: FOR THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE SUBURBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 24:
</P>
<P>
   In suburban counties outside New York City, many legislative
races are virtually decided, most in favor of incumbents. These are
our endorsements for some races that are considered competitive:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York State Assembly District Three (Suffolk): Voters in this
conservative district have a right to be confused. The Democratic
candidate for this Assembly seat was once a Republican, and the
Republican Party's candidate is a registered Democrat. Debra
Mazzarelli, the incumbent, was elected a Republican but shed her
GOP credentials to become a Democrat. She infuriated Republican
leaders by accusing them of giving short shrift to women, children
and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Very quickly this race has taken on the feel of blood sport,
with Republican State Committee ads that simply say ``Vote No on
Debra Mazzarelli'' without mentioning her opponent, Icilio Bianchi.
Bianchi, a Democrat who was unseated by Ms. Mazzarelli in 1994,
says that if elected he is not certain whether he will remain a
Democrat or become a Republican. This revenge politics might be
enough to make us side with Ms. Mazzarelli, but her efforts on
women's issues and her credentials as an independent political
force make her our distinct choice for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly District Four (Suffolk): Steven Englebright, the
Democratic incumbent, has a tough battle this year running against
John LaValle, an articulate Republican who is a Brookhaven town
board member. Both candidates have help from their state parties.
Some of the GOP ads for LaValle, however, seem crude even by
today's standards. An anti-crime brochure depicts a prisoner who
looks like Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, and another shows a
serene lake scene that is not in the district. The candidates and
the voters deserve better. For his efforts to pursue district
issues while maintaining an eye on larger questions for the state,
we endorse Englebright.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly District Five (Suffolk): Paul Harenberg, the Democratic
incumbent since 1974, is a diligent and thoughtful legislator who
has tackled such difficult issues as elderly abuse, HMO reform and
help for first-time home buyers. His Republican opponent, Pierce
Cohalan, is an engaging 31-year-old assistant district attorney
whose father is a judge and whose forebears have made their name in
politics going back to Tammany Hall. Despite Cohalan's promising
start, we endorse Harenberg for his excellent record.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly District 89 (northern Westchester): Voters in this lush
suburban area have the luxury of choosing between two excellent
candidates _ Naomi Matusow, the Democratic incumbent, and Ursula
LaMotte, the Republican challenger. Ms. LaMotte, a moderate,
pro-choice Republican, labels herself a ``tax fighter.'' She has
also been a civic leader working for children's and women's issues.
For all those strengths, we see no reason to oust Ms. Matusow, who
has a solid record on environmental issues, senior health care and
higher education. She has also done an admirable job fighting for
tax relief in Albany, where, as she puts it, she must overcome the
idea that she comes from Camelot where everybody is rich. Her pitch
is to help older residents who want to stay in their homes but find
property taxes prohibitive. We endorse Ms. Matusow.

   WASHINGTON _ After nine days and nights of tortuous
negotiations, Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel Friday signed a modest
agreement that restores life to the Middle East peace effort and
opens the way for talks on a final resolution of the 50-year-old
fight over whether the Palestinians will have a state.
</P>
<P>
   A proud, relieved President Clinton, who had seen the agreement
threatened by a last-minute dispute with Netanyahu over the fate of
the spy Jonathan Jay Pollard, presided over the signing ceremony in
the White House. He was joined as host by a visibly ailing King
Hussein of Jordan, who had been called in to push the talks toward
a conclusion and spoke movingly of a search for peace that has
consumed much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the king, wan and hairless from the effects of
cancer therapy, beside the aged Arafat, still in his familiar
headdress and uniform but with the trembling lip caused by ill
health poignantly visible, seemed to underscore the long,
debilitating path to even this relatively modest breakthrough in
the talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement in part serves to commit the two sides once again
to actions they had already promised in 1993 and 1995 in agreements
in Oslo, setting a detailed timetable for the Israelis to withdraw
from 13 percent more of the West Bank in three phases over 12 weeks
starting as soon as the agreement is ratified. That would bring to
40 percent the total territory that the Palestinians control fully
or partially. In return the accord provides for specific steps by
the Palestinians to fight terrorism and formally amend its charter
to expunge clauses calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Netanyahu, who make no attempt to disguise their
personal dislike, Friday shook hands under the gaze of the king of
Jordan and spoke words of peace and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never leave the peace process, and we will never go
back to violence and confrontation,'' Arafat said to applause in
the White House East Room.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu declared: ``Today is a day when Israel and our entire
region are more secure. Now this has required sacrifice from both
sides, and reaching into what Lincoln called the better nature of
mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the agreement an effort ``to rebuild trust and
renew hope for peace.'' But he urged the leaders to ``carry out
their commitments'' and to have the courage to withstand the
inevitable attacks from ``the enemies of peace'' from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   This final tableau of hope and self-congratulation was delayed
and slightly soured, officials said, by an extraordinary
last-minute demand by Netanyahu _ at 7 a.m. after the final
substance of the accord had been settled during a sleepless night _
that the United States release Pollard, an American convicted of
spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected the demand to release Pollard, imprisoned since
1985, immediately. But he promised at the White House ceremony ``to
review this matter seriously,'' a significant concession in itself
since this president and two predecessors have reviewed and
rejected numerous appeals for pardon, clemency and parole for
Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   In return for this public promise, which may help Netanyahu with
his right wing at home, officials said, the Israeli prime minister
agreed to sign Friday's agreement and not renege on his promise to
release 750 Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This agreement is designed to carry out long-delayed Israeli
withdrawals from the West Bank called for under the 1993 and 1995
Oslo accords. Netanyahu campaigned for office as an opponent of
those accords, by which Israel and the Palestinians recognize each
other's right to live in peace and commit themselves to
negotiations on a final settlement between them.
</P>
<P>
   These withdrawals were supposed to take place as interim steps,
to build up confidence, but instead they created a mounting crisis
of mistrust and anger, as Netanyahu insisted that the Palestinians
keep specific commitments to fight terrorism and restrain the
number of weapons in areas they control in return for land.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enormous American efforts, it has taken 19 months _ and
then these 9 long days and nearly 90 hours of Clinton's own time _
to seal even this interim deal.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is ``a big step that came too late,'' Clinton
acknowledged. ``It is true that whatever we achieved is only
temporary and that it has been late, but our agreement underscores
that the peace process is going ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But compared with the risks and costs of failure, these talks
were an enormous success.
</P>
<P>
   However difficult the sessions at the Wye River Conference
Centers on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and however modest the
specifics of this deal, an inability to reach agreement here would
have had serious consequences for the Middle East and American
stature in the region, especially among Washington's moderate Arab
allies.
</P>
<P>
   With another crisis brewing with Iraq and with the deadline for
the entire Oslo process running out next May, senior U.S. officials
say, they understood that American strategic interests required
progress here and a quick start on trying to resolve the most
difficult questions of Palestine's borders, whether it will be a
state or not and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this accord, intensive negotiations are to begin
immediately on a final peace settlement between Israel and the
Palestinians, but given the delay and the onset of the Jewish
Sabbath, when the Israeli government does not work, those talks
could not get started Friday, as American officials had hoped.
Instead, they will open after this agreement is ratified, and
Clinton may invite these leaders back for another summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days before the Nov. 3 elections, the accord was also an
important diplomatic triumph for Clinton, who could bask in the
praise of the participants for his intensive and imaginative
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, in particular, was unstinting in his praise for
Clinton, calling him a tireless and boundlessly optimistic man with
``a precious and unique gift,'' the ability ``to nudge and prod and
suggest and use a nimble and flexible mind to truly explore the
possibilities of both sides, and never just on one side.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words, an American official said, helped ameliorate the
``sour mood'' created when Netanyahu ``created a needless crisis
this morning in a clumsy attempt to get something he could not
have,'' the release of Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Clinton praised Netanyahu for his strength, will and
grasp of detail. ``He showed himself willing to take political
risks for peace, but not to risk the security of his people,'' the
president said. ``As a result, this agreement embodies an enormous
increase in the security of the people of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's words also reflect an American judgment, officials
said, that Netanyahu is politically strong in Israel, despite his
willingness to anger his own right wing, and is likely to win
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu even thanked Arafat for his cooperation and his wishes
for a happy 49th birthday on the very day, Wednesday, that the
Israeli threatened to leave the talks before backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat spoke of Netanyahu as a ``co-partner'' in peace like his
favorite Israeli, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated in 1995. To applause, Arafat acknowledged the
difficulties of getting this accord but vowed, ``We will never
leave the peace process. and we will never go back to violence and
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hussein, who intervened at key moments in the talks, as the
Americans asked him to, with emotional appeals for peace and stern
admonishments for narrow politics, said Israel and the Palestinians
were moving in the right direction. The king appealed to the better
instincts of everyone in the East Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough
waste,'' the king said. ``And it's time that together we occupy a
place beyond ourselves, our peoples, that is worthy of them and of
their sons, the descendants of the children of Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders then signed the accords on a walnut conference table
bought by President Grant in 1869 and last used in 1994 for the
peace treaty between Jordan and Israel, signed by Rabin and
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   This accord marks an important and little understood deepening
and institutionalizing of the U.S. role in the Middle East. Not
only did Clinton promise yet more financial aid _ to Israel for
security measures and to the Palestinians for development. But the
CIA will play an uncomfortably visible role as the validator of
Palestinian performance on fighting terrorism, as it sits on a
committee with the heads of the Israeli and Palestinian security
services.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself will go, for the first time, officials believe,
to the Gaza Strip to preside over the Palestinian meeting that
amends the Palestinian charter. That could begin a new and more
formal relationship between the United States and the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement, with small variations from a longstanding
American proposal widely published in the past, gives benefits to
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis won the formal, public change in the Palestinian
charter that Netanyahu and his influential industry minister, Natan
Sharansky, have insisted upon: to remove the 26 clauses calling for
Israel's destruction. While Arafat says the clauses are long gone,
the Israelis demanded a formal vote by the large Palestine National
Council, which contains expatriates and terrorists living abroad.
While there is some fudging over how the Palestine National Council
will be defined in the accord _ it will be subsumed in a larger
gathering of other Palestinian organizations more easily controlled
by Arafat, and which Clinton has agreed to attend _ Israel will get
the public ``turning of the page'' that Sharansky wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have also won a Palestinian pledge to jail 30 of
the 31 Palestinians wanted in Israel for killing Israelis, while
the Central Intelligence Agency will monitor their incarceration
and their cases. Israel did not get Arafat to agree to jail the
chief of the Palestinian police in Gaza, Ghazi Jabali.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, for their part, got an agreement from the
Israelis to release 750 prisoners in three stages and a guarantee
that they will get a third Israeli redeployment from the West Bank,
as called for under the Oslo accords. But Israel gets to determine
the redeployment's size, which Netanyahu has told his Cabinet will
be between 1 percent and 2 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that will bring areas under Palestinian partial or full
control to more than 40 percent of the West Bank _ the basis for
the Palestinian state that Arafat dreams of and that even the
hawkish Israeli foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, admits is now
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether this agreement brings a Palestinian state
closer into being, an Arafat aide, Marwan Kanafani, smiled broadly
and said simply, ``Yes.''

POLLARD'S CONVICTION FOR SPYING REMAINS A DIVISIVE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add 400 wds. after 15th graf on U.S.-Israeli relations and
the Pollard case.)  (See also: MIDEAST-ACCORD, MIDEAST-ASSESS, MIDEAST-SPY,

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 13 years, the case against the convicted spy Jonathan Jay
Pollard has symbolized darker aspects of the normally warm
relationship between the United States and Israel while also
exposing fissures long dividing American and Israeli Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the Pollard case has emerged from the diplomatic
wings and crept toward center stage whenever U.S. and Israeli
leaders have sat down to talk. Rarely, though, has it been the
dominant force that it suddenly became on Friday, when it looked
for a while as though it might unsettle the latest peace agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite strong emotions in both Israel and this country
produced by Pollard's life sentence, the exact nature of his crimes
has never been fully clear.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters demanding his release from a federal prison in North
Carolina say he has served more than enough time, arguing that he
handed Israel strategic information that in their view the United
States should have been sharing with an ally from the start.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are officials of U.S. security agencies and
the Justice Department who say it is impossible to overstate the
damage that Pollard's espionage inflicted on U.S.
intelligence-gathering in the Middle East and possibly also in the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   From bits and pieces that the Defense Department has made
available to the courts, it is evident that Pollard gave the
Israelis intelligence on hostile Arab countries, including chemical
weapons production in Iraq and Syria, and Libya's air-defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Samson Option,'' his 1991 book on Israel's nuclear
program, Seymour Hersh wrote that Pollard also supplied top-secret
data on the Soviet Union's defenses, including the location of its
military targets. The Israelis, Hersh said, passed along some of
this material to Moscow as a goodwill gesture, presumably to
encourage more liberal emigration policies for Soviet Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this has been confirmed by Washington, which has
never laid out precisely what Pollard did, except to say that it
was serious _ a view that thus far has been sustained by three U.S.
presidents: Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Pollard acted on behalf of a friendly nation was
irrelevant, the chief prosecutor in the Pollard case, Joseph
diGenova, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States doesn't have two standards for spying,''
said diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
``It's all bad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pollard, now 44, was a civilian intelligence analyst for the
Navy in 1984 when he and his wife, Anne Henderson Pollard, began
feeding Israeli agents thousands of pages of highly classified data
from intelligence reports, electronic intercepts and satellite
photographs. The material was vast. Federal agents estimated that
if it was all put together, the stacks would stretch 6-feet wide,
6-feet long and 10-feet high.
</P>
<P>
   A bearded, somewhat bookish man, Pollard keenly felt his Jewish
identity, having grown up in South Bend, Ind., where his father
taught at Notre Dame and where he was the only Jew in his grade
school.
</P>
<P>
   When he decided in the mid-1980s that intelligence material in
his grasp had to be passed along to Israel, he worked through
several Israeli handlers. One of them was Raphael Eitan, a
spymaster who had taken part in the 1960 kidnapping of the Nazi war
criminal Adolf Eichmann, taking him from Argentina to Israel for
trial and eventual execution.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1985, it became clear to Jonathan and Anne Pollard
that the FBI was on their trail. They sought refuge in the Israeli
Embassy in Washington, only to be turned away at the gate and
arrested by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pollard, now divorced and living in Israel, was sentenced
in 1987 to five years in prison. But to the shock of some, a
federal judge handed her husband a life sentence. That put Pollard
in the same category as spies like John Walker and Aldrich Ames,
who sold secrets not to an ally but to the enemy Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly shocking for many was the tale of betrayal that
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. prosecutors charged that the Pollards had turned on their
country not only out of Zionist fervor but also for trips to Europe
and Israel and nearly $50,000 in cash. In turn, Pollard was
betrayed by the Israeli government, which said he was running a
rogue operation and it had nothing to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Americans stood accused of betraying Pollard
by supposedly reneging on a pledge that he would not receive a life
sentence by cooperating with the prosecution and pleading guilty.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bleak period for U.S.-Israeli relations. U.S.
investigators angrily accused Israeli officials of arrogant
stonewalling, while Israel and some American Jews charged that the
Americans _ in particular the defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger
_ had badly overreacted and were needlessly pummeling a trusted
ally.
</P>
<P>
   Longstanding frustrations within the Jewish world also burst
forth. Some in Israel sneered at leading U.S. Jewish groups as weak
cousins who disavowed or attacked Pollard only because they feared
being accused of ``double loyalties.'' American Jews snapped back
that the Israelis were blind to an overriding fact: Jews in this
country are indeed loyal Americans, and are not about to support a
Jewish spy just because he is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, moods have shifted. Many American
rabbis and lay leaders _ from across the political spectrum, though
most assertively on the right _ now say that Pollard has paid for
his sin and should be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Israeli prime ministers have made the same plea, none
more assertively then the present leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, whose
government finally acknowledged last May that, yes, Pollard had
acted as an Israeli agent. Israeli officials expressed hope that
this admission would make it easier for them to negotiate the spy's
release.
</P>
<P>
   But Pollard still sits in a cell in Butner, N.C., alternately
remorseful and defiant. Last year, he told an Israeli Cabinet
minister that he felt ``profound sorrow'' for what he had done. Yet
about the same time, he told an Israeli interviewer that he saw
himself as ``a front-line soldier forgotten deep in enemy
territory, taking a last stand on a small hill.''

CONFERENCE HARMFUL TO GAYS, UNANIMOUS L.A. COUNCIL SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The City Council unanimously condemned a
conference being held in Los Angeles at which conservatives are
discussing their belief that homosexuality is an illness that can
be cured.
</P>
<P>
   Council members and other critics said Friday that the Making
Sense of Homosexuality conference is in fact an anti-gay event that
will promote hate that can lead to violence against gays, like the
recent beating death of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not just about spewing hate, they are about
putting actual lives in danger, mine included,'' said Councilwoman
Jackie Goldberg, the only openly gay member of the City Council.
``It gives people permission to be angry enough to take violence
against individual members of my community.''
</P>
<P>
   An event organizer, Joseph Nicolosi of the National Association
for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, said the conference at
the Biltmore Hotel downtown is not promoting violence. He
criticized the City Council, saying its condemnation was made
without the facts and infringed on his group's free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a right to view homosexuality as a developmental
disorder,'' he said. ``What the council did is just a knee-jerk
reaction. They don't know who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsored by Nicolosi's association and the conservative
Claremont Institute, the conference began Friday and was expected
to be attended by 50 doctors, politicians, social scientists and
conservative activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose . . . is to explain to a wide audience how the
homosexual movement has targeted children, the family and popular
culture in its attempt to increase its numbers and acceptance in
society,'' stated a flier.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda includes the role of counselors and ``how children
are being indoctrinated through homosexual propaganda in school and
in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Constitutional scholars will discuss why homosexuality is not
a civil rights issue and how homosexuals are trying to destroy
organizations such as the Boy Scouts, which seek to promote decency
and traditional morality,'' the flier stated.
</P>
<P>
   Those scheduled to speak at the conference include state
Assemblyman Keith Olberg, R-Victorville, and state Sen. Raymond
Haynes, R-Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said it was ``highly inappropriate'' for the City Council
to condemn a scholarly discussion of issues affecting the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their argument is that this is divisive to talk about
something, then we are in bad shape in this country,'' he said.
``The last time I read the Constitution, we have free speech.
Saying citizens can't sit around a table to talk about a political
issue, they do that in totalitarian governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolosi said the group's belief that homosexuality is an
illness has drawn protests from the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a threat to the gay agenda, which says you are born with
it,'' he said. ``We're taking the position that homosexuality is
treatable. We believe people can change.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg denounced the theory as ``voodoo science'' and
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are about saying I can be cured,'' the councilwoman said.
``I have things probably that could be cured, but my sexual
orientation is not one of them, because it's part of who I am as
much as ethnicity and race is part of who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer introduced the motion, saying he respects
free-speech rights but believes the council has to take a stand
against something that he views as hateful and divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the results of a push in our society to
marginalize members of gay and lesbian communities,'' Feuer said.
``It dehumanizes them. It creates an environment where Matthew
Shepard's death can be perpetrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard Alarcon challenged the premise of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying one's sexual preference is so basic to our human
existence to think somebody can be recruited, to think that
lifestyles can be changed by some kind of propaganda instead of
some nature we are born with, is ridiculous,'' Alarcon said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Joel Wachs singled out the Claremont Institute,
saying, ``They need to be thoroughly and roundly condemned for
giving cover to a cowardly and disrespectful group.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the Claremont Institute did not return calls
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan also issued a statement in response to the
conference, saying: ``I condemn any and all rhetoric that preaches
hatred, intolerance or divisiveness. It has no place in the city of
Los Angeles.''

BACH GETS NO HELP IN KINGS DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The day already had been a dizzying whirl for Ryan
Bach, and now Manny Legace was skating to the bench, queasy and
woozy and suffering from a mild concussion and doing what all the
Kings' goaltenders eventually do, which is to leave a game with an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   And so, two nights after the 25-year-old Legace made his NHL
debut, the 25-year-old Bach got the exact same opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he didn't have more support from his teammates. The
Tampa Bay Lightning fired 23 shots at Bach in the 27-plus minutes
he played, scoring on two of them to send the Kings to a 3-2 loss
Friday night before an announced crowd of 8,708 at the Ice Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Bach could hardly be blamed, because even though he probably
should have stopped blasts form the right circle by Mikael Renberg
and Pavel Kubina, he had spent the bulk of his NHL debut keeping
the Kings' hopes alive. His finest save came late in the second
period, when he slid across the crease to make a pad save on a shot
from the right circle by defenseman Michal Sykora.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always in the back of your mind,'' Bach said when asked
if he'd ever dreamed when he was acquired by the Kings on Thursday
that he would get into a game so soon. ``As a goaltender, you
always have to be ready. Injuries happen, and when they do, it
seems they come in twos or threes.... The opportunity has been
given to me and I have to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in Friday's game, the Kings (2-2-2) had numerous
opportunities given to them by the generous Lightning defense and
came away empty every time. In the first period, they fired a
season-high 16 shots at Lightning goalie Bill Ranford, who stopped
every one.
</P>
<P>
   Ranford couldn't stop Russ Courtnall on a breakaway 1:28 into
the second period, but off the ensuing faceoff, the Kings came
close to scoring again, only to have the Tampa Bay goalie hurl his
body in front of a shot from a sharp angle by Ray Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a couple of diving stops, incredible stops,'' Kings
coach Larry Robinson said. ``Guys were just shaking their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranford also got a break a couple of minutes later when Doug
Bodger's apparent goal was waved off by referee Mark Faucette
because of an in-the-crease violation by Sandy Moger.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Legace was looking just as sharp as he had two nights
earlier, when he'd stopped 49 of 50 shots in a 1-1 tie with Florida
in the first game of this five-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   But 7:26 into the second period, with the Kings on a power play,
Steve Duchesne got caught deep in the Lightning zone and lost the
puck. Tampa Bay center Darcy Tucker put the puck past Legace, and
landed on the goalie's head in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, Legace felt queasy and left the game, giving
Bach his opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks earlier, Bach and Legace had played against each
other in the IHL, Bach for the Utah Grizzlies, Legace for the Long
Beach Ice Dogs, who won that game 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Legace was recalled by the Kings on Monday after Stephane Fiset
and Jamie Storr suffered groin injuries. The Kings traded a
conditional draft choice in 2000 to Detroit for Bach on Thursday.
Bach, 25, didn't arrive in Tampa until 4:30 Friday morning, and
wore his Red Wings pads and mask in the game, a severe fashion
mis-statement set against the Kings' purple and black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange things happen in hockey,'' Bach said. ``Two weeks ago,
we were in totally different organizations, playing against each
other. Two weeks later, we're in the same organization and on the
same team in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went flat when Bach entered the game, perhaps becoming
overly cautious in a desire to protect the rookie. But prevent
defenses are about as effective in hockey as in football, and after
outshooting Tampa Bay 28-15 with Legace in the game, the Kings were
outshot 23-11 the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new goalie comes in and you sit back and don't attack,''
defenseman Sean O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning (2-4-1), which has won its last two games, built a
3-1 lead with Renberg's goal at 4:55 and Kubina's at 17:01, but the
Kings caught Tampa Bay on a line change with 1:42 left, Ferraro
scoring off a lead pass from Rob Blake for his first goal of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings could not get the equalizer, and in many ways, the
game epitomized the early part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were 0 for 4 on the power play but killed all six
Lightning opportunities to extend their string of successful kills
to 22 over the last four games. Offensively, though, after starting
strong, the Kings got back into the same habits, not getting the
puck deep, trying to make fancy plays and paying for those failed
efforts with turnovers that resulted in Tampa Bay scoring chances.

JOHNSON LAYS DOWN THE LAW
</HEADLINE>

By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Raul Mondesi spent $30,000 last season on a pair
of earrings. He won't be wearing them on the field this year.
</P>
<P>
   On a losing team, which the Dodgers were most of 1998, telling a
star player he can't do something would cause quite a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But when Davey Johnson outlined a policy of no jewelry, facial
hair or blue jeans on his first day as Dodgers manager, he sounded
like he was tackling a much bigger issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning makes the rumbling go away,'' Johnson said. ``Those
are things that become problems when there is no focus or
discipline, no direction. That will not be the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's philosophy during 10 seasons as a major-league manager
has been difficult to pinpoint. He is considered a player's
manager, tough on some, soft on others.
</P>
<P>
   But the results are easy to spot _ the highest winning
percentage among active managers at .575 and five division titles
to go with a World Series championship in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as important to his new situation, he has taken
sluggish veterans teams like the Dodgers and recast them into
vibrant winners.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the manager in Baltimore who suggested iron man Cal
Ripken move from shortstop to third base. Ripken balked, then
ripped Johnson for making the plan public.
</P>
<P>
   But Ripken switched and the Orioles made playoff appearances in
Johnson's only two seasons with the club.
</P>
<P>
   With the New York Mets, where the constant fan and media frenzy
often has undone talented teams, Johnson averaged 98 victories in
his first five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was criticized for not keeping a lid on the players'
off-field pursuits that landed stars Dwight Gooden and Darryl
Strawberry in drug rehab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very saddened when those things happened, but people
forget those guys were winning 98 games a year and you don't do
that by playing drunk every night,'' Johnson said. ``Those guys
were professionals and it was reflected on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   All that makes any issues Gary Sheffield has about moving from
right field to left or wearing a goatee seem workable. Sheffield,
acquired from Florida last May, has indicated he is reluctant to go
to left, with Mondesi returning to right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Gary a long time, and I think there is a lot of
respect on both sides,'' Johnson said. ``He has one of the quickest
bats in baseball and, when he's healthy, he is one of its best
players. I also know he likes to win and he showed that when the
Marlins won the World Series last year. That can happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``No earrings? There goes the nose ring for next year,'' he
said. ``Hey, he's the manager. He's the one whose butt is the on
the line. The manager is the one who is going to answer the
questions, the one who takes the fall. He has the right to set down
rules. It's not a question of earrings. They don't win or lose
games. The issue is who's running the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were a sideshow for much of the 1998 season. The
sale of the team, the Mike Piazza trade, the firings of manager
Bill Russell and executive vice president Fred Claire. It left the
team with another year of poor clubhouse chemistry and a crushing
amount of guaranteed contracts for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   New general manager Kevin Malone remains optimistic he can keep
closer Jeff Shaw in L.A. even though Shaw can demand to be trade
because he was acquired from Cincinnati in the middle of a
multi-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Malone conceded it will take a renegotiation of Shaw contract,
which stands at $2.8 million for each of the next three years. Shaw
is critical to Johnson, whose strength is nurturing young pitching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Malone says one of his top priorities is restocking the Dodgers
middle and setup relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sixth, seventh and eighth innings were a big problem for
us last year,'' Malone said. ``Davey is great working with the
starters, but we need to be able to get to Shaw in the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says the rotation of Chan Ho Park, Ismael Valdes and
Darren Dreifort reminds him of the mid-1980s Mets staff of Dwight
Gooden, Ron Darling and David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing, trivial or not. Those three Dodgers all
grew goatees during last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to look like the Los Angeles Dodgers of old,''
Malone said. ``We're going to be first class all the way. We're
going to look like a championship club.''

BID FOR NFL FRANCHISE GETS BOOST FROM L.A. COUNCIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Upping the city's ante in a bid for a
professional football team, the Los Angeles City Council voted to
consider issuing tax-exempt bonds for a new coliseum, but only if
developers guarantee them, not city taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted 11-2 on Friday to make the offer a day after
the suburban city of Carson agreed to contribute up to $180 million
to a competing proposal by former super-agent Michael Ovitz to
build a new football stadium in that city.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides raised the stakes as they prepared to fly to
Kansas City on Tuesday to make their pitch to National Football
League owners considering who to give the next expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Houston is also a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said the council vote
Friday offered a stronger commitment by the city to support the New
Coliseum Ventures' proposal to build a state-of-the-art football
stadium inside the historic shell of the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's excellent AA/AA2 bond ratings will present
considerable advantages in working out project funding,''
Ridley-Thomas said. ``Public financing can be structured without
increasing taxes or city debt and include an owner's guarantee to
make up for any revenue shortfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas said he envisions the city serving as a conduit to
issue tax-exempt bonds that would be paid off through revenue from
the new coliseum and backed by the developers.
</P>
<P>
   If such bonds were issued for $216 million of the $357 million
coliseum construction project, it could save the developers
substantial money because the city's good bond rating would allow
lower interest rates on the financing, said John Semcken III, an
executive vice president with New Coliseum Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   However, some of Ridley-Thomas' colleagues were uncomfortable
with a motion that called for the council to commit to serving as a
conduit for bond financing. So the motion was amended to say the
city ``expresses its commitment and willingness to work with all of
the various parties to make this project succeed, including its
interest in exploring a role in the issuance of tax-exempt and
taxable bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer also insisted that the motion say no
general fund money will be used.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, council members Joel Wachs and Rita Walters voted for
the watered-down motion. Walters said she was uncomfortable seeing
Los Angeles go down the road of public financing in a competition
where another city is pledging $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it is time for municipalities to divorce
themselves from these kinds of deals,'' Walters said. ``I was
appalled that Carson is talking about $180 million. I know Los
Angeles cannot afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Joel Wachs did not speak during the debate, but he
said earlier that he is unwilling to approve public financing
without voter approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``(NFL team owners) are billionaires with multimillionaire
players, and they ought to pay for their own stadium,'' Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas said he has no intention of having city taxpayers
pick up part of the tab. The council vote was significant, he said,
coming just a few days after the Coliseum Commission approved a
two-year contract giving Los Angeles Kings hockey team owner Ed
Roski Jr. exclusive rights to negotiate for a new NFL team for the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Hernandez said he does not care whether
professional football returns to Los Angeles, but that bringing a
team back to the Coliseum could boost the economy of the Exposition
Park area.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are being asked to do today is nothing any other city
wouldn't do,'' Hernandez said of the financial commitment. ``It
will continue to put us in the hunt for a football team. It will
continue to make our bid competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mayor Richard Riordan made a videotape Friday to be
played for the owners, in which he pledges his support for the
Coliseum bid.

JOHNSON HAS WINNING TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Trying to figure out why Davey Johnson wins, you
could go back to his childhood in Texas, when his baseball
education began with brother Fred explaining the physics of the
curveball.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson once wrote, ``It's as though I've been going to a school
for managers since I was 7 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could go back to his early days as a major-league second
baseman under Hall of Fame manager Earl Weaver, when he got the
clubhouse reputation for asking too many questions.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was so inquisitive, the other Baltimore Orioles
nicknamed him Dum-Dum.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could just put it all down to a keenly developed
mathematical mind and a knack for reading people.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson does seem perfectly suited to a job that requires both
the left-brain talent for playing tactical percentages and the
right-brain talent for soothing massive egos.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could do what a lot of Davey watchers have done, which
is to quit wondering why he wins and just try to get him to do it
for !ital!you!off!.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what the Dodgers did Friday when, on the happiest day
of the club's post-O'Malley era, they introduced Johnson as their
new manager.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery, how he has made winning look so easy while managing
in the tough baseball neighborhoods of New York, Cincinnati and
Baltimore, is part of what makes his hiring here so appealing.
Let's all try to solve the puzzle together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around him, you don't always see the A, B, C, D,'' said
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who observed Johnson when
both were with the Orioles in 1996 and '97. ``You see point A and
you see the end result.... He's one of those guys who just win.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, as noted by a writer who covered him in
Baltimore, some evenings Johnson would stroll into the clubhouse a
mere two hours before game time, a golf bag over his shoulder, so
casual it was as if he expected the team to manage itself.
</P>
<P>
   He holds the highest winning percentage (.575) among active
managers.
</P>
<P>
   He's riding an astounding streak of finishing first or second in
his division in each of the 10 complete seasons he has managed,
including the 1986 Mets' World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   He's the greatest ``impact'' manager in baseball, his teams'
records having improved by an average of 15 games in his first year
on the job and declined by an average of 14 games in the year after
he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of all that has imbued Johnson, 55, with the
substantial quality that political people call ``heft.'' It's the
difference between Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson. It's the
difference between Davey Johnson and Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in a long time, the questions about the
Dodgers won't start with the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the shortcomings of the new Dodgers _ a disconnected
assortment of veteran players, fewer young prospects than before,
an owner with unclear ambitions _ they're nothing worse than
Johnson battled with the ego-ridden Mets, penny-pinching Marge
Schott's Reds and belligerent Peter Angelos' Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson responded wearily Friday to a reporter who asked if
he's ready for this ``big market'': ``I've been there before.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question about this Dodgers manager is going to be, Why
wasn't he their first choice all along?
</P>
<P>
   Malone explains that he had to pursue Felipe Alou and Jim
Leyland first because they had to decide whether to leave their '98
teams, while Johnson had been unemployed since he quit the Orioles
in '97 and could wait.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. The manager search might have been bruising for Malone
and worrisome for fans, but all's well that ends well, and this
ended very well.
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson, the Dodgers got a manager whose extraordinary
self-confidence already seems to have washed over the organization.
</P>
<P>
   They got a manager with strong opinions, among them the beliefs
that people perform best in familiar roles, that ``auditioning''
young players wrecks their confidence, that honesty is the best
policy in dealing with employees, that discipline in matters as
small as grooming and dress are important, that selfish players are
perfectly all right because ``they strive for perfection,'' and
that chemistry comes from winning rather than vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Is something on that list the secret to averaging 98 wins a
year, as Johnson has done?
</P>
<P>
   It'll be fun trying to figure that out. &QL;

FOR ONE NIGHT, THE LOCKOUT ENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When he arrived at Hofheinz Pavilion for last night's
charity basketball game, Stephon Marbury was stopped at the door by
a security guard. But unlike the rest of his NBA players, it just
took a little negotiation for Marbury not to be locked out.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the NBA, but the Gallery Furniture Charity Game was
the only game in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the kind of game we want to be playing, but it's
better than nothing,'' said Marbury, who capped his 33-point
performance by tossing his jersey into the crowd. ``We want to play
NBA basketball, but the owners won't let us. Remember, this isn't
our choice.''
</P>
<P>
   With droopy shorts that would make Rod Thorn cringe and
ball-handling violations called about as often as compliments
thrown commissioner David Stern's way, a smattering of NBA stars
took their locked-out talents to the University of Houston for a
break from stagnant negotiations. The result was a sloppy, yet
entertaining, 170-168 game that was won on Ike Austin's 3-pointer
at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The game, before 7,000 fans who paid between $40-$50 per ticket,
provided a rare glimpse of NBA action as the lockout enters Day
116.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming player salaries are growing faster than league
revenues, owners locked out players on July 1 and recently canceled
the first two weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   After an exchange of proposals last week, players met Thursday
in Las Vegas in a show of solidarity. Last night's barnstorming
game, benefiting Houston's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, was the
first in a scheduled series that could lead to pay-per-view events
in Japan and help put money in the pockets of players who made the
league-minimum $272,500 salary last year and will start missing
paychecks on Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame they're making all that money and can't find a
way to split it up,'' said fan George Vasquez, 47, who brought his
two sons to the game. ``They're all spoiled brats. I didn't really
think I'd miss it, but after this I'm really going to be sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the odd-colored uniforms and strange mix of
teammates, including standouts like Michael Finley, Tim Hardaway,
Jerry Stackhouse, Penny Hardaway, Antonio McDyess and Antoine
Walker, it was the NBA as usual. Glitzy music blared, dancers
danced, acrobatic teams bounced and players complained about
whistles, though there wasn't a single foul in the first 12-minute
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches Kenny Smith and Clyde Drexler, and courtside observers
David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon were cheered throughout, despite
the game starting 50 minutes late and players like Mark Bryant
pulling up in a stretch limousine and refusing to sign pre-game
autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another sign we're together,'' Robinson said. ``I
learned in the military that posturing will get you nowhere. There
comes a time to fight, and I think we've shown we're ready to do
just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Players were paid as much as $10,000 to appear, even though
getting injured in a game-for-play could void their contract once
the lockout ends. Though point guards Marbury and Hardaway brought
the crowd to its feet with one-on-one dribbling exhibitions, the
game plan was definitely tentative.
</P>
<P>
   In his team's pre-game huddle, Rasheed Wallace shouted, ``Don't
get hurt!''

MARCHMENT BACK WEARING BULL'S-EYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frenzied fans at Reunion Arena Thursday night waved signs
counting down the return of Bryan Marchment as if it were the next
coming of the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   And for 16,928 Stars fans tonight, it could be.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Sharks defenseman will play the villain because of
his hits last season that injured Mike Modano, Greg Adams and Joe
Nieuwendyk. Marchment knocked Nieuwendyk out for the season with a
shot that Nieuwendyk called ``dirty'' and other Stars players said
might have cost them a chance at winning the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone's got to pay for what happened,'' Stars winger Grant
Marshall said. ``What he did to Nieuwendyk and Modano and Adams is
totally uncalled for.''
</P>
<P>
   And while retribution against Marchment was not possible in the
playoffs in May, what are the chances in a regular-season game in
October?
</P>
<P>
   ``He cost us, we think, the whole thing,'' Marshall said. ``We
don't make excuses for what happened, but he did a lot of damage to
our club last year. Something may have to happen. I'm not going to
say what's going to happen, I don't know, I can't predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchment doesn't seem to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more fans are interested in me, maybe it takes other
people off their game,'' he said. ``I'm not going to go out there
and worry about people throwing things. It just means I'm doing my
job, probably better than I should be.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said, ``I think our group, to be
honest, is beyond that,'' fans are not. And they expect to be
goading the Stars into making the Marchment issue bigger than what
Hitchcock said is ``an important divisional game in which we need
to get the two points.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will be focused on a victory. But do they have their
sights set on Marchment?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been a team to do that kind of stuff,'' Modano
said. ``I think we'll try to seek revenge on the scoreboard first.
... But you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchment might be the most hated man in North Texas sports and
is fast becoming the most notorious player in the NHL. This summer,
he was featured on the cover of the inaugural issue of ``In Your
Face Hockey'' magazine glaring through the headline: ``The most
hated man in hockey.'' In its hockey preview, ``Sports
Illustrated'' called him ``the dirtiest player in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   An aggressive defenseman who likes to challenge oncoming
forwards, Marchment's style of defensive play resulted in knee
injuries to four players last season _ costing him two suspensions
for 11 games and about $170,000 in salary.
</P>
<P>
   First, Marchment took out Modano on Dec. 3 with a knee-to-knee
hit that cost Modano 12 games and stopped the hottest streak of his
career. Marchment then felled Stars winger Greg Adams with a
similar knee-to-knee hit Dec. 23, costing Adams 20 games. He
knocked out Carolina Hurricanes winger Kevin Dineen with a similar
knee-to-knee hit in which he coldly replied: ``I'm man enough to
admit that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he ended the season for Nieuwendyk on April 22 in the
first game of the playoffs by riding Nieuwendyk into the end
boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in Nieuwendyk's
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk returns just in time to play the hero. He was voted
the Stars' most valuable player last season and took the ice for
the first time in six months on Thursday, scoring the go-ahead goal
in a 2-1 victory against the Phoenix Coyotes. Nieuwendyk called
Marchment's hit ``a dirty play by a dirty player'' in April, but
has tried to hold his tongue in the face of the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm bitter. I'm bitter about a lot of things that have to
do with that,'' he said earlier this week. ``Time and time again
he's been suspended for one or two games. It doesn't affect him. It
just goes on and on with this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Sharks coveted Marchment and eventually signed
him to a five-year deal worth $12 million and hope to have around
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got him from Tampa Bay, we were going against eight
other teams. I don't think eight other teams would be going after a
guy who is simply a goon, particularly going into the playoffs,''
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``The simplest way to
describe Bryan Marchment is a guy that everybody might hate, but
that you'd love to have on your team. That, to me, is the highest
compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Newly acquired Stars tough guy Brent Severyn has been told
``every day since I got here,'' about going after Marchment.
However, Severyn is nursing a sore neck and might not play tonight.
His inclusion in the lineup will be a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   Would Marshall, then, be the player who takes care of unfinished
business with Marchment? Already, he is using words like fists to
turn up the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of the reason I say yeah \Rto Marchment as the
dirtiest player in the league\S is because he likes it, and he has
no remorse for what he does,'' Marshall said. ``It's going to be a
physical game, and he's part of it, he's going to be a huge part of
it. We're going to try to make sure he is.''

RESURGENT DAVIS LOVE MOVES INTO TIE FOR LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Most golfers would envy the year that
Davis Love III has enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Love is 10th on the PGA Tour money list. He won the MCI Classic.
And he ranks among the tour's top 10 in scoring average, putting
average, birdie average and eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 1998 has not met Love's expectations. After winning his
first major at the 1997 PGA Championship, Love's best finish at a
major this year was seventh place, again at the PGA, and back
problems during the spring plagued him for two months.
</P>
<P>
   So sizzling round of eight-under-par 64 at the National Car
Rental Classic at Walt Disney World was a welcome change for Love,
who hopes to end the year by making a statement that he is back on
his game. While most players were bothered by blustery conditions
and lightning-quick greens, Love surged into a six-way tie for
first place at seven-under 137 after Friday's second round.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Thursday's leaders struggled. Duffy Waldorf, who
started the day with a three-stroke lead after an opening-round 63,
shot a 78 Friday at Magnolia and fell into a tie for 29th place at
three under par. Tiger Woods, Jesper Parnevik and Len Mattiace, who
started the day tied for second place at six under par, failed to
make a move. Parnevik (Magnolia) and Mattiace (Palm) both shot even
par Friday to remain at six under for the tournament, one stroke
off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a crowded leader board, with five others joining Love in
first place: Glen Day, John Huston, Doug Martin, Rocco Mediate and
Tom Purtzer. With the wind gusting to 25 miles per hour, and with
lightning-fast greens making putting an adventure, Love navigated
his way around Disney's Palm Course with little trouble, making
nine birdies and two bogeys. And if Love wins this week and has a
strong showing at next week's Tour Championship, he will look back
on this season with much fonder memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year after winning a major I've seen a lot of guys have a
letdown,'' said Love, who won last year's PGA Championship at
Winged Foot Country Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y. ``So I'm at least
happy that I came back and played fairly well. It's not what I
wanted by any stretch. I was thinking more like winning some majors
and player of the year, that kind of stuff. But you win this week
or next week, it isn't too bad a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day at even par, Love had the day's best round,
using his length off the tee and a smooth putting stroke to move
back into contention. His best stretch came between the ninth and
15th holes, when he birdied six of seven holes, capped by a 15-foot
putt for birdie on No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two rounds, the field alternated between the Palm
Course and the more difficult Magnolia Course. After shooting a 72
Thursday on the Magnolia Course, Love knew he needed to capitalize
with a low score Friday despite the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always got a good feeling about bad conditions, because
it's going to eliminate a lot of guys,'' Love said. ``I don't panic
when conditions get bad. I always try to find something positive,
and today, I knew the whole field wasn't going to run away.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot a 73 on the Magnolia Course and fell into a tie for
14th place at five under par, two strokes off the lead. All things
considered, Woods was glad to remain in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit the ball very well today, and I struggled with my
tee shots,'' Woods said. ``Thank God for my short game. I think I
only hit nine or 10 greens today, but I got up and down from
everywhere. I just didn't feel very comfortable with my swing. But
I'm only two back, and after playing the way I did today, that's
not bad at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Love's round was superb, and it gave him confidence heading
into the weekend. Love missed the cut in his last appearance at
Disney, so this tournament has already been an improvement. ``I was
determined that I wanted to be around for the weekend,'' Love said.
``I'm feeling better. I got beat up at the U.S. Open, and when I
tried to play hurt, I kind of lost my confidence. I got a lesson on
Tuesday, and I came out today not even thinking about my swing. I
think that was the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Those who missed the cut (at even par 144) included PAYNE
STEWART &UR;  &LR; (146), SCOTT HOCH (147) and PHIL MICKELSON (150). &QL;

JETS EMPHASIZE HALTING FALCONS' RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Sometime soon the Jets are going to have to
beat a nondivision opponent to keep alive their playoff dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been my fault,'' coach Bill Parcells said Friday,
noting that the Jets are 3-3, with all the victories coming against
American Football Conference East teams. ``I put a tremendous
emphasis on division games.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Last season, the Jets' record was marred by a 2-6 mark
against other teams in their division.
</P>
<P>
   So, what will happen against Sunday's nondivision opponent, the
5-1 Atlanta Falcons?
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has captured three straight games, and Jamal Anderson's
rushing average puts him at a 1,700-yard pace for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson will be the Jets' major obstacle, especially if Falcon
quarterback Chris Chandler does not play. Chandler's sore left
(nonthrowing) shoulder makes his appearance unlikely. His absence
would be a big loss for the Falcons, who are 13-3 in the last 16
games Chandler has played.
</P>
<P>
   If Chandler cannot go, the 44-year-old Steve DeBerg will start.
DeBerg, an assistant coach under Coach Dan Reeves with the Giants,
came out of retirement to hook up with Reeves again in Atlanta. He
has not started since 1993, for Miami. DeBerg would be 2 years
older than any other player who has ever started in the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The primary responsibility for halting Anderson will go to the
Jets' middle linebacker, which is now a two-headed position. Pepper
Johnson starts, plays a quarter and then is replaced by Dwayne
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   And what does Johnson, who hates not being in on every defensive
play, say about splitting time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a comment on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Parcells alternate Johnson, 34, who shares Parcells'
Super Bowl history with the Giants?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get him killed,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran linebacker, Bryan Cox, is thriving in the Jets'
defensive system. Cox, 30, was signed to a one-year contract as an
emergency replacement after training-camp injuries to Marvin Jones
and Casey Dailey. Cox has become an important player in third-down
schemes. He had four solo tackles last Monday against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had one problem, and it might also affect his future:
his wife and four children are back in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He
said family considerations could have an impact on any decision to
remain a Jet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Season statistics have a way of being skewed by big victories
and big losses. So, it is not surprising that the Jets (3-3) do not
necessarily have middle-of-the-pack numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Takeaway-giveaway: Minus-3. Conference rank: 13th. Largely
because of the error-filled game against the Rams _ five turnovers,
no takeaways _ the Jets are near the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   _ First downs: 132. Conference rank: first. KEYSHAWN JOHNSON and
WAYNE CHREBET repeatedly make big receiving plays. Johnson is
averaging more than 15 yards a catch on third-down receptions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Total offense: 2,104 yards. Conference rank: second. CURTIS
MARTIN and VINNY TESTAVERDE have helped to improve the offense
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Total defense: 1,961 yards. Conference rank: 13th. Again, one
game skewed the results _ the 49ers amassed 557 yards in the
opener, an overtime victory for the Niners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Curtis Martin: Averaging 126.4 yards a game, including rushing
and receiving. That is the sixth-best average in the league.
Atlanta's JAMAL ANDERSON is fourth at 133.7. But with Testaverde at
quarterback in three starts, Martin is at 168.3. &QL;

L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT LACKS BASIC TEXTBOOKS IN ENGLISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A school board member warned that the district
suffers from a severe shortage of elementary school reading
textbooks in English because it stocked up on Spanish-language
books over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Unified School District used part of a major
state allocation for textbooks to buy thousands of Spanish-language
readers -- books that are no longer useful to students who were
transferred to English-immersion classes under Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Tokofsky blasted the district's poor handling
of the situation and failure to quickly solve the problem, and said
some children and teachers have gone for months without needed
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district has declared a victory over the textbook
shortage, but I believe we have a massive problem,'' Tokofsky said.
``Teachers are being undermined. They've been asked to start a new
curriculum without any books.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, board members will review a report from the
superintendent notifying them there are not enough textbooks in
kindergarten through 12th grade, Tokofsky said. The board is
required by law to certify the sufficiency of textbook supplies
because the district receives state money for the books.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 227, passed by voters in June, essentially
eliminates bilingual education except where parents specifically
demand a waiver from its impact. About 11 percent of parents have
requested the waiver. Children who do not speak English now are
placed in English-immersion classes for a year before they are
transferred to a traditional classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Since school officials only had two months to implement
Proposition 227 after it was approved by voters, there have been a
number of questions and unforeseen problems for teachers to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky estimated that as many as 150 schools are affected by
the shortage, but he has been unable to get better figures from
LAUSD officials.
</P>
<P>
   District officials on Friday were able to shed little light on
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious there's a shortage, but I don't know the
extent of it,'' said Jim Konantz, director of instructional
technology and library and textbook services.
</P>
<P>
   Konantz said he thought Forrest Ross, the district's head of
language acquisition, would know. Ross did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Some principals in the city's San Fernando Valley area said they
believe the shortage is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Jeri Dunnigan, principal of Nevada Avenue Elementary School in
suburban Canoga Park, said nearly half of her students, or about
350, don't have the English reading textbooks they need.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was discussed at a recent meeting of schools in her
region, and Dunnigan determined that her school was ``better off
than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Konantz said the district was in the process of letting schools
know that money would be made available to buy new textbooks from a
$3.2 million fund.
</P>
<P>
   Because the district had not received orders from schools, it
was unknown how much would be needed, Konantz said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the district was working toward the goal of a reading
book for every student.
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky doesn't understand how the district landed in this mess
-- with possibly millions of dollars' worth of useless Spanish
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo Wednesday to Superintendent Ruben Zacarias,
Tokofsky said the district should arrange to trade for
English-language books with the publishers. Tokofsky urged that the
swap be done immediately because ``these schools have sat for
months without these textbook series in the primary grades.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky said the mammoth district, which has made
multimillion-dollar purchases with these same publishers in the
past, should use its clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there ever was an argument for a large district, it's the
advantages they have with economies of scale,'' he said. ``If a big
district doesn't do anything, a big district isn't worth
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Konantz said they plan to discuss trades with publishers but
have not had any meetings.
</P>
<P>
   While many schools operate on year-round calendars, other
schools on a traditional calendar began Sept. 8. Principals didn't
know until a couple of weeks ago just how significant the shortage
was.
</P>
<P>
   That's because state law required parents to wait 30 days before
they asked for a waiver to allow their children to circumvent
English-immersion classes and go back to a bilingual classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Dunnigan said very few parents wanted waivers, so the textbook
shortage was large.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting of schools in her area, Dunnigan began asking
publishers to give credits or exchanges. She has not had any
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed so fast with (Proposition) 227 that it's
hard to keep up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said new teachers were being helped along in reading
instruction tips by veteran mentor teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, it's threatening that they have no books, but on
the other, if they're new, they don't know any different,''
Dunnigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Miller, principal at Telfair Elementary School in suburban
Pacoima, said his school has had to use stopgap measures to deal
with the shortage, but he does not believe the problem will last
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing says that we can't use the Spanish-language books by
looking at the pictures, talking about it and developing word
lists,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   He has staffers ordering new books and looking for old books at
the school district's storage annex downtown. Students also share
books.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the unused readers could also be used in the library
or lent to children to take home. ``But I'd be lying to you if I
told you I knew what they're going to do with those millions of
dollars' worth of books,'' he added.

WINNIE RUTH JUDD, `TRUNK MURDERESS,' DIES
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX _ Winnie Ruth Judd, the infamous ``Trunk Murderess'' whose
grue some Depression-era trial was the talk of the nation, died
quietly in her sleep Friday at a friend's Phoenix home. She was 93.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judd, later known by her assumed name of Marian Lane, spent
nearly 40 years in a mental hospital or behind bars for the October
16, 1931, slaying in Phoenix of her two best friends, Anne LeRoi,
32, and Hedvig ``Sammy'' Samuelson, 24.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson's body had been hacked into pieces, and both victims
were packed into two trunks and a suitcase and shipped by train to
Los Angeles where they were found three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Judd was sentenced to death in 1932, but pleaded insanity to
avoid execution. She won release in 1971, then moved to the San
Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Though she lived in Phoenix for most of this decade under her
assumed name, her body was being returned to California on Friday
for interment, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Judd rarely spoke of the case in her later years,
others who studied it closely came to believe she had acted in
self-defense, that she was railroaded by small-town powerbrokers
intent on shielding the supposed involvement of a local playboy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the full truth may never be known, Phoenix attorney
Larry Debus, who helped free Judd in 1971, said she paid an
excessive penalty for the crime. Today, he suggested, she would
have served no more than five years in prison for a killing in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She actually had become so institutionalized in these 40
years, she was terrified to complain, to talk about it,'' Debus
said. ``She felt that every day she was not locked up was a gift.
She did not have a very good life.''
</P>
<P>
   In death, Judd was remembered as a kind and engaging woman who
spent her waning years trying to forget the event that had consumed
her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``She found her peace,'' said former Gov. Rose Mofford, who
first met Judd around 1940 when Mofford was a secretary at the
Arizona State Hospital. ``Her peace came from helping others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mofford said Judd had taken care of other patients at the state
hospital for years _ cooking, cutting hair, even taking a youngster
with hydro cephaly under her wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to take care of him like he was her own child,''
Mofford said. After her release, she volun teered to quietly help
Mofford with charitable causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a delightful woman,'' Mofford said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Cain, 76, of Sun City, a longtime friend, said Judd did
not seem bitter, even though ``she missed the biggest part of her
life, being locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always thinking of somebody else, never herself,'' he
said. ``That's the kind of lady she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Cain said Judd had recently told him she expected to die soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She more or less gave up, I think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oxford, Ind., to school teacher parents, Judd had a
religious upbringing thanks to her father's ministry in the Free
Methodist Church. She moved to Phoenix as an adult after marrying
Dr. William C. Judd, a sometime physician who spent much of his
time traveling in search of work.
</P>
<P>
   Judd, 26 at the time of the murders, took a job as a medical
secretary at a Phoenix clinic to support herself. She found friend
ship and support from a tightly knit group of friends that included
LeRoi, Samuelson and a Phoenix lumberman named Jack Halloran.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran, a bigwig playboy in local society, was known to be
dating Judd despite the fact that both were married. But he was not
above cooing at LeRoi and Samuel son as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday night of the murders, according to newspaper
accounts, Judd went to her friends' duplex where an argument appar
ently erupted over Halloran. LeRoi and Samuelson were both mortally
wounded in the confusion, although no one is sure to this day
whether one or two weapons were used. Judd was shot in the hand.
</P>
<P>
   The murder might never have become the spectacle it did, soaking
up gallons of headline ink and earning Judd titles like ``Tiger
Woman,'' were it not for the way the deaths came to light.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Samuelson's body was cut into pieces with
surgical tools. Both victims were stuffed into trunks and a
suitcase and sent on the train to Los Angeles. Judd rode the same
train to the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A railroad worker discovered one of the bloody trunks outside
Los Angeles' Central Station three days later, triggering a manhunt
that ended less than a week later when Judd surrendered to police
in a Los Angeles funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   A murder weapon _ a .25-cali ber pistol _ and surgical tools
were found with the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The press had a field day, and the theory of the day had it that
Judd had killed her friends in a jealous fit. She was convicted on
Feb. 8, 1932. The jury, after several ballots, voted to hang her.
</P>
<P>
   During an ensuing hearing, she was judged insane and diverted
from the gallows to the Arizona State Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Debus, who began representing her years later, is convinced she
acted in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a matter that she didn't do it _ but it
was self-defense,'' Debus said. The three women were, in fact,
arguing. But it was one of the victims who first got a gun and
began to rage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cain agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She figured she was rail roaded,'' Cain said. ``And she was.
It was self-defense, what she did. She was fighting for her life,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Although suspicions have lin gered ever since that Halloran was
also involved _ a car was seen at the house the day of the murders
and a few days later _ an attempt in 1933 to try him as an
accessory fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Judd spent her years in the mental hospital playing a game of
cat and mouse, escaping a half-dozen times with what some believe
was the tacit approval or help of hospital employees.
</P>
<P>
   On her last ocassion in 1962, she was out of sight for nearly
seven years, heading with the help of a nephew to the Bay Area
where she worked for and lived with a wealthy family. The family
had no clue about her real identity.
</P>
<P>
   After her recapture, Debus and Melvin Belli, the famous criminal
defense attorney, worked to free her. She remained jailed for
nearly two years before Debus secured a parole from Gov. Jack
Williams on Decem ber 22, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 book about the mur ders, Phoenix investigative
reporter Jana Bommersbach concluded that Judd had been sacrificed
to protect the involvement of other, more powerful Phoenicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said she was a cold-blooded killer. They said she hacked
up her best friend. They said she was insane. They said she acted
alone,'' Bommersbach wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet to this day _ now 60 years after the fact _ questions
remain about just how guilty Winnie Ruth Judd was. Or exactly what
she was guilty of doing. Or if she could have possibly done the
deed by herself. Or if she ever was insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mofford isn't sure. The ex-governor's late husband, Lefty,
was a Phoenix police officer at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his mind, she was never capable of doing something like
that,'' Mofford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was bigger than life,'' Debus said. ``But she literally
had her life taken away from her.'' &QL;

<P>
   MIDEAST-SPY (Washington) _ After all the wrangling over the
stalled peace process, the last snag before the agreement was one
of the most divisive issues left outstanding _ not between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, but between the Israelis and the
Americans: the fate of Jonathan Pollard, the American sentenced to
life in prison for spying for Israel in the 1980s. By Steven Lee
Myers.

   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Washington) _ No one but the president of the

and security. By John M. Broder.

<P>
   MIDEAST-CIA (Washington) _ The CIA's ability to win the
confidence of both sides by monitoring West Bank security issues in

Tenet, the director of central intelligence, ``had an unusual,
almost unprecedented role to play because of the security

   BOSPORUS-OILTANKERS (Istanbul, Turkey) _ The Bosporus, which has
for millenniums been one of the world's most strategic waterways,
is again a center of international attention. Huge amounts of oil
have been discovered under and around the Caspian Sea, and oil
companies must decide how to move it toward European markets. The
cheapest way might be to transport it through the Bosporus and into
the Mediterranean. That could double the number of tankers passing
through the Bosporus. And Turkish officials say that is intolerable
because the Bosporus passes through the center of Istanbul, home to
10 million people. By Stephen Kinzer. (With photo.)

<P>
   WRESTLE-FREESPEECH (Pittsburgh) _ Federal judges in Pennsylvania
have been poring over the observations of Mark Madden, an
irrepressible pro-wrestling commentator here who acknowledges that
the essays he writes for callers to his 900-number are often
sarcastic or even fictitious. ``Outrageous trash talk,'' he calls
his musings. But is outrageous trash talk journalism in the eyes of

   Parents: Moceanu being &QL; 
a typical rebellious teen
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; By RON NISSIMOV &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ Camelia and Dumitru Moceanu said Friday they are not the
poster parents for the victimization of teen-age athletes that many
have portrayed them to be.
</P>
<P>
   In her first interview since her daughter, Dominique Moceanu,
ran away from home Sunday, Camelia Moceanu said the Olympic gold
medalist is being a typical ``rebel teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How long can you push?'' said Camelia Moceanu, who received a
court order to stay away from her daughter Tuesday, one day after
her 37th birthday. ``One year? Two years? Three years? Ten years? I
cannot push that long. If you don't want to do (gymnastics), don't
do it. I am tired of pushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she's saying she wants to go to the 2000 Olympics,''
Camelia Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus, clearly weary of being in the spotlight all week
after their daughter left home, said they have always maintained a
good relationship with Dominique and have not squandered her
fortune and childhood, as the young gymnast has claimed. Dominique,
who turned 17 on Sept. 30, filed a lawsuit Monday asking to be
declared a legal adult, claiming that the money she has earned as a
professional since age 10 is all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus filed motions in court Friday to delay a scheduled
Nov. 11 hearing on Dominique's quest for adult status, dissolve the
restraining order, dismiss her lawsuit and bring her back home.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing for these motions has been scheduled for Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu, 44, said Dominique's trust fund has been used
to build a 70,000-square-foot gym at 6120 Louetta in Spring that
opened last year, a gym that his daughter wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working at Interstate Ford where I was a manager. I
don't need a gym,'' said Moceanu, a former car dealer. ``It was for
her and other children to give them the best place. I survived
without having a gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Huggins, 32, a family friend who helped with construction
of the gym and who helped Dominique leave home, said the gym cost
about $4 million. Dumitru Moceanu scoffed at that figure but
declined to say how much it cost. He said the gym is surviving
financially.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, who was with Dominique Friday at an undisclosed
location, said her lawyers advised her not to respond to her
parents' statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about `he said, she said,''' Huggins said. ``It's
about Dom trying to live her life on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus, Romanian immigrants, said they both competed for
the Romanian national gymnastics team as youths, but not in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique was born in Los Angeles in 1981, and the family moved
to the Houston area in 1990 so Dominique could train with Bela
Karolyi, who coached gold medalist Nadia Comaneci in Romania and
later several top gymnasts, including Mary Lou Retton, in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Camelia Moceanu disputed her daughter's contention that her
parents talk to her only about gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with her so many times in the ice cream store where
she has her poster there,'' Camelia Moceanu said, referring to
Dominique's statement to the Chronicle on Tuesday of ``Can't we go
out for ice cream?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Friday, we get all the gymnasts and go there to eat ice
cream,'' Camelia Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru said he and his wife have sacrificed tremendously for
Dominique's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to move to another state for her. We said, `OK, sell
the business, move to another state, start a new business,'''
Dumitru Moceanu said. ``It's not easy. All this costs a lot of
money. We have sacrificed all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Camelia Moceanu said Dominique was ``smiling from ear to ear''
on her 17th birthday when her parents traded in Dominique's
Mercedes for a Mustang convertible. The parents said they make the
payments on their daughter's car, but Dominique has said her
parents bought cars for themselves outright.
</P>
<P>
   The Moceanus also disputed their daughter's contention that they
have been selling a line of gymnastics clothing using Dominique's
name without her permission.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique said she had been considering taking legal action for
some time but was pushed finally to do so after her father said
last Saturday he would fire her coach, Luminita Miscenco, whom
Dominique credits with reviving her career. Dominique said her
father wanted to fire Miscenco because the coach was helping her
understand her finances.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu repeated his earlier contention that the coach
encouraged his daughter to leave home, and that he wanted to fire
her because she was demanding more money and a house.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique is scheduled to give her deposition on Tuesday, at
which time she is to bring her diaries and any items related to
Miscenco, Huggins and Jeff Pudlo, another coach.
</P>
<P>
   Camelia Moceanu said the only change she had noticed in
Dominique's behavior was ``in the last month, she was always
telling me she was tired, we didn't want to interfere too much.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Dominique became slightly withdrawn because she was
concentrating on school.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique said Tuesday that she still loves her parents and
hopes this lawsuit can bring the family ``closer than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu said he is skeptical that this can bring the
family closer but added that he loves his daughter and wants her
back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As parents, we don't believe we did anything ever that we did
not think to be in her best interest,'' Camelia Moceanu said.

A REGULAR GUY  
 UA'S TOMEY LETS FANS INTO HIS WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ An elderly woman brings a plate of freshly baked
muffins. There's fast food and a beat-up Thermos or two full of
coffee. It could be lunchtime at just about any job site.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it is.
</P>
<P>
   But this lunch break is a little bit different. This is Coach
Populist and the people, Arizona's Dick Tomey and the folks. There
are no poorly groomed sportswriters with tired questions, screaming
talk-show hosts, publicists with a spin, microphones or mini-cams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your team healthy, Coach?'' somebody asks between bites of
what looks to be a standard tuna on whole wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``No team in this country is healthy after seven games,'' Tomey
says. ``If you felt like some of my players do right now, you'd be
in bed for three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey chuckles, and a room full of about 20 people chuckle
along. He's clearly enjoying himself at a setting that is informal
and unique.
</P>
<P>
   Big-time college football coaches have talk shows, television
shows, clinics and speaking engagements. But there's only one with
a weekly brown-bag day.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is welcome. Bring your own lunch, don't forget to pack
a few questions and hold the pretensions. Tomey's Diner is open
every Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing it for as long as I've been coaching,'' said
Tomey, who is in his 22nd straight year as a head coach. ``It's for
students, administrators, teachers or janitors. Really, anybody who
is interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey says he does it as a service for both the university and
the public. It's also an opportunity, he says, for fans to make
their own judgments without a board operator screening calls or a
sportswriter editing his comments.
</P>
<P>
   Tough questions?
</P>
<P>
   Not often, Tomey says.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the lunch crowd is a true test of whether times are
tough or good, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had as many as 200 and as few as one,'' said Tomey, who
split Wednesday's session between films of the Wildcats' victory at
Oregon State and a discussion of tonight's game against Northeast
Louisiana at Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey recalls a lunch for two: Himself and a straggler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at Hawaii and we had lost a few games in a row,'' Tomey
said. ``One guy shows up. I was doing it at an auditorium at the
time. The people who ran the auditorium were probably upset with
me, too. They wouldn't open the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was back in the projector days. I had my film to show and
a projector to lug around. Anyway, this guy and I sat down in a
corridor at the student union. I plugged the projector into a
hallway outlet and we sat there on the floor, ate our lunch and
watched the film as it played on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tomey, the moment had to define a comment he often makes:
Humility is never far away in college football.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Tomey's Diner is beginning to do a brisk business.
The Wildcats are a surprise. They're 6-1. They're ranked among the
nation's top 20 teams. They're in the hunt for a major bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of very lonely lunches always looms, especially
with a schedule that still includes Oregon, California and Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Tomey's 11-plus years at Arizona, there has
speculation that his days were numbered. In an increasingly
impatient era, that's as inevitable as fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the middle of Arizona's current success, there are
echoes of complaints that swirled amid last season's 1-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey is in the final year of his contract. Arizona Athletic
Director Jim Livengood has said he doesn't intend to extend the
contract until after the season. Livengood goes on to applaud
Tomey's work this year, but the decision to wait on a new deal
leaves inevitable questions. No Rose Bowl, no contract?
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, the public was definitely split, 50-50 on Coach
Tomey,'' said one of this week's brown baggers, Doug Wallen, who
can remember lunch sessions at Hawaii when he was a high school
student in Honolulu. ``I've always admired him. With him, you
always know the program is run right.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's lunch also included a first-timer, Larry Romero, who
says he was a Tomey critic a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than a Tomey fan, I'm a U of A football fan,'' Romero
said.
</P>
<P>
   Romero conceded that he was hesitant to ask a question.
Sometimes, it's a lot easier to criticize from a distance. But
Tomey was willing to hear criticism.
</P>
<P>
   For Tomey, the brown baggers are the ``Joes'' to whom he often
refers. Joe is his term for the obscure lineman or reserve who is
instrumental in any victory.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is Tomey's kind of player, Tomey's kind of fan.
</P>
<P>
   A Joe at this week's lunch was curious about a current novel
written by Tomey's wife, Nanci Kincaid. ``Balls'' is set in the
South about 20 years ago. It's a college football story told
through the eyes of the wives and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is your wife a glutton for punishment, 'cause she's married to
a coach?'' this Joe asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is,'' Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you learn from the book?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did, I really did,'' said Tomey, who then referrred to a
writer's review by saying: ``Anybody offended by anything in the
book is offended only because they know it's true.'' &QL; 
I've had as many as 200 and as few as one. . . . (Once) one guy
shows up. I plugged the projector into a hallway outlet and we sat
there on the floor, ate our lunch and watched the film as it played
on the wall. &QC;

NBA LOCKOUT HAS EVOLVED INTO BATTLE OF EGOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (Analysis) 
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time to put a stop to this madness.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners, represented by Commissioner David Stern and his
deputy, Russ Granik, and the National Basketball Players
Association, under the guidance of Executive Director Billy Hunter
and President Patrick Ewing, are about to screw up something really
good.
</P>
<P>
   And for what? Because they have a golden goose that lays a $2
billion egg every year. And they can't agree upon how to share it.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a battle of egos so out of control that it
threatens to blow up what has for years been considered the model
professional sports league _ a partnership of labor and management
that has thrived.
</P>
<P>
   It has gotten to the point now where not only the 1998-99 season
is in jeopardy, but the future of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners are prepared to keep the players locked out no
matter what the cost. And players, prodded by agents, have talked
about decertification of their union, antitrust lawsuits and
forming an alternative league.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, is a television network going to pay $2.6 billion, as
NBC and Turner Sports just did to the NBA, for the rights to
broadcast some makeshift league's games? Not unless Rupert Murdoch
has lost his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Is the new league going to pay Ewing $17.5 million, as the New
York Knicks did last season?
</P>
<P>
   Not hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Are fans going to buy tickets to watch the games? It's doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the games going to be played? Most of the country's
major arenas have contracts with NBA clubs or are under the control
of NBA owners.
</P>
<P>
   And the bottom line: Is it worth throwing away $1 billion in
player salaries for it?
</P>
<P>
   It's not, but indications from a players meeting Thursday in Las
Vegas indicates the union is ready to do it. The players may be
misreading the public in this. Right or wrong, fans see the players
as whining millionaires who should be happy with what they have.
</P>
<P>
   The rising number of off-court incidents _ headlined by Latrell
Sprewell's attempt to strangle his coach _ has left the players
with a lousy case to argue in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The plain truth is that $1 billion is plenty of money for each
side, and that's a 50-50 split. The owners might even be willing to
give a little more than that. The players got 57 percent last
season, and they've asked for 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's ridiculous, and it isn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't the money, it's how the money is distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The Larry Bird exception to the salary cap, which allows teams
to sign their own players without regard to the cap, has thrown
everything out of whack because the owners have not been able to
control themselves given that much freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The players don't believe they should have to control the
owners. Maybe they shouldn't. But it only takes one owner to throw
everything off the chart. And if it will save a successful
partnership, why not?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the players seem to be asking owners to improve the lot
of their middle class but to keep paying the elite the same money.
</P>
<P>
   The Bird exception has allowed players to remain with the same
team and build a marketable identity profitable to owners and
players. But it has been abused.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan received $30 million for one season in 1996-97,
partly as repayment for the years in which he was underpaid while
boosting the image and popularity of the league. He had it coming.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Bulls paid him $33 million last season. That's
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you believe he deserved every penny, that doesn't
mean Jordan set the bar for Kevin Garnett, Bryant ``Big Contract''
Reeves or Allen Iverson. Those players have done nothing for the
league yet.
</P>
<P>
   They do not have it coming.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, picking up on a union suggestion to institute a
luxury tax, have proposed that any contract above last season's
$2.6 million average signed under the Larry Bird exception be
subject to a tax. A deal between $2.6 million and $10 million would
come with a 50 percent tax. Deals averaging $10 million to $15
million a year would come with a 100 percent tax. And anything
above that would be subject to a 200 percent tax hit for the club.
</P>
<P>
   The union has rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing said before Thursday's meeting of players that the
``main message Billy (Hunter) and I will be trying to get across
(is) we want to improve the pay, especially for the lowest-paid
players and restore the middle class. We players who are making the
most money have committed to make less so all other players can
make more.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   If the highest-paid players are truly willing to give something
back, enough money exists to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Ewing and Jordan are not making a sacrifice
here. It's players such as Golden State's Muggsy Bogues who are
really paying the freight.
</P>
<P>
   Bogues, 33, is winding down a career that for a player 5 feet 3
is a miracle to begin with. His knees are shot, and he's in the
last year of a contract that would pay him $2.8 million this
season. He already has lost $205,000.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't going to be another big contract for Bogues. There
may not be another contract at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for a player like me just to throw the whole season
away,'' Bogues said. ``You want a Damon Stoudamire to be rewarded
for what he'll do. But then you look at your situation and say you
might not get another 3- or 4-year contract. The top 15 players in
the league are going to have to give up something.''
</P>
<P>
   He's exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   Put a cap on how much the stars can make, thereby freeing money
to trickle down to the journeymen. Impose the tax on any owner who
decides he just has to pay the player more to keep him. If an owner
is making enough money, he will pay. If not, the player is free to
make a deal elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Put the tax into a pool that goes to teams making less money.
And agree upon a cut to go into a pension fund for retired players
_ all of them, back to the league's beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The owners' proposal for a tax at $2.6 million is ridiculously
low and offers virtually no flexibility. But the players' threshold
of $18 million is just as ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. The two sides have agreed upon a mechanism to make this
work _ the luxury tax. So sit down and deal. Find a threshold that
ought to split the pot at around 50-50. Lengthen the term of
service to qualify for the Bird exception. Lengthen the rookie
salary scale and include marijuana in the drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, let's put a cap on the price of a ticket
and a beer for at least a year since you've put us through this
mess. Cut Stern's $8 million salary by 20 percent. He still would
be making as much as two ``average'' players. And put a cap on
coaches' salaries, which have escalated even faster than players'
pay, prompting players to wonder why owners are so worried.
</P>
<P>
   There. Put the egos aside. Get a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   And throw the ball up. &QL;

POLE SITTER SEEKS RARE WIN  
 SCHRADER OUT OF VICTORY LANE FOR 7 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You think Mark Martin has problems? Hah.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Ken Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   While Martin virtually has no chance of overtaking NASCAR
Winston Cup series leader Jeff Gordon with just three races
remaining, one of which is Sunday's Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 at Phoenix
International Raceway, he's still a lot better off than Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   At least Martin knows his way into victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Not Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not recently, and not in a Winston Cup stock car, either.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, who captured the pole position Friday with a speed of
131.234 mph in a Chevrolet Monte Carlo, hasn't visited a Winston
Cup winner's circle in seven years, when he was still with car
owner Rick Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader won twice in 1991, then nothing. Nothing but goose
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's been 19-oh-(expletive) since we won,'' Schrader
said. ``We've just got to win. This thing pays 80 grand or
something to win Sunday. I'd pay 80 grand just to stand up there on
that stage afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only reason you do it. If I didn't think I could
win, I'd go ahead and quit now and not worry about hitting my head.
It'd be a whole lot simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Schrader doesn't know how to win at PIR. He has
nine Copper World Classic trophies in his living room, two of which
came courtesy of NASCAR Southwest Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, 43, also has four U.S. Auto Club midget wins and three
USAC Silver Crown triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   That's good.
</P>
<P>
   But not good enough, Schrader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had plenty of reasons keeping us from (winning),''
Schrader said. ``Most of the time you don't win races, it's not
luck. It's because we didn't do our job good enough, whether it be
me telling (the crew) what the car is doing so we can get it
handling better . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things that can keep you from it, and we
haven't done our job good enough. (But) this is the place we're
going into knowing it's one of our better places, and we're looking
forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, however, shouldn't feel lonely.
</P>
<P>
   All he has to do is look around and behind him, and he'll spot
several drivers in similar predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, there's winless rookie Kenny Irwin, who hustled his
Ford Taurus around the slightly banked one-mile oval at a speed of
131.205 mph to share the front row with Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   In the second row, Kenny Wallace never has won, and Bill Elliott
last won in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Third row? Rookie Rich Bickle is winless, and Rusty Wallace,
Kenny's older brother, hasn't won in 59 races.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mast, Mike Skinner, David Green and Ted Musgrave, Nos. 7-10
starters, also are non-winners.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, however, at No. 11 in the starting grid, has won seven
times this season but trails Gordon by a whopping 358 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like this racetrack, and I look forward to working on
race setup,'' Martin said. ``We never did quite get it like we
wanted (Friday) for qualifying, but we'll have a lot more time and
a little bit more leeway to work it in once we start on hot
tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge lead in the drivers' standings, Gordon wasn't
smiling following qualifying. No, that was a disgusting frown
splashed across his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Gordon, who won't need a
telescopic lens to locate Martin in the lineup. They're next to
each other in the sixth row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great race car, and it was all up to me to get a good
clean lap, and I overdrove it into (Turn) 1 and missed my line big
time,'' Gordon said. ``That is a sad lap. I'm disappointed in
myself, because I'm always out there trying to give it everything
I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of the time Gordon is rewarded with such devotion. With
the sixth-row starting position, it is only the fifth time in 31
races that Gordon has failed to start among the first five rows. He
also has won seven poles.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Gordon needs to gain just 12 points on
Martin to clinch a third championship in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon can have his title.
</P>
<P>
   All Schrader wants is one measly win. &QL;

ISBISTER HEADED BACK TO MINORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brad Isbister's yo-yo season with the Coyotes continued Friday
when the team sent him back to the minors and in his place recalled
rookie center Daniel Briere.
</P>
<P>
   Isbister was promoted from Las Vegas of the International Hockey
League for Thursday's game against the Dallas Stars after it was
learned right wing Dallas Drake would be sidelined four to six
weeks because of a fractured left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Isbister, a 21-year-old left wing, looked good during the
Coyotes' 2-1 loss, getting a few solid scoring chances and
delivering a handful of hard hits.
</P>
<P>
   But General Manager Bobby Smith said Briere is a step ahead of
Isbister and he and the coaching staff want to see how the former
first-round draft pick responds with a group of veterans. He also
disclosed that had Briere not had the flu on Wednesday, it would
have been Briere, not Isbister, who got called up.
</P>
<P>
   Briere, 21, had a goal and an assist in his only game with Las
Vegas. Both he and Isbister were sent to the Thunder last Monday,
before the Coyotes' game against the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Briere had won a spot on Phoenix's 24-man roster, but he
suffered a concussion during the Coyotes' final preseason game when
he was elbowed in the head and slew-footed by Anaheim's Ruslan
Salei.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Briere's next game will be against Salei and the
Mighty Ducks on Sunday. It will mark Salei's first game back after
serving a five-game suspension for the hit on Briere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a fun game,'' Salei said. ``They're going to
be chasing me all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Salei, a defenseman whose hit knocked Briere unconscious and
sent him into convulsions, didn't agree with the length of his
suspension, the first handed down this season by Colin Campbell,
the league's new executive vice president in charge of hockey
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might get a game or maybe two games when I read he
got a concussion,'' Salei said. ``(But five games) is unbelievable
and unacceptable. They (the NHL) just want to show how tough they
are and send a message to the whole league. But they better be
tough with everybody, not just me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes will be tough on Salei if he's in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way,'' one Phoenix player said, ``he'll know we'll
be out there. . . . He'll feel it.'' &QL;

HOUSE'S BROKEN JAW LEAVES ASU WITH 1 STARTER BACK 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-HOUSE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona State basketball team has taken another hit.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Eddie House, a two-year starter and the leading returning
scorer in the backcourt, is expected to miss four to six weeks
after suffering a broken jaw in practice Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   House was inadvertently struck by an elbow while taking a charge
from walk-on D'Angelo Jones during a drill.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-1 guard from Union City, Calif., House averaged 11.3
points a game last season and led the team with 64 steals. He also
had 93 assists and only 43 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   He will be able to resume light workouts in about 10 days, but
his jaw is wired shut, and breathing difficulties will affect his
conditioning. He will be on a liquid diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest concern is we've got to make sure he doesn't lose
muscle mass and doesn't lose a whole lot of stamina,'' Coach Rob
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, House had three teeth knocked loose in a game
against the College of Charleston in Alaska. He had emergency root
canal procedures and returned the next day, making seven
three-point baskets against Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough, tough kid,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils already will be without senior Mike Batiste for
their first eight games. Batiste, academically ineligible but
practicing with the team, averaged 15.3 points and 7.8 rebounds
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Batiste and House account for 53 percent of the Sun Devils'
returning offense. Their absences mean ASU likely will open with
only one starter back, senior forward Bobby Lazor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're minus two of our better players for the early part of
the season,'' Evans said. ``We've got some guys who are quality
players who can fill in, but none of them has played major college
basketball. We just have to try to work and make them better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the positive is that when we do get (House and
Batiste) back, those other guys will have some experience and make
us a better basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   House had been one of the pleasant early surprises. His past
attitude had been considered an issue, and Evans and his staff made
a concerted effort to address that when they came aboard in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really taken the coaching, everything,'' Evans said.
``He's done everything we've asked. He's never ducked any work
we've given him. He's the first one at practice. When he hits the
floor, he's serious about work. He stays afterward and works on his
shooting. He loves the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said that regardless of the prognosis, he expects House to
be back sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ASU will open its season with a pair of home games, Nov. 13
against San Jose State and Nov. 17 against Northern Arizona. The
Sun Devils then will travel to Hawaii for the Maui Invitational to
play national runner-up Utah in a first-round game Nov. 23.
Syracuse, Indiana, Clemson, Michigan and Kansas State also are in
the field. &QL;

VALLEY TRIP  BECOMES ADVENTURE  
 MARLIN LEAVES DRIVING TO OTHERS, FINDS TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No more cross-country trips for Sterling Marlin.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin, 41, who drives the Coors Light Chevrolet Monte Carlo
owned by Felix Sabates, decided to forgo the airplane ride to the
Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin instead asked Jerry Schweitz, the team's transporter
driver, if he could hitch a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Schweitz said.
</P>
<P>
   So Schweitz picked up Marlin earlier this week in Atlanta, where
he was testing for two days at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was fine until Thursday, when they reached Arizona.
Then, about 60 miles from Tucson, the hauler sputtered to a stop
because of engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin began to fret because he was a scheduled guest at an
autograph session later that day at a Valley nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' Schweitz said. ``I'll get on the CB and ask
some of these other truckers to give you a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Martin thought.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   No one stopped.
</P>
<P>
   So Schweitz improvised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, fellas, I need a ride here for my driver, Sterling
Marlin,'' Schweitz said.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, one of the large trucks slowed to a stop
about a half-mile from Marlin's location.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin thanked Schweitz, hopped out with his suitcase and began
to walk toward the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway, another car skidded to a stop and the driver motioned
Marlin to the passenger-side window.
</P>
<P>
   ``This old '72 Buick slides on up next to me and inside was this
elderly woman,'' Marlin said. ``She looked like she was about 85
years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Get in honey, I'll carry you.' So I get in and
she's got Bing Crosby playing full blast on her radio.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman dropped off Marlin at the awaiting hauler, but that
driver had to let Marlin off in Tucson because he had expired the
hours he was allowed on the road before making a mandatory stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (the driver) was real excited,'' Marlin said. ``But he kept
apologizing for the mess his cab was in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still facing a quandary as to how to negotiate the remaining 100
miles to Phoenix, Marlin walked into the truck stop hoping to spot
a friend.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wilburn, a former tire changer for driver Rusty Wallace,
was inside. Wilburn also was on his way to the Valley, where he was
entered in a World of Outlaws sprint-car show Friday at Manzanita
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Wilburn drove Marlin the remaining miles and Marlin was able to
make the scheduled appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too bad,'' he said of his adventure. ``I got to see
the countryside.'' &QL;

TRUCK SERIES STARTS LATER, DROPS 2 RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two down and only one to go.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials unveiled their 1999 Craftsman Truck Series
schedule Friday, leaving only Busch Series racers wondering when
and where they'll be driving next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup schedule was released several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes in next year's truck schedule is its
first-ever companion race with the Championship Auto Racing Teams
series. It will occur in July, during the same weekend as the U.S.
500 at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-race season begins March 20 in Miami, two months later
than this season's start, and ends Oct. 30 at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Three racetracks and two races also have been dropped from the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The later start is part of NASCAR's strategy to help increase
interest in the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to compact the schedule a little tighter than it
was,'' said Dennis Huth, NASCAR vice president for administration.
``By opening later, it gives us the opportunity to increase
interest by not conflicting with other NASCAR events.''
</P>
<P>
   This season's opener was Jan. 18 at Walt Disney World Speedway,
which was dropped from the schedule, but the next race wasn't until
April 4 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Facilities at Sonoma, Calif., and Flemington, N.J., also lost
their race dates.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Motor Speedway gained a second race, which will be
held at night Oct. 15 during the same weekend as an Indy Racing
League event.
</P>
<P>
   In all, nine races will be at night.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, ESPN will be the sole cable network to carry the
truck races. It will televise 22 and CBS has three race dates.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville Network and TBS, which televised races this
season, were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having only one cable network, it helps create an awareness
factor,'' Huth said. ``You can also do a lot of internal promotion
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Huth said that scheduling truck races on different days than
Winston Cup races was important ``in order for the trucks to create
their own identity.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hat dance &QL; 
 &QL; 
Native New Yorker Geoff Bodine wore his New York Yankees cap into
Phoenix International Raceway on Friday. And he almost didn't make
it through the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy at the gate said, `Yankee go home,' '' Bodine said.
``They say that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine was invited to Yankee Stadium in August and threw out the
ceremonial first pitch. One of Bodine's parting gifts was an
official Yankees cap. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
 &QL; 
It appears Ernie Irvan, injured in a crash two weeks ago at
Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway, might not need relief help in
Sunday's Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 at PIR. If so, Ricky Craven is
standing by.
</P>
<P>
   A feature on quarter-midget racing will be televised at 11 a.m.
Sunday on ESPN2. Jeff Gordon and Terry Labonte are featured. If you
can believe this, Gordon refused to kiss the trophy girl. Of
course, he was only 9 years old at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Davis of Dripping Springs, Texas won Valvoline's SynPower
Race Car Sweepstakes. The grand prize was a NASCAR Winston Cup car
formerly driven by Mark Martin. It was presented to Davis at PIR.
Martin raced the car 10 times, one of which he took to victory lane
at Dover Downs International Speedway.

DRIVING FORCE: FEMALE RACE FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was no way that Gary McBride was going to subject himself
to hours of noise while watching cars race around a track. He was
adamant. If there was ever a sure thing, that was it.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Holly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tried to explain things to me, but I said that just to see
cars going around in a circle, I would never go,'' McBride said.
``But she talked me into going in 1990, and every since that day I
was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly McBride said of her husband with the new attitude, ``Now
he's an addict.''
</P>
<P>
   The McBrides of Gilbert, who were at Phoenix International
Raceway this week watching the cars go through their paces in
preparation for Sunday's Dura-Lube/Kmart 500, probably are
atypical. Usually, it's the woman who has to be talked into going
to the track for her first look at the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR spectator base is still mostly male, but women are
flocking to the sport in a big way. NASCAR research shows that 32
percent of all its fans are women, up 5 percent from 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For Darlene Sisson of Mesa, it's driver Bobby Labonte who keeps
her coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wait for hours just to catch a glimpse of him,''
said Sisson, who has racing decals on each of her fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Sisson, who first came to the track with her husband, helped
introduce someone else to the sport _ her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was here from New York, and I told her how exciting it
was, and brought her to an Indy race here,'' she said. ``She
started rooting as soon as we got in. I'd never seen her like that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Latest numbers from other sports show that NASCAR's female
contingent is gaining ground. National Football League research
shows it has a 44 percent female fan base. The National Hockey
League and National Basketball Association report they are both at
41 percent. Interestingly, the Ladies Professional Golf Association
says that 48 percent of its tournament spectators are men. Figures
from Major League Baseball and the Professional Golfers Association
were not available.
</P>
<P>
   As they made their way through the pit and garage areas at PIR
on Thursday and Friday, female fans _ perhaps knowing that a tenet
of NASCAR is to be fan-friendly _ were not afraid to ask questions,
and at times even challenge the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Many auto racing fans, like Holly McBride, received their
indoctrinations from their fathers, husbands or boyfriends. In
McBride's case, it was her father, who took her to tracks in New
Jersey. She said that although she liked it right away, ``the noise
scared me at first.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's like a cup of coffee to get the blood going,'' she
said. ``It's like a scary movie. You might keep your hands in front
of your face, but you keep spreading your fingers to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, women strolling the PIR grounds said they were fans
for the same reasons as men. They like the noise, the excitement
and the fan-friendly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the women, some of whom did not want to be
identified, joked that a driver's looks and other parts of his
anatomy kept luring them back to the track. They also emphasized
that if they could talk some of their friends into coming to just
one race that they, too, would share their passion.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Anderson didn't have to be persuaded to go the track.
She just decided to show up one day _ and her story mirrors that of
many other women who say that all it took was one visit to keep
them coming back. Anderson told a quick story on why she'll be a
fan for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my grandson to the track in Watsonville (Calif.), and
he waved at Doug McCoun, and he waved back,'' Anderson said. ``We
became friends, and they know me around the track now as Doug's
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who lives in Santa Cruz, Calif., first went to the
local tracks around her hometown of Chariton, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted something to do one day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Slick of Sumner, Wyo., had her doubts at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated watching it at first,'' she said. ``But then I came to
the track with my husband, and the noise, the speed and seeing the
drivers after watching them on TV was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides supporting the drivers, women also are fiercely loyal to
NASCAR's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Sisson, for example, uses only Interstate Batteries, Labonte's
main sponsor, in her car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ate Kellogg's Corn Flakes this morning,'' Slick said. ``And
I save all the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, loyalty can be carried to the extreme. For example, in
the early 1980s, Darrell Waltrip was not a fan favorite as he
tooled around the circuit in his Mountain Dew car. Spectators loved
to boo him. During this time, a delivery man for the soft drink
Mountain Dew was loading a vending machine one moment, and the next
he was being loudly booed by the company's workers, male and female
alike. Shortly thereafter, Mountain Dew and Waltrip parted company.
</P>
<P>
   Real story or urban legend?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, it demonstrates the hold that the sport has
on its fans. &QL;

MANY ELECTION RACES HINGE ON GETTING OUT THE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Also moved in ``a'' category.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The campaign of 1998 entered an intense final
10-day stretch Saturday as Democrats and Republicans turned their
energies to vast telephone, mailing and advertising drives to prod
millions of loyalists to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Democrats no longer fear that their candidates will
be sullied by the White House scandal _ some are even trying to
turn it to their advantage _ politicians and party officials around
the United States say their biggest threat is that Republicans are
tapping into their huge financial advantage to dominate the
airwaves with commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're carpet-bombing right now with negative ads in most of
the country,'' said Craig Smith, the White House political
director. ``The amount of money they have is obscene. The question
becomes: How well are our guys holding up?''
</P>
<P>
   From Senate races in California and New York to contests for
governor in Maryland and Alabama to House matchups in every region,
candidates are so evenly matched that officials in both parties say
the outcomes hinge on a basic tactic: persuading their people to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true given that in this time of relative
economic contentment, compelling national themes have eluded both
parties, leaving most candidates clashing over local issues and
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1996 elections, when Speaker Newt Gingrich was the
No. 1 villain in Democratic commercials, his mug has hardly
surfaced in advertisements this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of the activity is not on the airwaves but on the
ground. In probably the largest turnout effort of any state, the
California Republican Party on Saturday began making 3{ million
phone calls to reliable Republican voters, urging them to vote on
Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have begun mailing slate cards to 3 million party
members in California, urging them to vote the party line. The
mailings close with a reminder of the White House scandal, but with
a twist: ``End the Washington witch hunt. Vote Democratic. Tell the
Republicans to get back to the business of running the country!''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the parties seem fairly evenly matched on the ground
because get-out-the-vote efforts by many unions have helped the
Democrats compensate for the Republicans' financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle over the airwaves is lopsided: Republican
organizations have collected as much as $300 million in the run-up
to the elections, edging out Democrats by more than $100 million.
In the final week, Republicans will channel at least $10 million
more into advertising than Democrats, according to estimates by
officials on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that in some states they had so little
to spend _ and waited so long to buy time _ that some television
stations were turning them away because all the advertising time
had already been bought by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The financial disparity is particularly disconcerting for
Democratic challengers for the House, who have a much greater
struggle raising money than incumbents do. By contrast, many
Republican challengers for the House who are considered long shots
are being lavished with resources from the national party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issueless year that has been driven by the good
economy and the dominance of the Lewinsky scandal,'' said Mitchell
Bainwol, chief of staff of the Republican National Committee.
``With no other issues getting traction, we are left with a very
microcampaign in the last 10 days, where Republican advantages in
dollars, intensity and individual candidates will enable us to
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   With the months-long distraction of the scandal having faded, at
least for now, candidates and voters finally seem to be engaging
each other. In some ways, the dynamic this year is like a British
election: It is being fiercely fought in only two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Most strategists in both parties agree that Republicans will
have the upper hand on Election Day. The big question, Democrats
say, is how successfully they can contain their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts are forecasting wild swings in either direction.
Most Republicans and Democrats predict that Republicans will build
on their thin 11-seat majority in the House; many say that more
likely than not, the gains will be no more than a dozen seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans expect to pick up seats, although it
is widely viewed as an uphill _ though entirely possible _
challenge to win a net gain of five seats. That would give
Republicans the 60 votes needed to cut off filibusters by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are many competitive races for governor,
strategists on both sides do not predict much shift in the
dominance of Republicans, who control 32 governorships and could
pick up a seat or two more. The overwhelming advantages of
incumbent Republican governors in Texas, Pennsylvania and Michigan
_ who have extensive and powerful political organizations _ are
expected to give an important lift to Republicans in tight House
races in those states.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in other races for governor, Democrats
will declare a huge victory if polls hold up and Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, a Democrat, defeats Dan Lungren for governor in California.
The California governorship, which Republicans have controlled for
16 years, is the biggest prize of the season; the winner will
preside over the redrawing of the state's congressional boundaries
after the 2000 census, affecting the composition of 52 House
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Warming up the audience for Davis at an event last week in
Riverside, Joe Baca, a Democrat running for the state Senate,
implored a labor audience to vote for Davis for the sake of other
candidates on the ticket _ and the party's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the other side is trying to do is to keep us from the
polls and voting,'' Baca said. ``We need him at the top of the
ticket. Because if we don't have him, what's going to happen to
labor?''
</P>
<P>
   But while the state's Democratic candidate for governor seems
comfortably ahead, another Democrat running statewide, Sen. Barbara
Boxer, trailed the Republican nominee, Matt Fong, in the polls for
weeks. By the end of last week, polls indicated that she had closed
the gap. That underscored how contests, at least in this state,
seem to be turning on the characteristics of individual candidates
and not on partisan advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a very mixed result on November 3,'' said
David Axelrod, a veteran Democratic strategist in Chicago. ``And
both parties are going to have something to crow about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without national themes, the outcome will carry important
national implications: It will be interpreted as a referendum on
whether the nation wants Congress to move forward with an
impeachment inquiry into President Clinton.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For months, the prevailing question among politicians was how
much the scandal would affect the elections. At first, Republicans
seized on Clinton's affair _ and tried to make character an issue
in races around the country. Then, after fleeing from the matter
for months, some Democrats embraced the scandal, asserting that
voters would turn against the Republican-controlled Congress for
approving an open-ended impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Though the events in Washington seem to have heightened
partisanship on both sides, most candidates in both parties are
steering clear of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   No Republicans are running commercials linking their opponents
to the scandal; only a few Democrats _ all challengers _ are
mentioning the impeachment inquiry in their advertisements. On
Friday, Christine Kehoe, a Democrat from San Diego in an uphill
effort to oust Rep. Brian Bilbray, a Republican, unveiled a
commercial about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partisan bickering _ politicians no longer in touch,'' the
narrator says. ``Brian Bilbray is doing things the Washington way.
Bilbray voted for impeachment hearings _ gridlock that could drag
on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks ago, Republicans boasted that Clinton was the best
thing to happen to them. Indeed, month after month, the Lewinsky
inquiry obscured the Democrats' efforts to take the offensive on
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were calling him the motivator-in-chief,'' said Mike
Madrid, political director of the California Republican Party. But,
explaining that the outcome here will have little to do with
Clinton, he added: ``This election is going to come down to three
things: turnout, turnout and turnout. Whoever gets their base to
the polls is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Torres, chairman of California's Democratic Party, said he
would decide in the next day or two whether to attack Republicans
for overreaching on impeachment as part of the party's telephone
efforts to get out the vote. But he said he was inclined not to.
``I don't think it's as strong a message as where the Democrats
stand on issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the mammoth drives, which include radio pitches
tailored to particular voters like Hispanics or blacks, experts
predict that turnout will be especially low this year for lack of
issues that excite voters. The outcome is likely to be decided by a
small core of people at the extremes of each party who usually vote
no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a lot of these races will be decided by 1,000 or
2,000 votes,'' said Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``This is the ultimate
roller coaster; you don't know whether the car is going to be up or
down on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The voter programs here are being mimicked on a smaller scale in
districts around the country, like in Allentown, Pa., where State
Sen. Roy Afflerbach is in fierce competition with Patrick Toomey, a
restaurant owner, for an open House seat. In the past week alone,
the Afflerbach campaign has made more than 40,000 telephone calls
through paid and volunteer efforts. Prospective voters are reminded
that Afflerbach, a Democrat, has a ``patient protection plan to
rein in the big HMOs and make health care more affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   In another competitive House race, in a Florida district that
extends from Jacksonville to Orlando, Rep. Corrine Brown, a
Democrat, has sent out campaign mailers that offer voters rides to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout efforts by her opponent, Bill Randall, have been
more problematic because he enraged many black leaders by declaring
that he had written off black voters and was focusing his attention
on white voters. He sought to clarify himself by insisting that he
was not writing off black voters. Ms. Brown is black.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, this much is clear: The deluge of
commercials in recent days has brought a sharp, and decidedly
negative, edge to the discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Though Republicans are not directly mentioning the scandal in
their advertisements, they are still lambasting the president. Last
week, for instance, the Republican Party unleashed a 30-second
commercial in 39 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the double talk?'' the announcer asks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, flashing on the screen, are snippets of videotape of
Clinton offering different assessments over time of how long it
would take to balance the budget. ``We should balance the budget
... in seven years ... in 10 years ... in eight years ... so we're
between seven and nine now,'' he says in footage that Republicans
used for commercials two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists said the ``double talk'' line was a
subtle reminder of Clinton's denials of an affair with Monica
Lewinsky.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERFURT, Germany _ A newly elected government and a new capital
have promoted much talk of ``a new Germany,'' and here, in a very
old German town, may be found the newest face of all.
</P>
<P>
   It is that of Carsten Schneider: bright-eyed, frank beneath
exuberant spikes of blond hair, seemingly unburdened by its
imminent passage into the history books. At 22, Schneider, a Social
Democrat like Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, is about to
become the youngest politician ever to sit in the German
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this young man seems to incarnate the more
forward-looking Germany that Schroeder says he will seek after
being sworn in on Tuesday. But the difficulties that crowd in on
Schneider bear the weight of the past, particularly the
disappointed hopes of German unification and the distress of a
strained economic model.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Erfurt, once home to Martin Luther and now home
to the wrecked remnants of a textile factory of the former East
German state, has reached 17 percent. Resentment toward what is
still called ``the West'' runs high.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond money and jobs, many people talk of a kind of moral void,
a bleak ``elbow society'' where elbows thrust as advancement is
restlessly sought but values of community have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get to the Bundestag, one of my aims will be strengthen
the confidence of Germans from the East,'' said Schneider, who will
attend the inaugural session of the newly elected Parliament in
Bonn on Monday. ``I want to get East German deputies to form a bloc
of their own, so we are no longer overrun. For real unification to
happen, the two sides must be at the same eye level.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Schneider's concerns are extraordinary. He was just
13 when the Berlin wall fell in 1989; he would appear to belong to
a generation more touched by German unity than German division.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a measure of the task facing the 54-year-old
Schroeder, who will head an untried coalition of Social Democrats
and Greens, that Germany has not yet defined itself in a way that
reaches across its former chasms. ``This is simply not a finished
country,'' one Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Erfurt's problems, common to many towns in the former East,
reflect the way Germany has been caught in a vicious circle that
has perpetuated, and often accentuated, divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The colossal transfers of funds from a prosperous West to a
formerly dilapidated East _ more than $625 billion since 1990 _
have been financed in part by increased social security charges
that now represent about 42.3 percent of wages compared with 35.5
percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   These increased wage costs have in turn made businessmen
reluctant to hire and have led to the elimination of more than 2.5
million jobs since 1991. Higher unemployment _ about 4 million
people are out of work _ has in turn put new pressure on a social
security system that was generously extended to the 15.5 million
people of the former East.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, under the strain of the exorbitant cost of
unification and faced by a more competitive global economy, the
social-market economic model that propelled Germany to post-World
War II prosperity has begun to buckle without anyone's being able
to agree on how to modernize it. In the place of cohesion has come
recrimination and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the election on Sept. 27, Schroeder has been
grappling with this central problem, one made more acute by
Germany's rapidly aging population and the consequent pressure on
pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, who was working as a trainee in a bank before he
decided to go into politics, said he was a little disappointed with
the result. ``I like Tony Blair, I like New Labor,'' Schneider
said. ``The problem here is that our Social Democratic party is
still very traditionalist. We have not yet shown enough courage for
a really new beginning. We need more private pension schemes, more
venture capital for new technologies in the East, a more
customer-friendly civil service, and banks more ready to back
risk-takers.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Schroeder's program smacks of difficult compromise.
Only in the area of immigration law _ where a change allowing many
of Germany's 7 million foreigners to gain citizenship has been
written into the coalition's program _ does a shift look really
decisive. Another bold measure _ the elimination of nuclear power _
has been left for the fairly distant, nebulous future.
</P>
<P>
   In the central area of economic reform, steps look timid. Unlike
Blair, Schroeder has had no Margaret Thatcher to precede him; the
entire onus of any change thus lies on him. Although clearly
tempted by aspects of the American model _ Schroeder often talks of
his fascination with New York _ it is still unclear how, if at all,
he will adapt the German system.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there have been casualties. Schroeder's first choice
for economics minister, the bustling self-made computer-industry
millionaire Jost Stollman, often portrayed here as about the
nearest thing Germany has to a Bill Gates, stormed out last week,
complaining that his powers were being usurped by the finance
ministry and that ``the loss of jobs is being programmed in.''
</P>
<P>
   His anger was evidently leveled principally at Oskar Lafontaine,
the powerful Social Democratic party chairman and finance minister
in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Stollman's sweeping talk of deregulation had tried the patience
of Lafontaine, who runs the party machine and knows that speeches
about the need to curb ``the global casino of world financial
markets'' _ a constant Lafontaine theme of late _ play better than
pension reform on the factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Stollman's departure is a bad sign for me,'' Schneider
said. ``We'll have to see if the forces of reform can still
prevail.''

<P>
   For now, the government's program of tax reform _ including a
so-called ecology tax on energy designed to permit a slight
reduction in social security charges to encourage hiring _ appears
too modest to have any immediate effect on unemployment. Germany's
six leading economic research institutes have all dismissed it as
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Erfurt, a city of 205,000 people, Kurt Keiner, the
director of the Thuringia state labor office, said that he thought
it impossible that unemployment would come down over the next year.
Indeed, without state-supported ``make work'' programs, he said,
unemployment would be as high as 25 percent _ ``an intolerable
level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it could even take another generation to solve
these problems,'' Keiner said. ``The walls in heads and hearts have
been growing in both parts of Germany, and we have divided more
than we have come together. This makes any coherent attack on
unemployment difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs from his office, two young men who had come to
collect unemployment benefits got into a brawl, punching and
head-butting each other as onlookers called for the police.
Meanwhile, a 47-year-old man, Roland Berard, perused job offerings
on a computer, but having been out of work for 18 months, he said
he held out little hope. ``I am too old for the job market,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider may seem too young for the political market. But he
has already made plans to join the parliamentary budget committee
and has evidently thought deeply about his new responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we cannot quickly solve economic problems, I think we
can write a new chapter in Germany history,'' he said. ``Bonn was
always a transitional phase. With the move to Berlin, I think we
have a unique opportunity to help unite East and West by really
talking openly of our communist and fascist demons. My dream is a
tolerant and truly united Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   As if surprised by his weighty words, Schneider added, ``And
besides, the night life in Berlin is a lot better than in Bonn.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a flippant remark. But it may indeed be that Schroeder,
as chancellor, will need to resort to style as much as substance _
the new, racy Berlin Republic over the old Rhineland conservatism
of sleepy Bonn _ in attempting to galvanize and bring together the
Germany that he seems destined to guide into the next century.

   INTERNATIONAL (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-PALESTINIANS (Ramallah, West Bank) _ Yasser Arafat has a
tough crowd to please. Palestinians, from the elite strata of the
intellectual class to the angry ranks of the refugee camps, believe
the agreement signed at the White House on Friday is mostly a
reiteration of actions already promised in the 1993 and 1995
accords in Oslo and never undertaken. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-RDP (Washington) _ After Friday's White House
extravaganza of rhetoric and hope, as Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed an
interim peace accord that was 19 months in the squabbling, those
who stand to lose most by the deal were quick to respond. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-BAILOUT (Washington) _ The United States is preparing to
commit American taxpayer funds as part of a lending program of at
least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, and with it the rest
of Latin America, from the worst effects of the financial turmoil
circling the globe, according to U.S. and foreign officials
assembling the program. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-DIVISIONS (Erfurt, Germany) _ It is a measure of the
task facing Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who will head an
untried coalition of Social Democrats and Greens, that Germany has
not yet defined itself in a way that reaches across its former
chasms. ``This is simply not a finished country,'' one Western
diplomat said. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   LEIPZIG-MALL (Leipzig, Germany) _ The immense railway terminal
in this eastern German city stands like a temple to modern
transport and commerce. But store owners in narrow downtown lanes
are praying that it will not mean the end of their trade. Last year
marked the completion of a two-year, $230 million overhaul of
Europe's largest rail terminus into Europe's largest shopping mall.
By John Tagliabue. (EDS: This story, which was held earlier in the
week, is now cleared for publication.)
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-MURDERS (Buenos Aires, Argentina) _ Even by Argentine
standards, the country has been treated to a barrage of recent news
coverage about suspicious deaths. Though on the surface the deaths
do not seem to be linked in any way, and may simply be a series of
macabre coincidences, the news reports have spawned vague
suggestions in the last several weeks that organized crime or the
Menem government itself is involved and blocking the cause of
justice. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   MONGOLIA-MYSTERY (Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia) _ Who killed
Sanjaasuren Zorig? From the apartment blocks, offices and countless
bars of this capital city to the nomadic tents across the endless
countryside, Mongolians have been obsessed with the question in the
three weeks since the man known as the father of their democracy
was stabbed to death by masked attackers. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   KAZAKHSTAN-POLITICS (Almaty, Kazakhstan) _ In the past eight
weeks, Akezhan Kazhegeldin says, his press aide was attacked by
masked men, a weekly close to him was firebombed and he was shot
at. If the intended message is that Kazhegeldin, 46, a businessman
and former prime minister, should drop out of next January's
presidential election, he is not listening. By Steve LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-NONDEFECTOR (United Nations) _ Despite rumblings that he is
on the verge of defecting, the half-brother of President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq, Barzan el-Takriti, who is an envoy in Geneva, has
sidestepped the question. By Youssef M. Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-TALKS (Geneva) _ The United States, China and the two
Koreas agreed Saturday to create two working parties to explore a
peace treaty and to examine confidence-building measures on the
peninsula, home to the most heavily defended border in the world.

<P>
   NEV-LAND-AUCTION (Carson City, Nev.) _ The federal government is
preparing to auction 27,000 acres of public land near Las Vegas

of the proceeds to stay in Nevada instead of going to the Treasury.
</P>

genetically engineered, patented bacterium, hope they are on the
cusp of a new era _ using garbage to make ethanol. By Matthew L.
Wald.
</P>
<P>
   AMERINDIANS-SCOTUS (Lawrence, Kan.) _ It was all white men on
the Supreme Court who handed down the milestone rulings that helped
decide the fate of American Indians more than a century ago. Now,
here at the University of Kansas School of Law, Indian lawyers are
acting out a legal ``what if'' experiment: What if there had been
Indians on the Supreme Court of the 1800s? By William Glaberson.

Richard L. Berke.
</P>

   N.C.-SENATE-RACE (Rocky Mount, N.C.) _ In the waning days of a
struggling re-election campaign, Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North
Carolina is working frantically to blemish the telegenic appeal of
his Democratic challenger, John Edwards, by linking Edwards to
another Democrat whose telegenic appeal once masked deeper flaws.
By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   UNIONS-REPUBS _ In the 1996 campaign, organized labor's approach
toward the Republican Party could best be described as all-out war,
but judging from Tony Speelman's enthusiastic calls on behalf of a

evolved considerably. By Steven Greenhouse.

MANY ELECTION RACES HINGE ON GETTING OUT THE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moved in ``p'' category.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The campaign of 1998 entered an intense final
10-day stretch Saturday as Democrats and Republicans turned their
energies to vast telephone, mailing and advertising drives to prod
millions of loyalists to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Democrats no longer fear that their candidates will
be sullied by the White House scandal _ some are even trying to
turn it to their advantage _ politicians and party officials around
the United States say their biggest threat is that Republicans are
tapping into their huge financial advantage to dominate the
airwaves with commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're carpet-bombing right now with negative ads in most of
the country,'' said Craig Smith, the White House political
director. ``The amount of money they have is obscene. The question
becomes: How well are our guys holding up?''
</P>
<P>
   From Senate races in California and New York to contests for
governor in Maryland and Alabama to House matchups in every region,
candidates are so evenly matched that officials in both parties say
the outcomes hinge on a basic tactic: persuading their people to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true given that in this time of relative
economic contentment, compelling national themes have eluded both
parties, leaving most candidates clashing over local issues and
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1996 elections, when Speaker Newt Gingrich was the
No. 1 villain in Democratic commercials, his mug has hardly
surfaced in advertisements this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of the activity is not on the airwaves but on the
ground. In probably the largest turnout effort of any state, the
California Republican Party on Saturday began making 3{ million
phone calls to reliable Republican voters, urging them to vote on
Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have begun mailing slate cards to 3 million party
members in California, urging them to vote the party line. The
mailings close with a reminder of the White House scandal, but with
a twist: ``End the Washington witch hunt. Vote Democratic. Tell the
Republicans to get back to the business of running the country!''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the parties seem fairly evenly matched on the ground
because get-out-the-vote efforts by many unions have helped the
Democrats compensate for the Republicans' financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle over the airwaves is lopsided: Republican
organizations have collected as much as $300 million in the run-up
to the elections, edging out Democrats by more than $100 million.
In the final week, Republicans will channel at least $10 million
more into advertising than Democrats, according to estimates by
officials on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that in some states they had so little
to spend _ and waited so long to buy time _ that some television
stations were turning them away because all the advertising time
had already been bought by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The financial disparity is particularly disconcerting for
Democratic challengers for the House, who have a much greater
struggle raising money than incumbents do. By contrast, many
Republican challengers for the House who are considered long shots
are being lavished with resources from the national party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issueless year that has been driven by the good
economy and the dominance of the Lewinsky scandal,'' said Mitchell
Bainwol, chief of staff of the Republican National Committee.
``With no other issues getting traction, we are left with a very
microcampaign in the last 10 days, where Republican advantages in
dollars, intensity and individual candidates will enable us to
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   With the months-long distraction of the scandal having faded, at
least for now, candidates and voters finally seem to be engaging
each other. In some ways, the dynamic this year is like a British
election: It is being fiercely fought in only two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Most strategists in both parties agree that Republicans will
have the upper hand on Election Day. The big question, Democrats
say, is how successfully they can contain their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts are forecasting wild swings in either direction.
Most Republicans and Democrats predict that Republicans will build
on their thin 11-seat majority in the House; many say that more
likely than not, the gains will be no more than a dozen seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans expect to pick up seats, although it
is widely viewed as an uphill _ though entirely possible _
challenge to win a net gain of five seats. That would give
Republicans the 60 votes needed to cut off filibusters by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are many competitive races for governor,
strategists on both sides do not predict much shift in the
dominance of Republicans, who control 32 governorships and could
pick up a seat or two more. The overwhelming advantages of
incumbent Republican governors in Texas, Pennsylvania and Michigan
_ who have extensive and powerful political organizations _ are
expected to give an important lift to Republicans in tight House
races in those states.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in other races for governor, Democrats
will declare a huge victory if polls hold up and Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, a Democrat, defeats Dan Lungren for governor in California.
The California governorship, which Republicans have controlled for
16 years, is the biggest prize of the season; the winner will
preside over the redrawing of the state's congressional boundaries
after the 2000 census, affecting the composition of 52 House
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Warming up the audience for Davis at an event last week in
Riverside, Joe Baca, a Democrat running for the state Senate,
implored a labor audience to vote for Davis for the sake of other
candidates on the ticket _ and the party's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the other side is trying to do is to keep us from the
polls and voting,'' Baca said. ``We need him at the top of the
ticket. Because if we don't have him, what's going to happen to
labor?''
</P>
<P>
   But while the state's Democratic candidate for governor seems
comfortably ahead, another Democrat running statewide, Sen. Barbara
Boxer, trailed the Republican nominee, Matt Fong, in the polls for
weeks. By the end of last week, polls indicated that she had closed
the gap. That underscored how contests, at least in this state,
seem to be turning on the characteristics of individual candidates
and not on partisan advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a very mixed result on November 3,'' said
David Axelrod, a veteran Democratic strategist in Chicago. ``And
both parties are going to have something to crow about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without national themes, the outcome will carry important
national implications: It will be interpreted as a referendum on
whether the nation wants Congress to move forward with an
impeachment inquiry into President Clinton.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For months, the prevailing question among politicians was how
much the scandal would affect the elections. At first, Republicans
seized on Clinton's affair _ and tried to make character an issue
in races around the country. Then, after fleeing from the matter
for months, some Democrats embraced the scandal, asserting that
voters would turn against the Republican-controlled Congress for
approving an open-ended impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Though the events in Washington seem to have heightened
partisanship on both sides, most candidates in both parties are
steering clear of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   No Republicans are running commercials linking their opponents
to the scandal; only a few Democrats _ all challengers _ are
mentioning the impeachment inquiry in their advertisements. On
Friday, Christine Kehoe, a Democrat from San Diego in an uphill
effort to oust Rep. Brian Bilbray, a Republican, unveiled a
commercial about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partisan bickering _ politicians no longer in touch,'' the
narrator says. ``Brian Bilbray is doing things the Washington way.
Bilbray voted for impeachment hearings _ gridlock that could drag
on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks ago, Republicans boasted that Clinton was the best
thing to happen to them. Indeed, month after month, the Lewinsky
inquiry obscured the Democrats' efforts to take the offensive on
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were calling him the motivator-in-chief,'' said Mike
Madrid, political director of the California Republican Party. But,
explaining that the outcome here will have little to do with
Clinton, he added: ``This election is going to come down to three
things: turnout, turnout and turnout. Whoever gets their base to
the polls is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Torres, chairman of California's Democratic Party, said he
would decide in the next day or two whether to attack Republicans
for overreaching on impeachment as part of the party's telephone
efforts to get out the vote. But he said he was inclined not to.
``I don't think it's as strong a message as where the Democrats
stand on issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the mammoth drives, which include radio pitches
tailored to particular voters like Hispanics or blacks, experts
predict that turnout will be especially low this year for lack of
issues that excite voters. The outcome is likely to be decided by a
small core of people at the extremes of each party who usually vote
no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a lot of these races will be decided by 1,000 or
2,000 votes,'' said Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``This is the ultimate
roller coaster; you don't know whether the car is going to be up or
down on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The voter programs here are being mimicked on a smaller scale in
districts around the country, like in Allentown, Pa., where State
Sen. Roy Afflerbach is in fierce competition with Patrick Toomey, a
restaurant owner, for an open House seat. In the past week alone,
the Afflerbach campaign has made more than 40,000 telephone calls
through paid and volunteer efforts. Prospective voters are reminded
that Afflerbach, a Democrat, has a ``patient protection plan to
rein in the big HMOs and make health care more affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   In another competitive House race, in a Florida district that
extends from Jacksonville to Orlando, Rep. Corrine Brown, a
Democrat, has sent out campaign mailers that offer voters rides to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout efforts by her opponent, Bill Randall, have been
more problematic because he enraged many black leaders by declaring
that he had written off black voters and was focusing his attention
on white voters. He sought to clarify himself by insisting that he
was not writing off black voters. Ms. Brown is black.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, this much is clear: The deluge of
commercials in recent days has brought a sharp, and decidedly
negative, edge to the discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Though Republicans are not directly mentioning the scandal in
their advertisements, they are still lambasting the president. Last
week, for instance, the Republican Party unleashed a 30-second
commercial in 39 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the double talk?'' the announcer asks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, flashing on the screen, are snippets of videotape of
Clinton offering different assessments over time of how long it
would take to balance the budget. ``We should balance the budget
... in seven years ... in 10 years ... in eight years ... so we're
between seven and nine now,'' he says in footage that Republicans
used for commercials two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists said the ``double talk'' line was a
subtle reminder of Clinton's denials of an affair with Monica
Lewinsky.

   The images were arresting. There they were, Ariel Sharon, who
once sent the Israeli military to Beirut for Yasser Arafat's head,
and Benjamin Netanyahu, who long avoided shaking the man's hand,
sitting together in Maryland agreeing with the Palestinian leader
on land and airports and prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that the weakness of the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord worked out in Oslo, Norway, was
that it was embraced by only half of Israel, the secular liberals
of European origin, and had never been sold to religious Israelis,
the poor and those of Middle Eastern origin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three years after an Orthodox, Yemenite Israeli student
sought to end the peace deal by assassinating Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, here were the representatives of that other Israel
coming to terms with the reality that Oslo had created.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they were making it hard with their near walkouts and
last-minute demands. But that was the way toward real peace: you
relinquish holy land with a tear in your eye and an ache in your
gut, not with the detachment of the previous government. Here were
negotiators who understood the fears as well as the hopes of their
people, who could build an agreement that might survive those
fears. Rabin, the messenger of peace, may have died, but his
message has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the past five years _ since Rabin and Arafat shook
hands on the White House lawn _ have offered sobering lessons on
why optimism has rarely held sway in this process since.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the intimate and personal Oslo negotiations, at
the Wye Plantation it took the president of the United States and
the King of Jordan days and nights of prodding to produce this next
interim step. And its implementation is highly complex.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, details and implementation posed formidable barriers
to peace from the start. What is different this time is that the
Wye agreement comes in the context of difficult experience in
making specific peace arrangements work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Netanyahu's election more than two years ago, the
message from the government was that we have to begin a new life
with the Palestinians; let's be neighbors,'' said Yoel Esteron,
managing editor of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. ``But now there
is no spirit of reconciliation. What we have is a deal among
technocrats, a deal with no soul or spirit because there is so
little good feeling left.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Shlomo Gazit, aformer director of Israel's military
intelligence, put it this way: ``I am very doubtful that this is a
new beginning. For the process to go on, there must be trust and
understanding between the two sides and a joint will to move ahead
to an overall agreement. What happened in recent months does not
bring us any nearer to that.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the Palestinians and Israelis agreed to make
peace five years ago but never did much to alter the sense they had
of each other. Schools on both sides have virtually no lessons in
the other's history. Maps in Palestinian schools still show only
the names of Palestinian villages destroyed by Israel, not the new
Israeli cities. Israeli maps and textbooks make no reference to the
destroyed Palestinian towns or to the life and culture of
Palestinians before Zionist immigration in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   An official 8th-grade textbook from the Palestinian Authority
was recently shown to include the sentence, ``The prime examples of
racial discrimination are Zionism and Nazism.'' Last August,
Palestinian television was showing footage of a summer camp with
youngsters training with automatic weapons and chanting, ``I
foresee my death and I rush toward it!'' and, ``A hero's death, the
death of a suicide warrior!''
</P>
<P>
   Esteron of Haaretz said that even the largely liberal, educated
Israeli readers of his newspaper seem unmoved by the difficulties
that Palestinians suffer as a result of Israeli rules and
regulations _ checkpoints, bans on home building, severe
restrictions on trade, industry and movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at it as if it were somewhere in the Philippines,
not right next door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has tended to consider the Oslo accord a kind of
apology from the other, an acknowledgment that it had done wrong.
But each side sees only the other's misdeeds, not its own.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem that has overwhelmed all others is the enormous
imbalance _ military, geopolitical and economic _ between Israel
and the Palestinians. For many Palestinians, Israel is simply a
neighborhood outpost of the U.S.-dominated global economy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the new global system has little place in it for land,
clan and honor, values upon which Palestinian society has long been
built, and can be so unforgiving to those not part of it, Israel is
seen as a threat in the most fundamental way to the values of many
in the West Bank and Gaza. To many there, Israel stands for sexual
permissiveness and godlessness, and so the battle against it goes
beyond a fight over land and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is, of course, still more complicated. A battle over
values exists within Israel itself, where a religious-secular
divide threatens internal politics. Rabin's assassin, Yigal Amir,
like many Sephardi and religious Israelis, felt that peace was
draining the nation of its biblical mission and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Netanyahu and Sharon the advocates of peace, the
opponents of peace within Israel may feel more and more
marginalized. But that does not necessarily mean Israelis will see
Palestinians in a more generous light. Israelis feel that what they
are giving up is not fully appreciated _ as Netanyahu has said, 1
percent of the West Bank is the size of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the end of this process includes something that
bears the name ``State of Palestine,'' as the Palestinians so
fervently hope and the majority of Israelis now accept, many doubt
it will end the century-old Jewish-Arab conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal does not change the basic rules of the game,''
asserted Meron Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem and
advocate of greater Israeli concessions. ``Let's say the
Palestinians get even 50 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about water resources, land development, sewage.
Israelis use five times the water of Palestinians. What happens
when the Palestinians want more? Where will it come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis will say: `We gave all we could. No more. The
rest is ours.' So what the Palestinians will get is exactly what
the Israelis can live with, peace without any real price. That's
why they don't care if there is a Palestinian state. That's why
even Sharon and Netanyahu can accept a state, because of the way
they will define it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Jarbawi, a Palestinian political scientist at Bir Zeit
University in the West Bank, said he was equally pessimistic. ``I
think that for Netanyahu this week's deal is the end of the track
altogether,'' he said. ``He won't give up much more land. And what
kind of state will we get? There will be cantons with no direct
links. It is a gloomy prospect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Ben-Simon, a political analyst for Haaretz, said he
believes the new accord will reshape Israeli politics because the
issue that has defined left and right for so long _ territorial
concession and a Palestinian state _ will no longer be there. In
addition, he says that because of the Palestinian question, other
Israeli problems, like the religious and ethnic divides, have
festered. Now they can be dealt with and that process will produce
an entirely new set of parties and coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   But Gazit, the former military intelligence chief, is far less
hopeful. He believes that Sharon and Netanyahu have no long-term
vision for the Palestinian question.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is huge writing on the wall,'' he said. ``It shows us
that without a comprehensive agreement with our neighbors we are
doomed ultimately to war. I think the politicians see it. But they
don't have the courage to act on it.''

   The images were arresting. There they were, Ariel Sharon, who
once sent the Israeli military to Beirut for Yasser Arafat's head,
and Benjamin Netanyahu, who long avoided shaking the man's hand,
sitting together in Maryland agreeing with the Palestinian leader
on land and airports and prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that the weakness of the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord worked out in Oslo, Norway, was
that it was embraced by only half of Israel, the secular liberals
of European origin, and had never been sold to religious Israelis,
the poor and those of Middle Eastern origin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three years after an Orthodox, Yemenite Israeli student
sought to end the peace deal by assassinating Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, here were the representatives of that other Israel
coming to terms with the reality that Oslo had created.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they were making it hard with their near walkouts and
last-minute demands. But that was the way toward real peace: you
relinquish holy land with a tear in your eye and an ache in your
gut, not with the detachment of the previous government. Here were
negotiators who understood the fears as well as the hopes of their
people, who could build an agreement that might survive those
fears. Rabin, the messenger of peace, may have died, but his
message has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the past five years _ since Rabin and Arafat shook
hands on the White House lawn _ have offered sobering lessons on
why optimism has rarely held sway in this process since.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the intimate and personal Oslo negotiations, at
the Wye Plantation it took the president of the United States and
the King of Jordan days and nights of prodding to produce this next
interim step. And its implementation is highly complex.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, details and implementation posed formidable barriers
to peace from the start. What is different this time is that the
Wye agreement comes in the context of difficult experience in
making specific peace arrangements work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Netanyahu's election more than two years ago, the
message from the government was that we have to begin a new life
with the Palestinians; let's be neighbors,'' said Yoel Esteron,
managing editor of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. ``But now there
is no spirit of reconciliation. What we have is a deal among
technocrats, a deal with no soul or spirit because there is so
little good feeling left.''
</P>

PAINTING BILL GATES AS A VILLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(EDS: optional sidebar at end of article)

 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Will it matter to consumers that Bill Gates isn't a nice guy?
 &HT;    Until last week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman
of the Microsoft Corp., as a genius and innovator. A nerd perhaps _
but also a self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly
unlocked the power of the personal computer.
 &HT;    Monday, however, in a Washington courtroom, the Justice
Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. In
an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man
whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for
personal computer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian
schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition.
 &HT;    Product innovation, the suit argues, is not a sufficient weapon
for Gates. Flashing back and forth between snippets of Gates'
videotaped deposition and e-mail messages he had sent that
contradicted his testimony, the government sought to establish a
pattern of threats and offers of payments by the Microsoft
chairman. It also sought to cast Gates as an obsessed man who
feared the tiny Netscape Communications Corp. and its potential
threat to his domination of the market for Internet browsers, the
software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
 &HT;    Gates was portrayed by Justice Department litigator David Boies
as a schoolyard bully who rides roughshod over the computer
industry with a crudeness that is in stark contrast to his popular
image as a benevolent dictator and high-technology guru. According
to a document presented by Boies, for example, Gates asked America
Online executives in 1996: ``How much do we need to pay you'' to
damage Netscape? ``This is your lucky day.''
 &HT;    The implication, Boies said, was that the amount was irrelevant,
and that Microsoft, with its deep pockets and market dominance,
makes as many ``offers you can't refuse'' as needed to achieve its
goals.
 &HT;    Microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any
hint that the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be
detracting from the company's world-famous brand name, but they
insist that the public will continue to draw a distinction between
allegations of anticompetitive business tactics and the company's
software.
 &HT;    ``Despite what you're reading in the press, people judge us by
our products,'' said Mich Matthews, head of Microsoft's corporate
public-relations office. ``Our experience is that people vote with
their pocketbooks.''
 &HT;    So far, consumers are casting positive votes. Last week
Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $1.52 billion, a stunning
58 percent increase over the level a year earlier.
 &HT;    Despite the record profits, some marketing experts say that if
the public comes to view Gates as a Rockefeller-style robber baron,
his company and its brand name may suffer.
 &HT;    ``When you have a company with such a visible chief executive,
the CEO is really the driver of the brand,'' said David Aaker, a
brand marketing expert at the Haas School of Business at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``There is no question this
is going to affect Microsoft's brand recognition.''
 &HT;    Already there are early warning signals, as political cartoons
in newspapers across the country bashed Gates last week. One showed
him holding a globe and saying, ``If you don't play my way, I'll
take my ball and go home''; another portrayed the Microsoft
chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window
while a Microsoft secretary says to a caller, ``I'm sorry, but Mr.
Gates is busy teaching a competitor about Windows.''
 &HT;    But some industry analysts believe the new view of a Bill Gates
who knows how to play hardball may not be such a bad thing for his
company. The he-said, she-said round of e-mail messages being
dragged out in court cases both in Washington and in Silicon
Valley, where Microsoft is locked in a legal battle with its
archrival, Sun Microsystems Inc., is viewed by some as little
different from the exaggerated trash talking that goes on in
professional sports.
 &HT;    ``It's like taking what Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan say
to each other on the ball court'' and turning it into something
more sinister than it really is, said Paul Andrews, co-author with
Stephen Manes of ``Gates'' (Doubleday, 1993).
 &HT;    Indeed, there is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his
company has so far taken root only in the District of Columbia and
in Silicon Valley, where the computer industry has long felt the
impact of Gates' tactics, and where bitterness and distrust of
Microsoft are deep.
 &HT;    In the rest of the country, Gates continues to enjoy great
popularity. Two weeks ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost
7,000 students at Indiana University, a questioner who asked about
the Justice Department's suit was roundly booed.
 &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Bill Gates a high-tech Machiavelli, Public Enemy No. 1 or a
threat to the known universe? All three, judging from the numerous
political cartoons that popped up in newspapers across the country
last week.
</P>
<P>
   From Chattanooga to Boston, cartoonists took delight in
demonizing Gates, who is facing an unexpected public relations
challenge as Microsoft's antitrust trial unfolds in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Other cartoons ran the gamut from the predictable (a worker,
pointing to an aquarium in which a large fish is gobbling up
smaller ones, saying to some visitors, ``Welcome to Microsoft's
research and development department'') to the weird (a dweebish man
hunched in front of a computer screen staring at the words: ``Our
beloved leader, Mr. Gates, is under attack. Leave your possessions.
Go to the desert. Await the spaceship'').
</P>
<P>
   And that was just Week One of the trial. Stay tuned.

GAY POLITICS AND ANTI-POLITICS: A MOVEMENT DIVIDED

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of gay demonstrators scrapped with police
officers in midtown Manhattan on Monday, protesting the violent
death of a young gay man in Wyoming. The clash recalled the
Stonewall uprising, the brawl between homosexuals and policemen
outside a Greenwich Village bar that launched the gay rights
movement in 1969. Many of the people gathered in front of the Plaza
Hotel last week had marched in Greenwich Village 29 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a very different expression of the gay rights movement
was taking place in Washington. In a tense, quarrelsome conference
call, 22 members of the board of directors of the Human Rights
Campaign, the most mainstream of American gay organizations, voted
to endorse Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato over Democratic Rep.
Charles Schumer in New York's U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same D'Amato who had been the target of many of the
gay men and women the night before; they were outraged by the
anti-homosexual positions of many of his Republican colleagues,
especially his allies in the state Legislature who have blocked
consideration of a gay rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   As discordant as they might appear, the events in New York and
Washington accurately reflected two major forces that have roiled
the gay rights movement over the decades. This inherently fractious
political movement has been torn by a struggle between pragmatic
homosexuals who seek to work with government and more hostile
advocates who tend to view government as an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, a group of young, radical New Yorkers formed the Gay
Liberation Front, pushing aside the staid Mattachine Society, whose
suit-and-tie leaders had quietly worked with Mayor John Lindsay to
end entrapment of homosexuals in public bathrooms and police
harassment of gay bars. Fifteen years later, young protesters
picketed the Municipal Elections Committee of Los Angeles, the
city's pioneer gay political action committee, after its leaders,
adopting the anti-AIDS position of the more conservative forces in
local government, called for bathhouses to close. The creation of
Act Up in 1987 was, from its first demonstration in the financial
district, a repudiation of established gay rights groups from
Washington to New York.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Human Rights Campaign plays the
inside-the-system role. The organization, the first national gay
political action committee, distinguished itself upon its founding
in the early 1980's by holding black-tie fund-raisers at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, though it might be better remembered for the
alliance it struck with D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between defiant advocates and those who prefer to
compromise has been mirrored in other civil rights movements,
notably the one for black rights. But the gay rights movement is
distinct because it is made up of such a diverse universe _
covering all ideologies, economic classes and races. Its members
share only two traits: sexual orientation and, most likely, the
experience of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that the movement as a whole has
never reached a consensus about its mission: An equal rights bill?
Admission to the military? The right to marry? To be left alone?
</P>
<P>
   The tension between those who want a place at the table and
those who want to throw rocks through the window has been one of
the few constants. On one side, the gathering at the Plaza Hotel,
like that at the Stonewall Inn, was a spontaneous venting of
frustration and a classic display of take-it-to-the-streets
politics. No major organization put out the call for the protest;
there was no list of demands, no leader. The spark was Matthew
Shepard, the 21-year-old University of Wyoming student murdered in
what authorities described as a bias-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Human Rights Campaign is about as
establishment as politics get in Washington, with an annual budget
of $13 million, a board of directors and stationery. Vice President
Al Gore attends its annual dinner, which brings in money for
candidates who support gay rights measures.
</P>
<P>
   And like all establishment homosexual groups of the past 30
years, it is focused and pragmatic. Its members practice the kind
of politics that the street firebrands have either rejected or
failed to understand, starting with compromise.
</P>
<P>
   To many people in New York, the notion of a gay rights
organization endorsing D'Amato may seem astonishing. To the Human
Rights Campaign it was the obvious decision: D'Amato took its side
on many gay rights issues in recent years. And in a race involving
two candidates with similar records on gay issues, the group has a
policy of picking the incumbent. This determined pragmatism comes
at a time when the board has been trying to demonstrate to
Washington its readiness to work with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to appreciate the divergent views is to consider
two people who were at the center of both the disturbances at the
Stonewall and the Plaza Hotel: Andrew Tobias, a financial writer
who is a member of the Human Rights Campaign board, and Jim
Fouratt, a New York record producer who protested in front of the
Stonewall and in front of the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias, who organized a fund-raiser for Schumer, makes a
passionate case for Schumer's election. ``I'm terrified of a
filibuster-proof Senate,'' he said, referring to the possibility
that Democrats will hold fewer than 40 seats after Nov. 3. ``And I
have very strong feelings about choice.'' D'Amato, unlike Schumer,
opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tobias fully supports what his board did. How could the
Human Rights Campaign hope to convince other Republicans to follow
D'Amato's path and defy party orthodoxy, he asked, if it turned its
back on the senator now? It is a nuanced position, he acknowledged,
but a rational one. ``Clearly, D'Amato, by all of our policies,
earned and deserved the endorsement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the kind of argument that has perplexed people
like Fouratt for years. D'Amato's endorsement was ``shocking,''
Fouratt said, nothing more than the latest example of the
short-sightedness of the ``middle class,'' as he disparagingly
calls the establishment homosexuals. ``You don't change people's
opinions and attitudes by power-brokering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fouratt did not say it, but that is about the same point he made
28 years ago, when another group of gay activists, the Gay
Activists Alliance, tried to nudge their new movement into the
mainstream by lobbying for a gay rights bill in New York City. It
seems safe to say it is a difference of opinion that is going to be
troubling this movement for a long time.

CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK MAY DECLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- There is no doubt that California's real estate
market is on track for a banner year. Sales are expected to reach
record levels, supplies are tight, demand is strong and prices are
rising.
</P>
<P>
   But it's that kind of performance that is starting to worry
analysts, economists and industry officials alike.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, they see the leading edge of a crisis forming that
could stall the state's robust economy and send companies to other
states in search of affordable housing for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   New-home construction is simply not keeping up with demand. And
with prices rising, the number of residents who can afford a house
will diminish as California heads into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, affordability, which is measured by the percentage of
the population earning enough money to buy the median priced home,
is already diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If home prices continue to increase, affordability is going to
continue to erode and erase some of the progress we have made since
the late 1980s,'' said G.U. Krueger, deputy chief economist for the
California Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, 37 percent of Los Angeles County residents can afford
the median-priced home, which is at $193,020. That's an increase of
10.8 percent from a year earlier, according to a report that will
be released Monday by the Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, 43 percent of the county's residents could afford
the median-priced home. It was at a record low of 10 percent in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates, which are near-historic lows, have been fickle
lately, and a sudden upturn could drive affordability down even
further, Krueger said.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence of increasing prices surfaced Friday when
Axciom/DataQuick, a market tracker based in La Jolla, a San Diego
suburb, reported that home values in California will pass their
pre-recession peak sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
   Axciom/DataQuick said this year's home-buying spree is pushing
up values by a collective $12 billion to $15 billion per month. The
company based its prediction on a computer appraisal of 7 million
residential units.
</P>
<P>
   Axciom's survey found that Los Angeles County was one of the
hardest hit by the housing market downturn, with prices falling
24.4 percent from their peak.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in Los Angeles County are still climbing back up and
should reach their pre-recession level probably in the middle of
next year if current trends stay in place, said John Karevoll, the
company's market analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is happening now is home value increases have
migrated from the upper tier of the market into the midsection, and
since there are so many homes and buyers there, it is adding value
at a much faster rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the growth in sales and prices came at a
much less frantic pace than what happened in the late 1980s, when
interest rates were in the 10 percent range and first-time buyers
were eventually priced out of the market until its collapse in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   New-home construction, though, was still occurring at a brisk
clip as the last decade wound down.
</P>
<P>
   The boom started in the early 1980s as California emerged from a
recession. In 1983, contractors built 172,569 new units, more than
double the number built in 1982, according to figures compiled by
the Construction Industry Research Board in Burbank, in L.A.'s San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It peaked at 314,569 units in 1986 but remained above the
200,000-unit level from 1983 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Housing construction started falling in 1990 and had dipped into
the mid-80,000 level by the middle of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Builders probably will construct 124,000 units this year, still
well below a level needed to meet the demand and keep affordability
in check, industry experts say. And while during the first eight
months of the year the number of residential permits issued jumped
11.5 percent from the same period in 1997, two of the state's more
robust metropolitan areas -- Orange County and San Jose -- saw a
decline in permits.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it's a disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are still just recession-level numbers we are talking
about here,'' said Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California
Department of Finance.``If we don't start building houses the
state's economy is not going to grow. It's a fairly universal
concern around the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The lackluster pace of construction comes at a time the state's
population is growing by about 800,000 residents a year, which
means there will be 50 million new residents in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is also puzzling given the fact that sales should reach
record levels this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Greg Brown, president of the Building Industry Association
of Southern California and owner of home builder Camashco Inc.,
said the length of the recession is one factor that held new
construction in check.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the economy is heating up, so is construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the builders were trying to peg where the market was
going to come back and have now thrown a lot of energy into getting
lots completed and entitlements through the bureaucratic process,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of where to put the housing.
</P>
<P>
   Urban areas, like those around the San Fernando Valley and
surrounding communities, don't have much vacant land left for
single-family housing. That means developers must go farther out
from population centers to areas like north Los Angeles County and
the Inland Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Tom K. Lieser, executive director of the UCLA Business
Forecasting Project at the college's Anderson School, said housing
is rapidly becoming a key component to the state's continued
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley have the least
affordable housing in the state and are already acting as a drag on
growth. Lieser noted that in Silicon Valley -- where the median
price for a single-family home is in the $340,000 range -- the job
growth rate has been nonexistent over the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that can be attributed to the international financial
crisis, but the lack of affordable housing is playing a part, too.
</P>
<P>
   And it might not be long before the entire state feels the
impact from the limited supply of new homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially that was related to the recession,'' he said of the
decline in new-home construction, ``but the recession is long over
and we're still not producing much more housing. Maybe five years
out there is going to be a reckoning.''

CHARTER PROPOSAL ASSAILED AS POWER GRAB BY L.A. CITY COUNCIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Billed as an innocent proposal to streamline city
government, Charter Amendment HH on the Nov. 3 ballot would give
the City Council broad power to strip the harbors, airports and
Department of Water and Power of their historic independence.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call the measure a power grab by the City Council that
could prove destructive to agencies that are fundamentally
businesses dealing with billions of dollars of public money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this some Machiavellian plot? No,'' said city Chief
Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton, the powerful council liaison who
wrote the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Deaton insists the measure is innocent and intended only to
facilitate the transfer of airport and harbor police forces to the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledges that if the measure passes, the council
with a two-thirds vote could transfer functions, powers or duties
out of or into the city proprietary departments or reorganize them
entirely. Currently, the council only has that power regarding
general fund departments.
</P>
<P>
   Critics -- including heads of the proprietary departments --
take a dim view of the council suddenly having that kind of power
over agencies that have extensive insulation from political
interference under the City Charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has to run a business like that would be concerned
because it integrates politics into a situation where you are in a
highly competitive industry,'' said Bill McCarley, the retired DWP
general manager and a longtime power at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible idea because we need professional
management,'' said Bill Powers of the United Chambers of Commerce
of the San Fernando Valley. He said he is concerned that broadening
the council's power over self-sufficient agencies would inject
politics into their operation.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Glickman, a member of the city's appointed Charter
Reform Commission, said the city's proprietary departments should
remain independent and continue as self-sufficient enterprises,
separate from the city's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very concerned about the ability to raid and
pillage,'' she said of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Added Xandra Kayden of the League of Women Voters: ``It's too
broadly written. It opens the door in ways that it should not be
opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the concerns are that giving such power to a political
body like the council could play havoc with the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Kayden warned that the council could raid proprietary
departments for their revenue generating functions to pad the
general fund.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the City Council could attempt to take the highly
profitable airport parking lots away from the airport department to
bolster a sagging general fund if Federal Aviation Administration
approval could be gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those functions go to support the airport system,''
Kayden said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure stems from the desire to put all police forces under
the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including Councilwoman Laura Chick and Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks, have said it would make easier efforts to the
transfer the airport and harbor police forces and carry out other
streamlining measures.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Driscoll, executive director of the city Airports
Department, said the measure has caused ``fairly large'' concern on
his part. He is reviewing the issue to determine whether to take an
opposing position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could possibly create a situation where they could cut up
the department,'' Driscoll said. ``It could create some problems.
We have to take a hard look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainties about the potential implications of Charter
Amendment HH have caused Mayor Richard Riordan to decide to stay
neutral on the ballot measure, said Kelly Martin, his chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Driscoll said the measure might cause worry in
financial markets that are heavily invested in the proprietary
departments. They said bond holders and rating agencies need to be
assured that passage of the measure will not jeopardize the
departments and their financial standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears as though it could create some issues with our
bondholders,'' Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure the concerns of the bond-rating agencies
are alleviated,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raiding the proprietary departments, Kayden
warned that the measure could allow the City Council to dump off
expensive functions into the proprietary agencies, so they are not
a burden on the general fund.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the City Council could transfer the costly
street-light program from the Public Works Department to the DWP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the city wouldn`t have to pay for it,'' Kayden said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, DWP General Manager David Freeman was concerned enough
about the potential implications to contact City Council members
for assurances, said Frank Salas, a spokesman for the DWP.
</P>
<P>
   Salas said Freeman was assured there would be no council raid on
his agency to take major functions away for the general fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, under the worst-case scenario, that could happen,
but council members have told Mr. Freeman that that is not their
intention,'' Salas said.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Deaton said he has assured Driscoll and Freeman that the ballot
measure is not part of a scheme to gut the proprietary departments.
But he acknowledged the possibility that major reorganizations
involving airports, harbor or DWP could become attractive -- and
feasible -- for the council to carry out.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the DWP's water system might do better if paired
with the city's sewer system under a new agency outside the DWP,
Deaton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be under a separate agency altogether,'' he said.
``Would wastewater and water go together better than water and
power?''
</P>
<P>
   He also said it might be more efficient to merge the Airport and
Harbor departments into one agency.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said state and federal law would make it difficult
for the council to simply raid proprietary agencies of their
revenue-producing functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't raid the harbor because it's under (state) public
trust doctrine,'' Deaton said. ``There are also federal laws
prohibiting that at the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   However, given the history of the city of trying to take money
from the airport department for the city general fund, Roger Cohen
of the Air Transport Association said his group is reviewing the
ballot measure closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at it,'' Cohen said. ``We are ever vigilant to
oppose attempts by any city to circumvent federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Close, president of the suburban Sherman Oaks Homeowners
Association, said he might support giving the council more power
over the budgets of proprietary departments, but he is suspicious
of how it is being done, just months before two commissions are
scheduled to propose whole new charters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems silly to have amendments made to the charter now when
it's going to be entirely replaced next year,'' Close said. ``It
raises concerns about why this is being done this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick, the primary backer of the measure, did not return calls
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kayden said there may not be any raid attempts by the current
mayor and City Council, who have been able to balance the budget
because of the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kayden said future councils could be tempted to raid
profit-making departments ``if we go into another recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayden said part of her concern was that there was no debate
about the measure by the City Council before it was rushed onto the
ballot, given that it affects proprietary departments that
represent half of city budget expenditures, or about $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody should have asked some questions about it,'' Kayden
said. ``It's not written just about police. The way it was written,
it opens up the possibility for the city to get into the budget and
functioning of the proprietary agencies.''

U.S. TO SEND BILLIONS TO SHIELD BRAZIL'S ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>

(lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is preparing to commit U.S.
taxpayer funds as part of a lending program of at least $30 billion
to try to insulate Brazil, and with it the rest of Latin America,
from the worst effects of the financial turmoil circling the globe,
according to U.S. and foreign officials assembling the program.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the U.S. contribution, which is expected to total
several billion dollars in direct aid or loan guarantees, have yet
to be negotiated. But several congressional leaders have been
alerted to the likelihood that the administration would have to act
while Congress is in recess.
</P>
<P>
   This early warning from the administration reflects memories of
how Congress erupted with objections and hearings in 1995 when
President Clinton committed $20 billion in U.S. funds to the
bailout of Mexico. But administration officials said last week that
their early soundings indicate that members of Congress are deeply
concerned about preventing an economic collapse in Latin America
that would resound in the United States, and thus they expect few
objections.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of an aid package for Brazil _ originally expected
within the next few days _ is complicated by unexpected delays that
have cropped up in dealing with the Brazilian government.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso faces
politically risky gubernatorial elections on Sunday, which may well
determine whether Brazil can execute an austerity program that is
the key condition for the loans it is concurrently negotiating with
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest role in the rescue program for Brazil will be taken
by the International Monetary Fund, which said last week that it
would contribute at least $15 billion _ and appears to be under
pressure from the United States to do even more. Another $9 billion
or so will come from the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank, and the remainder from the United States and
other major industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and Japan, though, have been reluctant to take part, one
U.S. official noted, suggesting that Latin America is chiefly
Washington's problem, not their own.
</P>
<P>
   So far, U.S. officials working behind the scenes to organize the
aid package have said nothing in public about the details of plans
for a direct contribution to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is very important to the economic well-being of the
region, the United States and the international community, and all
of us are very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful,''
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But in a wide-ranging interview about the global economic
turmoil, Rubin declined to say what strategy he would pursue in
dealing with Brazil's problems and insisted that no decisions had
been made about how the United States might contribute.
</P>
<P>
   But he discussed Brazil as an opportunity to engage in the kind
of preventive financial diplomacy that President Clinton advocated
in speeches to the IMF and the World Bank here three weeks ago. At
the time, Clinton argued that the monetary fund should ``provide
contingent finance to help countries ward off global financial
contagion'' rather than wait for disaster to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Direct U.S. aid to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message:
that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through
the monetary fund, the United States is now ready to put a limited
amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc _ not
only for Brazil but to stop chaos spreading to Argentina, Mexico
and other countries that are major U.S. trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a change of strategy. So far, the United States
has operated almost entirely through international financial
institutions, chiefly the IMF But it would also be a risky move for
President Clinton, economically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Congress objected to the $20 billion in U.S. funds
committed to the bailout of Mexico, it turned out that only $12
billion was ultimately needed, and it has since been paid back,
with interest. But Rubin noted on Friday that ``it's a very
different environment now.'' Other administration officials say
they believe that there would be few objections in Congress to
direct U.S. participation in a Brazil bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now
scared to death by what's been happening in the markets, and what
could happen in their own districts,'' a White House official said
last week, ``and they won't say much as long as they don't have to
vote on it.''
</P>
<P>
   By acting soon to stabilize Latin America, the administration is
hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the
late-summer panic that engulfed Russia and, at its height, led to
an outflow of a billion dollars a day from Brazil, for fear that it
would be the next country forced to devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this calm marks the beginning of a turnaround or just
another pause in the wildfires that have erupted since Thailand's
currency crisis in July 1997 is a matter of considerable debate.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts cite the confluence of several events that have
reassured jittery investors around the world: two successive
interest-rate cuts in the United States, Japan's long-delayed move
to prop up its banking system with $500 billion in taxpayer funds,
and a steady strengthening of currencies in Thailand, Indonesia and
South Korea, the first signs that investors may be preparing to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Always circumspect when it comes to commenting publicly on
markets, Rubin acknowledged that ``in the last several weeks there
have been a number of significant, positive developments.'' But the
former trader, burned during a 26-year career by many false market
rallies, warned that ``serious issues remain'' and that ``it will
take some time for the world to work its way out'' of what he has
repeatedly called ``the most serious international financial
disruption of the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rubin's aides are clearly nervous about the possibility
of another outbreak that could set off a new round of panic, which
has made it virtually impossible for many emerging-market countries
to borrow money on world markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil and Japan are the two obvious tinderboxes,'' said
Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, who served
as undersecretary of commerce for international affairs during
Clinton's first term. ``In Brazil, the issue is whether the package
that is coming together will really be big enough to deal with an
exploding debt problem. And in Japan the question is whether there
is real reform that goes along with the money.''
</P>
<P>
   But after spending 18 months in negotiations with the Japanese,
Rubin clearly senses that the United States has little leverage in
Tokyo; its problems are chiefly rooted in political gridlock, not
lack of resources.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, though, the United States has a better chance of
buying time and influencing an economic reform program, as long as
it does not appear to be dictating terms publicly to Cardoso and
his team.

</P>
<P>
   But demonstrating economic support will probably require tapping
the Exchange Stabilization Fund, created during the Roosevelt
administration to help stabilize the dollar. The money is under
Rubin's control, with presidential approval, and he reached into it
to circumvent congressional objections to aiding Mexico in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction was so strong _ for a time Congress restricted
tapping the fund for international bailouts _ that Rubin has been
extraordinarily cautious ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He committed $3 billion in a ``second line of defense'' in
emergency aid programs for Indonesia and South Korea last year, but
no money was ultimately dispersed to either country. U.S. officials
said that South Korea did not need the extra help, and that the
collapse of the Suharto government in Indonesia so changed the
political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct
U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   In the bailout of Russia _ whose economy collapsed after
President Boris Yeltsin abandoned an agreement to reform the
economy and dismissed the leading reformers _ the United States
offered no direct help. Those events set off a panicked exit by
investors from all emerging markets, and greatly worsened Brazil's
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Brazilian officials have successfully calmed the market
by constantly talking about a forthcoming aid program from the IMF,
convincing speculators that it would be dangerous to bet against
the country. But at the same time, the Brazilian officials have
maintained the pose that they do not really need the cash _ and are
certainly in no hurry to get it.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials and top officials of the IMF are clearly nervous,
worried that the longer the negotiations drag on, the greater will
be the risk of Brazil being caught in another round of market
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brazilians want everyone to think that it's all under
control,'' said an investment banker involved in the talks. ``But
the fact is that there's still a real risk that sometime in the
next 18 months the government is going to be forced to devalue''
its currency, which is pegged to the dollar, but adjusts about 7.5
percent a year in a carefully controlled fall.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a sudden devaluation, the Brazilian government has
had to raise interest rates to more than 50 percent, choking off
credit for most companies. Meanwhile, the country is slipping into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The aid would buy time for the Brazilians, but it is contingent
on Cardoso's success in persuading the legislature to end huge
deficits, chiefly through unpopular cuts in social spending.
</P>
<P>
   The first deputy managing director for the International
Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review
the country's austerity plan, which is expected to be announced
after Sunday's elections but before the international package, to
avoid the appearance that the global lender is dictating conditions
to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil has to do a lot,'' Fischer said last week before
leaving on his trip. ``In return, I expect the international
community will make a large contribution.''

<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Yasser Arafat has a tough crowd to please.
</P>
<P>
   After the interim peace accord was signed in Oslo in 1993, they
took to the bustling streets here with olive branches, wrapping
themselves in Palestinian flags, cheering and honking in what they
believed would be a new era for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, barely 12 hours after Arafat signed an
agreement that promises the Palestinians what amounts to 40 percent
of the West Bank, there were no parties here, no outbursts of
pride, no euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   It was just traffic as usual in this busy, cosmopolitan town,
daily commerce interrupted by heated conversations about hopes
raised and hopes dashed. Few wanted to admit what many said they
did feel _ a leap in the heart, a flash of faith _ because they did
not want to end up dupes of a peace effort they no longer trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we can't believe,'' said Fatmeh Jwailes, a mother of 10,
as she shopped for wall-to-wall carpeting, wearing traditional
Islamic dress. ``Until I see with my own eyes that their promises
are worth the ink they're written in, I don't want to get my hopes
up.''
</P>
<P>
   If carried out, the agreement could transform the nature of the
Palestinian entity, making it larger and more autonomous. It would
grant the Palestinians complete control over a sizable chunk of
territory, much of it contiguous, and create safe-passage corridors
between the West Bank and Gaza, linking the two axes of the
Palestinian world here. It would create a Palestinian airport and
an industrial zone in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   But to Palestinians, from the elite strata of the intellectual
class to the angry ranks of the refugee camps, the ``if'' is a big
one, and implementation is the key. The agreement signed at the
White House on Friday is mostly a reiteration of actions already
promised, in the 1993 and 1995 accords in Oslo, and never
undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   This agreement sets a precise timetable for Israeli troop
withdrawal in exchange for specific Palestinian steps to eradicate
terrorism. And, unlike the Oslo agreements, it is a trilateral one,
with the Americans playing guarantor, policeman and financier,
using promises of financial aid to both sides. These are
distinctions, and they might make a huge difference, Palestinians
say _ or they could crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was like pulling teeth, so you hesitate to
have confidence that there will be follow-up,'' said Hanan Ashrawi,
a prominent Palestinian academic and member of the legislative
council. ``Only the absolutely naive would be carried away with the
spectacle of the signing.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt cautiously welcomed the accord, echoing on a state level
what the Palestinians were saying on the street: not only that
implementation is all, but that there are thorny issues yet to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   As Foreign Minister Amr Moussa put it: ``The accord is one step
on the right path toward restoring Palestinian land and negotiating
fundamental issues, topped by Jerusalem and the Palestinian right
to self-determination. The road is still long for a comprehensive
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In a village outside Ramallah, Raafat Hamdan, 17, who works as a
day laborer in Israel, watched the White House ceremony on
satellite television with his extended family. They sipped sweet,
hot tea and munched on green grapes, speechless until the papers
were actually signed. Then, he said, there were some sniffles, and
he himself became choked up to think that the whole world was
watching what he believed was Palestinian history being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am young so I like to have hope,'' he said. ``Maybe with
everyone watching them like hawks, the Israelis will behave. I
think that if there are no suicide bomb attacks, they will, because
they must be tired of the whole fight, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After the signing of the Oslo accords in 1993, the Palestinians,
particularly those in the Gaza Strip, experienced hardships they
had not anticipated when they were dancing in the streets. Owing to
a series of terrorist attacks, the Israelis imposed frequent border
closings, denied many work permits and tightened security at
checkpoints. Many Palestinians felt the lands they had been granted
_ mostly the big cities _ were bubbles that they were trapped in.
Frustration grew and settled in their bones, and it is not easy to
dislodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about the larger peace,'' said Moussa Zubedi, 27, who
is unemployed. ``Palestine is my homeland, and I want the right to
go from one place to another without restrictions. So let them do
just that, the safe-passage thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At a busy intersection, a crowd gathered to debate, as vendors
poured shots of Turkish coffee.
</P>
<P>
   An older man, Khalil Abi Hawa, chastised the younger ones for
not having vision. ``This is a step toward getting freedom and then
independence,'' he said. ``Even the details are astonishing; maybe
you are too young to realize. Now we will get an airport, a
Palestinian airport!''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We will have borders, then a state. You guys must
keep your eye on the prize.''
</P>
<P>
   A taxi driver rolled his eyes at this. ``Where is freedom if you
can't go to pray in Jerusalem?'' he asked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The young men criticized Arafat for making concessions. They
said he should have demanded that more Palestinian prisoners be
released, and that he should have refused to convene the
Palestinian legislature to amend the covenant that calls for
Israel's destruction _ an amendment that Arafat has long claimed
was already made. And some wondered if the promised crackdown on
terrorism would give the Palestinian Authority license to crack
down on dissent.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza, during the signing, the Palestinian Authority detained
11 journalists who had come to watch the ceremony with Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of the fundamentalist Islamic Hamas
movement. They were moved from his home, the authorities said,
because Sheik Yassin's negative comments on the peace effort are
``against the Palestinian Authority policy.''
</P>
<P>
   When the older man pointed out that President Clinton had
promised to visit the Palestinian legislature, recognizing the
institution in what could be perceived as a diplomatic act, the
young men were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming on Israel's behalf, to make sure they change the
covenant,'' Jalal Hassam, 30, a maintenance worker, said. ``And
he's coming for himself, to distract attention from his problems
with the Monica woman. We are the carpet that everyone treads on
their way to somewhere else. Israel wants to use us to get trade
with other Arab countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and Israeli political experts noted that Arafat
emerged from the nine days at the Wye Plantation in Maryland with
what looked like a closer relationship with the Americans. As the
Israeli party packed bags, threatened walkouts and delayed the
final signing ceremony, he took on the air of a dignified elder
statesman, even an insider, which is striking for the head of an
organization still labeled terrorist by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, the Palestinians noticed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look like a revolutionary anymore, despite the
clothes,'' said Bilal Abedrobu, who is unemployed. ``He looks like
one of them. It makes you think that this is a peace between
individuals and not between peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing underneath the dresses that hung outside his clothing
store, Ahmad Alfar watched the heated debate with a half-smile and
sad eyes. ``Why not be proud when you see the opportunity to get
more land, to have our prisoners freed?'' he asked. ``We have been
living in darkness, and this is a light that brings us back hope.''

<P>
   Not so many years ago, it would have been impossible to find
Genaro Arriagada on the side of Chile's former military dictator,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   As a prominent academic in the years after Pinochet took power
in 1973, Arriagada churned out critical studies of the military and
its rule. When Pinochet finally agreed to submit his regime to a
popular vote in 1988, Arriagada organized the coalition that
campaigned successfully for his defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But as street demonstrations in Chile began to turn violent late
last week, following the 82-year-old general's arrest in London on
Oct. 16 on human rights charges filed by a Spanish judge, Arriagada
argued bitterly against the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   And though he had just taken over as Chile's new ambassador to
Washington, his reasons, it seemed, have more to do with his own
views than with his government's arguments that Pinochet should be
protected by diplomatic immunity or released on humanitarian
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the achievement of our transition back to democracy
has been to take all of the demons of this history and put them
into some kind of closet,'' Arriagada said in an interview. ``This
case brings them all back out again. What right does some Spanish
judge have to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Pinochet's arrest, a parade of law professors
was pointing out that a strong basis for his prosecution has been
established over the past decade in international law. The threat
of what are often called universal crimes, so grotesquely
demonstrated in Africa and the Balkans, has prompted many states,
especially in Western Europe, to codify in their national laws the
jurisdiction that international conventions have offered since the
aftermath of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Arriagada and others maintain that unlike the recent
prosecutions of accused war criminals from Bosnia and Rwanda, the
success of human-rights lawyers targeting Pinochet will almost
certainly come at the expense of the uneasy political compromise by
which Chile achieved a measure of reconciliation and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that argument, moreover, lie serious practical
difficulties in mounting a legally compelling case against figures
like Pinochet _ particularly at a distance of several thousand
miles.
</P>
<P>
   When the investigating judge, Baltasar Garzon, prevailed on
Scotland Yard to arrest the general on charges of murder, genocide
and terrorism relating both to 94 Spanish citizens and others among
the more than 3,000 people believed to have been killed during
Pinochet's reign, he overcame only the first obstacle to
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Garzon must persuade Spain's right-of-center government to
formalize his request for the general's extradition. Then he must
convince British Home Secretary Jack Straw to grant the
extradition. Then Garzon will almost certainly need some help from
the government of Chile to build a successful criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be seeing an increasing readiness by governments to
enforce these international human-rights laws,'' said Theodor
Meron, a professor of international law at New York University.
``But when you open up the code book and try to prosecute, you find
that you have to deal with a lot of bread-and-butter criminal
statutes to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, judges and activists seeking justice for
human-rights crimes are not the only ones running into such
challenges. Since the end of the Cold War, countries like France,
Britain and the United States have tried to extend the reach of
their laws across borders to combat crimes like terrorism and drug
trafficking. Although these efforts have had a more solid legal
foundation than the human-rights cases, they have run constantly
into questions of sovereignty and jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Switzerland were reminded of such difficulties last
week when they announced the seizure of $114 million that was
hidden in European banks by Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder
brother of Mexico's former President.
</P>
<P>
   To some U.S. law-enforcement officials, the Swiss detectives had
done heroic work: They had started out with virtually no experience
in Mexico's narcotics underworld, and faced considerable resistance
from some officials in Mexico and the United States. Still, they
managed to use a legal-assistance treaty to pry open U.S. jails.
There they found informants who, in several cases, had apparently
been ignored or mishandled by U.S. prosecutors, and who said they
had witnessed Salinas taking huge bribes from drug traffickers to
arrange for the protection of their loads.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many Mexican officials viewed the conclusions
of the Swiss investigation differently. They acknowledged that
Swiss detectives might have developed enough evidence to keep the
money; if Salinas' lawyers challenge the seizure in court, as they
have promised to do, the Swiss government will only have to argue a
civil rather rather than a criminal case _ one with a considerably
lower standard of proof than what would be required to convict
Pinochet. Nonetheless, the Swiss investigators were hit immediately
by a barrage of procedural and jurisdictional questions from
Mexican officials.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. Customs agents learned last May when they set off a
diplomatic confrontation by disclosing that they operated under
cover in Mexico to trap bankers accused of laundering drug money,
it is hard to overestimate how quickly concerns about sovereignty
can outweigh those of criminal justice when one country sees
another acting unilaterally on its soil or in its affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Chilean nationalists, former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher offered such an argument on Pinochet's behalf
last week. ``The people of Chile, through successively elected
democratic governments, have determined how they should come to
terms with their past,'' she wrote to The Times of London. ``An
essential part of that process has been the settlement of the
status of General Pinochet and it is not for Spain, Britain or any
other country to interfere in what is an internal matter for
Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   At nearly a decade's remove, the deal that centrist politicians
like Arriagada reluctantly cut with Pinochet strikes many Chileans
as too generous, even accounting for the relative prosperity and
political stability that the country has enjoyed since. Others,
including some of the general's critics, argue that however
unsatisfying Chile's solution might have been, the strength of its
example can be seen in similar accommodations with military rulers
and repressive regimes from Central America to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these transitions to democracy were just about trials, we
could leave them to the judges,'' Arriagada said. ``But these
transitions are about achieving a great number of goals, including
political goals, economic goals _ and also human rights goals.''

lower standard of proof than what would be required to convict
Pinochet. Nonetheless, the Swiss investigators were hit immediately
by a barrage of procedural and jurisdictional questions from
Mexican officials.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. Customs agents learned last May when they set off a
diplomatic confrontation by disclosing that they operated under
cover in Mexico to trap bankers accused of laundering drug money,
it is hard to overestimate how quickly concerns about sovereignty
can outweigh those of criminal justice when one country sees
another acting unilaterally on its soil or in its affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Chilean nationalists, former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher offered such an argument on Pinochet's behalf
last week. ``The people of Chile, through successively elected
democratic governments, have determined how they should come to
terms with their past,'' she wrote to The Times of London. ``An
essential part of that process has been the settlement of the
status of General Pinochet and it is not for Spain, Britain or any
other country to interfere in what is an internal matter for
Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   At nearly a decade's remove, the deal that centrist politicians
like Arriagada reluctantly cut with Pinochet strikes many Chileans
as too generous, even accounting for the relative prosperity and
political stability that the country has enjoyed since. Others,
including some of the general's critics, argue that however
unsatisfying Chile's solution might have been, the strength of its
example can be seen in similar accommodations with military rulers
and repressive regimes from Central America to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these transitions to democracy were just about trials, we
could leave them to the judges,'' Arriagada said. ``But these
transitions are about achieving a great number of goals, including
political goals, economic goals _ and also human rights goals.''

   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to a
special three-part series on the changing nature of adoption in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The stories will move in two forms: full length as published in
The New York Times, and abridged (less than half the length of the
original version). The first part moved Friday and was repeated
Saturday morning. The other parts will move Sunday and Monday. All
stories will move in the ``a'' news file and are for publication
beginning Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and thereafter.

   The budget follows:
</P>
<P>
   ADOPTION-CHANGES _ In the last decade, as Americans have become
more candid about their private lives, adoption has gone public.
Open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is
becoming increasingly common _ before birth and after _ and the
fact of adoption is shared with the child, relatives and even
strangers. In some urban centers, such as New York City, San
Francisco and Boston, playgrounds are peppered with parents of
various races and nationalities chasing adopted children of other
races. Many of those families are headed by single people, older
and gay people _ men and women who, in years past, would have been
rejected by agencies and lawyers as unsuitable parents. By Esther
B. Fein. (Approximate length: 5,700 words.)
</P>
<P>
   ADOPTION-ECONOMICS _ Adoption in America is governed by an
economic equation of supply and demand, with unhappily infertile
couples competing for a smaller and smaller supply of white
American-born infants. It is an imbalance that professionals in the
adoption world are calling a crisis, allowing money to determine
who will succeed in a desperate quest for that which cannot be
legally bought or sold. To find their babies, adoptive parents will
pay on average $15,000 to $20,000, even if they have to mortgage
their futures; a few, who have the money for intermediaries to do
the work, pay up to $100,000. The scarcity has created a cast of
thousands of such intermediaries, leaving only the thinnest line
between buying a child and buying adoption services that lead to a
child. By Laura Mansnerus. (Approximate length: 5,000 words.)
</P>
<P>
   With:
</P>
<P>
   ADOPTION-MATCHING _ In New Jersey, officials are taking an
aggressive approach to finding adoptive homes for the 100 or so
children in foster care who have no immediate prospects. With a
$600,000 budget, the state advertises and promotes, has an adoption
web site, and sponsors ``match events'' _ special parties where
prospective parents and children can get acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   ADOPTION-RACE _ As cross-racial adoption has become more
accepted, families like the Goldens of North Olmstead, Ohio, with
four children _ one white, one black and two Hispanic _ have begun
to melt some of the boundaries that define racial territory. But
because the adoption process spotlights a family's deepest feelings
about race and culture, it has created a marketplace in which white
children usually cost more than blacks, and children from Asian
orphanages are more highly valued than those in American foster
care. Many groups and activities have been established to reinforce
the heritage of children adopted by parents of other races; still,
family adjustment can be difficult, and some blacks continue to
oppose the adoption of black children by white families as a form
of betrayal. By Tamar Lewin. (Approximate length: 5,000 words.)
</P>
<P>
   With:
</P>
<P>
   ADOPTION-DEBATE _ Kirsten Albrecht and Alexis Oberdorfer are
both 27-year-olds born of one black parent and one white parent,
and adopted, as infants, by white parents. But in their strongly
opposing views, they almost embody the whole debate over
transracial adoption.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Yvette Weilacker sits in the kitchen of a small house in Buffalo
waiting for the contractions to begin. Her baby, already named
Nicholas Lee by his anxious parents, was due days ago, and he shows
scant signs of being ready to be born.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting is all the more tense because the kitchen she waits
in is not hers, and the baby she waits for is in another woman's
body. Kim Elniskey and her fiance, Jorge Rosario, have chosen Mrs.
Weilacker and husband, Paul, to adopt their son and the two
families have gotten to know each other well these past few months,
by telephone, letter and now in person as the birth nears.
</P>
<P>
   Since she flew in from her home in Riverside, Calif., four weeks
earlier, Mrs. Weilacker has been staying with Ms. Elniskey and
Rosario and helping care for their three other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to feel that this is your baby, your family,'' Ms.
Elniskey told Mrs. Weilacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey has kept the Weilackers involved throughout her
pregnancy, sharing ultrasound pictures and updates about the baby's
intra-uterine acrobatics. ``Your son kicked me a lot today,'' Ms.
Elniskey reported in one of many telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers have promised that they will be just as open as
Nicholas grows: what he wears on his first Halloween, when he loses
his first tooth and learns to read. When the boy is ready, Ms.
Elniskey and Rosario plan to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   The intimacy between these two families would have been rare
just a few years ago and unthinkable a generation ago. But such
open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is one
of the many ways that adoption has evolved from a secretive, closed
process weighed down by dark stigmas and painful misconceptions
into an infinitely more transparent experience.
</P>
<P>
   How many children are adopted each year is an elusive number,
since no one keeps complete statistics. The most recent data, from
1992, show 127,441 children adopted that year, a slight increase
from 118,000 five years earlier. About 42 percent of those
adoptions were by stepparents and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The most sought-after children for adoption are, as they have
been for generations, domestic white infants _ known among parents
and professionals in the adoption loop as DWI's _ but those babies
are scarcer because of the easier availability of birth control,
the legalization of abortion and the growing acceptance of single
mothers raising children alone. Experts estimate that there are
fewer than 20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the biggest increase in adoptions has been children
adopted from other countries. Because they require visas, there are
up-to-date statistics for these adoptions and since 1990, their
numbers have nearly doubled, to 13,620 in 1997 from 7,093. So while
the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been
subtle, the increase in visibility has been dramatic, enhanced by
those children adopted from other countries whose physical
differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, adoption has gone public in much the same
manner that divorce did in the 1970s. Increasingly children are
told, even before they can fully understand, how they came to their
families and that story is shared with relatives, friends,
teachers, sometimes even strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birth mother gave me this doll,'' Sasha Saidman, a
6-year-old who was adopted, told a clerk at the video store near
her home in Wheaton, Md., as her family prepared for a visit from
the woman who had borne her. Like most adopted children, Sasha used
the term that has replaced such loaded phrases as ``real mother''
and ``natural mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once children hid their adoption from friends, if they
even knew of it, adopted children today can belong to play groups
made up entirely of adopted children. They can buy storybooks about
being adopted, go to summer camps for children adopted from
particular foreign countries, and if they face emotional
difficulties, get treated by a therapist who specializes in
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, like New York, San Francisco and Boston,
playgrounds are peppered with parents of various races and
nationalities chasing children of other races. Many of those
families are headed by single people, people in their '40s or older
and gay people, men and women who, in years past, would have been
rejected as unsuitable adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ``other'' option for becoming parents, adoption is now
one of many ways that men and women create families. The panorama
of the American family now includes children born through advanced
reproductive technology, some conceived with donated sperm and
eggs; families broken apart by divorce then blended through
remarriage; families created by single parents and by gay men who
have hired a surrogate to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing an explosion of different family forms which
make adoption seem downright mainstream and conservative,'' said
Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson
Adoption Institute, a research group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the media have focused on global dramas
highlighting the plight of children needing homes: Chinese girls
abandoned in markets by parents encumbered by the country's
one-child policy and its preference for boys; Romanian children
orphaned by revolution or left in understaffed institutions by
their impoverished parents; Russian children stranded in dismal
state orphanages, in a society that widely stigmatizes adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, it became a kind of social phenomenon to adopt a
child from abroad. Last summer, Vanity Fair magazine quipped that a
Chinese baby was the season's hot accessory in the Hamptons. The
experience, however, is not limited to wealthy neighborhoods.
Suburban American and rural towns are also home to children adopted
from Shanghai, Murmansk, Guatemala City, Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed
adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting
families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted
out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call
the ``Ovarian Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Further raising the profile are the celebrities who have spoken
happily about being adoptive parents, including: Nicole Kidman and
her husband, Tom Cruise; Rosie O'Donnell, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who
wrote a popular children's book on the subject, ``Tell Me Again
About the Night I Was Born.''
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores, that book shares shelf space with an expanding
selection of adoption-related titles from large publishers and from
niche publishers like R-Squared Press in Ann Arbor, Mich., a small
family-run business that focuses on adoption.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Tacoma, Wash., Gloria Finkbeiner, an adoptive sister, aunt
and grandmother, started a mail-order card and gift business called
Adoption Option with her daughter, Susan Pierce, who adopted three
children out of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are, adoption isn't unique,'' said Mrs. Finkbeiner.
``It's just a way to be a family.''

<P>
   &UR; Rules on Privacy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Led to Secrecy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most profound change in the process of adoption is
the growth of the kind of open adoption that brought Nicholas to
his parents, the Weilackers.
</P>
<P>
   Before World War I, it was common for friends and relatives to
raise the child of someone they knew and for the biological parents
to be in touch with their children. But as the century progressed,
adoptive parents were paired with babies, mainly by doctors,
lawyers and social workers, most of whom sought a match of physical
traits that would allow parents and children to pass as a ``real
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The institutionalization, and the secrecy and the stigma, of
adoption were deepened after World War II by state laws requiring
that records to the event be sealed and new birth certificates
issued, listing the adoptive parents in place of the biological
ones. E. Wayne Carp, a professor at Pacific Lutheran University,
writes in his book ``Family Matters: Secrecy and Disclosure in the
History of Adoption,'' that initially, such confidentiality was
intended to protect those involved in an adoption from outside
scrutiny, but it later evolved into a way to keep all parties to an
adoption from one another.
</P>
<P>
   That change dovetailed with a postwar emphasis on the nuclear
family. In the 1950s, motherhood was glorified. For those unable to
conceive on their own, adoption was a blessing, one often kept
secret to mimic the wished-for idyll.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, social workers seized on a postwar embrace of
psychoanalytic theories _ which tended to view unmarried mothers as
disturbed, adoptees seeking information about their roots as
neurotic, and infertile people as unstable _ as a rationale for
keeping adoptive families and biological families apart.
</P>
<P>
   In that atmosphere, nobody imagined that adopting parents would
ever live with the expectant family in the final days of the
pregnancy, waiting for the contractions that would signal the
beginning of their new families.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are going through together blows me away,'' Mrs.
Weilacker said, soon after she arrived in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   But as the wait dragged on, drawn out by a doctor's inaccurate
calculating of Ms. Elniskey's due date, both women grew tense.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weilacker, a court stenographer, was also anxious about
transcripts she needed to finish. Reluctantly, she returned to
California until the birth seemed more imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel a little lonely,'' Ms. Elniskey said. ``I thought
we'd stick this out together and now Yvette gets to get away for a
while and I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in California, there seemed no relief. ``It's all I think
about,'' Mrs. Weilacker said. ``I love Kim and Jorge and their
kids. It was just all getting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A New Approach: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Easing the Curiosity &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And Guilt in Adoption &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how many people build families
through open adoption, no way to know how many birth parents select
the people they want to rear their child, get to know them and then
stay in some sort of contact _ from regular visits to occasional
phone calls or letters _ after the baby is legally and emotionally
the other family's child. But people in the field say the trend of
open adoption is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Human Services in Traverse City, Mich., a rural area in
the northern part of the state, was one of the first agencies to
arrange open adoptions. Since 1980, the agency has handled close to
500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotype from 20 years ago was that birth parents were
wild and reckless people from the other side of the tracks,'' said
Jim Gritter, a child welfare supervisor at the agency. ``But what
we found was that that viewpoint was 180 degrees from reality. So
many birth mothers talked about feeling that they were abandoning
their babies because the closed system basically asked of them to
abandon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Social workers at the agency decided that the only way to soothe
birth parents' guilt was to let them choose families for their
children. The social workers were motivated in part by stories they
had heard of adoptees searching for their birth parents. If
children yearned to know about their roots, and birth parents
longed to know who became the parents of their children, the agency
social workers figured that it made sense to make adoption a
collaborative experience.
</P>
<P>
   It was a logical time to try to coax adoption out of the
shadows. By the late 1970s, with the rise of the sexual revolution
and the women's rights movement, many in society were rejecting a
range of paternalistic institutions. Although in many places a
child born to unwed parents would still face scorn, in many places
he would not.
</P>
<P>
   The Traverse City social workers devised a plan in which they
asked prospective adoptive parents to put together a letter about
themselves with a picture and other information to be shown to
pregnant women, who would choose among them.
</P>
<P>
   Gritter and his colleagues have since taken the concept one step
further. In nearly all cases, the children handled by their agency
are born of parents in the region and adopted by parents in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same to be pen pals as it is to be part of a
clan,'' Gritter said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that open adoption is always a good option,
particularly workers at agencies whose birth mothers come from
cultures that still regard out-of-wedlock births with shame. In
addition, many parents who have adopted internationally say that
one reason they chose that route was to avoid being involved with a
birth family.
</P>
<P>
   Because the practice is still so new, researchers are only now
studying how these open relationships are working: Will a child be
hurt if a birth parent starts out involved but then withdraws? How
will a child feel if the woman who bore him has another child but
decides she can raise this one? And what if there is a falling out
between the birth parents and the adoptive parents?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people pressured into openness that
might not be in their best interest,'' said Beth Parsons, executive
director of El Paso Adoption Services. The agency places about 25
children a year, roughly 70 percent of them children of Hispanic
mothers, many of whom conceal their pregnancies from relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to birth mothers about what their options are, but
many do not feel emotionally ready for an open adoption,'' Ms.
Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the pregnant women choose parents themselves
from among the agency's files, most people who adopt through the El
Paso agency do not learn that they have a child until
relinquishment papers are signed, which cannot be done in Texas
until at least 48 hours after the birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the mothers to make their decisions without the
pressure of an adoptive family waiting outside the delivery room
door,'' Ms. Parsons said. She said she also wanted to protect
adopting parents from becoming attached to a woman and her unborn
baby in case the mother changes her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Parsons said, the move toward openness is positive
and she urges all birth mothers to give photographs, letters or
some memento to their child, a change from when the agency first
opened in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the open adoption process has helped to
transform the experience of adoption even for those with more
traditional arrangements. Today, the majority of people who adopt
know something about their children's backgrounds. Even if they do
not stay in regular contact, they frequently have detailed medical
histories, photographs of biological relatives, and letters and
gifts for the children from the women who bore them.
</P>
<P>
   This information, experts say, can help children to understand
better the decisions leading to their adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most frustrating things for me growing up was not
knowing my background,'' said David Wilson, a 31-year-old
telecommunications consultant who several years ago found and met
his birth parents. ``I'm cautious about saying that having an open,
ongoing relationship with them when I was growing up would have
been good. That could create conflict or blur lines. But just
knowing who they were and why they made their choices would have
taken away an unnecessary mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest shifts in adoption in recent years is this
emergence of birth mothers from the shroud of shame and dependence
that kept them from having any role in shaping their children's
futures. In fact, most parents who adopt domestically today _
whether in totally open adoptions or more closed ones _ engage in a
kind of courtship of birth mothers, preparing often elaborate
albums and letters aimed at persuading pregnant women to entrust
their unborn children to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see things through the eyes of this child,'' the
Weilackers wrote in their ``Dear Birth Mother'' letter.
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers, who are both 39 and had endured several years of
unsuccessful infertility treatments, placed their letter in the
files of the Independent Adoption Center in Pleasant Hill, Calif.
It was forwarded, among dozens of others, to Ms. Elniskey,
prompting her to call the Weilackers on a toll-free line they had
set up in the hopes of receiving just such a call.
</P>
<P>
   Before she called the center, Ms. Elniskey said that she did not
even know such an arrangement was possible. The world of adoption,
she said, was vastly different than it was eight years ago, when
she was 18, in high school and pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't ready to be a mother; I couldn't do it,'' Ms.
Elniskey, a 26-year-old homemaker, said of her first pregnancy.
``After I gave birth, my sister Judy took the baby home and cared
for her. I named her Alyssa. My obstetrician found the couple. She
was a patient of his. I wanted to know about them, who they were
and all. But I didn't know I could ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience, she said, left her heartbroken. Even now she
will scan a crowd, looking at girls around Alyssa's age, wondering,
``Is that my hair? My nose? Could this be her?''
</P>
<P>
   When she found herself last winter with three small children and
pregnant again, despite having had an injection of Depo-Provera
that was supposed to prevent pregnancy for several months, Ms.
Elniskey said she panicked. She and Rosario, who is 30 years old
and works in a factory making roll-up doors for trucks, agreed that
they could not cope with another child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey said she knew she could never go blindly into
another adoption. But she never imagined the power she had to
influence her baby's future and to remain a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to have his own life with them,'' Ms. Elniskey
said. ``I don't want to be in their way. But I want to know what's
going on. When he's old enough, he can come to me and ask what he
wants. But I want him to never have to wonder why I made this plan
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He never will,'' Mrs. Weilacker assured.

<P>
   Despite these radically changed attitudes toward adoption,
parents and adoption professionals said that Nicholas can expect to
be asked by his friends and others why his ``real'' mother ``gave
him away.'' Even in the most cosmopolitan and adoption-saturated
cities, like New York, people still say callous things to adoptive
families.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a girl adopted from Korea said that the first week
she strolled with her daughter in Central Park, strangers
approached her and said: ``Oh, she'll be great at math!''
``Couldn't you have one of your own?'' ``Does she speak Chinese?''
</P>
<P>
   Ronny Diamond, director of post-adoption services at the
Spence-Chapin adoption agency in Manhattan, said that attitudes
toward adoption were similar in some ways to racial prejudice. ``If
you ask people if they are prejudiced, they would say, `No,''' Ms.
Diamond said. ``But if you put forth a scenario, the bias emerges.
For example, a teacher gets a class list and sees that three boys
are adopted. Often, they'll say, `This is trouble. This will be a
tough year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spence-Chapin offers advice to help teachers and administrators
focus on how they talk about adoption, the language they use and
the assignments they make.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent workshop, teachers were surprised at how clumsy they
had been in dealing with the issue and how easy it was to readjust.
Administrators at the school agreed to have a reporter present on
condition that the school not be identified.

<P>
   Ms. Diamond began by handing out a glossary showing the common
ways people talk about adoption and the more positive alternatives.
For example, instead of saying that a birth parent ``gave a child
away,'' it is better to say she ``made an adoption plan,''
reflecting the thought that goes into such a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important shifts in language is to say that a
child ``was'' adopted, rather than ``is'' adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being adopted is an action that happens once and then you are
someone's child,'' Ms. Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   She also cautioned teachers against trying to comfort adopted
children by telling them that they were ``chosen.'' ``Think about
it,'' Ms. Diamond suggested. ``What is the opposite of chosen?
Rejected. To be chosen, a child might think he had to have been
rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she went on, most adopted children are not chosen.
Implying that they are makes it seem like their parents walked down
a row of children in a pediatric supermarket and selected the
choicest offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adoption is not better,'' Ms. Diamond told the teachers.
``It's just not worse.''

   Diana Galligan, nearly 7, knows what adoption means. ``It's when
people who love you take care of you and become your parents,'' she
says, quietly poised.
</P>
<P>
   And she will tell you that in her case, those people who love
her and take care of her are her ``guys,'' her dad, John Galligan,
and her pop, Richard Koonce.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuckahoe Elementary School in Arlington, Va., Diana is one of
many adopted children, although her fathers think she is the only
one there who is being raised by openly gay parents. And even
though Galligan and Koonce are far more concerned with helping
their daughter learn to read and to express herself freely, they
are acutely aware that families like theirs are a symbol of ``the
new American family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In previous generations, one of the most difficult notions for
many gay men coming out was putting aside the idea of having a
family,'' said Galligan, 39, who works for the U.S. Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Galligan said that he knew he wanted to be a father ever since
he worked as a college volunteer in a Big Brother program. Several
years ago, Galligan, said, although he had no partner at the time,
he decided that ``the time was right; I wanted to be a father.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to figure out how to go about adopting, when a
woman he knew with two older children told him that she was
pregnant and was willing to have him adopt the baby. Their
arrangement is open, and Diana visits her birth mother every summer
and calls her when she feels like it.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have sensed disapproval and worse from strangers,
Galligan and Koonce said they have never faced prejudice from
neighbors or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But both men lamented that many religious and political
institutions were still hostile. Although Galligan adopted Diana,
Koonce is legally only Diana's guardian in case something happens
to Galligan. He has yet to formally adopt her, they said, because
Virginia courts would not allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Many states let single people adopt without their sexual
orientation being an issue. Some states allow one gay person to
adopt, then later and separately the other partner. But about half
the states do not allow a second parent of the same sex to adopt a
child, even at a later time. And in Florida and New Hampshire, it
is nearly impossible for homosexuals to adopt at all.
</P>
<P>
   Koonce and Galligan said that they thought such resistance to
adoptions by gay people would eventually wither.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is on the edge of creating a lot of new models for
work, family and community,'' said Koonce, 44, who owns his own
career counseling business. ``I look at myself. I have a
nontraditional model of work that's a far cry from what my father
did, working for the big company. I have what many people would
consider a nontraditional family, although we see ourselves as very
conservative and mainstream. I walk Diana to school; John picks her
up. On Teacher Appreciation Day, there I was with all the moms,
bringing a tossed salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when Kathryn Creedy is stitching badges on a Brownie
sash or searching under a couch for a magic marker cap, she pauses
and reminds herself that, as real as being a mother feels to her, a
generation ago, she and her daughters _ Alexis, who is 8, and
Brooks, 5 _ would also likely not have become a family. Ms. Creedy
is a single woman.
</P>
<P>
   As the American family has assumed new forms, adoption agencies
have begun to look beyond stereotypes to find parents. Some
countries, it turned out, actually favored older parents and single
parents, reasoning that children would have such parents' full
focus. Single parents were also more willing to adopt older
children or children with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Ms. Creedy, a media specialist for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Washington, decided that, then 39 and unmarried,
the biggest regret in her life was that she was not a mother.
Initially, she tried to adopt a child out of foster care, but she
was turned down because she was single.
</P>
<P>
   She signed up with a private adoption agency near her home in
Alexandria, Va. While preparing to adopt a child from Guatemala,
news reports coming out of Eastern Europe pushed her to fly to
Rumania. After seven grueling weeks of scouring the bureaucracies
there, she returned home at last with a feisty 14-month-old girl
with laughing eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's birth mother was desperate for her child to climb out
of the poverty engulfing the family. ``She would take Alexis and
point to me and say, `Mama, America,''' Ms. Creedy recalled. ``It
was so profound. We didn't speak the same language, but it was
clear she was saying to me, `You are the one I trust to be my
child's mother.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Ms. Creedy flew to Bolivia to adopt a
5-month-old girl, whose onyx hair and tawny skin set her apart from
her golden-haired, fair-skinned sister, and from her mother, who
describes herself as having ``turkey white skin.'' And yet,
together they are a family in every way: loving, argumentative,
affectionate.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' roots are a vibrant part of their identities. Each
year, each girl celebrates her ``Gotcha Day,'' the day she became a
part of the family. The day begins with the reading of ``life
books'' that Ms. Creedy prepared for each, with pictures, maps and
the tale of how their family came to be.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis' book, which she now proudly reads herself, begins,
``Once upon a time there was a woman, who dreamed of having a baby
girl of her own to give her all the love she had stored up over her
lifetime. Her name was Mommy.''

</P>
<P>
   Even as adoptive parents and their children feel less isolated
and stigmatized, birth parents say they continue to endure
society's disapproving glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pregnant, people were shocked and disgusted by my
plans, not that I was pregnant and unmarried but that I was making
an adoption plan,'' said Lisa Nicholson, a 28-year-old woman from
Richmond, Va., who four years ago chose a family to adopt her
daughter. ``My family and friends understood, but strangers who
knew nothing about me or my circumstances would say, `How could
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, when she hears people talking about how
irresponsible birth parents are, she cannot help revealing herself.
``Usually, I really surprise them, because, to meet me, I'm the
girl next door,'' said Ms. Nicholson, who married last year and
hopes to start a family. ``I explain to them why it's a responsible
decision. It's not easier, it's harder.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Nicholson corresponds with and occasionally speaks to
the couple who adopted her daughter, she has often feared that
disapproval and ignorance among the couple's friends and relatives
would drive them away from her.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Saidman, who has a warm and open relationship with Linda
Dooley, the birth mother of her daughter, Sasha, said that
prejudices in society lingered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been this image in the popular consciousness that
birth parents are these selfish, uncaring people who don't even
think twice about giving up their kids and yet, paradoxically, that
they are these evil people lurking in the shadows who are going to
come and snatch these children back,'' said Mrs. Saidman, 49, a
writer and management consultant. ``But it's just fear and
ignorance speaking. Linda is part of our lives, part of our family.
But I am Sasha's mother.''
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate Sasha's 6th birthday this August, Mrs. Saidman and
her husband, Perry, a 52-year-old design patent lawyer, invited Ms.
Dooley and her 22-year-old daughter, Keira, to drive up from their
home in Florida and stay with the family in their house in Wheaton,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third time the extended clan had gotten together
since Sasha's birth. In between, there were e-mail exchanges,
letters, phone calls and a vacation in the Bahamas that Keira, a
college student, took with the Saidmans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for me is that Sasha is a great kid,
she has wonderful parents and she will never have to have any
self-doubts because any questions she has, she can ask me or she
can ask Susan,'' said Ms. Dooley, 42. ``The hardest part has been
when people who barely know me belittle me and my decision.'' &UR;

   The day Nicholas was born, on a warm, late September Sunday, Kim
Elniskey wrote him a letter as he rested beside her in a bassinet
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weilacker was scrambling to get on a plane to Buffalo.
Rosario was at home with the children. ``I needed to make sure that
you would always be healthy, safe, happy and most of all LOVED more
than could humanly have been possible,'' Ms. Elniskey wrote. ``And
in order for all those things to go together as one, Jorge and I
had to make THE HARDEST DECISION OF OUR LIVES, and that was to find
you a mommy and daddy that would do all those things for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Weilacker arrived, the two women stayed together in
the hospital room and tended to Nicholas, confusing nurses about
who his mother was. One even tried to take Mrs. Weilacker's
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey showed Mrs. Weilacker how to change his diaper, how
to tap his back gently to bring up air after a feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Nicholas' birth, Mrs. Weilacker spent time alone
with him in the hospital, when Ms. Elniskey had tubal ligation
surgery. After checking out, Mrs. Weilacker settled into a hotel
with Nicholas, while Ms. Elniskey returned home to her family.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the week, they shuttled between the apartment
and the hotel. Jake, Miranda and Serena cooed over Nicholas.
Rosario kept his distance. Ms. Elniskey seemed always on the verge
of tears. And yet, when her children clambered about her and
Nicholas would begin to cry, she said that she was relieved and
sure of her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mrs. Weilacker, Ms. Elniskey and Rosario boarded a
plane to Los Angeles, where Nicholas met his father and the
adoption papers were signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas has to get on with his life and we have to move on
with ours,'' Ms. Elniskey said. ``At least our lives won't be
entirely separate, but I really can't imagine how it will all be in
a month or a year from now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Yvette Weilacker sits in the kitchen of a small house in Buffalo
waiting for the contractions to begin. Her baby, already named
Nicholas Lee by his anxious parents, was due days ago, and he shows
scant signs of being ready to be born.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting is all the more tense because the kitchen she waits
in is not hers, and the baby she waits for is in another woman's
body. Kim Elniskey and her fiance, Jorge Rosario, have chosen Mrs.
Weilacker and husband, Paul, to adopt their son and the two
families have gotten to know each other well these past few months,
by telephone, letter and now in person as the birth nears.
</P>
<P>
   Since she flew in from her home in Riverside, Calif., four weeks
earlier, Mrs. Weilacker has been staying with Ms. Elniskey and
Rosario and helping care for their three other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to feel that this is your baby, your family,'' Ms.
Elniskey told Mrs. Weilacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey has kept the Weilackers involved throughout her
pregnancy, sharing ultrasound pictures and updates about the baby's
intra-uterine acrobatics. ``Your son kicked me a lot today,'' Ms.
Elniskey reported in one of many telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers have promised that they will be just as open as
Nicholas grows: what he wears on his first Halloween, when he loses
his first tooth and learns to read. When the boy is ready, Ms.
Elniskey and Rosario plan to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   The intimacy between these two families would have been rare
just a few years ago and unthinkable a generation ago. But such
open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is one
of the many ways that adoption has evolved from a secretive, closed
process weighed down by dark stigmas and painful misconceptions
into an infinitely more transparent experience.
</P>
<P>
   How many children are adopted each year is an elusive number,
since no one keeps complete statistics. The most recent data, from
1992, show 127,441 children adopted that year, a slight increase
from 118,000 five years earlier. About 42 percent of those
adoptions were by stepparents and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The most sought-after children for adoption are, as they have
been for generations, domestic white infants _ known among parents
and professionals in the adoption loop as DWI's _ but those babies
are scarcer because of the easier availability of birth control,
the legalization of abortion and the growing acceptance of single
mothers raising children alone. Experts estimate that there are
fewer than 20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the biggest increase in adoptions has been children
adopted from other countries. Because they require visas, there are
up-to-date statistics for these adoptions and since 1990, their
numbers have nearly doubled, to 13,620 in 1997 from 7,093. So while
the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been
subtle, the increase in visibility has been dramatic, enhanced by
those children adopted from other countries whose physical
differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, adoption has gone public in much the same
manner that divorce did in the 1970s. Increasingly children are
told, even before they can fully understand, how they came to their
families and that story is shared with relatives, friends,
teachers, sometimes even strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birth mother gave me this doll,'' Sasha Saidman, a
6-year-old who was adopted, told a clerk at the video store near
her home in Wheaton, Md., as her family prepared for a visit from
the woman who had borne her. Like most adopted children, Sasha used
the term that has replaced such loaded phrases as ``real mother''
and ``natural mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the ``other'' option for becoming parents, adoption is now
one of many ways that men and women create families. The panorama
of the American family now includes children born through advanced
reproductive technology, some conceived with donated sperm and
eggs; families broken apart by divorce then blended through
remarriage; families created by single parents and by gay men who
have hired a surrogate to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing an explosion of different family forms which
make adoption seem downright mainstream and conservative,'' said
Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson
Adoption Institute, a research group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed
adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting
families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted
out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call
the ``Ovarian Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Further raising the profile are the celebrities who have spoken
happily about being adoptive parents, including: Nicole Kidman and
her husband, Tom Cruise; Rosie O'Donnell, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who
wrote a popular children's book on the subject, ``Tell Me Again
About the Night I Was Born.''
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores, that book shares shelf space with an expanding
selection of adoption-related titles from large publishers and from
niche publishers like R-Squared Press in Ann Arbor, Mich., a small
family-run business that focuses on adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In Tacoma, Wash., Gloria Finkbeiner, an adoptive sister, aunt
and grandmother, started a mail-order card and gift business called
Adoption Option with her daughter, Susan Pierce, who adopted three
children out of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are, adoption isn't unique,'' said Mrs. Finkbeiner.
``It's just a way to be a family.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how many people build families
through open adoption, no way to know how many birth parents select
the people they want to raise their child, get to know them and
then stay in some sort of contact _ from regular visits to
occasional phone calls or letters _ after the baby is legally and
emotionally the other family's child. But people in the field say
the trend of open adoption is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Human Services in Traverse City, Mich., a rural area in
the northern part of the state, was one of the first agencies to
arrange open adoptions. Since 1980, the agency has handled close to
500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotype from 20 years ago was that birth parents were
wild and reckless people from the other side of the tracks,'' said
Jim Gritter, a child welfare supervisor at the agency. ``But what
we found was that that viewpoint was 180 degrees from reality. So
many birth mothers talked about feeling that they were abandoning
their babies because the closed system basically asked of them to
abandon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Social workers at the agency decided that the only way to soothe
birth parents' guilt was to let them choose families for their
children. The social workers were motivated in part by stories they
had heard of adoptees searching for their birth parents. If
children yearned to know about their roots, and birth parents
longed to know who became the parents of their children, the agency
social workers figured that it made sense to make adoption a
collaborative experience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the open adoption process has helped to
transform the experience of adoption even for those with more
traditional arrangements. Today, the majority of people who adopt
know something about their children's backgrounds. Even if they do
not stay in regular contact, they frequently have detailed medical
histories, photographs of biological relatives, and letters and
gifts for the children from the women who bore them.
</P>
<P>
   This information, experts say, can help children to understand
better the decisions leading to their adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most frustrating things for me growing up was not
knowing my background,'' said David Wilson, a 31-year-old
telecommunications consultant who several years ago found and met
his birth parents. ``I'm cautious about saying that having an open,
ongoing relationship with them when I was growing up would have
been good. That could create conflict or blur lines. But just
knowing who they were and why they made their choices would have
taken away an unnecessary mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoption is no mystery for Diana Galligan, nearly 7. ``It's when
people who love you take care of you and become your parents,'' she
says, quietly poised.
</P>
<P>
   And she will tell you that in her case, those people who love
her and take care of her are her ``guys,'' her dad, John Galligan,
and her pop, Richard Koonce.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuckahoe Elementary School in Arlington, Va., Diana is one of
many adopted children, although her fathers think she is the only
one there who is being raised by openly gay parents. And even
though Galligan and Koonce are far more concerned with helping
their daughter learn to read and to express herself freely, they
are acutely aware that families like theirs are a symbol of ``the

   ``In previous generations, one of the most difficult notions for
many gay men coming out was putting aside the idea of having a

Department.
</P>
<P>
   Galligan said that he knew he wanted to be a father ever since
he worked as a college volunteer in a Big Brother program. Several

he decided that ``the time was right; I wanted to be a father.''

   He was trying to figure out how to go about adopting, when a
woman he knew with two older children told him that she was
pregnant and was willing to have him adopt the baby. Their
arrangement is open, and Diana visits her birth mother every summer
and calls her when she feels like it.
</P>

   Although they have sensed disapproval and worse from strangers,
Galligan and Koonce said they have never faced prejudice from
neighbors or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But both men lamented that many religious and political
institutions were still hostile. Although Galligan adopted Diana,
Koonce is legally only Diana's guardian in case something happens
to Galligan. He has yet to formally adopt her, they said, because
Virginia courts would not allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Even as adoptive parents and their children feel less isolated
and stigmatized, birth parents say they continue to endure
society's disapproving glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pregnant, people were shocked and disgusted by my
plans, not that I was pregnant and unmarried but that I was making
an adoption plan,'' said Lisa Nicholson, a 28-year-old woman from
Richmond, Va., who four years ago chose a family to adopt her
daughter. ``My family and friends understood, but strangers who
knew nothing about me or my circumstances would say, `How could

hopes to start a family. ``I explain to them why it's a responsible

</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Nicholson corresponds with and occasionally speaks to
the couple who adopted her daughter, she has often feared that
disapproval and ignorance among the couple's friends and relatives
would drive them away from her.

<P>
   The Weilackers, who are both 39 and had endured several years of
unsuccessful infertility treatments, placed their letter in the
files of the Independent Adoption Center in Pleasant Hill, Calif.
It was forwarded, among dozens of others, to Ms. Elniskey,
prompting her to call the Weilackers on a toll-free line they had
set up in the hopes of receiving just such a call.
</P>
<P>
   Before she called the center, Ms. Elniskey said that she did not
even know such an arrangement was possible. The world of adoption,
she said, was vastly different than it was eight years ago, when
she was 18, in high school and pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't ready to be a mother, I couldn't do it,'' Ms.
Elniskey, a 26-year-old homemaker, said of her first pregnancy.
``After I gave birth, my sister Judy took the baby home and cared
for her. I named her Alyssa. My obstetrician found the couple. She
was a patient of his. I wanted to know about them, who they were
and all. But I didn't know I could ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience, she said, left her heartbroken. Even now she
will scan a crowd, looking at girls around Alyssa's age, wondering,
``Is that my hair? My nose? Could this be her?''
</P>
<P>
   When she found herself last winter with three small children and
pregnant again, despite having had an injection of Depo-Provera
that was supposed to prevent pregnancy for several months, Ms.
Elniskey said she panicked. She and Rosario, who is 30 years old
and works in a factory making roll-up doors for trucks, agreed that
they could not cope with another child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey said she knew she could never go blindly into
another adoption. But she never imagined the power she had to
influence her baby's future and to remain a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The day Nicholas was born, on a warm, late September Sunday, Kim
Elniskey wrote him a letter as he rested beside her in a bassinet
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weilacker was scrambling to get on a plane to Buffalo.
Rosario was at home with the children. ``I needed to make sure that
you would always be healthy, safe, happy and most of all LOVED more
than could humanly have been possible,'' Ms. Elniskey wrote. ``And
in order for all those things to go together as one, Jorge and I
had to make THE HARDEST DECISION OF OUR LIVES, and that was to find
you a mommy and daddy that would do all those things for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Weilacker arrived, the two women stayed together in
the hospital room and tended to Nicholas, confusing nurses about
who his mother was. One even tried to take Mrs. Weilacker's
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey showed Mrs. Weilacker how to change his diaper, how
to tap his back gently to bring up gas after a feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Nicholas' birth, Mrs. Weilacker spent time alone
with him in the hospital, when Ms. Elniskey had tubal ligation
surgery. After checking out, Mrs. Weilacker settled into a hotel
with Nicholas, while Ms. Elniskey returned home to her family.

   For the rest of the week, they shuttled between the apartment
and the hotel. Jake, Miranda and Serena cooed over Nicholas.
Rosario kept his distance. Ms. Elniskey seemed always on the verge
of tears. And yet, when her children clambered about her and
Nicholas would begin to cry, she said that she was relieved and
sure of her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mrs. Weilacker, Ms. Elniskey and Rosario boarded a
plane to Los Angeles, where Nicholas met his father and the
adoption papers were signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas has to get on with his life and we have to move on
with ours,'' Ms. Elniskey said. ``At least our lives won't be
entirely separate, but I really can't imagine how it will all be in
a month or a year from now.''

<P>
   One spring afternoon in 1994, a University of Wyoming freshman
was shot in the head at point-blank range and left to die. A day or
two later, The Laramie Daily Boomerang shoved the event in the
community's face, printing a front-page photograph of the young
man's body as it lay near his dormitory. The figures of police
officers partly blocked the view. But only partly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing a story about somebody being gunned down in the
busiest intersection of town in cold blood didn't have the same
impact as seeing it,'' said managing editor Robert Wilson, whose
daily newspaper has a circulation of about 8,000. ``I wanted people
to feel that horror. I particularly wanted young people to see that
this isn't a movie we're playing here. This is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Outrage was what Wilson wanted. Outrage was what he got _
directed not against the killers or the crime, but against the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, if inconsistently, images of the dead are finding
their way into print and onto television. There are corpses without
shrouds, without the comfort of a soft focus. There are slack
bodies, bloated bodies, frozen, frightened faces that make viewers
turn away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something I wish to see alongside my breakfast,''
an angry reader wrote to The New York Times three weeks ago when
the newspaper ran a photograph of a massacre victim in Kosovo, his
face contorted.
</P>
<P>
   In fits and starts, the reflexes that made graphic death a
rarity in newspapers in the generation after the Vietnam War are
being supplanted by a willingness to use such images for their
emotional impact.
</P>
<P>
   An uncomfortable fact for journalists is that their use has an
editorial tone at odds with the buttoned-down objectivity of news
columns. But images from Rwanda, Kosovo and Algeria have focused
popular outrage. The larger the point to be made, the more willing
editors have been to use visual horror to make that point.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean there has never been graphic death in
newspapers. In the first decades of the 20th century, pictures of
dead mobsters and suicides filled the tabloids. But in the last two
decades, along with the rise of graphic violence on television and
in the movies, both the grittier tabloids and the more restrained
broadsheets took a different approach. Instead of embracing all
disturbing images, editors waited until a particularly visceral
image captured a visceral moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing victims in Kosovo look the same as bombing victims 10
years ago in Iran,'' said Eric Meskauskas, photo editor of The New
York Daily News. ``You wind up trying to look for something that
has something else in it that makes it more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Since we've seen almost everything there is to see
in this age, what photo editors are trying to do is make you feel
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Some photographs have ``outrage quality,'' said Michael Smith, a
deputy picture editor at The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the baby in the Oklahoma City bombing,'' he said,
speaking of the photograph by Charles Porter, an amateur, showing a
firefighter cradling the dead body of one-year-old Baylee Almon.
``People agonized over it because it was a baby. Nobody wants to
put a baby in the paper. But it so symbolized the loss of
innocence, the fact that we were as vulnerable to terrorism as
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors who chose to run photographs of charred corpses in a
Nairobi morgue after this summer's embassy bombing, or the face of
an old Albanian man killed in a Kosovo massacre, made the same
argument. At a panel discussion at the Newseum in New York
recently, Meskauskas said, ``I think you have to use it because it
tells you something about terrorism and what the people were
feeling like.''
</P>
<P>
   The visible dead tend to have two things in common. For one,
they have usually died at human hands. With the exception of the
youth whose ash-covered body was photographed from the air after
the explosion at Mount St. Helens in 1980, dead victims of natural
disasters, as well as victims of airplane crashes, tend not to be
shown in the news media. As a senior photo editor described it,
without a moral lesson to be drawn, there is no point in showing
corpses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at a war,'' said Vincent Alabiso, the executive
photo editor of The Associated Press, ``one image can somehow
define a story and crystallize your feelings some way or another,
and can force you to decide on a point of view you might take.
That's different from looking at a hurricane picture.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A second factor common to many images of the dead in newspapers
is their distance from readers. While no generalization is
foolproof, it is safe to say that the farther away the dead person
is, physically or psychologically, the more likely that the image
will find its way into print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people really want to look at highly disturbing
photographs, and the closer to home, the more disturbing the
images,'' said Gail Buckland, a photo historian and an associate
professor at Cooper Union in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead bodies in Africa are more tolerated,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Meskauskas, have a simpler explanation: Crime
scenes in the West are tightly controlled. None of the editors
interviewed had seen images of the bodies of James Byrd, the black
man dragged to death in Jasper, Texas, last summer, or Matthew
Shepard, the gay college student tied to a fence, beaten and left
to die two weeks ago in Laramie, Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The rollicking, anything-goes photojournalism of the 1920s and
1930s changed during World War II, according to John Morris, a
former photographer and picture editor for Life magazine, ``The
rule was: We can show enemy dead but not our own people. Especially
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first big breakthrough occurred in 1943,'' added Morris,
who was also picture editor at The New York Times in the 1960s and
1970s. ``Life ran a photo from Buna Beach in New Guinea. That
picture was held up in censorship in Washington for about eight
months before it was released. It showed two or three American
bodies face down in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Censorship was eased during the Vietnam War, but returned during
the Persian Gulf war; The Detroit Free Press' photographer, David
Turnley, had to argue and cajole the military censors to approve a
photograph of a soldier crying next to a body bag.
</P>
<P>
   But censorship had little role to play in 1993 during the
ill-fated U.S. military involvement in Somalia. The Toronto Star's
image of a dead U.S. serviceman dragged through the street by mobs
went around the world. ``We ran the poor American soldier who was
dragged through the streets in Mogadishu,'' said Michele
Stephenson, the director of photography for Time magazine. ``We
felt we needed to do that to show what was going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his decision to put the corpse of a murdered college
student before his readers, Wilson, of The Laramie Daily Boomerang,
would not quickly do it again. Even had photos of Shepard tied to
the fence existed, he said, the cruelty of the crime was such that
``I don't think I or anyone else could have faced a photograph of
it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The countdown is set to begin Monday morning for a space flight
that will not make history or any new heroes but has everything to
do with history and an aging hero, John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years after he rode a cramped Mercury capsule to
become the first American to orbit Earth, on Feb. 20, 1962, and 24
years after the trajectory of fame landed him in the U.S. Senate,
Glenn will be suiting up again as an astronaut. At the age of 77,
he will be the oldest person ever to fly in space, a hero of the
Cold War stepping forward this time as a role model for the
geriatric generation _ and to satisfy an unending yearning.
</P>
<P>
   The curtain is scheduled to go up on Glenn's encore flight at 2
p.m. on Thursday with the launching of the space shuttle Discovery
at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. On the planned nine-day
mission, the retiring Democratic senator from Ohio will join a crew
of six other astronauts trained to conduct observations of solar
physics, tests of new equipment for the Hubble Space Telescope and
experiments in materials processing and biology.
</P>
<P>
   But since the announcement in January that Glenn was being added
to the crew, what would have been just another shuttle mission, and
a blip on the public consciousness, has assumed outsized importance
as ``the Glenn flight,'' generating magazine cover stories and an
expected media crush at Cape Canaveral unknown since the Apollo
days in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the flight has been criticized as a blatant publicity
ploy by NASA to revive the flagging interest in human space flight.
NASA officials insist that Glenn's presence on Discovery has
scientific merit and should produce insights into the physiological
effects of space flight and aging.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper response, though, seems to be an awakening of
submerged memories of the time when a man sat alone atop a rocket
and was blasted into orbit to make a nation full of doubt and under
great stress feel better about itself and its future. Space was one
of the battlegrounds in the Cold War between the United States and
the Soviet Union, and the Russians were seizing the high ground
there. Glenn was 40 then, a Marine pilot and one of the country's
first seven astronauts chosen to risk their lives equaling or
surpassing the Soviet achievements.
</P>
<P>
   At the Johnson Space Center in Houston 10 days ago, Glenn
professed to be astonished by ``the rising tide of interest'' in
the coming mission. The Discovery commander, Lt. Col. Curtis Brown
Jr. of the Air Force, said, ``We've been overwhelmed by the
curiosity and the excitement about our flight.'' Some crew members,
including Glenn, have complained of what they call the
media-manufactured hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   On reflection, Glenn acknowledged in an interview that his
return to space was very likely inspiring a general wistfulness
about those days in 1962 when ``we accomplished some things that
were fundamental in moving us in new directions internationally as
well as in this country.'' His three-orbit, five-hour flight, he
said, ``came at a time when we desperately needed a success, and it
was a success.''
</P>
<P>
   His reception after the flight, the outpouring of emotion with
people everywhere wiping tears from their eyes, the profound relief
and tumultuous parades, still leaves Glenn incredulous. ``This
would have been the case whoever was on that flight,'' he said,
modestly. ``It was almost like we had turned a corner in our
national psyche, almost as though we were at a low point and were
starting back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter McDougall, a historian at the University of
Pennsylvania, characterized the public reaction to Glenn's first
flight as ``a national catharsis unparalleled'' in his political
history of the Space Age, ``The Heavens and the Earth,'' published
by Basic Books in 1985. ``It seemed that he had given Americans
back their self-respect, and more than that _ it seemed Americans
dared again to hope,'' McDougall wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers note that Glenn's nostalgia trip seems to hold
little appeal for those who did not live through the early days of
space flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to my students now, and they don't see why Alan Shepard
and John Glenn were such big heroes,'' said Dr. Pamela Mack, a
historian of science and technology at Clemson University. ``They
think of the technology as the exciting thing, and the fact that
people did all this has gotten rather lost. To them the little
robot on Mars Pathfinder was more of a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   For most young people today, the ``compelling vision of the
space program'' is the Challenger explosion that killed seven
people on liftoff, said Dr. Alex Roland, a former NASA historian
who is chairman of the history department at Duke University. ``For
them, John Glenn and Apollo are ancient history, and they don't
care very much,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have persisted in questioning the decision to fly Glenn,
saying it is no more than a joy ride for a loyal Democrat who
defended the White House in a congressional investigation of
campaign finances and a transparent move to bolster public support
for NASA. Twice before, politicians, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah in 1985
and Rep. Bill Nelson of Florida in 1986, took shuttle rides, but
this practice was suspended after the Challenger disaster. The
critics especially bridle at arguments trying to justify Glenn's
role as a worthwhile medical experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight itself doesn't bother me, but calling it science is
a disservice,'' said Roland, who is often critical of NASA policy.
``If they had said we're flying John Glenn because he's John Glenn,
everybody would have bought it. When Glenn started to promote the
flight, he cooked up this notion of doing aging experiments. That's
a hollow pretext that trivializes science and embarrasses the space
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials and Glenn himself explain that the senator
initiated the idea of a flight in which he would be a test subject
for studies of the seeming parallels between the changes that
happen to a body in space and those wrought by aging on Earth. In
1996, Glenn proposed the idea to Daniel Goldin, the NASA
administrator, who agreed on the conditions that scientists found
that the studies would be of value and the senator passed a
rigorous physical examination.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Glenn said in the interview, he had never really abandoned
hope that he would get a second chance to fly in space. He resigned
from the astronaut corps in 1964, only after getting nowhere with
requests for a second flight; he would learn later that President
Kennedy had thought him too much of a national hero to risk losing
him in an accident. A few years later, Glenn also sounded out
officials about a place on an Apollo moon mission, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked very much to go to the moon,'' Glenn said,
but he could get no assurances of a mission. ``I didn't want to
stick around being the oldest astronaut in training just hoping to
go to the moon, so I went on to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's persistence finally paid off when scientific advisers to
the space agency endorsed the idea of medical tests and physicians
pronounced the senator fit enough to fly in orbit. They said he
passed all the medical tests required of anyone assigned to fly the
shuttle as a payload specialist, for whom the standards are
slightly less rigorous than for pilot astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Williams, a physician-astronaut who is the life
science director at the Johnson center, said that Glenn had managed
to keep up with the pace of training. ``I hope when I'm 77 years
old I'm in as good shape as Sen. Glenn is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Engelauf, the flight director, acknowledged that there was
``a slight increased risk'' having a man of Glenn's age on board.
He might not be able to move swiftly in emergencies (Glenn admits
that his bones and muscles have lost much of their flexibility) and
is at a greater risk of becoming ill or incapacitated. But the
flight director said that no special medical-emergency equipment
had been installed in the shuttle and no new emergency procedures
had been incorporated in mission training.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent news conference, Glenn said, ``I'm not concerned
about the trip itself as much as I am making sure the experiments
I'm responsible for get done and get done well.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being at the cockpit controls, as he was as the lone
pilot of his Friendship 7 flight, Glenn will ride below the flight
deck and work in a pressurized Spacehab module in the shuttle's
cargo bay. There he is to process blood and urine specimens from
the rest of the crew and sit for the battery of tests that will be
run on him as a human guinea pig.
</P>
<P>
   His heartbeat, pulse and even urine flow will be monitored for
studies of the effect of weightlessness on an aged human body. An
assortment of sensors and wires will be attached to his body for 21
different experiments. The objectives are to watch for signs of
debilitating conditions _ like muscle and bone loss _ that affect
both astronauts in orbit and elderly people on the ground, as well
as run tests for changes in the immune system and protein levels.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials confirmed a report last week that Glenn did not
meet all the required conditions for tests on the role of
melatonin, a hormone produced naturally by the brain, in helping
astronauts and elderly people sleep. He will not participate in
that part of a battery of sleep tests. But the officials declined
to explain the decision, citing the tradition of confidentiality
between doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the other tests, Glenn's on-board physician will be
Dr. Scott Parazynski, a 37-year-old astronaut who was seven months
old at the time of Glenn's first flight. He may be all business
when sticking needles in Glenn's arm, but he has his memories, too.
``I'm really thrilled and honored to fly the skies with my boyhood
hero,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides carrying Glenn as a human test subject, the Discovery's
Spacehab pressurized module will be crammed with equipment for the
astronauts to work on 30 experiments ranging from materials science
to plant growth. One experiment involves the development of new
techniques for delivering anti-tumor medications to cancer
patients. Other instruments in the cargo bay are designed to make
ultraviolet observations of stars and test an infrared-camera
cooling system that is to be installed next year on the Hubble
Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth day in orbit, the Discovery astronauts plan to
release a small satellite called Spartan for two days of
observations of the Sun's atmosphere, or corona, and its effects on
the space environment throughout the solar system. The satellite is
to be retrieved before the shuttle returns to Earth. The landing,
back at Cape Canaveral, is scheduled for Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   This is expected to be the last shuttle flight for some time
that will be devoted primarily to scientific and medical research.
Beginning in early December, nearly all shuttle flights will be
carrying components into orbit for the much-delayed international
space station.
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping count, this will be the 92nd shuttle mission
since the reusable vehicles began flying in 1981. And it will be
the 121st American flight of astronauts in space since that day in
February 1962 when John Glenn brought respectability and hope to
the fledgling American space program.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Brown, a veteran of four shuttle flights, remarked at a
recent news conference that he looked forward to seeing the
expression of Glenn when he looks out the window on orbital space
for the first time in 36 years. ``That will be a special moment for
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me too,'' John Glenn responded in an instant, flashing the
smile that once dazzled parade crowds on Broadway and through a
grateful land.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1996 campaign, organized labor's approach toward the
Republican Party could best be described as all-out war, but
judging from Tony Speelman's enthusiastic calls on behalf of a Long
Island Republican, Rep. Michael Forbes, labor's approach has
evolved considerably.
</P>
<P>
   At a union hall in Hauppauge, Speelman, political director of a
local representing 18,000 supermarket workers, was making 30 calls
an hour, urging union members to vote for Forbes _ one of three
Long Island Republicans labor has endorsed for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a script on a computer screen, Speelman told one
union member in his booming baritone, ``Mike Forbes has been a
champion for Long Island in the fight to create jobs, protect
workers' benefits and insure a family-friendly workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sharp contrast from two years ago when labor not only
fought against Forbes, but spent nearly $35 million condemning
Republicans nationwide and praising Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After that offensive irked labor's few Republican friends in
Congress and caused the Republican leadership to push anti-union
legislation, labor has adopted a less partisan approach this fall.
It has endorsed 27 Republican House candidates in an effort to
reward its allies and insure what labor leaders call ``a
worker-friendly majority,'' composed of Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   These endorsements of Republicans are part of an important shift
in labor's national political strategy, in which unions are
focusing more on issues and less on party. Seeing that Republican
moderates have voted labor's way on many issues and that many
conservative Democrats have not, unions have stopped their
knee-jerk endorsement of Democrats _ although labor continues to
back more Democrats than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said, ``If we're going
to maintain credibility with our rank and file as well as with
elected officials, we have to show that we're supporting
candidates, regardless of party, who have supported us.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor has choreographed a difficult dance for itself, endorsing
some Republicans to strengthen its ties with moderates while
mobilizing union members and other parts of the Democratic base to
minimize losses by Democratic friends.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have changed their political tactics in other ways. With
the AFL-CIO's $35 million war chest a major issue in the 1996
campaign, the 13 million-member federation is spending less money
this fall _ about $7 million on broadcast spots and $14 million for
other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Labor is shifting from its air war toward a ground war, by
broadcasting fewer advertisements and by mobilizing thousands of
members, including more than 300 coordinators who are doing
full-time political work for a month or more. To maintain its
independence, labor is increasingly channeling its efforts into
political education and get-out-the vote operations run by unions,
rather than by candidates' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders say their get-out-the-vote drive, always a major
thrust, is crucial because the White House sex scandal has turned
off many voters to politics and because Republicans and
corporations are expected to spend a record amount on the midterm
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that
monitors campaign finances, said corporations contributed $460
million to campaigns from Jan. 1, 1997, to Oct. 1, 1998, while
unions gave $39 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than vote with money, our role is to get people to vote
with their feet,'' said Jack Kittle, a painters union official who
oversees labor's push for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican leaders belittle labor's endorsement of
Republican moderates as a transparent effort to rack up IOU's when
union leaders recognize that Republicans will maintain control of
Congress. But union leaders say they are merely rewarding
Republicans who, after getting bruised by labor's push in 1996,
have begun backing unions on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders say they have embraced Forbes because he is one of
the best examples of a Republican turnaround. They say Forbes has
embraced labor after unions battered him in 1996, though he insists
he is merely paying more attention to an important constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Forbes has done a total 180-degree turn from the time
that we took him on,'' said Jack Caffey, president of the Long
Island Federation of Labor. ``He confers with us on any bill that
labor has a concern with.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO said Forbes, whose Democratic opponent is William
Holst, voted labor's way 18 percent of the time in 1995 and 50
percent last year. He sided with labor against overhauling laws on
overtime and against fast-track legislation that would have made it
easier to negotiate free-trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say that in 1995, just one House Republican voted
with labor at least 50 percent of the time, while last year 23 did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've changed,'' Sweeney said. ``I think the
Republicans have changed. We wouldn't have been able to defeat
fast-track without the help of the moderate Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor has not forsaken the Democrats. Indeed, at the
electrical workers' union hall from which Speelman was telephoning,
there were three other union members making calls _ one for Forbes
and two for Caroline McCarthy, a Nassau County Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders suggest that labor's endorsement of some
Republican moderates is a trick. ``Their talk of endorsing some
Republicans is encouraging spin, although they remain the principal
backers and funding source of the National Democratic Party,'' said
Terry Holt, a spokesman for the House Republican Conference.

<P>
   In what are considered the 40 closest House races, labor is
overwhelmingly backing Democrats. Union officials acknowledged that
they would love to see the Democrats regain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with Republicans, but I do have a
problem with the Republican leadership,'' said Kittle, the
painters' official. ``Sure, I'd love to see Newt Gingrich hand the
gavel over to Dick Gephardt, but not at the expense of friends like
Mike Forbes.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kittle as coordinator, Long Island unions have registered
3,000 members to vote this year, part of more than 400,000
registered nationwide. Unions hope to make more than 50,000 calls
and send 50,000 brochures to members in Forbes' district. They have
similar goals for Ms. McCarthy's district.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's big hope is to get union turnout far closer to the 24
percent of 1996 than to the 14 percent in 1994, when Republicans
made large gains in the congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director, said the
White House sex scandal had made labor's efforts more difficult by
making it harder for campaigns to focus on issues that union
members care about, like regulating health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this terrible Lewinsky smog that has settled in, and
it has created an issue vacuum in the campaign,'' Rosenthal said.
``It's made it hard for us to convince people to go out and vote.
We tell people, `The other side wants you to stay home so they can
privatize Social Security and stop patient protections for HMOs.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If 1998 is an election about things that matter to working
people, it makes our job easier to get out the vote,'' he said.
``We're telling our members, `If you don't vote, you're only doing
harm to yourself.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1996 campaign, organized labor's approach toward the
Republican Party could best be described as all-out war, but
judging from Tony Speelman's enthusiastic calls on behalf of a Long
Island Republican, Rep. Michael Forbes, labor's approach has
evolved considerably.
</P>
<P>
   At a union hall in Hauppauge, Speelman, political director of a
local representing 18,000 supermarket workers, was making 30 calls
an hour, urging union members to vote for Forbes _ one of three
Long Island Republicans labor has endorsed for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a script on a computer screen, Speelman told one
union member in his booming baritone, ``Mike Forbes has been a
champion for Long Island in the fight to create jobs, protect
workers' benefits and insure a family-friendly workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sharp contrast from two years ago when labor not only
fought against Forbes, but spent nearly $35 million condemning
Republicans nationwide and praising Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After that offensive irked labor's few Republican friends in
Congress and caused the Republican leadership to push anti-union
legislation, labor has adopted a less partisan approach this fall.
It has endorsed 27 Republican House candidates in an effort to
reward its allies and insure what labor leaders call ``a
worker-friendly majority,'' composed of Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   These endorsements of Republicans are part of an important shift
in labor's national political strategy, in which unions are
focusing more on issues and less on party. Seeing that Republican
moderates have voted labor's way on many issues and that many
conservative Democrats have not, unions have stopped their
knee-jerk endorsement of Democrats _ although labor continues to
back more Democrats than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said, ``If we're going
to maintain credibility with our rank and file as well as with
elected officials, we have to show that we're supporting
candidates, regardless of party, who have supported us.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor has choreographed a difficult dance for itself, endorsing
some Republicans to strengthen its ties with moderates while
mobilizing union members and other parts of the Democratic base to
minimize losses by Democratic friends.
</P>
<P>
   Unions have changed their political tactics in other ways. With
the AFL-CIO's $35 million war chest a major issue in the 1996
campaign, the 13 million-member federation is spending less money
this fall _ about $7 million on broadcast spots and $14 million for
other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Labor is shifting from its air war toward a ground war, by
broadcasting fewer advertisements and by mobilizing thousands of
members, including more than 300 coordinators who are doing
full-time political work for a month or more. To maintain its
independence, labor is increasingly channeling its efforts into
political education and get-out-the vote operations run by unions,
rather than by candidates' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders say their get-out-the-vote drive, always a major
thrust, is crucial because the White House sex scandal has turned
off many voters to politics and because Republicans and
corporations are expected to spend a record amount on the midterm
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that
monitors campaign finances, said corporations contributed $460
million to campaigns from Jan. 1, 1997, to Oct. 1, 1998, while
unions gave $39 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than vote with money, our role is to get people to vote
with their feet,'' said Jack Kittle, a painters union official who
oversees labor's push for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican leaders belittle labor's endorsement of
Republican moderates as a transparent effort to rack up IOU's when
union leaders recognize that Republicans will maintain control of
Congress. But union leaders say they are merely rewarding
Republicans who, after getting bruised by labor's push in 1996,
have begun backing unions on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders say they have embraced Forbes because he is one of
the best examples of a Republican turnaround. They say Forbes has
embraced labor after unions battered him in 1996, though he insists
he is merely paying more attention to an important constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Forbes has done a total 180-degree turn from the time
that we took him on,'' said Jack Caffey, president of the Long
Island Federation of Labor. ``He confers with us on any bill that
labor has a concern with.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO said Forbes, whose Democratic opponent is William
Holst, voted labor's way 18 percent of the time in 1995 and 50
percent last year. He sided with labor against overhauling laws on
overtime and against fast-track legislation that would have made it
easier to negotiate free-trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say that in 1995, just one House Republican voted
with labor at least 50 percent of the time, while last year 23 did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've changed,'' Sweeney said. ``I think the
Republicans have changed. We wouldn't have been able to defeat
fast-track without the help of the moderate Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor has not forsaken the Democrats. Indeed, at the
electrical workers' union hall from which Speelman was telephoning,
there were three other union members making calls _ one for Forbes
and two for Caroline McCarthy, a Nassau County Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders suggest that labor's endorsement of some
Republican moderates is a trick. ``Their talk of endorsing some
Republicans is encouraging spin, although they remain the principal
backers and funding source of the National Democratic Party,'' said
Terry Holt, a spokesman for the House Republican Conference.

   ULAAN BAATAR, Mongolia _ Who killed Zorig?
</P>
<P>
   From the apartment blocks, offices and countless bars of this
capital city to the nomadic tents across the endless countryside,
Mongolians have been obsessed with the question in the three weeks
since the man known as the father of their democracy was stabbed to
death by masked attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Still unsolved, the killing of the 36-year-old Sanjaasuren Zorig
occurred in circumstances that strongly suggest a political or
financial motive: On the day of his death, party leaders had agreed
to nominate him for prime minister, promising to end a three-month
standoff that has paralyzed the government.
</P>
<P>
   And the speculation about why he was killed reveals the lost
innocence of a country that only in 1990 _ thanks in part to
Zorig's leadership _ began a peaceful and exuberant transition to
free-market democracy after 70 years of communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of the romantic phase of Mongolian
democracy,'' said Hashbat Hulan, 37, a member of Parliament. As in
many countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia that shook off
the Soviet empire, euphoria has given way to bitter truths and not
a little disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that the first thing everyone says about Zorig is
that he was honest. Equally telling, as a sign of the blend of
sparse fact and plentiful fiction that characterizes many
post-communist societies, the fantastic theories being bruited
about are seen as entirely plausible.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Zorig had served as minister of infrastructure,
overseeing multimillion-dollar construction contracts. In a painful
interview on Thursday his widow, Bulgan, who was tied up in the
bathroom of their home as her husband was stabbed to death, said he
had told her of being offered bribes _ of $5,000 and $50,000, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he refused,'' said Mrs. Zorig, bursting into tears.
``If he had taken these bribes, perhaps he would be alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder whether he was killed because, if he had become
prime minister, he might have uncovered cronyism in the country's
sell-off of state industries, or exposed misuse of foreign aid. Or
was it the Russian mafia _ a favorite suspect for evils here _
fearing that he would interfere with lucrative business interests?
</P>
<P>
   Of course it might have been a simple robbery gone bad, and the
timing a bizarre coincidence. But nobody in this country of 2.4
million people seems to believe that.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians were clearly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did this happen now, just as we were beginning to unify
our coalition?'' asked Delgermaa, a 39-year-old former law
professor who is a member of Parliament. ``This was not a
coincidence,'' she said. Like many Mongolians, Ms. Delgermaa uses
one name.
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's richest capitalists, Jargalsaikhan, spoke
out about Zorig's killing last week. ``He was an honest, principled
and educated person,'' he told a local newspaper. ``These qualities
of his were not liked by some people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately there are a lot of disputes about how to divide the
pie, different cases involving money and financial deceit,'' added
Jargalsaikhan, director of the giant Buyan Co., which trades in
cashmere.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three months the government has been hobbled by an
impasse between the fractious Democratic Coalition and the
president. The coalition controls Parliament, and the president is
from the opposition Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the
former Communists, who now call themselves social democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members had helped vote down two of their own prime
ministers, in the most recent case largely because of an abortive
effort to merge a large state bank with a private one. The merger,
accomplished and then reversed, has been denounced as poorly
conceived _ and, the opposition asserts, pursued in an illegal and
corrupt manner.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the president must be consulted before
Parliament votes on a new prime minister. The president, Natsagiyn
Bagabandi, has repeatedly turned down candidates, calling them
unqualified. Finally, on Oct. 2, the coalition factions found
common ground, agreeing to nominate Zorig. The president said he
had been ready to approve the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   That night, a masked man and woman entered the couple's modest
apartment in one of the monotonous blocks in central Ulaan Baatar,
tied up Ms. Bulgan and ambushed Zorig at the door, stabbing him 16
times. Ms. Bulgan said that her husband had not indicated any
suspicions of danger.
</P>
<P>
   In a land where wrestling is the national sport and Genghis Khan
the revered ancestor, Zorig was a gentle hero. Although his
grandfather had been killed decades earlier by Stalin's henchmen,
in the 1980s Zorig, like many Mongolian intellectuals, went to
university in Moscow, studying Marxist-Leninist philosophy. He
returned to teach Marxism at a university in Ulaan Baatar, but his
thoughts had turned to Western ideals.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1989, as democratic movements coursed through the
Soviet empire, Zorig was one of 13 men who began agitating for
Mongolia's freedom. In early 1990, as demonstrations blossomed in
Ulaan Baatar's giant central square, he emerged as the most
articulate and respected leader.
</P>
<P>
   He was not so much an eloquent orator, friends say, as a man of
wise counsel and a quietly powerful voice of conciliation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On one tense day in April 1990, tens of thousands of
demonstrators were pressing toward soldiers in front of the
government House. When Zorig climbed onto friends' shoulders and
appealed for calm, witnesses recall, the entire crowd sat down to
show their support for peaceful talks. The Communists agreed to
write a new, democratic constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In the country's first real elections, in 1992, the former
Communists won handily. But the task of beginning to build a market
economy took a toll, with homeless children taking up residence in
Ulaan Baatar's sewers, rampant inflation and a growing disparity in
incomes. In 1996, to its own astonishment, the coalition of new
democratic parties found itself voted into office.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of an array of international aid agencies and
nongovernmental organizations, the youthful leaders vowed to speed
up privatization. They also found themselves haggling over Cabinet
posts and the management of complex financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   While the corruption here does not appear to have reached the
rapacious heights of Russia and some other places, it has stirred
resentment in a nation with a strong egalitarian tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very small country,'' said Ms. Hulan, the
legislator. ``People have eyes and ears; they can see how much
their leaders are spending, and how much they earn in their public
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We entertained naive thoughts that Mongolia could
escape the pitfalls of all the other post-Communist countries that
are now submerged in corruption and racketeering.''
</P>
<P>
   A small group including Ms. Huran has proposed new laws to
require that legislators disclose their total earnings and campaign
donations, and that records of government financial transactions be
made public.
</P>
<P>
   This year, just as Mongolia seemed to be turning the corner
economically, the country was battered by plummeting global prices
of copper and cashmere, its main sources of revenue and foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Between the economic woes and public impatience with the
government's performance, most politicians here predict that the
former Communists will regain power in the next general election in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mongolians _ an exceptionally literate and
well-informed people _ are dismayed by the stalemate. In the warmth
of his traditional tentlike dwelling, called a ger, Demberelmolom
expressed his exasperation by reciting a Mongolian saying: ``If the
people up high can't stand on their feet, the people down below
can't find a seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Demberelmolom and his wife tend monastery ruins in a mountain
valley south of Ulaan Baatar. Their theory about Zorig's murder?
``Maybe they were having trouble dividing up their pie.''

BRAZIL PICKING GOVERNORS IN VOTES VITAL TO ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Closing out elections that have held up
action to rescue the country's faltering economy, Brazilian voters
will elect governors in key states on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was elected
to a second term three weeks ago, are lagging in the states of
Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. The most
important race, for the governorship of Sao Paulo, is also the
closest and most bitter, pitting Mario Covas, who is running for
re-election, against Paulo Maluf, a former mayor of the city of Sao
Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Though Covas took the lead in recent opinion polls, with the
support of 45 percent of those polled against 41 percent for Maluf,
the margin of error was large enough to suggest that either could
win. Politically and economically, Sao Paulo's cooperation in
adhering to spending limits and supporting reforms is essential to
their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elections Sunday are very crucial,'' said Carlos Geraldo
Langoni, director of the world economic center at the Getulio
Vargas Foundation here and a former president of the Central Bank.
``This is a country that's still in political, not just economic,
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   With credit shrinking for emerging markets, Brazil has been
struggling to regain investor confidence, pulling together a $23
billion package of budget reductions and tax increases to convince
investors that it is serious about fiscal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   But the race is so important that despite the daily loss of
hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign reserves, the government
has delayed announcing the details of a fiscal adjustment package
promised for Oct. 20. And it is taking its time reaching a final
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Stanley Fischer, the deputy managing director of the
IMF, ended a two-day visit to Argentina and Brazil. He said that
the IMF would contribute $15 billion toward shoring up Brazil and
that the combined aid could be double that amount.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the IMF, talking with reporters outside while
Fischer met here Saturday with Pedro Malan, the Brazilian finance
minister, said an IMF mission would have to examine conditions in
Brazil, perhaps for as long as three weeks, before any agreement
would be made final. ``There is no other way to obtain a financing
agreement,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Harmon, president of the Eximbank, also visited Brazil as
the election neared, and left Saturday saying the bank might
increase its lending to Brazilian companies, which currently
receive some $3.8 billion in financing, by $2 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would propose the Eximbank resume lending to the
Brazilian government after a 10-year hiatus, though the government
is behind on some $240 million in payments since the early 1990s.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though Cardoso has used crises to galvanize support in the past,
getting the reforms through Congress will probably be a far more
demanding task in the coming term.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso has already been warned by Maluf, a populist who is
considered a sure contender for the presidency in four years, that
his party will vote against reforms. Though Maluf's party belongs
to Cardoso's governing coalition, Cardoso had endorsed Maluf's
opponent, breaking a pledge to abstain from backing any candidate
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maluf's already put the president on notice that they're
waiting for him around the corner in the Congress,'' said David
Fleischer, a political science professor at the Federal University
of Brasilia. ``Winning or losing, he's very upset that the
president broke his word on neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Covas has been known largely for balancing the
state's books, while Maluf's administration had been repeatedly
accused of corruption in delivering government services. In Sao
Paulo last week, the Covas campaign parked a giant papier-mache
chicken in a downtown square, reminding voters of a scandal during
Maluf's administration involving markups in the price of chicken
bought for school meals. His opponent called Maluf a ``fascist,'' a
``rat'' and a ``crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Maluf threw back curses. So revolting was his rival, he said,
that ``our Lady of Osasco'' struck down the platform on which Covas
was speaking, when it collapsed in the town of Osasco last week.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials were quick to point out, however, that there is
no such saint. Fernando Altemeyer Junior, a spokesman for the Sao
Paulo archdiocese, suggested that creating the saint was something
else the candidate could take credit for. Reciting the candidate's
slogan, he said, ``It was Maluf who did it.''

IN ELECTION, KAZAKHSTAN GETS A DOSE OF THE WEST

<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ In the past eight weeks, Akezhan
Kazhegeldin says, his press aide was attacked by masked men, a
weekly newspaper close to him was firebombed and he was shot at.
</P>
<P>
   If the intended message is that Kazhegeldin, 46, a businessman
and former prime minister, should drop out of next January's
presidential election, he is not listening.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he has bought a bulletproof vest, hired a battery of
Washington lawyers and plunged into an election race against
President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The former Communist boss, and
Kazhegeldin's erstwhile political patron, Nazarbayev has ruled here
for nine years and won every election with Soviet-style, 90
percent-plus votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them shoot if they can,'' said Kazhegeldin, a compact man
with a shock of black hair. ``This will not stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment he has received offers the latest lesson in the
autocratic politics of the Caspian Sea region. A jigsaw of nations
that have attracted attention in the United States and elsewhere
for their oil and natural gas reserves, the area has never been
especially democratic. Rigged votes are the norm, and transfers of
presidential power come in coups.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kazakhstan, Nazarbayev, who until recently had nurtured
an image abroad as a relative moderate, has moved to consolidate
his grip. His rubber-stamp parliament has lifted a two-term limit
that would have forced him to step down in 2005, effectively
freeing him to rule for life, which most foreign analysts believe
he wishes to do.
</P>
<P>
   The court system he controls has threatened Kazhegeldin with
disqualification from the Jan. 10 election under a law barring
elective office for anyone convicted even of a traffic offense. At
issue is $80 that Kazhegeldin was fined for meeting with a
political movement not registered with the government. He has
appealed. The president's much-energized KGB successor agency has
carried out a Soviet-style character attack against Kazhegeldin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rather worrying,'' said Adam Smith Albion, an American
expert on the region, adding, ``If this kind of thuggishness is
going to continue in Kazakhstan politics, it is reminiscent of how
the Soviets treated political figures they didn't like.'' Smith
Albion, a fellow of the Hanover, N.H.-based Institute of Current
World Affairs, was interviewed from Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   Kazhegeldin has certainly breathed life into the region's
one-dimensional politics. In place of the customary drab opposition
candidate, Kazakhstan is being treated to a well-spoken businessman
who has published a glossy book in English on his economic ideas,
and who jets around Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kazhegeldin made his fortune during the chaotic final years of
the Soviet Union. Sent to Moscow's KGB Academy to study
international business, he moonlighted in the black-market
scrap-metal trade, for which the spy agency expelled him in 1989.
He then got rich smuggling chemical fertilizer abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Nazarbayev appointed him prime minister.
Kazhegeldin began selling off decrepit former jewels of
Kazakhstan's industrial base _ oil fields, refineries and plants _
and stabilizing a new currency, the tenge.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also slowly accumulating an independent political
base. After three years in the job, he was forced out last October.
</P>
<P>
   He has since applied his fortune to toppling his old boss. Among
those on the Kazhegeldin payroll are two Washington law firms and
the public affairs specialists Hill &AMP; Knowlton.
</P>
<P>
   Among his supporters is Bigeldi Gabdullin, editor of The 21st
Century, a pro-Kazhegeldin weekly whose offices were firebombed
Sept. 26. ``Nazarbayev has only one goal _ to remain president,''
Gabdullin said. ``And he wants to get rid of those who are
interfering.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Certainly Kazhegeldin has annoyed someone. On Oct. 13, he says,
he was strolling after a horseback ride when two shots rang out. A
bodyguard grabbed him, and together they rolled to safety behind a
car.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, what diplomats call the official effort to muzzle
Kazhegeldin has been comic. One of his American lawyers, Charles
Both, was addressing reporters recently in a ballroom at Almaty's
top hotel when the manager charged in and declared the meeting was
``to be dispersed.'' When no one left, he turned off the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the nation's spy agency called a rare news conference. The
No. 2 spymaster, Alnoor Musaev, said that Kazhegeldin was lying
about the shooting incident and that no one had fired at him.
Furthermore, he said, the former prime minister ``doesn't have the
moral right to head our state,'' because he is being investigated
in Belgium on suspicion of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Kazhegeldin says there is no such case. In Brussels, the
district attorney's office said it could not comment.

AT SUMMIT MEETING, EUROPEAN LEADERS GREET ARAFAT AND HAIL PACT

   KLAGENFURT, Austria _ European leaders welcomed Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, at a lakeside summit meeting near this
Alpine border city Saturday and hailed the agreement he reached
with Israel at Wye Plantation under U.S. auspices Friday as a
triumph for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, in Palestinian headgear and an olive-drab uniform, was
welcomed as a last-minute guest at the start of a two-day meeting
on the future of the European Union. He flew into Vienna and then
here to brief leaders of the 15 European Union countries and thank
them for years of political and economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thanks are unending,'' he said at a news conference here
later, at which he also thanked Clinton. He said he had told
Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that they would be
``partners in peace'' together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very grateful to President Clinton, without whom we
probably would not have achieved what we achieved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said he had expressed gratitude to the European leaders
meeting in a resort hotel in Portschach for their political support
of the peace effort through recent months of difficult
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe, as you know, and in particular the European Union, can
be counted among the countries that assist the Palestinian people
the most,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not by chance that immediately after the signing
ceremony I came here directly.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union countries have contributed well over $1
billion to the Palestinians since the first peace accord with
Israel five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, said
Sunday, ``The patience of people and their determination to pull it
through has paid off, and it is clear that this has been a personal
triumph for President Clinton as well.''
</P>
<P>
   France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, expressed admiration
earlier for Arafat, Netanyahu and Clinton for reaching the latest
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   France's president, Jacques Chirac, has expressed support for an
eventual Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's defense minister-designate, Rudolf Scharping, said
here, ``Yesterday, we saw that under the leadership of the United
States there was achieved a fruitful and absolutely necessary
development for peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Europeans had some way to go before they would
have the kind of coordinated diplomatic, military and economic
leverage that enabled the United States to broker the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, visibly fatigued from his overnight trans-Atlantic
journey, said that future negotiations with Israel would deal with
refugees, Israeli settlements on the West Bank, the border between
Israeli and Palestinian-controlled territory, water rights and the
status of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al-Quds,'' he said, using an Arab term for Jerusalem's status
as a city holy to Islam, ``has top priority.''

 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a meeting at an Albany hotel recently, the Democratic nominee
for New York lieutenant governor was introduced as Sandra Feldman,
the longtime teachers' union leader. Never mind that the
candidate's name is Sandra Frankel and that the speaker was none
other than the chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frankel, a town supervisor from the Rochester area, had
suffered such indignities before; in an earlier party press release
she had been called Barbara. The gaffes were telling in a state
where the second-ranking job in government involves little more
than refereeing Senate debates and has become so marginalized that
New York's current lieutenant governor, Betsy McCaughey Ross,
hasn't had a substantive conversation with Gov. George Pataki in at
least three years.
</P>
<P>
   But their relationship is not typical. When it comes to
questions of how seriously one should view the backup quarterbacks
in the nation's state capitals, the answers often depend on the
particular stadiums in which they are warming the bench. In some
states, the No. 2 person actually has clout, and campaigns for the
job are serious matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, for example, where the lieutenant governor has broad
authority to shape the legislative agenda, this year's race has
been tough and personal. Ads for the Republican candidate, Mitch
Skandalakis, imply that his Democratic opponent, Mark Taylor, has
resumed a prior, admitted cocaine problem. Taylor responded with a
lawsuit accusing his opponent of slander.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where Gov. George W. Bush is expected to win
re-election next month, attention has shifted to the lieutenant
governor's race, in part because the winner would succeed Bush if
he were to win the presidency in 2000. Texas is among 18 states in
which voters can choose a governor and lieutenant governor of
different parties, and often do. To head off such a situation,
Bush's famous father has made a TV commercial on behalf of the
Republican who would be his son's understudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is what you make it,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political analyst at Claremont Graduate University in California,
who was speaking of her home state but could have easily been
citing many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nelson Rockefeller referred to the vice presidency as `standby
equipment,''' she added. ``If you are the lieutenant governor and
your governor is not of the same party, you're not even perceived
as standby equipment. You're out there in orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   California Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has been in such an
orbit for four years. Whenever Republican Gov. Pete Wilson leaves
the state, Davis' office floods reporters' fax machines with press
releases that begin, ``Acting Governor and gubernatorial candidate
Gray Davis. . . .'' Davis is now running to succeed Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   But that pales in comparison to the friction two decades ago
between former Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and Mike Curb, his
Republican lieutenant. Once, Ms. Bebitch Jeffe recalled, Brown
raced to get a flight back to California because Curb was trying to
capitalize on the governor's absence by appointing a conservative
judge whom Brown opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Some view the lieutenant's job as a steppingstone. After a
16-year career as Georgia's lieutenant governor, Zell Miller was
elected governor in 1990. Bob Finch, the first lieutenant governor
in California under Ronald Reagan, was appointed secretary of
health, education and welfare by President Richard M. Nixon. And
Mario Cuomo, elected New York's lieutenant governor in 1978, was
elected governor in the next three elections.
</P>
<P>
   But others have gone the route of Malcolm Wilson, who waited in
the wings behind Rockefeller for 15 years and became governor in
1973, when Rockefeller chose to step down before the end of his
term. Wilson was defeated the next year by Hugh Carey. Still,
Wilson was governor long enough to leave a legacy, of sorts: The
Tappan Zee Bridge was renamed the Gov. Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee
Bridge in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his successors in the No. 2 spot have found fame more
fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Having found little to occupy his time during the Cuomo
administration, Alfred DelBello resigned the lieutenant governor's
post in 1985 to take a position with a waste management firm in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Mary Anne Krupsak, Carey's lieutenant. She
failed to unseat him in the 1978 Democratic primary and never again
held elected office. She now runs a chamber of commerce for the
counties in the Finger Lakes area and is the co-owner of Pasta
Only's, a restaurant in Geneva, N.Y.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a meeting at an Albany hotel recently, the Democratic nominee
for New York lieutenant governor was introduced as Sandra Feldman,
the longtime teachers' union leader. Never mind that the
candidate's name is Sandra Frankel and that the speaker was none
other than the chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frankel, a town supervisor from the Rochester area, had
suffered such indignities before; in an earlier party press release
she had been called Barbara. The gaffes were telling in a state
where the second-ranking job in government involves little more
than refereeing Senate debates and has become so marginalized that
New York's current lieutenant governor, Betsy McCaughey Ross,
hasn't had a substantive conversation with Gov. George Pataki in at
least three years.
</P>
<P>
   But their relationship is not typical. When it comes to
questions of how seriously one should view the backup quarterbacks
in the nation's state capitals, the answers often depend on the
particular stadiums in which they are warming the bench. In some
states, the No. 2 person actually has clout, and campaigns for the
job are serious matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, for example, where the lieutenant governor has broad
authority to shape the legislative agenda, this year's race has
been tough and personal. Ads for the Republican candidate, Mitch
Skandalakis, imply that his Democratic opponent, Mark Taylor, has
resumed a prior, admitted cocaine problem. Taylor responded with a
lawsuit accusing his opponent of slander.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where Gov. George W. Bush is expected to win
re-election next month, attention has shifted to the lieutenant
governor's race, in part because the winner would succeed Bush if
he were to win the presidency in 2000. Texas is among 18 states in
which voters can choose a governor and lieutenant governor of
different parties, and often do. To head off such a situation,
Bush's famous father has made a TV commercial on behalf of the
Republican who would be his son's understudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is what you make it,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political analyst at Claremont Graduate University in California,
who was speaking of her home state but could have easily been
citing many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nelson Rockefeller referred to the vice presidency as `standby
equipment,''' she added. ``If you are the lieutenant governor and
your governor is not of the same party, you're not even perceived
as standby equipment. You're out there in orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   California Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has been in such an
orbit for four years. Whenever Republican Gov. Pete Wilson leaves
the state, Davis' office floods reporters' fax machines with press
releases that begin, ``Acting Governor and gubernatorial candidate
Gray Davis. . . .'' Davis is now running to succeed Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   But that pales in comparison to the friction two decades ago
between former Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and Mike Curb, his
Republican lieutenant. Once, Ms. Bebitch Jeffe recalled, Brown
raced to get a flight back to California because Curb was trying to
capitalize on the governor's absence by appointing a conservative
judge whom Brown opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Some view the lieutenant's job as a steppingstone. After a
16-year career as Georgia's lieutenant governor, Zell Miller was
elected governor in 1990. Bob Finch, the first lieutenant governor
in California under Ronald Reagan, was appointed secretary of
health, education and welfare by President Richard M. Nixon. And
Mario Cuomo, elected New York's lieutenant governor in 1978, was
elected governor in the next three elections.
</P>
<P>
   But others have gone the route of Malcolm Wilson, who waited in
the wings behind Rockefeller for 15 years and became governor in
1973, when Rockefeller chose to step down before the end of his
term. Wilson was defeated the next year by Hugh Carey. Still,
Wilson was governor long enough to leave a legacy, of sorts: The
Tappan Zee Bridge was renamed the Gov. Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee
Bridge in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his successors in the No. 2 spot have found fame more
fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Having found little to occupy his time during the Cuomo
administration, Alfred DelBello resigned the lieutenant governor's
post in 1985 to take a position with a waste management firm in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Mary Anne Krupsak, Carey's lieutenant. She
failed to unseat him in the 1978 Democratic primary and never again
held elected office. She now runs a chamber of commerce for the
counties in the Finger Lakes area and is the co-owner of Pasta
Only's, a restaurant in Geneva, N.Y.

IN ARGENTINA, RUMORS ABOUND FOLLOWING SUSPICIOUS DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ The brother of a former aide to
President Carlos Saul Menem was found hanging from a rope early
this month with a newspaper clipping about a bribery scandal
involving the government and IBM stuffed in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   A retired navy captain was found dead late in August with a
bullet through his head, four days after he was questioned about
illegal sales of Argentine government weapons to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Menem publicly called for the reopening of an
investigation into whether his son, thought to have been killed in
a helicopter accident three years ago, may actually have been
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   It might all be grist for a Jorge Luis Borges thriller in a
society that has long been fascinated by intrigue and whose
bookstores are full of accounts of how many times Evita Peron's
body has disappeared and been exhumed.
</P>
<P>
   But even by Argentine standards, the country has been treated to
a barrage of recent news coverage about suspicious deaths. Though
on the surface the deaths do not seem to be linked in any way, and
may simply be a series of macabre coincidences, the news reports
have spawned vague suggestions in the last several weeks that
organized crime or the Menem government itself is involved and
blocking the cause of justice.
</P>
<P>
   These latest skeptical reports come on top of a dozen deaths of
potential witnesses over the past three years in cases involving
customs fraud, arms smuggling and a number of other government
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   The recent deaths of the former presidential aide's brother and
the navy captain were officially attributed to suicide. The list of
the other dead include a general and another army officer who were
killed in a helicopter crash, two other government and military
employees who died in reported criminal assaults, and several more
people who reportedly succumbed to heart attacks and brain
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of those witnesses who survive, who will dare to talk?'' asked
a headline on the cover of the Oct. 8 issue of Veintiuno, an
influential weekly political magazine. Emblazoned with a picture of
a noose, the headline continued, ``Let the next in line come
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent front page headline about the death of the retired
navy officer, Clarin, Argentina's leading circulation newspaper,
asked, ``Was the death of the navy man a message?''
</P>
<P>
   Menem reacted angrily to the speculation early this month,
saying, ``Those stupid people who want to blame the government are
totally wrong.'' But prosecutors, the press and opposition figures
continue to express bewildered concern about this string of fatal
misfortunes that has befallen people in high places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm confused about this like everyone else,'' said
Carlos Escude, a political scientist at Di Tella University in
Buenos Aires. ``In a transition to democracy, unfortunately, you
usually have an increase in crime and mafia-like procedures.''
Trying to find a silver lining to the deadly mysteries, he added,
``With widespread media coverage, it's harder to get away with
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the confusion, take the case of Marcelo
Cattaneo, the younger brother of Menem's former deputy chief of
staff. Prosecutors say they believe he committed suicide three
weeks ago, but even they concede that they cannot be absolutely
certain.
</P>
<P>
   Cattaneo had been missing for three days when he was found by a
fisherman on Oct. 4, hanging by the neck beside a homeless man's
shed outside Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper article stuffed in his mouth referred to the
investigation by an Argentine federal judge into allegations that
IBM, the American computer company, gave government officials up to
$21 million in 1994 and 1995 to win a contract with the state-owned
Banco de la Nacion. IBM officials in the United States have
repeatedly denied any involvement, saying local executives who have
since left the company were acting on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the months before his death, two former directors of Banco de
la Nacion named Cattaneo as the man who offered to bribe them with
money from two shell companies that had separate contracts with the
local IBM subsidiary. Cattaneo was an executive in the two
companies along with his brother, Juan Carlos, who was forced to
resign three years ago as Menem's deputy chief of staff as the
scandal unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Cattaneo has charged that the bribes paid by IBM
were somehow destined for the current presidential campaign of
Domingo Cavallo, a former economy minister in the Menem government
who now serves in the Senate, although he offered no proof. Cavallo
has denied the charge, and accused Menem's current chief of staff,
Alberto Kohan, of being behind the bribery scheme.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kohan denied any involvement in the IBM
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are media and legislators who say things when they have
no proof, people like Cavallo,'' Kohan said. ``There is no mafia in
Argentina, absolutely not. I've not seen any proof of it, and it's
hard to disprove a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls published in the Buenos Aires press indicate that
fewer than 10 percent of the population believe that Cattaneo died
by suicide, even though forensic tests found no signs of violence.
Skepticism in the news media was fueled by reports that police had
failed to seal off the crime scene for more than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the local media have repeatedly compared Cattaneo's
death to the apparent suicide in May of Alfredo Yabran, a
millionaire businessman who had close ties to the military juntas
that ruled the country in the 1970s and 1980s and who had benefited
from several privatizations of companies in the early 1990s. Yabran
reportedly shot himself at his ranch as police prepared to arrest
him in connection with the killing of an Argentine magazine
photographer, but a government investigation into his death
continues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another scandal that has seized the attention of the country
involves illegal shipments of Argentine weapons to Ecuador and
Croatia between 1991 and 1995. The arms scandal had been simmering
for years and two years ago led Oscar Camilion to step down as
defense minister when he was implicated in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   But it jumped back on the front pages after the death of the
retired navy captain, Horacio Estrada, on Aug. 25, four days after
prosecutors began questioning him about arms sales to Ecuador. The
Argentine media raised the question of why Estrada was found with
an entry wound on the left side of his head when he was
right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after his death, the local press reported that
prosecutors had learned that the arms shipments to Ecuador and
Croatia followed the signing of four secret presidential decrees by
Menem. The decrees assigned the arms sales to Panama and Bolivia,
and government officials have blamed international arms dealers for
diverting the shipments without authorization.
</P>
<P>
   A former senior manager of the state arms factory was indicted
and a second was arrested in the last week on charges of smuggling
gunpowder to Croatia in the early 1990s, falsifying official
documents and breaking a U.N. arms embargo in place at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they are investigating the role of former
Defense Minister Antonio Erman Gonzalez, who is now labor minister,
and Gen. Martin Balza, the army commander. Both have said they knew
nothing of the clandestine shipments, but are expected to testify
in court.
</P>
<P>
   The American Embassy here has denied that the United States knew
Argentina was breaking the U.N. embargo, responding to Argentine
news reports suggesting that the shipments were condoned by the
Clinton administration to help stop Serbian aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the deaths, the one that has received the most
speculation is that of Menem's son, Carlos Jr., three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses said he and a friend were operating the
helicopter recklessly, dipping wildly at low altitudes, before the
crash. But Menem's former wife, Zulema Yoma, has long expressed
skepticism that the crash was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   After a judge closed his investigation last week, Ms. Yoma gave
a radio interview, saying her former husband ``knew from the
beginning it was a hit.'' Adding to suspicions, she said of Menem,
``He has to face up to what point the mafia will not allow him to
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Put on the defensive by her remarks, Menem for the first time
suggested publicly that maybe his son was murdered and called for
the investigation to be reopened. ``A mother's concerns are
understandable,'' he said.

KOREAS TO FORM TWO GROUPS TO WORK OUT PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The United States, China and the two Koreas agreed
Saturday to create two working parties to explore a peace treaty
and to examine confidence-building measures on the peninsula, home
to the most heavily defended border in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding four days of talks here, the four countries also
agreed to hold a fourth round of discussions in Geneva next
January. The working groups will not begin work before then,
according to a statement that described the closed-door discussions
as ``useful and constructive'' and ``conducted in a businesslike
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after the talks had earlier hit an apparent
snag when the official news agency of the Stalinist government in
North Korea issued a statement last week criticizing the timing of
U.S. military exercises with South Korea. Those maneuvers, routine
since 1961, are scheduled to begin Oct. 26, the day after talks
here are set to end.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third round of such talks over the last few years.
The last time the four parties met, in March, the talks collapsed
over North Korea's insistence that the United States withdraw its
troops from the border dividing the peninsula, a demand that has
repeatedly been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, leaving North and
South Korea technically in a state of war. For 45 years the border
has remained a potential flash point, guarded by 37,000 U.S.
soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Korean troops on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and South Korea have indicated a willingness
to discuss troop withdrawal, but officials say South Korea objects
to the demand being on the talks' formal agenda.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also has sought a separate peace treaty with the
United States, but the Clinton administration has maintained that
any such treaty must be signed between the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly the demands on all sides appear unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The chief U.S. negotiator, Charles Kartman, sounded cautiously
optimistic when the talks opened, although on Friday evening he
stressed that there was no agreement yet. ``We've made quite a bit
of progress in narrowing the differences, but the North Korean
position remains quite firm,'' he said, emerging from the first day
of talks on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of the talks here was part of a deal between the
United States and North Korea in a negotiation held in New York
last month that centered on North Korea's missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Those discussions took on added urgency after North Korea's
launching on Aug. 31 of what officials now believe was a staged
rocket in a failed attempt to lift a satellite into orbit. The
rocket flew over Japan and landed in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, new concerns have emerged over North Korea's
nuclear program, with reports that North Korea has constructed an
enormous underground complex.

EUROPE'S LARGEST MALL HAS LEIPZIG'S MERCHANTS WORRIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story, eliminated earlier in the week, is now
restored.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEIPZIG, Germany _ The immense railway terminal in this eastern
German city, erected in the heady years before World War I and
faithfully restored after the destruction of World War II, stands
like a temple to modern transport and commerce. But store owners in
narrow downtown lanes are praying that it will not mean the end of
their trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year marked the completion of a two-year, $230 million
overhaul of Europe's largest rail terminus into Europe's largest
shopping mall. Turning train stations into shopping centers is in
vogue, and now in Leipzig 140 stores and a dozen or so restaurants
line three levels of the station's 845-foot-long main concourse.
</P>
<P>
   So impressive is the finished product, with glass-enclosed
elevators and escalators buzzing shoppers from one level to the
next, that the head of France's national railways, Louis Gallois,
said during a visit that it impressed him, ``like a church, like a
cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   But such hyperbole is little edification for people like
Eva-Maria Bachmann, who runs a quaint book shop in the 16th-century
Old Town Hall, on Market Square, a 10-minute walk from the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the available buying power is not getting
bigger,'' she said. ``Roll the dough ever thinner, and at some
point it tears.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, she said, the new stores have benefited from
federal laws that permit shops in train stations to stay open later
and to open on Sundays for ``travelers' supplies,'' while ordinary
stores must close.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Saxony, taking advantage of the government's
indulgence toward the economically lagging eastern states, has
chosen to interpret the law unusually generously in the case of the
Leipzig station, which is under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Such tensions are familiar to Americans who have often seen the
arrival of a Wal-Mart cripple Main Street merchants. But in
Leipzig, population 430,000, in the heart of eastern Germany, they
assume a special quality. With the region's manufacturing wiped out
by the transformation of old East Germany's economy, unemployment
is 15 percent, said Angelika Rusch-Ziegner, a city government
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   That may be modest in eastern Germany, where some regions suffer
double that level, but the only hope for creating new work in
Leipzig lies ``in the service industries, in banking, and above all
in retail trade,'' said Ms. Rusch-Ziegner, who supported the
station development.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal project is not the Leipzig area's first push into
shopping malls. After the collapse of communism in 1989, efforts to
restore the heart of the city were hampered by property disputes.
Much downtown property in Leipzig, a major prewar publishing
center, was owned by Jewish families who perished in the Holocaust,
and tracing heirs has been time consuming. That and the low cost of
farmland outside the city led large western German department store
chains to throw up shopping centers in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the train station developers, led by the Deutsche Bank,
Germany's largest bank, contend that they have reversed that trend
by creating the first major shopping center downtown. They have
created 800 new jobs, they say, and the rising tide of shoppers
should help shopkeepers all across the city's center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view ourselves as a magnet for the downtown area,'' said
Michael Mehnert, a spokesman for the developers. ``If the old city
is strong, we're strong, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   WMF, a manufacturer of cutlery and household utensils, appears
to agree. Despite two stores in Leipzig, it opened a third at the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``People not only browse, they buy, too,'' said Liane Zunft, the
store manager.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the train station has its magnetism. On an average
day, 100,000 people pass through, including 30,000 railway
passengers. Annual sales in the stores are projected to be more
than $5,000 per square yard, one-third more than in shopping
centers on the edge of Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a success, and we wouldn't have thought it,'' said Inis
Scheithauer, a shopper from the outskirts of Leipzig, as she sipped
soda with her husband and son at Ovidio's, an ice cream parlor.
When relatives visited recently from Hanover, in western Germany,
the one thing they wanted to see was the train station. From the
station, she often goes downtown for more shopping, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Sparschuh, who follows retail trade at Leipzig's Chamber of
Commerce, said inner-city retailers are now divided between those
who believe that the train station attracts shoppers like Mrs.
Scheithauer, who then go on to visit the downtown stores, and
others, notably big inner-city department stores, who say they are
hurting.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber is supporting a lawsuit, now pending before a court,
to test the legality of the station's late closing hours as
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot allow unfair conditions,'' she said.

COMMENTARY: GIULIANI LOVES A PARADE, IF IT'S HIS KIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The gridlock reports on the car radio sounded dire
Friday morning as the city prepared to heap praise and confetti on
the Yankees. The Brooklyn Bridge was closed down for a while; the
Manhattan Bridge was clogged, and traffic was backed up. Forget
about the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes where fans were
packed in, including children whose hooky party was winked at by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani when he said he learned as much playing
baseball as he did in school.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, it was an easy ride to points north. It took 20
traffic-free minutes to drive from midtown to the Bronx home of
Ramon and Iris Baez. Sports taught them a lot about life, too.
Their son, Anthony, was tossing a football outside their house in
December 1994 when it struck the patrol car of Police Officer
Francis Livoti. In the ensuing dispute, Livoti used an illegal
choke hold that killed Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   After a state trial that found him not guilty, ex-Officer Livoti
was convicted of civil rights violations in a federal court and
sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. The city also
settled the Baez family's wrongful-death lawsuit for nearly $3
million. The whole ordeal was enough to make the Baezes advocates
for other families like themselves. That's why they helped the
October 22 Coalition organize Thursday night's march and rally
against police brutality that went from Union Square Park to City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   They are still learning about life through sports. While the
mayor had no problem with Yankee gridlock, city officials cited
traffic concerns when they denied the coalition a permit to march
down one lane of Broadway. A federal court ruled for the rally's
organizers. As usual, the city appealed. As is quite usual, the
city lost. In the end, 1,000 people went to the rally, which was
peaceful, with limited traffic delays.
</P>
<P>
   Want a Yankee parade? No problem. Want to put signs outside
courthouses to mark legal victories for the poor and dispossessed?
Problem.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how police shut down Amsterdam Avenue to let
hundreds of Yankee fans spontaneously celebrate Wednesday night,
one wonders if what's really being blocked are the First Amendment
rights of the mayor's critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything against the mayor, he says no,'' Mrs. Baez said. ``He
has gotten to the point where he thinks he can rule everybody. Even
some people in City Hall complain it's being run like the military.
There's no freedom of speech and everybody is walking around on
eggshells. Don't crack the eggs and everything goes smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Baez has copies of Parks Department permits that allowed
the coalition to use city parks for the rally. She thought the
police permit to march in the street would be a cinch. It was not.
In fact, city officials waited weeks before informing the group
that their request was denied and that marchers would have to stay
on the sidewalks. A federal judge called that delay
``unconscionable,'' and suggested that the city's only motive was
to squelch unpopular speech. Without any apparent irony, the mayor
lambasted the ``imperial federal court'' and judges who ``think
they were put here by God.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't the commoners know that only mayors rule by divine right?
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wants something, that's what he wants,'' Mrs. Baez
said. ``It's disturbing. `Something I don't want can't go forward.
Something I didn't set up can't proceed.' It's always `I,' and the
`I' is what's going to bring him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's against lauding the Yankees. She only wants to
put it all in perspective. ``The Yankees are good for the city,''
she said. ``They erase the bad. But tomorrow, we have to come back
to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baezes have established a foundation to help other families.
They make speeches and hand out fliers encouraging others to come
forward and report any complaints they have about police abuses.
They get about a call a day from people seeking advice. They say
they'll continue to take to the street, peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be the voice of the dead,'' Mrs. Baez said. ``All
we can do is march and raise our voices.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is one street they go to just for fun and without a
permit. It's the one outside their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids love to play football,'' Baez said. ``They love the
game. They're never going to stop playing. Our street. And if we
have to block it, we'll block it.''

HALF-BROTHER OF IRAQI LEADER DENIES TALK OF DEFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Despite rumblings that he is on the verge of
defecting, the half-brother of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq,
Barzan el-Takriti, who is an envoy in Geneva, has sidestepped the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Takriti, the former head of Iraqi intelligence who has spent
nearly a decade as delegate to the U.N's Geneva headquarters,
became the focus of speculation when his name surfaced in a routine
recall of Iraqi diplomats in July.
</P>
<P>
   Takriti is no ordinary envoy, however. His duties have far
transcended normal diplomatic functions. He has dabbled in the
world of clandestine missions and managed some of the billions Iraq
has stashed away.
</P>
<P>
   The other recalled diplomats are gone, and Takriti has been
replaced in his U.N. position. He has said he plans to return to
Iraq, but not immediately.
</P>
<P>
   There were hints from associates that he might seek to become a
``guest'' in an Arab country, Morocco or the United Arab Emirates,
thus neither breaking with Iraq nor defecting to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent defection in the Iraqi ruling family was the
flight to Jordan of two of Saddam's sons-in-law and their families
in 1995. They fled with secret documents on Iraq's weapons programs
and millions of dollars. Upon their return six months later, they
were assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   From Takriti's point of view, there are reasons to stay away,
among them his wife's chemotherapy in the United States and
Switzerland for cancer. And he has had a falling out with Saddam's
powerful son, Uday. Takriti has criticized the president's favored
son openly in interviews. Uday Hussein, who directed the
assassination of the sons-in-law barely two days after they came
home, was briefly married to Takriti's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Takriti has called for greater openness and less
family rule in Iraq, suggestions that did not sit well with Saddam
or the cousins and nephews who occupy all important positions in
the ruling hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity, say
recent events are setting the scene for another palace intrigue in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Takriti said in an interview in the Saudi daily Asharq Al Awsat,
published on Oct. 12, that he had no reason to defect, but stopped
short of saying he was going directly home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am returning to Baghdad, and yes I am staying here
because of my special circumstances,'' he told the Arabic
newspaper, which is based in London. ``No, I am not quitting
politics, and I am not seeking asylum elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would have ``preferred'' to put off his return to
Baghdad for another year until his wife completed her treatment,
but pointedly said he did not contact Saddam about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother has not interfered because he is a president, and
it is not his habit to interfere in favor of anyone, no matter how
close to him, unless he is persuaded that such an interference
would lift an injustice and is in the interest of the state,''
Takriti told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The recall was ``just a matter of an ambassador whose time of
service in one place has ended and who must move to another spot,''
he said. ``It is not an issue that merits all this attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable Iraqi officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, asserted that Takriti would not defect, particularly
since the last defection drew no honorable offers of asylum in the
West. Saddam has not pushed harder to get him home for fear of
provoking a defection, Iraqi affairs experts say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Swiss capital, Bern, Vera Britsch, speaking for the
Federal Office for Refugees, said no request for asylum had been
received from Takriti, which means that he will have to leave the
country by the end of November. In the last two months, he has
moved out of his plush quarters and is said to be living in a house
he bought near Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of Takriti's who spoke on condition of anonymity
said last week that the former special envoy was ``bargaining''
over the conditions of his return, seeking some iron-clad
assurances that he will remain a special envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Takriti said in the Oct. 12 article: ``Who said that this role
is not ongoing? Who said the president does not assign such
missions or that I am not in fact doing this at the moment.''

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ An odd thing happened last week: A former
Communist became prime minister of Italy for the first time in
history, yet the Italian lira didn't drop in value amid fears of
left-wing economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly benign reaction stems in part from the reality of
Italian politics; the new government under Massimo D'Alema is a
hodgepodge of people from across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a telling sign about the peculiar condition of
Europe on the eve of its greatest experiment in the postwar era.
Just 10 weeks before 11 European countries adopt the euro as a
common currency Jan. 1, eventually replacing marks, francs and
lira, Europe has suddenly become the world's bastion of economic
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being alarmed about the changes and uncertainties
ahead, traders have seized upon European currencies _ including the
lira _ as their preferred safe haven from the turmoil rocking Asia,
Russia and now even the United States. European currencies have
soared about 10 percent against the dollar since August.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, that is testimony to Europe's soundness. But in
practice it is creating a baptism of fire for the euro and its
overseer, the new European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear last week. The debate now raging across the
continent is whether the euro will be a bit too credible and too
strong, meaning that European goods will become too expensive for
customers with other currencies. Precisely when the new central
bank is most preoccupied with proving its political independence,
politicians across Europe are badgering it for a weaker euro and
lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing and investment.
</P>
<P>
   The chorus got substantially louder last week, after the
European Commission reduced its prediction for economic growth next
year from 3.2 to 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where the Social Democrats defeated Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in elections last month, the incoming chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder, and his finance minister stepped up calls for
lower interest rates and even suggested a return to some form of
fixed exchange rates in world markets. In France, Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, made similar calls. And at the European
Commission, officials are talking about softening the tough fiscal
requirements that it set to bring the economies of the 11 countries
in line with each other and thus insure the euro's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's new central bankers are getting even more pressure from
the United States. With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates
in a sign of its own anxiety about the economy, the European
Central Bank is suddenly the odd man out as the world's most
hawkish supporter of hard money.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all this is a more basic question about Europe's
condition. Even though economists have recently begun slashing
growth projections for next year, most still predict that Europe
under the euro _ thanks in part to trade efficiencies produced by
the use of one currency rather than many _ will grow faster than
the United States for the first time in many years.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rest of the world looks bleaker and bleaker, the
question boils down to this: Is Europe an ``island of stability,''
as many European leaders have argued? Or is it just the last domino
to fall in a worldwide slump? Naturally, there aren't many clear
signs. But there are trends worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most positive and least appreciated change is the
dramatic improvement in the competitiveness of European
manufacturing. Here in Germany, makers of cars and machinery have
learned to produce far more with far fewer people. They have also
redesigned their products, rethought the way they do business and
cut innovative deals with labor unions to win more flexibility in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Other developments are less encouraging. With the exception of
countries like the Netherlands, continental Europe continues to be
weighed down by high taxes, costly social programs and very high
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there are clear signs of what might be called
``reform fatigue.'' Having endured years of budget cuts to satisfy
fiscal requirements for the euro, voters have ushered in
left-leaning governments inclined to shore up social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who campaigned as a ``new'' and vaguely pro-business
Social Democrat, has infuriated German industry by charting a
return to left-wing priorities. His new coalition, which includes
the environmentalist Green Party for the first time, has pledged to
reverse the few labor reforms Kohl succeeded in pushing through.
More important, it has drafted a tax plan with little reduction in
the overall tax burden _ which consumes about half of Germany's
total output _ and shifts much of it to business. It has also given
tacit support to big wage demands by Germany's giant metalworking
union.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Italy's centrist government under Romano Prodi
was an even more vivid sign of reform fatigue. Prodi lost his
parliamentary majority after the Reformed Communist Party rebelled
over his plans for a budget cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists tried the same thing last year, but they failed
because Italians wanted to reduce their budget deficit enough to
qualify for the euro. But all that changed last May, when Italy
made the grade and the pressure for austerity eased.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, why are the currency markets so sanguine? The
answer is that politicians do not control the new central bank. And
the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands, is almost
typecast for the role of the gruff banker who doesn't let
politicians push him around.
</P>
<P>
   A big man with piercing blue eyes and a shock of white hair,
Duisenberg has thus far refused to budge on his policies and has
perfected a curmudgeonly scowl that projects wonderfully over
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Central Bank already has credibility in financial
markets, and you can see that from what has been happening,'' said
Bernhard Speyer, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank Research. But
the task ahead is not easy: a bit too tough and Duisenberg could
precipitate a real decline in Europe; a bit too easy and the euro's
strength could be undermined for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we face in 8 to 10 weeks from now is a major regime
shift, and in a situation like that there are always things that
can go wrong,'' said Speyer. ``You don't want to take any
chances.''

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ An odd thing happened last week: A former
Communist became prime minister of Italy for the first time in
history, yet the Italian lira didn't drop in value amid fears of
left-wing economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly benign reaction stems in part from the reality of
Italian politics; the new government under Massimo D'Alema is a
hodgepodge of people from across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a telling sign about the peculiar condition of
Europe on the eve of its greatest experiment in the postwar era.
Just 10 weeks before 11 European countries adopt the euro as a
common currency Jan. 1, eventually replacing marks, francs and
lira, Europe has suddenly become the world's bastion of economic
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being alarmed about the changes and uncertainties
ahead, traders have seized upon European currencies _ including the
lira _ as their preferred safe haven from the turmoil rocking Asia,
Russia and now even the United States. European currencies have
soared about 10 percent against the dollar since August.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, that is testimony to Europe's soundness. But in
practice it is creating a baptism of fire for the euro and its
overseer, the new European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear last week. The debate now raging across the
continent is whether the euro will be a bit too credible and too
strong, meaning that European goods will become too expensive for
customers with other currencies. Precisely when the new central
bank is most preoccupied with proving its political independence,
politicians across Europe are badgering it for a weaker euro and
lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing and investment.
</P>
<P>
   The chorus got substantially louder last week, after the
European Commission reduced its prediction for economic growth next
year from 3.2 to 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where the Social Democrats defeated Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in elections last month, the incoming chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder, and his finance minister stepped up calls for
lower interest rates and even suggested a return to some form of
fixed exchange rates in world markets. In France, Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, made similar calls. And at the European
Commission, officials are talking about softening the tough fiscal
requirements that it set to bring the economies of the 11 countries
in line with each other and thus insure the euro's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's new central bankers are getting even more pressure from
the United States. With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates
in a sign of its own anxiety about the economy, the European
Central Bank is suddenly the odd man out as the world's most
hawkish supporter of hard money.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all this is a more basic question about Europe's
condition. Even though economists have recently begun slashing
growth projections for next year, most still predict that Europe
under the euro _ thanks in part to trade efficiencies produced by
the use of one currency rather than many _ will grow faster than
the United States for the first time in many years.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rest of the world looks bleaker and bleaker, the
question boils down to this: Is Europe an ``island of stability,''
as many European leaders have argued? Or is it just the last domino
to fall in a worldwide slump? Naturally, there aren't many clear
signs. But there are trends worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most positive and least appreciated change is the
dramatic improvement in the competitiveness of European
manufacturing. Here in Germany, makers of cars and machinery have
learned to produce far more with far fewer people. They have also
redesigned their products, rethought the way they do business and
cut innovative deals with labor unions to win more flexibility in
the workplace.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a tale of two news conferences on the same day last week
concerning the same organization, the United Nations Population
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   At one, in Washington, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., complained
that the House Republican leadership had erased the Clinton
administration's $20 million budget request for the fund. To the
two television news crews and the few reporters who bothered to
attend, it was just another briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The other news conference, 200 miles away at U.N. headquarters
in New York City, played to a standing-room-only audience that will
not soon forget the scene. The main attraction was someone not
known for making policy pronouncements: Geri Halliwell, revered by
screaming teen-age fans as Ginger Spice. She had walked away from
the hugely popular singing group, the Spice Girls, several months
ago. The population fund hit the publicity jackpot by naming her a
``goodwill ambassador,'' for two television news services beamed
the news conference around the world live.
</P>
<P>
   In the television-oriented 1990s, policy wonks are using
celebrities to get their messages across. Maybe it is inevitable
that groups like the population fund, which provides contraception
and counseling, would turn to entertainers and athletes to reach a
wider audience than do the policy-makers who inhabit Sunday-morning
interview shows. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has his own ``messengers for peace'' _ Magic Johnson,
Muhammad Ali, Elie Wiesel and Michael Douglas, who said last summer
that ``this probably means as much to me as any of the two Oscars
that I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary-General Gillian Sorenson said the idea was
to keep from ``preaching to the converted.'' ``This gets us new
audiences, including especially young people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halliwell joined a roster that includes the media-and-sports
tycoon Ted Turner and his wife, the actress Jane Fonda; the
Japanese actress Keiko Kishi, and the Finnish rock star Mikko
Kuustonen. Yes, Mikko Kuustonen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never heard of him,'' said Corrie Shanahan, a
spokeswoman for the population fund, ``but he's huge in Finland,
huge. We look at donor countries where we want to raise awareness
and we choose someone who's big and popular and has the right
image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The right image,'' she added, ``is someone who's passionate
and sincere about why they care about this.''
</P>
<P>
   But who may not talk in diplomatic language. Consider Ms.
Halliwell. ``I am famous,'' she said. ``And I am damn well going to
use my fame positively. If I save one person's life just by
awareness, I'm going to damn well do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't the United Nations the kind of place where never is heard
a provocative word? ``She's not in the U.N.,'' Ms. Shanahan said.
``This is why we have ambassadors. Geri Halliwell can reach and
influence young women in a way we can't, we being the people behind
the desks here. We don't have their attention, and that's it: She
has their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But the U.N. bureaucracy may have found her less than
mesmerizing. The news service Agence France-Presse quoted one
official it did not identify as saying that Ms. Halliwell was ``not
up to'' the job of promoting family planning issues.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using celebrities to promote causes is hardly new.
``Unicef started it,'' said Ms. Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   A generation after Danny Kaye promoted the U.N. Children's Fund,
Diana, Princess of Wales, made land mines a post-divorce crusade.
And Linda McCartney, who became famous because she married a famous
man, tackled animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jay Leno's wife is following suit. Last week Mavis Leno
announced a $100,000 donation to the Feminist Majority Foundation,
a nonprofit group trying to rally opposition to what it calls the
Taliban's ``inhumane oppression of women'' in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I tell you? You probably know more than I do,'' Mrs.
Leno said in a conversation last week. ``What I'm bringing to the
issue is the visibility bestowed on me by the fact that I'm married
to Jay.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week was also a busy one for the four singers who have
carried on as Spice Girls since Ms. Halliwell abandoned them. They
sent a letter to President Nelson Mandela of South Africa that was
publicized by an animal-rights group, People for Ethical Treatment
of Animals. They asked Mandela to rescue 30 baby elephants they
said had been ``ripped from their families in Botswana and taken to
a warehouse near Pretoria.'' Animal-rights advocates say the
elephants have been beaten and starved to become ``zoo friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which left Ms. Maloney's press secretary, Terese
Schlachter, sighing. ``Maybe,'' she said, talking of how to
increase attendance at her boss' next news conference, ``we should
make her Congressional Spice.''

<P>
   JENNINGS, La. _ The plant was opened in 1977 to refine crude oil
into gasoline, but when that proved unprofitable, it was converted
in 1981 to run on molasses, and then in 1987, on grain. Bankruptcy
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with rust on its tanks and pipes and grass growing through
the gravel on its paths, construction workers are converting it yet
again, to make fuel alcohol from agricultural garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's product, ethanol, which can be blended with gasoline
to power cars and trucks or used on its own to power modified
vehicles, has been produced around the country for years using corn
and wheat and other high-quality, high-cost ingredients, but never
with economic success. But the new owners of the plant here, BC
International Corp., with a subsidy from the U.S. Energy Department
and help from a genetically engineered, patented bacterium, hope
they are on the cusp of a new era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bio-refinery,'' said Stephen Gatto, president and
chief executive of the company. Exactly 25 years after the
beginning of the Arab oil embargo, the Energy Department believes
that Gatto's company may have a way to replace crude oil with
garbage. BC International will be the first to try on a commercial
scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The input costs are close to zero,'' said Dan Reicher,
assistant secretary of energy. ``In some cases they are less than
zero, because people are paying to get rid of these materials.''
And if it works, he said, the technology could also reduce the
accumulation of gases in the atmosphere that are thought to cause
climate change, and could lower smog.
</P>
<P>
   The plant here in this south-central Louisiana town will run on
bagasse, a part of the sugar cane plant usually considered useless,
as well as on rice hulls, a currently useless part of the rice
plant. Later, it may digest sawdust as well.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, energy experts have their eyes on clippings
from suburban lawns, prairie grasses and other woody materials, as
fuel for the new process. ``It's a lot cheaper to grow wood and
grass than corn,'' said John Ferrell, director of the Office of
Fuels Development at the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   In the current generation of ethanol plants, the fuel is the
corn kernel; plants using the new technology could digest the cob
and the stalk as well, Ferrell said.
</P>
<P>
   These materials are made of cellulose, which contains large
amounts of sugar, the basic ingredient required for alcohol
production. But the sugar in cellulose is in a chemical form that
traditional fermentation processes, which use yeast, cannot digest.
</P>
<P>
   BC's plant uses a bacterium, KO11, also used in the
pharmaceutical industry, to break down the sugars.
</P>
<P>
   The natural bacterium on which KO11 is based likes to eat sugars
and produces a chemical called acetic acid. But then came gene
splicing. Dr. Lonnie Ingram, a microbiologist at the University of
Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, borrowed
four genes from another organism, Zymomonas mobilis, to make the
bacterium produce alcohol instead.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, researchers are working with Z. mobilis to
find other approaches, but BC International's will be the first
commercial plant to make ethanol from woody material. The plant
will take about 18 months to build and will cost $90 million,
including $11 million from the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Existing ethanol plants do little to save energy or reduce
carbon build-up in the atmosphere. They can use up to seven gallons
of oil or its energy equivalent to produce eight gallons of
ethanol, experts say. The energy is used by the coal in power
plants and diesel fuel in tractors that plant, fertilize and
harvest the corn, and in petroleum-based fertilizer. But using
waste for fuel _ especially waste that might otherwise be burned
and in the process dump carbon dioxide back into the air _ could
allow production of seven gallons of ethanol from one gallon of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever the feedstock, whether trees or grasses, using it
makes room for new growth, which will draw carbon back out of the
atmosphere. This would be true, backers point out, wherever ethanol
from cellulose might catch on, in this country or abroad,
especially the Third World, where demand for motor fuel is rising.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, retail distribution of ethanol in its
near-pure form _ a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent
unleaded gasoline _ is minuscule. But it is more widely distributed
as ETBE, a gasoline additive used to raise octane and to reduce
carbon monoxide emissions. Ford and Chrysler expect to turn out
hundreds of thousands of vehicles that can run on ethanol or
gasoline, to take advantage of credits offered under the federal
fuel economy rules, so a market is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block has been price. To compete, ethanol has to
cost about one-fourth less than gasoline, because it has less
energy per gallon. BC International sees an initial niche for
ethanol as the basic ingredient of ETBE; later, the company says,
it could compete with gasoline directly.
</P>
<P>
   What would help, experts say, is using ingredients that are
available free, or that others will pay to dispose of. In
California, one area has banned burning of rice straw because of
air pollution, and that could be a potential fuel for an ethanol
plant, Gatto said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant here, on the banks of the Mermentau River, is designed
to produce 20 million gallons a year _ less than a pint for every
car in America _ but several others using cellulose are planned
around the country. One company, Masada Resource, of Birmingham,
Ala., says it will break ground next year on a plant in Middletown,
N.Y., that will use the cellulose in household garbage. In that
case, sales of ethanol will not turn a profit but will help offset
the cost of garbage disposal, in a region where a large landfill is
scheduled to close soon. It will not use KO11, but a different
proprietary process for rendering the cellulose into digestible
form.
</P>
<P>
   If the new technology does not revolutionize the fuels business,
it would not be the first time, as the plant here bears witness.
``It all depends on how good these bugs are, and what the price of
oil is,'' Reicher said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's strongman,
knows the playbook well.
</P>
<P>
   His first big performance was in Bosnia; his second has just
been completed in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The plot goes like this: As a divided West looks the other way,
create a crisis. Pursue your ends a little too harshly by
destroying a few too many villages, permitting one too many
massacres. Finally you catch Washington's attention. Then in a
grand gesture grant some concessions _ like allowing monitors on
the ground in Kosovo and NATO surveillance planes above.
</P>
<P>
   The climax: You are elevated to the position of indispensable
keeper of the peace; U.S. and NATO officials come to consult and
sometimes to scold. It all serves to pump you up in the eyes of
your own people, to whom you present yourself as their champion and
protector against hostile outsiders, namely the West, with which
you have just done a deal. As a result, you are guaranteed more
years in power as their autocratic ruler.
</P>
<P>
   In moments of candor, U.S. and European diplomats describe
Milosevic's behavior in the last eight months in Kosovo in this
neat sequence. They know, they say, that by offering some
face-saving concessions to NATO _ which despite its bravado has
been reluctant to carry out the air strikes that it continues to
threaten _ Milosevic has outfoxed the West once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president was allowed to make a mess in Kosovo over
the summer when the West was on vacation and when there was concern
that getting tough with him might disturb elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath _ 250,000 refugees, burnt villages and
irrevocably ruined relations between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in
Kosovo _ the United States is left with the cleanup. Washington
will foot a big portion of the bill for an expected 2,000
international monitors, and for much of the aid for refugees. Some
put the total price at $500 million _ a lot for an underdeveloped,
rural province about the size of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons, of course, beyond the crises he creates
that make Milosevic the man to deal with in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, he has been the master manipulator of
Serbian politics, and his political machine remains in firm control
of the state-run press and broadcast media. Whatever horror
officials in Washington express about his appeals to crude
nationalism, it is depressingly clear that he has a lot of material
to work with when he stirs ethnic passions: a distrustful culture
built on long-held sagas of martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   But to the West, Milosevic goes out of his way to present
himself as less extreme than some others. To prove the point, he
has chosen as his coalition partner Vojislav Seselj, who is even
more of a nationalist and who has led a charge against ``traitors''
in the independent media and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, does the West really have to play Milosevic's game? Is it
time to think about whether _ and how _ he could be displaced as
Serbia's leader? These questions are being increasingly raised in
the aftermath of the Kosovo agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a policy review that emphasizes ways of
getting rid of Milosevic,'' said David Phillips, the executive
director of the International Conflict Resolution Program at
Columbia University and who visited Kosovo last month. ``To have to
go back to Belgrade while Milosevic holds court is no longer
tenable.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips says the United States can shape its policies so that
Milosevic is weakened, not strengthened, and he maintains that one
of the weakest chinks in Milosevic's armor is the existence of a
United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague. ``It is time for
Louise Arbour to make a move against Milosevic and other Yugoslav
officials,'' said Phillips, referring to the tribunal's chief
prosecutor. ``At this juncture there should be plenty of evidence
and eyewitnesses to crimes against humanity by forces under the
control of Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Many pro-Western Serbs in Belgrade who oppose the Milosevic
regime, like Srbobran Brankovic, a leading Serbian pollster, agree
that the possibility of prosecution at The Hague could be turned to
the West's advantage as it struggles to contain Milosevic's
ambitions. He said a major motivation for Milosevic's agreement to
sign the Dayton agreement on Bosnia three years ago was his
calculation that, as a guarantor of the peace, he would not be made
a target of the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has an abnormal fear of the tribunal,'' the Serbian
pollster said. ``People in his circle said that when it was first
mentioned that he might be tried in The Hague, that he was in a
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's popularity at home is not quite what it is
advertised abroad. His personal approval rating in Serbia has slid
from a high of 40 percent in the early 1990s to 20 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Mr Brankovic and other pro-Western Serbs say they are not
persuaded by the argument that the only alternative to Milosevic is
Seselj, who enjoys about a 16 percent approval rating. There are,
he says, substantial independent voices of moderation that need to
be encouraged in Serbia's universities, in its independent media,
in its trade unions and mong its few struggling entrepreneurs _
even in the army.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who relies on the Interior Ministry's well-paid
police force to protect him and to repress opponents, is not well
liked in the Yugoslav Army; it is underpaid and has lost all the
battles that he sent it into in the last eight years. This feeling
was surprisingly evident in remarks last week by the army's chief
of staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, who rose through the ranks during
the glory days of Marshal Tito.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many leadership members have subjected everything to their own
interests,'' Perisic said in what seemed a veiled reference to
Milosevic. ``The Serbs have been at war since 1991 and we still
don't have an ally. We were never this isolated and we were never
without allies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   How to capitalize on these signs of dissatisfaction is the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In many quarters in the West, the notion of lightening the
financial and investment sanctions that have been placed on Serbia
is heresy, a sign of caving in to Milosevic. But educated Serbs who
would like to see Milosevic disappear argue that the sanctions
actually play into his hands by allowing him to argue that the
wicked West is responsible for a catastrophic drop in living
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions also encourage a pirate economy in which a tight
circle of Milosevic cronies get all the spoils. And barriers to
international travel fall especially hard on Western-oriented
Serbs, rather than on Milosevic's rural supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But given the West's pattern of letting Milosevic play out his
hand, there is not much optimism among educated Serbs in Belgrade
that the game will change very soon. They note the three-year time
frame for the interim political status of Kosovo agreed to during
the negotiations with Holbrooke. ``He will say I'm the guarantor of
the peace and security in the region, and the West will say
`yes,''' said Brankovic.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats in the Western embassies here are more cynically
optimistic, however. They point out that instead of operating on a
land-for-peace concept, Milosevic operates on a land-for-power
principle. Thus, he gave up his fight for Slovenia, then Croatia,
then Bosnia, but retained power as leader of a truncated Yugoslavia
dominated by Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In time, given the realities in Kosovo, where the majority
ethnic Albanians are struggling for independence, he will also lose
Kosovo, these diplomats say. Montenegro could follow, if Milosevic
chooses to provoke a crisis there. At that rate, Milosevic is
likely one day to wind up king of a suburb of Belgrade, still in
power but of no relevance to the United States.

   CHINA-FLOODS _ ZHAOYUAN, China _ Chinese are racing against time
as scores of victims from this summer's record flooding sit in
tents fearing the onset of this region's bitter winter in the next
few weeks. Authorities are working to assure they won't freeze
after being flooded out of their homes. Inundated oil wells at the
Daqing oil field 130 miles to the north shows another dimension of
flood ramifications _ the economic hit China took as agricultural
and industrial resources were swallowed by roiling waters of three
major rivers that exploded from their banks under heavy summer
rains. Already experiencing economic problems, China is paying
heavily to clean up the aftermath of floods that killed more than
3,000 people, destroyed 5.8 million homes, ravaged hundreds of
villages and cost an estimated $19 billion. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox

   POLMONEY-TRENDS _ WASHINGTON _ After weeks of arguing between

Clinton's problems were or were not affecting fund-raising efforts,
the truth will emerge reports filed Oct. 15 by some party
committees and Oct. 20 by others. We'll compare their actual
results from July (a quiet month), August (when Clinton confessed)
and September (when Starr went public) with the same months in
other mid-term elections, and say whether the patterns from big
givers or from small givers were any different this year.

   NASA _ Like John Glenn, NASA is playing time travel. The
77-year-old former astronaut's return to space links the national
space agency with its whiz-bang past, in the same month it
celebrates its 40th anniversary. But while NASA's first two decades
were a whirlwind of giant leaps _ it went from its first manned
flight to stepping on the moon in just eight years _ the second
half of the agency's life has mostly been a comfortable routine of
workmanlike space shuttle missions. That's about to change. NASA
has big plans. It's mulling a new breed of spaceship, with the
emphasis on utility and cost-effectiveness. In the works: reusable
rockets that operate at a fraction of the cost, can take off in the
kind of weather that would scrub a shuttle lunch, and turn around
in a remarkable seven days. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post). 25-30.

   SCANDAL-ELECTION_ Pundits are in search of campaigns where
Washington's impeachment-mania is having an effect. One place to
look may be Cincinnati, where popular Democratic mayor Roxanne
Qualls is challenging sophomore Rep. Steve Chabot. What makes this
close race inviting is that Chabot serves on the House Judiciary
Committee. He is one of only two committee members involved in
potentially close elections. The other is Democratic Rep. Mel Watt
of North Carolina. (Two other committee members, Democrat Charles
Schumer and Republican Bob Inglis, won't be back because they are

   CHANDLER _ David Ronald Chandler is on track to be the first
person executed by the United States in 35 years. Tried and
convicted in 1991 for having a snitch killed, Chandler sits on
death row as his appeals are almost exhausted. But as he nears
execution, the case against him seems to be falling apart. In a
prison interview, his chief accuser _ in fact, the man who pulled
the trigger and handed Chandler to prosecutors _ has recanted his
trial testimony almost entirely. Chandler, also interviewed,
insists he did not. Chandler was tried and convicted as a drug
kingpin in Piedmont, Alabama, a place where it seems that nobody
could be a kingpin of anything. And the crimes and the times of
Ronnie Chandler constitute a Faulknerian saga populated by killers,
drunks and ne're-do-wells, all of whom seem related to one another
in some way. (Chandler's appeal will be argued before the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Tuesday, Oct. 27.) (Rankin,

   CROSSDRESS _ NEW ORLEANS _ New Orleans recently became one of a
handful of American cities to specifically protect cross-dressers
from harassment and intimidation. An ordinance now outlaws
intimidation of cross-dressers, transsexuals or anyone else who
identifies with a gender other than his or her biological one. It
also permits employers to fire someone for cross-dressing in the
workplace _ unless the person has doctor-verified proof that he or
she has a gender-identification disorder. (Rochell, Atlanta

   ATLANTA-MALL _ The EPA surprised a lot of people with the warm
welcome it gave a proposed mega-mall on the edge of the central
business district in downtown Atlanta. The welcome is an example of
how the EPA is easing its rules in order to encourage projects it
believes promote ``smart growth.'' This is the first time EPA has
used this process anywhere in the nation for a shopping
development, and the case will be watched closely. Meantime, not
everyone is convinced the project meets the criteria of smart

   TEACHPREP _ ATLANTA _ Everything today's teachers need to know,
they're not learning in education schools. An increasingly complex

today's teachers that even several years of schooling may not be
able to prepare them for. How to reach a child who has to take care
of alcoholic parents, how to teach a child who is being sexually
abused, or how to interest a child who is overstimulated by too
many toys and too much television are just some of the challenges
today's teachers face. Add baby boomer parents who often expect
teachers to be their personal assistants in buffing their little
ones to academic and personal perfection, and the task becomes more
daunting. (Anderson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   DEATH-PENALTY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida's death penalty

Supreme Court and allowing the continued use of the state's

   BALCONES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The terrain was steep, rocky and

yellow face. Come spring, 50 of the warblers will arrive from Latin
America, calling out in buzzy, lilting tones to stake out their
territories. What is more, a limestone cave harbors endangered
bugs. Now, after years of debate, the owners of Vista Point, as the
tract is known, have reached an agreement with a nonprofit group

   WINTER _ For decades, long-range weather forecasts have been

the past few years, for instance, the National Weather Service's
Climate Prediction Center has begun using a network of sea buoys
laden with monitoring instruments to keep tabs on ocean conditions
and determine when El Ninos and La Ninas are developing and how
strong they might be _ and the resulting weather patterns they may
cause around the globe. Weather satellites orbiting the earth also
gather reams of data for the climate researchers. A look at the
state of weather prediction. (Seabrook, Atlanta

   WINTER-SIDE _ On Georgia's coastal Sapelo Island, the ants seem

winter. Long before there were meteorologists with Doppler radar,
generations of farmers and other rural folk were predicting the
weather by observing nature. Those prognostications don't always
square with the official science-based forecasts of the National
Weather Service, but the traditions endure. (Seabrook, Atlanta

   BETHESDA, Md. _ One of the bellwethers for next month's
elections is taking milkshake orders from a late-night party of 25
in the Tastee Diner here _ all separate checks, she notes, with a
sort of kindly grimace.
</P>
<P>
   No, says the waitress, Carol Chavez, with enviable patience, she
was not previously aware that she is a member of the hot political
swing group of the moment, the ``waitress moms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been trying to raise my kids,'' she says. ``I work
two jobs, so I don't listen to any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``angry white men'' and ``soccer moms'' before them,
waitress moms are said to be the group to watch in the elections
this year. They are low-income working women _ not just those who
wait tables _ and are mostly white and under 50 with a high school
education.
</P>
<P>
   And while they may be Democrats at heart, they tend to sit out
elections when they don't see the political debate as relevant to
their families.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal involving President Clinton seems to have troubled a
good number of them, pollsters have said. And now no one knows if
they'll turn out on Nov. 3 _ or how they'll vote if they do show
up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chavez, who turns 50 on Tuesday, says she, for one, won't
vote, or even tune into the debate. She has children aged 9, 15 and
19, and everything she's got goes into providing for them.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-worker, Janet Pochon, a 41-year-old mother of three
handing out burgers at a pretty good clip, is a lifelong Democrat
who twice voted for Bill Clinton but will also be staying home this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really depressed with everything that's going on with
Clinton and it's really turned me off,'' she said. At what moment
did the Democrats lose her? ``When Clinton admitted he lied,'' Ms.
Pochon said. ``You put your trust in somebody and they break that
trust. I'm sure there are a lot of people just like me.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, is the Democrats' biggest fear, and the
reason women like Ms. Pochon and Ms. Chavez are so sought after by
both parties this year.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, the Democratic pollster who coined the term
waitress moms in 1996, said she dreamed it up in an effort to
remind Democrats of the importance of the voters down market from
the soccer mom. ``I was trying to think: What's the downscale
version of the soccer moms _ the women who don't have a minivan and
a cleaning lady and have to take their kids to their mother's house
at 4 in the morning on their way to work?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're values oriented,'' Ms. Lake said. ``They think the
president has done a good job, but they're troubled by his personal
life. They've been swung back and forth by events, so they're a
question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   And they seem to be a newly volatile factor in the gender gap,
the tendency of women to vote heavily Democratic, which has helped
President Clinton in the past. In this midterm election, in which a
lower-than-normal turnout could hurt Democrats, the waitress moms
are more important than ever, and more unpredictable. So the term
has stuck this year, with these women symbolizing the ambivalence
and uncertainty of a strange political season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are doubts about Ms. Lake's catchy phrase: Is it
mostly a marketing buzz phrase designed to motivate Democrats? Has
it caught on merely as a way for political reporters to enjoy an
order of fries on the job while interviewing the female equivalent
of the much-quoted taxi driver? And is it even a good way to sum up
working-class women? (When these women are asked to describe
themselves, Ms. Lake said, their No. 1 response is ``tired.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the term _ waitress moms is a little derogatory,'' says
Stephanie Cohen, spokeswoman for Emily's List, the women's advocacy
group whose own pollster, Ms. Lake, made it up. (Ms. Cohen prefers
``drop-off women.'' And no, that doesn't refer to the mothers
queued up in the parking lot to let their kids out at the school
door, but to the fact that low-income women are less likely to vote
in off-year elections.)
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, an independent pollster for the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press, says the new formulation
mostly fills the need for political theater and good visuals.
``This comes from focus groups as the new political insider's
wisdom, and it's a myth,'' he said, adding that he sees no evidence
that these women are any more or less likely to vote this year than
in any off-year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is only one way to describe one of many voting
blocs that could be crucial to this or any other election. But both
parties seem to be taking the waitress-moms concept seriously,
targeting the group heavily with mailings and advertising campaigns
that emphasize resonant themes like education, social security and
the reform of health-maintenance organizations. The AFL-CIO is
sponsoring 2,000 events with them in mind, mostly small gatherings
to be held in kitchens and job sites all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen said polling shows that this group is turned off by
heavy partisanship and is almost solely focused on practical
questions like, ``Can I pick my own doctor?''
</P>
<P>
   And these days, the waitress moms seem more favorably disposed
to Hillary Rodham Clinton than to her husband. Ms. Lake said that
in a recent poll in a Southern border state she would not name, 46
percent of them said they liked the president. That's compared with
the 64 percent who felt an affinity for the first lady. Mrs.
Clinton has been campaigning heavily, and signed a letter that
Emily's List sent to many of the 2 million waitress moms targeted
by the group.
</P>
<P>
   But just getting these women to the polls is only part of the
challenge for Democrats, said Garry South, campaign director for
Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor of California.
South warned that efforts to pursue this group will backfire on
candidates who try to win over waitress moms without knowing them
well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a subset of what's come to be known as the Reagan
Democrats, who vote Democrat but will desert you in a second if
something doesn't smell right,'' he said. ``They're fickle,
frustrated and hard to fathom, and Democrats cannot simply turn out
waitress moms through a get-out-the-vote campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Allen County Republican Party's annual bean dinner in
Fort Wayne, Ind., on Friday night, the featured speaker, former
Vice President Dan Quayle, said Republicans were the waitress moms'
true friends. ``Think of the waitress that works extra hours at
night so she can buy a book for her child,'' he told the crowd.
``She might want to be at her son or daughter's soccer game, but
she has to work because of high taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans are running advertising campaigns
emphasizing education and other matters of particular interest to
these women.
</P>
<P>
   And both parties seem to see waitress moms wagging a finger at
them, warning that they won't be ignored this year.
</P>
<P>
   That image, and the whole metaphor of the waitress mom, ``is
somewhat an oversimplification,'' South admitted. ``But it's a
useful way to characterize for the Democrats why you have to pay
attention to someone other than the soccer mom.''

   BETHESDA, Md. _ One of the bellwethers for next month's
elections is taking milkshake orders from a late-night party of 25
in the Tastee Diner here _ all separate checks, she notes, with a
sort of kindly grimace.
</P>
<P>
   No, says the waitress, Carol Chavez, with enviable patience, she
was not previously aware that she is a member of the hot political
swing group of the moment, the ``waitress moms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been trying to raise my kids,'' she says. ``I work
two jobs, so I don't listen to any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``angry white men'' and ``soccer moms'' before them,
waitress moms are said to be the group to watch in the elections
this year. They are low-income working women _ not just those who
wait tables _ and are mostly white and under 50 with a high school
education.
</P>
<P>
   And while they may be Democrats at heart, they tend to sit out
elections when they don't see the political debate as relevant to
their families.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal involving President Clinton seems to have troubled a
good number of them, pollsters have said. And now no one knows if
they'll turn out on Nov. 3 _ or how they'll vote if they do show
up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chavez, who turns 50 on Tuesday, says she, for one, won't
vote, or even tune into the debate. She has children aged 9, 15 and
19, and everything she's got goes into providing for them.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-worker, Janet Pochon, a 41-year-old mother of three
handing out burgers at a pretty good clip, is a lifelong Democrat
who twice voted for Bill Clinton but will also be staying home this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really depressed with everything that's going on with
Clinton and it's really turned me off,'' she said. At what moment
did the Democrats lose her? ``When Clinton admitted he lied,'' Ms.
Pochon said. ``You put your trust in somebody and they break that
trust. I'm sure there are a lot of people just like me.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, of course, is the Democrats' biggest fear, and the
reason women like Ms. Pochon and Ms. Chavez are so sought after by
both parties this year.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, the Democratic pollster who coined the term
waitress moms in 1996, said she dreamed it up in an effort to
remind Democrats of the importance of the voters down market from
the soccer mom. ``I was trying to think: What's the downscale
version of the soccer moms _ the women who don't have a minivan and
a cleaning lady and have to take their kids to their mother's house
at 4 in the morning on their way to work?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're values oriented,'' Ms. Lake said. ``They think the
president has done a good job, but they're troubled by his personal
life. They've been swung back and forth by events, so they're a
question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   And they seem to be a newly volatile factor in the gender gap,
the tendency of women to vote heavily Democratic, which has helped
President Clinton in the past. In this midterm election, in which a
lower-than-normal turnout could hurt Democrats, the waitress moms
are more important than ever, and more unpredictable. So the term
has stuck this year, with these women symbolizing the ambivalence
and uncertainty of a strange political season.

   WASHINGTON _ Maybe it was just a false dawn _ there have been
plenty of those.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Dow Jones industrial average rose, the final touches
were put on a $30 billion package to prop up Brazil, and Japan
committed a half a trillion dollars to save its banks, there was
hope last week that the worst of the global financial upheaval
might be passing.
</P>
<P>
   The case for optimism goes like this: Investors may be realizing
that their panicky race for the exits, into Treasury bonds and
anything else that seems secure, was as much an overreaction as
their rush into the world's emerging markets in the mid-1990s was a
triumph of blind optimism.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the interest-rate cuts pulled off by the Federal
Reserve in recent weeks show that someone is paying attention.
Interest rates in Thailand and South Korea have fallen to 7
percent, evidence that their economies may finally get going. Sure,
Indonesia has turned into a lawless land, with mobs burning out the
shops of ethnic Chinese merchants and chopping off the heads of
suspected sorcerers, but its currency, the rupiah, is making a
surprising comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Commerce Department's announcement last week of a
mammoth August trade deficit for the United States, $16.77 billion,
was greeted by the markets as good news: America remains the last
big-time consumer on the globe, the numbers showed, and projections
that the 1999 trade deficit could hit $300 billion for the year
suggests the United States will keep consuming. In other words,
even as America's growth slows, it may pull Asia and Japan out of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were plenty of optimists around in the spring,
declaring that the sky had stopped falling. That was just before
Russia defaulted on its debts and backtracked on its commitments to
economic reform. And it was when Japan's troubles still seemed
limited to $600 billion in bad bank loans, instead of more than $1
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time for these problems to develop, and it will
take a long time for the world to work through them,'' Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin cautioned last week. Meanwhile, his aides
are explaining what fundamentally good shape Brazil is in, which
must explain why it is about to become the fifth country to receive
a multi-billion rescue package in the past year.

   The Taliban hard-liners who rule most of Afghanistan are
arguably the world's most vociferous enemies of modern technology.
When they aren't busy enforcing the rules that prohibit females
from leaving their homes unveiled or unaccompanied by a close male
relative, the Taliban religious police roam neighborhoods searching
for radios, TVs, VCRs, phonographs, satellite dishes or computers,
which are promptly destroyed while the owners are arrested.

   Drive of Kandahar Police Against Antisocial Elements: The
Kandahar police, in a drive against antisocial elements yesterday,
rounded up different criminals from around the city. They arrested
a man and seized ... 240 song cassettes and packs of playing cards
from his possessions. All the things were then set on fire while
the culprit was handed over to the police. _ Oct. 4
</P>
<P>
   Televisions Seized and Smashed in Kabul: (The religious police)
have started their country-wide campaign of destroying televisions,
VCRs, satellite dishes, etc. ... On Tuesday, here in Kabul,
hundreds of television sets and other instruments of immoral
pastimes were seized from markets and work places and then
destroyed. These means of corruption were, in some places, even
thrown out of the windows of high buildings to smash on the streets
below. A source revealed that the campaign will be carried on with
the same fervor and zeal till the complete destruction of these
instruments of moral depravity. _ Aug. 9

<P>
   Kabul: 16 Punished for Trimming Beard: (The religious police)
arrested 16 people in raids on different parts of the city, on the
charge of having their beard trimmed to less than the required
length. Two taxi drivers were also arrested for taking unattended,
unveiled women as passengers.

<P>
   _ Aug. 2
</P>
<P>
   Punishment on Trimming Beard and Keeping Un-Islamic Hairstyle:
The religious police ... arrested several people in different
crimes during several raids in different parts of the city. They
arrested and gave sharia punishment to 13 shopkeepers for not
offering congregational prayers. ... Similarly, dozens of people
were (given) punishment for trimming their beards. ... Meanwhile,
the religion police gave hard sharia punishment to three taxi
drivers who had allowed (unescorted) women to sit in their taxis
(and) issued an order according to which no women could go to the
doctor even for medicine (unless accompanied by a male relative).
Similarly, some private schools for women were also ordered to be
closed which were open in homes. ... According to an official of
the religious police ... some weak elements were trying to pave way
for indecency and dissension among women under cover of education;
therefore, all such schools have been ordered to close down.

   _ July 19
</P>

   Liquor Seized at Kabul International Airport: A large amount of
liquor was seized from Kabul International Airport. This liquor was
being smuggled by the officials of an international welfare
organization from Islamabad (Pakistan) to Kabul, when it was seized
by Taliban security forces. Later liquor is burnt in fire. ...
Previously also, liquor bottles were recovered from the officers of
Red Cross International organization during search at Kabul
airport.

<P>
   Three Dozen Shopkeepers Punished: (government agents) punished
three dozen shopkeepers for not offering congregational prayers in
Kabul. The accused were also ordered to keep their shops closed for
five days. Whereas, 25 persons were punished for trimming their
beards and 12 taxi drivers were given sharia punishment for dealing
with women and for listening (to) songs.

   Prohibition of TV, VCR Essential to Save Society from
Destruction: An edict was issued by (the religious police) ordering
the destruction or disposal of all TV sets, VCRs, videocassettes,
etc., in the country within 15 days. ``No one is allowed to keep
these things in their home or shops. Selling or dealing in such
goods is strictly prohibited from now on. Restriction is imposed
upon mechanics of corruption and depravity,'' the order maintained.
</P>
<P>
   (In an interview), the deputy head of the Taliban's religious
ministry said that they had no other option to cleanse the society
of corruption and moral depravity. ``We had banned all televisions,
videocassette recorders, videos, satellite dishes, audio cassettes
of recorded songs and music from the country when we took control.
But the ban had not been strictly imposed and, taking advantage of
our leniency, people are watching TV in their homes. So we have
decided to remedy this.''

Stay in Their Homes.'' Banning women from schools, the workplace
and even the streets prompted the government of Iran (no slacker
when it comes to keeping women undercover) to protest recently that
the Taliban are ``giving Islam a bad name.'' In a series of
rhetorical questions and answers, the Taliban addressed such
concerns at length: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Taliban use force in the enforcement of Islamic law.
Their haste in implementing sharia is discrediting Islam in the
eyes of the world. Shouldn't they have implemented it gradually,
step by step?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Taliban have put a ban on wine, on the immorality of TV,
a complete restriction on songs, photography or painting of living
things. Shaving off the beard or trimming it less than a fistful is
prohibited too, as is adopting an English hairstyle. Gambling,
betting, pigeon-flying, dog-racing, sodomy are strictly forbidden.
... When Islam has forbidden them and the Taliban have banned them,
would it be called cruelty _ (this) use of force? To call it so
would be criticizing Islam, and criticizing Islam leads to going
astray.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The U.N., America, Britain, in fact the entire Western media
accuse the Taliban of violating the rights of women, of banning
them from jobs, of ordering them to observe ``purdah'' (a
requirement that women's faces and legs be covered when in public).
The Taliban are also accused of depriving women of their right to
education.
</P>
<P>
   A. Neither do we acknowledge the rights given to women by the
West, nor are we bound by them. ... Men in the West have made women
an object of their lusts and desires. They have used them (as) they
pleased. When these slaves-of-their-desires had to go to work, to
offices and factories, they drafted the women along with them also.
Women were made to work in offices, restaurants, shops and
factories for the gratification of (male) desires. In this way did
the Western man destroy the personality, position and identity of a
woman. ...
</P>
<P>
   The women of the West are laboring under a double burden. One,
she is torn by anxiety as to who will look after her in case she
remains unmarried. ... She is thus forced to wander from door to
door in search of security. Even in the matter of dress she is
exploited. Men wear trousers which cover their ankles, while women
are forced to wear skirts with their legs bare in every kind of
weather. In the scantiest of dresses, merely a sleeveless blouse
and miniskirt, the Western woman can be seen roaming in shops,
airports, stations, etc. She is a target for unscrupulous men who
satisfy their lust with them _ wherever, whenever they please. ...
She has become no less than a bitch, chased by a dozen dogs in
heat. If these are the rights of the Western women, then the West
is welcome to them.

NEVADA TO GET MONEY FROM U.S. AUCTION OF LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON CITY, Nev. _ The federal government is preparing to
auction 27,000 acres of public land near Las Vegas estimated to be
worth $500 million to $1 billion, with almost all of the proceeds
to stay in Nevada instead of going to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Like many cities in the West, Las Vegas is surrounded by public
land managed by the Interior Department. The Bureau of Land
Management has designated 55,000 acres of desert within a
460-square-mile zone around the city for eventual disposal to
developers and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been reluctant to sell public land in the
past, because the proceeds went to the Treasury and neither the
Interior Department nor Nevada gained anything. Previously, the
government traded developable public land near Las Vegas to
developers in exchange for environmentally sensitive private lands
elsewhere in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   But these exchanges have become mired in controversy, with
federal audits finding that the government received far less than
equal value in many exchanges. Rep. John Ensign, a Republican, has
said the government lost nearly $40 million in the last two years
in land trades with developers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under a bill enacted by Congress and signed by President
Clinton, the government will sell the public land at auction.
Eighty-five percent of the proceeds will go to acquire
environmentally sensitive private land in Nevada and to improve
parks and recreation areas around Las Vegas, 10 percent to the
Southern Nevada Water Authority to build drinking-water pipelines,
and 5 percent to schools in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas office of the Bureau of Land Management is already
fielding calls from potential bidders, said a public affairs
officer, Phillip Guerrero. But the bureau must first consult with
Clark County and the cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas and
Henderson to determine which lands should be sold and which lands
the local governments need for roads, flood-control projects,
schools, police and fire stations and parks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the airport authority in Las Vegas is
picking up around 5,000 acres in its noise-abatement area at no
cost. Local governments can also acquire parks and rights-of-way
for water, sewage and flood-control projects at no cost. And more
than 20,000 acres is expected to be sold to local governments for
only $10 an acre for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves as much as 27,000 acres of public land that is
expected to be auctioned to developers at average prices of $18,000
to $37,000 per acre. The land will be sold in parcels of five to
2,500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Each parcel will be offered with minimum bids set by a
government-approved appraisal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bill, the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act, was
sponsored by Ensign and Sen. Richard Bryan, a Democrat. It passed
the House two years ago but was held up in the Senate in an effort
to press Nevada to accept a temporary nuclear-waste storage
installation at Yucca Mountain, and by concern about setting a
precedent for sales of public lands surrounding other rapidly
growing Western cities.
</P>
<P>
   The act raised a major policy question, Bryan acknowledged.
``This is groundbreaking legislation in that you're allowing the
state to keep all the money from public lands,'' he said. ``This is
not money that goes back to Washington and that then has to be
appropriated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan said the sale was justified because 87 percent of the
land in Nevada is owned by the federal government.

<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 25, moved Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds: WAITRESS-MOMS-REVIEW,
TALIBAN-WEBSITE-REVIEW and ECON-OPTIMISM-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-REVIEW _ It is often said that the weakness of the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord worked out in Oslo was that it was
embraced by only half of Israel, the secular liberals of European
origin, and had never been sold to religious Israelis, the poor and
those of Middle Eastern origin. Now, three years after an Orthodox,
Yemenite Israeli student sought to end the peace deal by
assassinating Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, here were the
representatives of that other Israel coming to terms with the
reality that Oslo had created. By Ethan Bronner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-PHOTOS-REVIEW _ Increasingly, if inconsistently,
disturbing images of the dead are finding their way into print and
on television. There are corpses without shrouds, without the
comfort of a soft focus. There are slack bodies, bloated bodies,
frozen frightened faces that make viewers turn away. In fits and
starts, the conservative reflexes that made graphic death a rarity
in newspapers in the generation after the Vietnam War are being
supplanted by a willingness to use these images, with their
powerful emotional impact. By Felicity Barringer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET-REVIEW _ It would seem impossible for Genaro Arriagada
not to feel some satisfaction at the arrest in London of his
country's former military dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. As a
prominent academic in the years after Pinochet took power in Chile,
Arriagada churned out a series of critical studies on the military
and its rule. When Pinochet finally agreed to submit his regime to
a popular vote, Arriagada organized the coalition that campaigned
successfully for his defeat in a national referendum. By Tim
Golden. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GAYS-POLITICS-REVIEW _ The struggle between defiant advocates
and those who prefer to compromise has been mirrored in other civil
rights movements, notably the one for black rights. But the gay
rights movement is distinct because it is made up of such a diverse
universe _ covering all ideologies, economic classes and races. Its
members share only two traits: sexual orientation and, most likely,
the experience of discrimination. It is not surprising, then, that
the movement as a whole has never reached a consensus about its
mission: An equal rights bill? Admission to the military? The right
to marry? To be left alone? By Adam Nagourney. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-REVIEW _ Until last week, most Americans thought of
Bill Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corp., as a genius and
innovator. A nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled visionary who
almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal computer.
On Monday, however, in a Washington, D.C. courtroom, the Justice
Department began painting a different, darker portrait of Gates. In
an antitrust suit brought by the department and 20 states, the man
whose company commands a 97 percent share of the market for
personal computer operating systems is being depicted as a Nixonian
schemer who will go to almost any length to crush his competition.
By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   LT-GOVERNORS-REVIEW _ When it comes to questions of how
seriously one should view the backup quarterbacks in the nation's
state capitals, the answers often depend on the particular stadiums
in which they are warming the bench. In some states, the No. 2
person actually has clout, and campaigns for the job are serious
matters. By Jacques Steinberg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EURO-CURRENCY-REVIEW _ Just 10 weeks before 11 European
countries adopt the euro as a common currency on Jan. 1, eventually
replacing marks, francs and lira, Europe has suddenly become the
world's bastion of economic safety. Far from being alarmed about
the changes and uncertainties ahead, traders have seized upon
European currencies _ including the lira _ as their preferred safe
haven from the turmoil rocking Asia, Russia and now even the United
States. By Edmund L. Andrews. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEACE-MESSENGERS-REVIEW _ In the television-oriented 1990s,
policy wonks are using celebrities to get their messages across.
Maybe it is inevitable that groups like the population fund, which
provides contraception and counseling, would turn to entertainers
and athletes to reach a wider audience than do the policy-makers
who inhabit Sunday-morning interview shows. At the United Nations,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has his own ``messengers for peace'' _
Magic Johnson, Muhammad Ali, Elie Wiesel and Michael Douglas, who
said last summer that ``this probably means as much to me as any of
the two Oscars that I got.'' By James Barron. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-MILOSEVIC-REVIEW _ Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's strongman,
knows the playbook well. His first big performance was in Bosnia;
his second has just been completed in the Serbian province of
Kosovo. The plot goes like this: As a divided West looks the other
way, create a crisis. Pursue your ends a little too harshly by
destroying a few too many villages, permitting one too many
massacres. Finally you catch Washington's attention. Then in a
grand gesture grant some concessions _ like allowing monitors on
the ground in Kosovo and NATO surveillance planes above. The
climax: You are elevated to the position of indispensable keeper of
the peace; American and NATO officials come to consult and
sometimes to scold. It all serves to pump you up in the eyes of
your own people, to whom you present yourself as their champion and
protector against hostile outsiders, namely the West, with which
you have just done a deal. As a result, you are guaranteed more
years in power as their autocratic ruler. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   WAITRESS-MOMS-REVIEW (Bethesda, Md.) _ Like ``angry white men''
and ``soccer moms'' before them, waitress moms are said to be the
group to watch in the elections this year. They are low-income
working women _ not just those who wait tables _ and are mostly
white and under 50 with a high school education. By Melinda
Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-OPTIMISM-REVIEW (Washington) _ As the Dow rose, the final
touches were put on a $30 billion package to prop up Brazil, and
Japan committed a half a trillion dollars to save its banks, there
was hope last week that the worst of the global financial upheaval
might be passing. But was it? By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   TALIBAN-WEBSITE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Taliban hard-liners who
rule most of Afghanistan are arguably the world's most vociferous
enemies of modern technology. What a surprise, then, to go online,
type in ``www.taliban.com'' and witness what spills forth: Taliban
Online.

AFTER INTENSE SCRUTINY, SUFFOLK DEATH-PENALTY JURY IS SELECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ Over the last three-and-a-half months, nearly
1,300 prospective jurors have filed into court here and answered
questions about whether they could fairly determine the guilt or
innocence of a suspect in a series of murders and then possibly
sentence him to death.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Arthur Pitts of Suffolk County Criminal Court announced
Friday that 12 jurors and 11 alternate jurors had finally been
chosen to hear the case against Robert Shulman, a former postal
worker accused of killing three prostitutes. It is the first
death-penalty case on Long Island in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are always problems in finding jurors who are
able to serve for many months, there is one additional element that
complicates the process in capital cases: moral judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalty phase involves moral reasoning, which is a much
more subjective process and entirely different from the factual
determination of guilt or innocence,'' said Kevin Doyle, the chief
of the state's new capital defenders office. ``That's why it has
taken courts months to pick juries in capital murder cases,
especially if it's done properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential jurors for the Shulman jury filled out a 61-page
questionnaire eliciting their views on everything from lawyers and
psychiatrists to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Under closer questioning from the prosecutor in the case,
Georgia Tschiember, and Shulman's defense lawyers, Paul Gianelli
and William Keahon, the questions focused on moral issues to
determine, among other things, whether a ``death-qualified'' jury _
people who say they are able to condemn someone to die _ might be
inherently conservative in nature. The fear for defense lawyers is
that such a jury could be more likely not only to convict Shulman,
but also to sentence him to death, rather than consider the
alternative of life in prison without the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that, by itself, could become a matter for
the appeals court,'' said Eric Freedman, a professor at Hofstra Law
School who is an expert on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman said the state's three-year-old death penalty law was
not based on any existing model approved and tested in other
states, but was ``written on a blank piece of paper,'' leaving many
legal questions unanswered. Eventually, he said, these questions
will have to be answered by the state's highest court, the Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The first such test of the law was argued before the appeals
court on Oct. 13, when lawyers contended that the statute's
plea-bargaining provisions were unconstitutional because they
coerced defendants into pleading guilty rather than risk a death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law took effect in New York on Sept. 1, 1995,
prosecutors throughout the state have sought the death penalty in
31 murder cases. (For a defendant to be sentenced to death, the
jury must reach a unanimous decision on both the matter of guilt
and penalty. Should they fail to agree on the penalty, the statute
requires that the decision be made by the judge.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, two of these cases have gone through both the trial and
penalty phases, and the defendants have been sentenced. In the
first case, in June, a jury in Brooklyn sentenced to death a former
jail guard, Darrel Harris, 40, for fatally shooting three people
during a robbery at a social club. In July, a jury in Dutchess
County found Dalkeith McIntosh, a 38-year-old immigrant from
Jamaica, guilty of murdering his estranged wife and her daughter,
but voted to send him to prison for life, rather than to death by
lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   The results of these two cases have only further confounded some
experts who use demographic information _ including sex, age, race
and religion _ to study juries in death penalty cases. While these
experts expected the Dutchess County jury to be more conservative,
it decided against death. The Brooklyn jury, which was expected to
be more liberal, voted for the death penalty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Suffolk County, where juries are regarded as generally
conservative, lawyers hesitate to pursue a liberal defense, knowing
that jurors are less likely, for example, to accept an insanity
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Picking a death-penalty jury can place the defense at an added
disadvantage. For example, Gianelli, one of the defense lawyers,
found himself arguing to keep a juror who said he was already
convinced of Shulman's guilt, but would be willing to consider
sentencing him to life in prison without parole rather than to
death.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty
Information Center in Washington, pointed to difficulties in
labeling prospective jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have all sorts of shades of views on the death penalty
and many people don't really know what their moral stance is until
they actually have to make a real decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman, 44, a former postal worker in Hicksville, is accused of
bludgeoning five women to death and dismembering four of them. He
is being tried here for the murder of three of the victims whose
bodies he discarded in trash bins in Suffolk County. He also faces
trial for murder in Westchester County, where the bodies of the
other two women were found. Although he has signed a confession to
the murders, he has entered a plea of not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts instructed all 23 jurors to be in court on Tuesday morning
for opening arguments in a trial that is expected to last as long,
if not longer, than the protracted jury selection process.

   Showers and thunderstorms will develop across Arizona Sunday as
a core of very fast jet stream winds associated with a potent
low-pressure system over the southern Great Basin lifts moderately
moist air. Farther west, building westerly winds will gust to 40
mph or more across the deserts of southern California, setting the
stage for blowing dust and sand.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will fall at high elevations in the mountains of southeast
Idaho, Utah, southwest Wyoming and western Colorado as the potent
low churns eastward.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Hurricane Mitch strengthened over the western
Caribbean Sea, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph. On Sunday,
Hurricane Mitch may take a westward jog before approaching Jamaica.
If, however, Hurricane Mitch continues to forge northward, the risk
that the Caribbean island will be lashed with hurricane or tropical
storm-force winds by the end of the day will rise.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and spotty showers will affect the northern Great Lakes
region Sunday as an upper-level low pressure system, which tracked
from California to Montana and then the northern Plains over the
past several days, finally arrives. Showers could reach
southwestward of the low across parts of the upper Mississippi
Valley as moist winds from the southwest converge near the low.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp cold front will forge into northern New England Sunday,
escorted by a few widely separated showers. Farther south, high
clouds streaming east from the low over the Great Lakes will dim
the sun over parts of northern Pennsylvania and western New York.

   Focus: Destiny of Water
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tropical moisture that swirled around the eye of
Supertyphoon Zeb over the western Pacific Ocean nearly two weeks
ago fell as snowflakes over the northern Sierra Nevada Saturday.
Next spring, this melting snow linked to the tropics will trickle
down from the high Sierra into reservoirs. Some of it will
evaporate quickly, only to eventually condense into cloud droplets
elsewhere. Some of it will stay in reservoirs for years. The
possible destinies of water are endless. The labyrinth of paths of
water molecules between the tropics and poles is called the
hydrologic cycle.

   In Time for Elections, A New Federal Budget
</P>
<P>
   After a grueling labor, Congress delivered a 40-pound,
16-inch-high monster, otherwise known as the federal budget. It ran
3,825 pages, and hardly a man or woman alive had read the whole
thing before Congress passed it into law and President Clinton
signed it.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 billion omnibus package picked up all the loose ends of
the legislative year, including spending for eight broad categories
of the government. And it cemented into policy an array of
non-money matters that rank-and-file lawmakers had never debated or
voted on.
</P>
<P>
   If the process horrified people inside Congress and out, it
produced a package larded up with local goodies that lawmakers
could take home and boast about as they run for re-election.

   Suspicious Fires in Vail
</P>
<P>
   Skiers who visit Vail, Colo., often rate it the best ski area in
the nation. So the stakes seemed clear after a series of fires
there that destroyed a luxury restaurant, a picnic shelter and the
ski patrol headquarters on Vail Mountain _ all of the blazes
erupting in linear sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions immediately focused on the possibility of an act of
vengeance against Vail Resorts, a corporate giant resented by local
residents because it has been acquiring huge parts of the local ski
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer called the fires ``terrorism,'' and the FBI and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were called in to
investigate, since the fires took place on U.S. Forest Service
land.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Apples; Give Teachers Stock
</P>
<P>
   The problem is this: how to make teaching a more prestigious
occupation, one that draws the best and the brightest. The Edison
Project, a privately held company that runs public schools around
the country, thinks it has an answer: Pay teachers like executives.
</P>
<P>
   Edison announced that it would give stock options and cash
bonuses to teachers at the elementary school it runs in Miami _ and
it plans to expand the program to its other 50 schools as well.
Teachers will be given $3,000 in options, the school principal
$10,500, and other staff $1,000, when fully vested after five
years. If Edison does well after it goes public in a couple of
years, the options could be worth more.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like much to top executives, who are used to
counting their compensation in the millions. But to teacher
representatives it is a start. Although other public schools will
have trouble offering shares of stock, teachers union officials say
it's about time some creative thinking went into teacher pay.

   Glenn Doesn't Strut The Old Stuff  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent lull in space shuttle launchings has raised quiet
concerns over the safety of Sen. John Glenn's flight, prompting an
unusual series of dry runs meant to keep ground crews sharp and
complex gear up to snuff. Safety experts agree that the winged
spaceships must run regularly or become balky and their launching
crews rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Glenn himself seems a bit fragile and has been
dropped from one of the main age-related inquiries planned for his
return to space, set for Thursday. For a study of how melatonin can
promote sleep, he failed to meet one of the medical criteria; just
which one was undisclosed for reasons of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   On the mechanical side, safety experts give NASA high marks for
looking potential trouble in the eye. It was hiding from problems
that led to the 1986 Challenger explosion, in which six astronauts
and a high school teacher died.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into something that is extraordinary, everybody
has to be made aware of that fact and to do the job right,'' noted
Dr. Seymour Himmel, a safety adviser to NASA.

   Tyson Gets to Return To the Ring
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson is back.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada State Athletic Commission voted to restore the
fighter's boxing license, 15 months after he bit both ears of
Evander Holyfield, the heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew my cool,'' Tyson said simply.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of his unpredictability in the ring, Tyson
remains one of the sport's biggest draws. Last month he underwent
psychological tests, which concluded that the fighter suffered from
depression and anger but was mentally fit to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is hoping to fight soon. His lawyers say the IRS has
placed a $13 million lien against his three homes.

   Pipeline Blast Kills 48 In Colombia

   Even as the Colombian government was moving toward opening peace

province.
</P>

Petroleum pipeline last Sunday morning, they denied responsibility

   Senator Blocks a Nomination of a homosexual
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott recently compared gay people
to kleptomaniacs and alcoholics. So it was no surprise when the
nomination of James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg died in the
Senate because Lott refused to permit a confirmation vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, a San Francisco philanthropist and the heir to the
meatpacking fortune, would have been the first openly gay
ambassador in the history of the foreign service. The White House
says it might renominate him next year.

   A Little Respect For the Commander in Chief
</P>
<P>
   By now in the Lewinsky matter, there is very little bad that has
not been said about President Clinton. Already the butt of
late-night television jokes and talk-radio scorn, his reputation
took a new drubbing in Minnesota when Paula Jones' appeal of her
dismissed sexual-harassment lawsuit rehashed some of the more
sordid accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In one place, though, the president still gets respect _ or
else. The Uniform Code of Military Justice prohibits members of the
Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from making ``contemptuous
remarks'' in public about the president. A Marine major now faces
investigation and, possibly, punishment for writing a newspaper
article disparaging Clinton as an ``adulterous liar.'' Worried
about a rash of ventings, the Marine Corps and Air Force reminded
troops that when it comes to the commander in chief, it's ``Mr.
President, SIR!''

   Numerical Lunacy (Cont.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How big is a googolplex? A brief article last Sunday _ one that
invited readers on a wild ride through the world of really, really
big numbers _ presumed to answer that question in a down-to-earth,
lay-'em-end-to-end sort of way. ``Write the numeral 1 followed by a
letter-sized page of zeros,'' it suggested innocently. ``Continue
writing zeros until you have a stack of paper that reaches the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   The expected reactions:
</P>
<P>
   1) Whew! That's a lot of zeros!
</P>
<P>
   2) Or, from pickier types: How thick is the paper? How big are
the zeros? Full moon or new? Wouldn't you get writer's cramp? Do
you start at sea level, or on top of one of Donald Trump's towers?
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, that vivid little image was wrong. Very, very wrong,
as a handful (an imprecise number far, far smaller than a
googolplex) of readers rushed to point out.
</P>
<P>
   One writer, a math and computer science professor, ridiculed the
lunar in-basket as having a measly 15 quadrillion zeros. Another,
after offering his own calculation, wrote, ``Even if you could
stack paper up to the edge of the known universe, it still wouldn't
be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another: ``Your article points to the need to teach many
`educated' people to understand numbers (and our universe) just a
wee bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   And a final letter, after noting that in the universe ``there is
not even a sufficient amount of matter available to write out a
googol's worth of zeroes,'' concludes, ``Thankfully, there is no
need to.''
</P>
<P>
   So how big is a googolplex? Get out some paper, start writing
zeros, and do it, well, pretty much forever.

   The Yankees (and Baseball) Win &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the veteran pitcher, found himself hoarding
newspapers after the New York Yankees ended their extraordinary
season with a World Series sweep of the San Diego Padres. ``I'm
curious to see what everyone is saying about us and how we stack
up'' in history, Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Yankees are arguably the best team ever. They
accumulated a record of 125 victories (against 50 losses) in the
regular season and postseason. More to the point, they played with
a unique intensity and respect for their opponents, taking nothing
for granted in a season of many twists.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells pitched a perfect game May 17. Bernie Williams won a
batting title. Cone won 20 games. And Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez
emerged as a frontline pitcher less than six months after defecting
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the first round of the playoffs, the slugger Darryl
Strawberry was found to have colon cancer. So his teammates had his
number, 39, embroidered on the backs of their caps as they blitzed
to the 24th championship in Yankee history. The owner, George
Steinbrenner, and the manager, Joe Torre, were moved to tears when
they won, and Derek Jeter and others called Strawberry at his New
Jersey home, screaming happily to him on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stirring conclusion to a season that saw Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa break the 37-year-old home run record, allowing fans
nationwide to share in a rebirth of baseball.

MONTHS AFTER COMA, 2-WAY PLAYER RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In late July, Dan DiCorcia lay in a coma at Jersey Shore Medical
Center in Neptune, N.J. Nearly three months later, DiCorcia, the
captain of Point Pleasant Beach High School team, has not only
avoided brain surgery, but he has also resumed his career as a
Division I prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five minutes before game time, I just started bawling,''
DiCorcia said of his first game back on Oct. 2, in which he was the
defensive star with 14 tackles. ``From being introduced when they
called out the starting defense through the national anthem, I was
so emotional. I was just so happy to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his return, DiCorcia, an all-Ocean County quarterback and
defensive back, has shown flashes of the promise that first
attracted interest from Boston College, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan
State, Rutgers and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In three games, DiCorcia has run for 100 yards on 28 carries and
has completed 14 of 33 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown. He has
recorded 32 tackles, intercepted a pass, knocked down a pass and
recovered a fumble. His punts an average of 32 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not 100 percent yet,'' said his coach, Joe Fitzsimmons.
``Mentally, he's OK But he still has to play himself back into
football-playing shape.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCorcia was trying to write a happy ending to a scary story
Saturday, when Point Pleasant (2-3) played host to Keansburg (0-5).
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, DiCorcia went to the movies in Brick, when he
suddenly developed a severe headache. He broke out in a cold sweat,
could not stand and began vomiting uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Danny get sick many times before and he never
reacted like that,'' said Katie Miller, a senior, who has known him
since kindergarten. ``I was really scared.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old DiCorcia was rushed to Brick Hospital, where he
was diagnosed as suffering from dehydration. Still in pain several
hours later, DiCorcia was transported to Jersey Shore's trauma
center. There DiCorcia slipped into a two-day coma. A shunt was
inserted into his head to relieve bleeding and excessive pressure
to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was in one of those horror movies where they bring
the clergyman in to read the last rites,'' Barbara DiCorcia, his
mother, said. ``It was so surreal. I just thought my son had
dehydration.''
</P>
<P>
   For DiCorcia's family and this tiny Jersey Shore community _ one
a half square miles with a year-round population of 5,600 _ the
possibility of losing another teen-ager was far too much to handle.
Three weeks earlier, Michelle Sirchio of DiCorcia's graduating
class, which consists of 100 students, collapsed and died while
talking on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 visitors came each day that Danny spent in the
hospital. It was not uncommon to see them all holding hands and
praying together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small town, and these kids are like family to each
other,'' Barbara DiCorcia said. ``They just recovered from a
funeral, and then Danny went down. We had to support them and
understand their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days after Danny regained consciousness, doctors at
Jersey Shore were convinced that DiCorcia had an aneurysm that
required exploratory brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The DiCorcias sought a second opinion from Dr. Robert Solomon, a
neurosurgeon at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York.
DiCorcia was transferred to Columbia Presbyterian, where a series
of tests were done, including a CAT scan, magnetic resonance
imaging, electrocardiogram and an angiogram.
</P>
<P>
   According to the DiCorcias, Danny's problem was one that
basically could heal itself and did not require surgery. On Sept.
11, DiCorcia was cleared to play football again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to verbalize to him that I didn't want him
to play,'' said Barbara DiCorcia. ``But it's something that he
loves to do. I didn't feel that it's my place to take that away
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCorcia knows he will have to prove that he is the same player
who last season led the Garnet Gulls in passing (671 yards),
rushing (744 yards), scoring (12 touchdowns), kick returns (2 for
touchdowns), tackles (78), interceptions (4) and caused fumbles
(5). He also averaged 37 yards a punt. He has regained most of the
30 pounds he lost in 2 weeks from his 6-foot-2{-inch, 180-pound
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that if I play well the rest of the year, schools
will look at me and say, `Gee, this kid didn't lose it,''' said
DiCorcia, who weighs 170 pounds. ``I want them to look and me and
say, `He could still play for us.''' &QL;

GINGRICH DRAWS FIRE FROM THE RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich is under fire from his
conservative flank. Again.
</P>
<P>
   The chief complaint these days is over the federal budget he
helped negotiate. Gingrich is accused of abandoning conservative
principles in the budget by breaking spending limits, for not
pushing for tax cuts and by directing money to pork-barrel
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 percent of House Republicans voted against the budget,
which was approved by more Democrats than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that Gingrich let President Clinton set the terms
for the budget debate, Robert Novak, the columnist, accused the
speaker of ``a mindless tactical incompetence that insures
defeat.'' David Keene, head of the American Conservative Union,
said Gingrich's negotiating stance showed ``cowardice under fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who brought Republicans to power in 1994, remains an
icon for many in the party. He is its premier fund-raiser and his
party's most recognizable national voice. But he has faced
persistent and nettlesome criticism from his right wing as he has
tried to grow from a self-styled revolutionary into the
speakership, a job that is third in line to the presidency. And his
right wing will not let him forget his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as criticism swelled over his handling of the budget,
Gingrich's irritation with the conservatives burst into public
view. Gingrich took to the House floor and suggested that he had
matured and his critics had not, chastising them as
``perfectionists'' who did not understand the nature of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   His defenders said the speech reflected only a momentary
frustration with a vocal minority, noting that there is no
challenge to his leadership, as there was in 1997, and that scores
of members are eager for him to campaign with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always 11 or 12 people who are mad about anything,''
said Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform and a close
adviser to the speaker. And a top Republican aide said, ``This is a
short-term tactical difference rather than a philosophical
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the criticism reveals divisions within the party that
make governing a constant challenge for the speaker, who is
concluding the fourth year of what he has said will be no more than
a six-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are riven by internal splits between
conservatives and moderates and between traditional
business-oriented Republicans and those driven by social concerns.
This makes it hard for Gingrich to move bills without Democratic
support. And House Republicans are divided from Senate Republicans.
Their split over tax cuts earlier this year stalled the budget
process from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   The harping at Gingrich from the right comes as he moves into a
season of dicey political calculations. He leads a Congress that is
weighing impeachment of a president, for only the third time in
history. Conservatives could revolt if Republican leaders try any
bargaining with the White House that appears to let Clinton off the
hook. And Gingrich is pondering whether to run for president
himself, aware that the Republican primaries are dominated by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In these last days before the election, Gingrich is doing all he
can to prove his value to his party, dialing for dollars and
barnstorming the country for Republican candidates. He is in a
desperate drive to inflate his majority in the House and to
increase Republican victories in state legislatures, which will
control congressional redistricting after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Even if conservatives are only a minority, Gingrich knows that
he risks destabilizing the House by ignoring them; they might rise
and revolt, as they did during the coup attempt. But if he cedes
too much to the right, he risks alienating the moderates, whom he
also needs because his 11-seat majority is so thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no chance of passing anything other than mush with an
11-vote majority,'' said Tony Blankley, a commentator and former
spokesman for Gingrich. ``There is no point in declaring war when
you've got a squad and you need a battalion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' struggle, Blankley said, is to learn ``how not
to sell out and still function as a team.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, a Texas Democrat who directs where to spend
money in congressional races, agreed that Gingrich had been hobbled
by the divisions within his party and the narrowness of his
majority. But he also said Gingrich had made some bad calls. He
said the speaker had miscalculated by allowing the budget process
to degenerate all year and then to become the matter on which
Congress closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have had the last vote on impeachment and not let
us come back on the budget,'' Frost said, adding that the White
House ``ran circles'' around Gingrich in the budget deal and left
Gingrich taking the blame for the messy process that produced the
4,000-page document, largely in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Palazzolo, a political scientist at the University of
Richmond who has written extensively about the speaker, said that
because of his early revolutionary zeal, Gingrich had raised
expectations among his followers. And his lurch toward pragmatism
and his need to manage the factions, just like an old-fashioned
speaker, has inevitably let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he was going to change Western civilization from
the speakership and that the Republican Party would be his army,''
Palazzolo said. ``But political parties aren't armies. They're
fractious organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 3 elections mark Gingrich's next public reckoning. If
Republicans pick up a substantial number of seats in the House,
Gingrich's tactics, style and management could be vindicated; if
they pick up few or none, he will be blamed for a dramatic shift in
fortunes for a party that has made broad gains since he came to
power, and has been expecting big wins this year because of the
scandal involving Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. Indeed, if
Republicans fail to make serious gains, Gingrich's leadership could
be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said last week that the Republicans could gain anywhere
between 10 and 40 seats. The National Republican Congressional
Committee predicts a gain of between 10 and 15. Democrats say
Republicans are dreaming and that Democrats will lose no more than
a handful of seats.

CLINTON IS EVOKED IN NORTH CAROLINA RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ In the waning days of a struggling
re-election campaign, Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina is
working frantically to blemish the telegenic appeal of his
Democratic challenger, John Edwards, by linking Edwards to another
Democrat whose telegenic appeal once masked deeper flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Edwards has been an absolute surrogate for Bill Clinton,''
Faircloth said at a barbecue Friday night that served chopped pork,
fried chicken and a smorgasbord of Clinton-bashing by Faircloth's
own surrogates _ Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky and former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties consider the North Carolina race vital in
determining whether the Republicans will attain the 60 seats needed
to block a Democratic filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   The Faircloth message was not just delivered by the Republican
heavyweights brought in to bolster his campaign. It also began to
dominate his television advertising Friday with three new
commercials that depict Edwards and Clinton as ``two tobacco-taxing
liberals who have a habit of stretching the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 45, a successful trial lawyer from Raleigh, said in an
interview Friday night that the new multifront assault by
Faircloth, 70, was ``just nonsense.'' He added: ``The truth just
doesn't mean anything to these people. And the worse they see their
campaign doing, the more mean-spirited they get.''
</P>
<P>
   National officials with both parties said that no other
Republican Senate candidate has tried so directly to sully a
Democratic opponent by using Clinton's involvement in the Monica
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   But polls show that North Carolinians, who never cared much for
Clinton, have been less forgiving of his recent transgressions than
many Americans. Polls also show that Edwards, with no record to
pick apart and a courtroom lawyer's stage presence, is in a dead
heat with Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running scared,'' said Faircloth, who last week hired
Arthur Finkelstein, a New York strategist known for negative
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But in this burgeoning, bipartisan state, the numbers may work
in Faircloth's favor. Although 52 percent of North Carolina's
voters are registered as Democrats, that number has dropped from 61
percent since Faircloth's first election in 1992, when he narrowly
defeated his ailing former ally, Sen. Terry Sanford. Voter
registration has increased 25 percent since then, with only one of
five new voters signing up as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1975 when Sam Ervin last held it, Faircloth's seat has
offered little job security, changing hands and parties in each of
the last three elections.
</P>
<P>
   It is therefore a measure of how desperate Faircloth is to scuff
up Edwards, or of how unpopular Clinton is in North Carolina, that
the senator and his allies intensified their attacks on the day the
president brokered a Middle East peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   At the barbecue in this town on Tobacco Road, McConnell, the
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called
Edwards ``Bill Clinton's new best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms asserted that Edwards ``stands with the Clinton
liberals.'' Helms said that Faircloth's defeat could dash ``any
hope whatsoever of dethroning the man who has committed the high
crime and misdemeanor of making America the laughing stock of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But the assertion with the most sting in this region is voiced
in Faircloth's new advertisements, which suggest that Edwards joins
Clinton in backing a tax increase on cigarettes. Questioned Friday
night, Faircloth offered no evidence for that contention other
than: ``Mr. Clinton supports tobacco taxes. Mr. Edwards supports
Mr. Clinton on everything. So he supports him on tobacco taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Edwards said in the interview that he ``completely
disagrees with President Clinton on this issue, and I would not
vote with him.'' He said he would support ``a reasonable
tobacco-tax increase'' only as a part of comprehensive tobacco
legislation that would provide adequate compensation to farmers for
lost production and protection from liability for cigarette makers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republican strategists have made clear that they also are trying
to link Edwards to Clinton stylistically. Edwards' strengths,
political scientists in the state said, are his youth, energy,
eloquence, boyish good looks and a blue-eyed earnestness that leaps
through the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   By depicting Clinton side by side with Edwards, and noting
repeatedly that the president raised $400,000 for his campaign, the
Republicans hope to raise doubts about whether those traits are
always winning ones, the strategists said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has focused more on the biographies of the
candidates than on any particular issues.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is one of the most acclaimed trial lawyers in the state,
but has never held public office. He has won many
multimillion-dollar judgments for injury victims and has lent his
campaign $4.8 million of the $6.3 million it has spent. His wealth
has allowed him to eschew contributions from lobbyists and
political action committees, and he has focused his somewhat vague
message on improving schools and giving patients increased rights
to sue managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth has assailed Edwards' profession, but the lawyer has
tried to turn it to his advantage by telling voters he that has
``spent my life representing regular people against very powerful
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth was a fixture of North Carolina's Democratic
establishment before switching parties to run against Sanford. A
farmer and businessman, Faircloth is a solid conservative best
known as a deal maker who wins money for North Carolina projects.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, who does not share Edwards' friendly relationship
with the language or the camera, has refused to debate. But when
the two confronted each other for the first time at a barbecue on
Thursday, North Carolina newspapers printed the full text of their
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice to finally meet you, senator,'' Edwards said, shaking his
rival's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice to meet you,'' Faircloth parried. ``Nice day for a
barbecue.''

Democratic opponent by using Clinton's involvement in the Monica
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   But polls show that North Carolinians, who never cared much for
Clinton, have been less forgiving of his recent transgressions than
many Americans. Polls also show that Edwards, with no record to
pick apart and a courtroom lawyer's stage presence, is in a dead
heat with Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running scared,'' said Faircloth, who last week hired
Arthur Finkelstein, a New York strategist known for negative
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But in this burgeoning, bipartisan state, the numbers may work
in Faircloth's favor. Although 52 percent of North Carolina's
voters are registered as Democrats, that number has dropped from 61
percent since Faircloth's first election in 1992, when he narrowly
defeated his ailing former ally, Sen. Terry Sanford. Voter
registration has increased 25 percent since then, with only one of
five new voters signing up as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1975 when Sam Ervin last held it, Faircloth's seat has
offered little job security, changing hands and parties in each of
the last three elections.
</P>
<P>
   It is therefore a measure of how desperate Faircloth is to scuff
up Edwards, or of how unpopular Clinton is in North Carolina, that
the senator and his allies intensified their attacks on the day the
president brokered a Middle East peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   At the barbecue in this town on Tobacco Road, McConnell, the
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called
Edwards ``Bill Clinton's new best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms asserted that Edwards ``stands with the Clinton
liberals.'' Helms said that Faircloth's defeat could dash ``any
hope whatsoever of dethroning the man who has committed the high
crime and misdemeanor of making America the laughing stock of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But the assertion with the most sting in this region is voiced
in Faircloth's new advertisements, which suggest that Edwards joins
Clinton in backing a tax increase on cigarettes. Questioned Friday
night, Faircloth offered no evidence for that contention other
than: ``Mr. Clinton supports tobacco taxes. Mr. Edwards supports
Mr. Clinton on everything. So he supports him on tobacco taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Edwards said in the interview that he ``completely
disagrees with President Clinton on this issue, and I would not
vote with him.'' He said he would support ``a reasonable
tobacco-tax increase'' only as a part of comprehensive tobacco
legislation that would provide adequate compensation to farmers for
lost production and protection from liability for cigarette makers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republican strategists have made clear that they also are trying
to link Edwards to Clinton stylistically. Edwards' strengths,
political scientists in the state said, are his youth, energy,
eloquence, boyish good looks and a blue-eyed earnestness that leaps
through the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   By depicting Clinton side by side with Edwards, and noting
repeatedly that the president raised $400,000 for his campaign, the
Republicans hope to raise doubts about whether those traits are
always winning ones, the strategists said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has focused more on the biographies of the
candidates than on any particular issues.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is one of the most acclaimed trial lawyers in the state,
but has never held public office. He has won many
multimillion-dollar judgments for injury victims and has lent his
campaign $4.8 million of the $6.3 million it has spent. His wealth
has allowed him to eschew contributions from lobbyists and
political action committees, and he has focused his somewhat vague
message on improving schools and giving patients increased rights
to sue managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth has assailed Edwards' profession, but the lawyer has
tried to turn it to his advantage by telling voters he that has
``spent my life representing regular people against very powerful
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth was a fixture of North Carolina's Democratic
establishment before switching parties to run against Sanford. A
farmer and businessman, Faircloth is a solid conservative best
known as a deal maker who wins money for North Carolina projects.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, who does not share Edwards' friendly relationship
with the language or the camera, has refused to debate. But when
the two confronted each other for the first time at a barbecue on
Thursday, North Carolina newspapers printed the full text of their
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice to finally meet you, senator,'' Edwards said, shaking his
rival's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice to meet you,'' Faircloth parried. ``Nice day for a
barbecue.''

(ATTN: BRAZIL)  
 CLEUSA MILLET, 67, LEADER OF CELEBRATED CANDOMBLE TEMPLE IN
BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Cleusa Millet, a former nurse who
became the spiritual leader of one of the most celebrated Candomble
temples in Brazil, died on Oct. 15 in Salvador da Bahia. She was
67.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers reported the cause of death as heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Mother Cleusa, Mrs. Millet presided over the Candomble
temple at Alto do Gantois in Salvador, Brazil's first capital, now
home to a flourishing renaissance of Afro-Brazilian culture.
Candomble is the strongest of Brazil's syncretist religions, mixing
the nature-based beliefs some 4 million slaves brought from Africa
with the Catholicism of the Portuguese colonists.
</P>
<P>
   Its pantheon of orixas _ gods and goddesses of wind, oceans,
still water, metals and fire _ correspond to Catholic saints, and
appear in masks and swaying skirts of raffia.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Cleusa took over the Gantois terreiro, as the temple is
known, from her mother, Maria Escolastica da Conceicao Nazare,
known as Mother Menininha, after her mother's death 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A towering figure in Afro-Brazilian culture, Mother Menininha
helped transform Candomble from a belief whose rituals of animal
sacrifice, possession, music and dance were persecuted as a form of
devil worship to a religion accepted in the highest levels of
society. Though initially reluctant to give up her nursing career,
Mother Cleusa tended her mother and the Gantois temple during her
mother's final years of ailing health, eventually agreeing to
succeed her, if that were to be her fate.
</P>
<P>
   She became the new high priestess through a ritual known as
throwing the shells, in which the orixas are said to select the new
spiritual leader of a temple through the shells. The Gantois is one
of the few Candomble temples in Brazil whose leadership has passed
along blood lines and has always been headed by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Cleusa represented the continuity of an important line
in Candomble,'' said Jeferson Bacelar, an anthropology professor at
the Center for the Afro-Oriental Studies at the Federal University
of Bahia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mother Cleusa was not known for initiating any dramatic changes
in Candomble, but dedicated herself to tending what her mother had
built. With the help of wealthy patrons, she renovated the temple
and created a memorial to her mother that became a kind of museum
of Candomble. She collected donations from the Brazilian rich and
renown, some of whom have become devotees of Candomble with the
religion's growing popularity in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends and associates included the singers Gilberto Gil,
Maria Bethania and Caetano Veloso, and the president of the Senate,
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. Several times, Mother Cleusa met with
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who once said that he was born
``with one foot in the kitchen,'' an expression suggesting he was
part black. The governor of Bahia declared a day of official
mourning for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very fine person,'' said Zelia Gattai, a Brazilian
writer. ``She would help anybody who needed her.'' Ms. Gattai's
husband, Jorge Amado, the author, was also friends with Mother
Cleusa.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very much like her mother,'' said Walson Botelho,
artistic director of the Bale Folclorico da Bahia, who is a senior
figure in another Candomble temple in Salvador. ``She had a
conciliatory spirit, and was a good, honest person,'' said Botelho.
``She treated everybody the same, whether it was a poor person or
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the seventh day after her death, followers held
the last funeral ceremony at her temple, Botelho said. In the
center of the room were the objects she loved, including her
favorite foods, clothes and belongings. The drums, which are
associated with the orixas, remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   The natural successor to Mother Cleusa is her eldest daughter,
Monica Millet. Mother Cleusa is survived by three other children as
well. They are Alvaro, Zeno Eduardo and Ana Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   A percussionist for Gil and other top musicians, Monica Millet,
37, has said she does not intend to take her mother's place as the
high priestess of Candomble. But then again, her mother was once
heard to say the same.

EDITORIAL: CHARLES SCHUMER FOR SENATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 5:
</P>
<P>
   New York's U.S. Senate race this year is one of those rare
contests in which it is a pleasure to take sides. The incumbent
Republican, Alfonse D'Amato, is a strong campaigner and a powerful
politician who knows how to get things done. But his opponent, Rep.
Charles Schumer, is a more serious lawmaker with more rooted
values, sounder policy positions and a deeper commitment to the
common good.
</P>
<P>
   The chunks of pork that D'Amato boasts of bringing home are no
fair exchange for the damage he does with his impulsive style and
devotion to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   New York deserves a senator who will grow in gravitas, not just
in volume. The state needs a senator who hearkens to the yearnings
of the average citizen rather than to the demands of contributors
and his party's ideologues.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's talent for political pyrotechnics has obscured the
fact that he is far to the right of the average New Yorker on many
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He supported the disastrous Gingrich-Lott strategy of forcing a
government shutdown in order to try to blackmail the White House
into accepting repeal of key parts of the social safety net. He
sides with the extreme positions of the National Rifle Association
in opposing gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, in contrast, has been responsible for legislation to
curb the sale of handguns to criminals and the mentally
incompetent. D'Amato has consistently voted to deprive women of the
right to legal abortion, while Schumer was responsible for passage
of legislation to protect the right of access to abortion clinics.
D'Amato has an unreliable record when it comes to legislation that
protects the environment. Schumer's is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, a successful but greedily unselective fund-raiser, has
snubbed the crusade for campaign-finance reform by uttering
platitudes about fixing the system but working behind the scenes to
kill the McCain-Feingold reform bill. Schumer, although he has been
a prodigious fund-raiser himself, has been a consistent supporter
of bills to control the power of special interests in American
elections. He was a faithful supporter of campaign finance reform
not only this year, but also in the past, when Democrats were in
the majority and his own party leadership was far less enthusiastic
about talk of change.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's re-election pitch has always been his ability to
deliver for New York as ``Senator Pothole.'' Although that talent
seems to go into higher gear as elections near, he has scored some
real triumphs in matters like getting the state its fair share of
transportation funds and securing help for Holocaust victims in
their fight with Swiss banking authorities. He has sometimes risen
to the occasion on other fronts, most notably his handling of the
Senate hearings on Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   But he mainly is a man of the moment, who wins skirmishes
without holding any greater vision of what the fight is for. He
picks up cash for individual projects back home, but consistently
undermines the state's long-term interests in the Senate. While
other Republicans from the Northeast have fought to push their
party toward the center, D'Amato buys into the overall vision of
the Senate leadership, which is anti-urban and focused on the
economic needs of the South and West.
</P>
<P>
   The question before the voters, then, is how to use the past of
these two men as a guide to the future. D'Amato will remain what he
has always been, a scrapper who brings home at least some of the
bacon and from time to time has to explain that his latest gaffe
was not really intended as a slur against ethnic group X or
religion Y or constituency group Z.
</P>
<P>
   With Al D'Amato, what you see is what you get, and what you get
is often vital, sometimes useful and always unpredictable. But it
is not now and never will be the kind of balanced leadership that
New York ought to be supplying to the Senate and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to D'Amato, Schumer has used the 18 years since his
election to the House to mature from a raw and ambitious young
politician to a man with the legislative skills, overarching policy
interests and demeanor of a high-impact senator. Unlike D'Amato,
Schumer has not faced questions about relatives using his Capitol
office for business purposes or endured congressional ethics
investigations. Voters should not forget that D'Amato has never
arranged for the Senate Ethics Committee to release his testimony
during closed hearings on conflict-of-interest charges against him.
Sealing records and escaping legal sanction are not good enough.
New York needs a senator of notorious probity, and Schumer fits
that bill.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that Schumer, who is one of the most infamous
workaholics in Congress, has been attacked by D'Amato as a no-show
representative. The consistent harping on Schumer's attendance
record was trivial, but it was also a tactically brilliant piece of
demagogy that flattened the flight path of the Schumer campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of building a poll lead as he needed to last week,
Schumer has been struggling to hold his altitude. The political
reality is that he can win, but he will need a flawless performance
on the stump, smart and incessant advertising and every available
progressive vote to do so. Schumer and the electorate will have to
beware of last-minute tricks from D'Amato, such as his promise in
1992 not to seek re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage for Schumer is that D'Amato's desperate and
overreaching charges may tilt the advantage back. The D'Amato
attempt to capitalize on Schumer's missed procedural vote on using
the Capitol Rotunda for a Holocaust memorial carried the whiff of
panic. So, too, did D'Amato's use of a vulgar term to describe
Schumer and his ridiculing of Rep. Jerrold Nadler for being portly.
These incidents reminded voters of the cruelty and tastelessness
that have pocked this Senator's career.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, the deal D'Amato offers voters is rough and candid.
They have to put up with his gaffes, ethical problems and loyalty
to an ultraconservative agenda because he knows how to play the
bureaucracy and the budget game to get New York's slice of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   But opportunism, however skillfully executed, is not leadership
appropriate for a state that historically has been a national
seedbed for talent in both parties. Schumer has the capacity to
become the kind of senator New York deserves, a senator who will
engender pride rather than embarrassment, a senator who will lead
Congress on education, the environment, health care, gun control
and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   For all those reasons, we endorse Charles Schumer for the U.S.
Senate.

COMMENTARY: THE MORNING AFTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the morning after being defeated by Benjamin Netanyahu in
Israel's 1996 elections, the Labor Party leader, Shimon Peres, was
asked what he thought happened. ``The Israelis lost,'' said Peres.
``The Jews won.''
</P>
<P>
   What Peres was referring to was his notion that Israel had
become divided between ``Israelis'' and ``Jews.'' The ``Israelis''
tend to be secular, with their primary loyalty to Israel as a state
and their own individual and material advancement. They see
Israel's future as being in the peace process and in greater and
greater integration with the region and the world at large. The
Israelis, though, come in two varieties: the dovish, liberal
Israelis (49 percent) and the conservative, security-hawk Israelis
(25.5 percent). The dovish Israelis pretty much liked Oslo as it
was, and voted for Peres; the security-hawk Israelis wanted a
better Oslo, and voted for Bibi to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Jews''(25.5 percent), by contrast, come from the
traditional and Orthodox communities, the West Bank settlements and
the religious-Zionist movements. They are devoted to a traditional
conception of Judaism and see the Israeli state as a means to
fulfill Judaism's commandments, not as an end itself. The Jews are
skeptical of integration, which they equate with assimilation, and
they see Israel as fated to perpetually struggle with its
non-Jewish neighbors. They were threatened by Oslo and voted for
Bibi in hopes that he would kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Bibi's heart always seemed to be with the Jews, but his head _
and his electoral future _ was always with the Israeli hawks (and
doves). For two years, he did all he could to avoid having to
choose between them, but when finally forced to do so _ when
presented with a credible Palestinian security plan, undergirded by
the CIA _ Netanyahu opted for a deal based on what most Israelis
wanted (a better Oslo), not on what most Jews wanted (no more
Oslo).
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Bibi did something hugely important. He brought the
Israeli hawks into Oslo, adding them to the Israeli doves who were
already there, and thereby put the Oslo accords on a solid
foundation of 75 percent of the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Israelis are now all on board, but many of the
Israeli Jews are still not. The crucial political question is, Can
Bibi bring the Jews into Oslo as well? Until now, Bibi has kept the
Jews on board _ while negotiating with the Palestinians _ by
constantly delegitimizing Yasser Arafat, building settlements and
playing down prospects for any deal. He has been like Nixon going
to China, while all the time telling his people he was just
visiting Taiwan. But this time it is clear to everyone: He has gone
to China. He is doing his own deal with Yasser. And God bless him
for it.
</P>
<P>
   But for this deal to work, Bibi has to treat the Palestinians as
a real partner (and they him) and freeze settlements and rein in
Jewish extremists, every bit as much as Arafat has to rein in
Hamas. And that means he has to find a way to hold the Jews, and
bring them along into Oslo, not by playing on their fears of peace
with the Palestinians, but by constructing a positive vision of it
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi has now taken ownership of the pragmatic side of the Oslo
peace process and made it better and more popular,'' said Stephen
Cohen of the Center for Middle East Peace. ``But now Bibi has got
to begin to build a constituency among the Jews of Israel for peace
as something more than a defeat of the Palestinians or the result
of coercion from Washington. It has to have a positive meaning for
them _ if they are to give him the space he needs, not only to
implement this deal, but to reach a final accord. He has got to
start persuading the Jewish Jews that a smaller Israel, at peace
with the Palestinians and respected in the region, will lead to the
real `Greater Israel.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bibi's first instinct, though, seems to be to tell the Jews that
he had no choice, that he got them the least bad option, and to try
to toss them bones like the release of Jonathan Pollard. That may
work for some for a while, but it won't cut it for long. Because as
Oslo moves forward, and more territory is ceded, these Jews will
feel they are losing their Israel, and that will make them very
dangerous. This is the time when Bibi needs something more than
pragmatism. He needs the thing that Shimon Peres was so often
ridiculed for _ a vision of Israel at peace that will make a
settlement with the Palestinians a positive choice not just for
Israel's Israelis, but also for its Jews.

THE REAL PRESSURE ON TOLLES IS FOR HIM TO KEEP PLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Tommy Tolles has learned a lot about
pressure, frustration and adversity this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tolles was one of the PGA Tour's rising players, a contender to
make the Ryder Cup team, a player who had nine top-10 finishes in
1997. But this year, Tolles started slowly, his problems
snowballed, and his confidence melted. He arrived at the National
Car Rental Golf Classic at Walt Disney World clinging to his tour
card, holding the 124th position on the money list. Only the top
125 on the money list after this weekend will secure automatic
playing privileges for next year. Tolles has no interest in
returning to qualifying school, but he said he would if he must.
</P>
<P>
   So far last week, during which Tolles turned 32, has responded
with one of his best performances of the year. Standing at
three-under par for the tournament after rounds of 71 and 70,
Tolles entered Saturday's third round tied for 29th, just four
strokes off the lead. And Tolles knew that if he avoided a weekend
collapse, he stood an excellent chance of securing his tour card
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years at this point, I was trying to get
into the top 30 on the money list, which I thought was a lot of
pressure,'' Tolles said. ``This year all of a sudden, I'm trying to
fight for job security, and the pressure is even greater. At least
so far this week, things have gone pretty well. But I still have to
finish it off.''
</P>
<P>
   The year has been a humbling experience for Tolles, but it has
happened to others. Knowing that has given Tolles some consolation.
``I remember seeing guys who had finished really high on the money
list one year end up in qualifying school the next,'' said Tolles,
a former star at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way it is. When you have your opportunities,
you have to make the most of them. If you don't, you end up in
situations like this.''
</P>
<P>
   There are so many things that Tolles misses about being one of
the better players on tour _ the respect from his peers, the
notoriety. Now, instead of being congratulated at his locker for
having a strong tournament, people stop by to offer encouragement,
or simply keep walking, not knowing exactly what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was so much fun, just having the thrill of the hunt,
being competitive,'' Tolles said. ``I have really missed that. I've
learned a lot about myself. That's a place where everybody needs to
be, near the center of attention. You learn so much about yourself
and life in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Things started to go downhill for Tolles during the summer of
1997, when he was fighting to stay in the top 10 on the Ryder Cup
points list. It was a huge letdown when he failed to make the
United States team that went to Spain, and he has never played as
well since finishing third at the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fighting so hard, and instead of fighting the course, I
was fighting myself,'' Tolles said of his attempt to make the Ryder
team. ``I had all these emotions running through my head. I thought
it was going to be the greatest thing that ever happened to me,
something I could tell my kids and grandkids about. When it didn't
happen, I kind of hid under a rock for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I realized it wasn't the end of the world. It wasn't
the last Ryder Cup ever. There'll be other opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Cink, who begins the third round just three strokes off
the lead, will also need a strong finish this weekend. But he needs
it to qualify for this week's Tour Championship at East Lake Golf
Club in Atlanta. East Lake is Cink's home course, and he badly
wants to play this week. But the Tour Championship is for the top
30 on the money list, and Cink is currently 31st.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been outside of the top 30 until the last month,''
said Cink, last year's PGA Tour rookie of the year. ``I don't
consider the top 30 to be gravy. I think I should be there. I'm
almost embarrassed not to get in.'' Andrew Magee, who is 30th on
the money list, missed the cut Friday. He leads Cink by nearly
$78,000. &QL;

 &HT;    John Glenn . . . 77 and still climbing
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCOA BEACH, Fla. _ The tourists used to line the roadways and
waterfront in droves, camping in tents and RVs for days on end, all
for the chance to see America's flyboy heroes ride thundering
rockets into the wild blue yonder.
</P>
<P>
   The button-down engineers labored through marathon work sessions
trying to invent the air locks and thrusters and heat shields
needed to catch up with the elusive Russians, then they poured into
bars with names like the Mousetrap and partied the night away.
</P>
<P>
   The boom times that swept this once quiet stretch of Florida
beachfront in the 1960s as America leapt toward the stars are long
gone, nothing more than swirling memories shared by graying men as
they sip afternoon cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   But a little bit of that past is coming back to Florida's Space
Coast this week as 77-year-old Sen. John Glenn, one of the nation's
seven original astronaut heroes, returns for a long-hoped-for
second trip into space. Officials expect up to 300,000 spectators
for the mission _ double the usual number for a shuttle liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the electricity in the air,'' declares Wanda Lee
Massie, the veteran bartender at Bernard's Surf, a 50-year-old
watering hole where patrons piled onto the street on a sunny day in
1962 to watch Glenn parade past in an open Corvette sitting next to
Vice President Lyndon Johnson. ``It'll be just like it was before.
We should be packed every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism honchos sure hope so.
</P>
<P>
   This area has ridden a space-related economic roller coaster for
decades,filling up with thousands of new residents for programs
like Gemini and Apollo only to watch the booms go bust when
Congress yanked the funding and the nation's commitment to space
seemed to waver.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of trying, local leaders have managed to wean
their economy away from space somewhat, attracting the tourists and
retirees who have fueled the rest of Florida's boom as a more
dependable economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   Now the launches that once drew armies of engineers, dignitaries
and tourists are pretty much routine. A hundred thousand spectators
still may show up, and the beachfront bars may enjoy an afternoon
crush, but the sense of boomtown excitement _ the feeling that the
nation's eyes were focused on Cape Canaveral _ has slipped into the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime locals miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' says Pete Godke, 67, whose family ran an
ocean-front hotel in Cocoa Beach in the 1940s, when the streets
were sand, the bridges were one-lane wooden spans and only 10
families called the place home. ``There was so much excitement
then. This mission will bring the nation's attention back to the
space program again. It will be wonderful for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, few dreamed the place would ever be more than a
side-trip for Yankee tourists on their way to Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Orange groves lined the narrow barrier island, and tourists were
far outnumbered by lumbering sea turtles, which crawled onto the
beach each summer to lay their eggs in pits dug laboriously in the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the big excitement for the tourists,'' Godke recalls.
``We all had beach buggies, and we'd drive them out to see a turtle
laying eggs. Or take them over to Pelican Island to take their
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Things started to change in the 1950s, when the military
imported a bunch of German rocket scientists who began
experimenting with missiles that seemed to blow up in bright
fireballs over the Atlantic as often as they made it into space.
</P>
<P>
   Then Russia launched Sputnik, the world's first satellite,
followed by the first manned space flight. President John F.
Kennedy announced America's mission to put a man on the moon by the
end of the 1960s, and the space race was on.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Joyce, 73, moved to Cocoa Beach in 1963 to work at the post
office after a friend from Illinois told him the postmaster
couldn't find enough help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had a flat-top haircut because they all wanted to
look like the astronauts,'' he recalls. ``The engineers all wore
white shirts, black ties and black pants. Everybody kept telling me
I could make more money sweeping floors out at the Cape than I
could at the post office.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce stayed at the post office, and watched the town grow from
sand streets and orange groves into a bustling area filled with
motels, restaurants and bars, all of which seemed to be graced by
signs with some sort of rocket, missile or space station outlined
in flashing neon.
</P>
<P>
   The boom times brought a frontier atmosphere, fueled by the
heady sense that history was being made. Brutal work shifts were
followed by stress-relieving bar sessions, with everything leading
to a frenzy at launch-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wild,'' Joyce says. ``When they had a launch, everybody
got screwy. They all went to the Vanguard Motel and by the end of
it, all the furniture wound up in the pool, along with a few young
ladies who may or may not have had clothes on. The astronauts all
had a bunch of Corvettes and they used to race up and down the
beach. They never got a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere got so wild that NBC News did a report calling
the area ``Sin City,'' bemoaning the devil-may-care attitude and
the wild parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the work got done, and history was made.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Ransom, now 73, was brought in to manage the Cape Colony
Motel, bought as an investment by several of the astronauts. He
spent a lot of time with the heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just good, outstanding, dedicated guys,'' he says.
``They knew their mission and they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ransom got into a post-work jawboning session with a group of
the astronauts once, and after hearing them describe trying to eat
goo out of a tube, suggested they make some corned-beef sandwiches
for the next mission. They tried it, smuggling the eats aboard in
John Young's space suit, only to see the sandwiches disintegrate in
the weightless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they brought the capsule back, there were bread crumbs
everywhere,'' Ransom recalls.
</P>
<P>
   After the astronauts made it to the moon, the nation's
space-mania faded. NASA became more politicized and bureaucratized,
fighting to survive as just another government program hungry for
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Burned by massive layoffs that saw some families simply walk
away from houses they couldn't pay for, the Space Coast slowly
shifted its focus from space to tourism.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is still a top draw, but the neon rocket signs have been
replaced by garden-variety emblems for motels and fast-food joints
like any other American city.
</P>
<P>
   For old-timers, though, Glenn brings back one last chance to
revel in the glory days _ or at least to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enthusiastic about it, but the camaraderie just isn't the
same,'' Ransom muses. ``The place has gotten so big. Now you've got
people selling cars or insurance or whatever. Back then, everybody
was part of the space program.

 &HT;    Seeking justice on death row
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Ala. _ The Appalachian foothills here are a forlorn
landscape of double-wides, rusting chemical drums and bald tires
littering the roadside. Here and there, a rutted dirt track crawls
off the highway and angles into the thick woods, leading back to a
secluded house, a hidden deer stand, or God knows what.
</P>
<P>
   The hills around Piedmont are lonesome enough, wild enough, that
a man could get away with just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   David Ronald Chandler nearly did. Or so say the federal
authorities who have put Chandler on track to become the first man
executed by the U.S. government in more than 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Chandler harvested marijuana in these hills as a
sideline to the construction work he performed from here to the
Atlanta suburbs. In April 1991, Chandler was tried and convicted as
a drug kingpin _ from a place where it seems that nobody could be a
kingpin of anything. Prosecutors described him as the ruthless
mastermind of a large-scale dope operation who ordered the murder
of a snitch and made two local men who stole his pot disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, whose appeal will be argued Tuesday before the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, could find himself in the
electric chair by the end of next year. Now 45 and sitting on death
row at Holman Unit Prison in Atmore, Ala., Chandler may be the
murdering drug lord that prosecutors have painted him to be. But as
Chandler moves closer to his execution, the case against him seems
to be falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   His chief accuser, the man who killed the snitch and then made a
deal to testify against Chandler, now says the prosecution urged
him to lie on the stand, and he has recanted his testimony against
Chandler. Another witness who linked Chandler to the disappearance
of one of the pot thieves has made roughly the same claim.
</P>
<P>
   And Chandler's many friends in Piedmont, none of whom was called
during his trial, now have come forward to praise a purported drug
kingpin who also bought shoes for poor children and groceries for
hungry families, built a fellowship hall for his church and
performed other acts of kindness for his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win this case,'' Chandler said during an
interview on Alabama's death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never killed any of them,'' he said. ``I never hired anyone
to kill any of them. ... There was not one witness that came down
to that trial that didn't tell a lie. Not one.''
</P>
<P>
   The crimes and the times of Ronnie (cq) Chandler constitute a
Faulknerian saga populated by killers, drunks and ne'er-do-wells,
all of whom seem related to one another in some way.
</P>
<P>
   First there is Chandler himself, the carpenter and brick mason
who cultivated marijuana from isolated fields in the Alabama woods.
Next is Charles Ray Jarrell Sr., Chandler's brother-in-law. This
was the man who, after drinking 23 beers, went target-shooting with
Marlin Shuler and chose Shuler as a target, shooting him twice and
killing him.
</P>
<P>
   And there is ``Marty'' Shuler, the murder victim. Described as a
minion in Chandler's pot ring, Shuler violated a code of the hills
by turning snitch to local police and, prosecutors say, died
because of it. Shuler was also Jarrell's brother-in-law, having
married Jarrell's sister. It came out in testimony, incidentally,
that Shuler frequently beat his wife and once even attacked her
(and Jarrell's) mother.
</P>
<P>
   Initially arrested on state murder charges, Chandler suddenly
learned that the U.S. Justice Department had plucked his case as
the first to be tried under a new drug kingpin law that Congress
enacted in 1988, a backlash to the unremitting drug problem and the
violent crime associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, moonshiners hid in the North Alabama hills. But a
changing Southern culture led them to market marijuana instead of
mash. Even today, Slaughter's Store, where Jarrell stopped for beer
the morning of the murder, sells T-shirts imprinted with a
marijuana leaf and boast of the region's ``genuine quality home
grown.''
</P>
<P>
   The capital killing occurred at Snow's Lake, a remote pond
surrounded by tall pines about a mile down a bumpy, muddy drive off
the county road heading into Piedmont.
</P>
<P>
   There are now two starkly different versions of Jarrell's story
of what happened there on the morning of May 8, 1990. According to
his trial testimony, Jarrell interrupted his morning chores of
cleaning out his septic line to take Shuler to Snow's Lake, where
they would engage in target practice by shooting at tree stumps
sticking out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell testified that Chandler drove by his house and saw
Shuler standing nearby. ``He's going to cause me and you a whole
lot of trouble,'' Chandler told him. ``You need to go on and take
care of him, and I still got that $500,'' referring to an earlier
offer on Shuler's head.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell testified that he killed Shuler, using a 9 mm handgun
Chandler had given him, ``for the money,'' though it was never
paid. After the murder, Jarrell testified, he drove Shuler's
beat-up Pinto to Chandler's house to get a reliable truck, which he
and Chandler used to haul Shuler's body away for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell's weary eyes and raspy voice are the products of years
of hard living and, more recently, a successful fight against
throat cancer. He speaks with a blunt candor, gravely recounting
his violent past, bragging of his days as a happy drunk. State
murder charges against him were dropped in exchange for his
testimony against Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Just months before the murder, he tried to shoot Shuler in the
face after hearing of Shuler's continued abuse, Jarrell said during
an interview at the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta, where he is
serving a 25-year sentence for drug conspiracy. But his gun jammed,
leading him to tell Shuler, who had fallen rubber-legged to the
floor, ``Marty, evidently the Lord just didn't intend for you to
die tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The version of the killing Jarrell tells now is that after they
were taking turns shooting at stumps, he confronted Shuler once
again for abusing his sister and mother. Shuler responded by
calling Jarrell a liar and added, ``I'm going to get even with all
of you.''
</P>
<P>
   These apparently were Shuler's last words. Jarrell turned and
shot him once from behind and then clipped off a second round
behind Shuler's ear as he lay on the ground. ``Just like that,''
Jarrell recalled grimly with a strange, chilling laugh. ``Just
swung around and shot him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said the killing ``took a load off my shoulders. I don't
have to worry about my mama being hurt by this crazy Marty.''
Jarrell said he regrets testifying untruthfully against Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said he told Chandler he needed the truck to haul
firewood. When Chandler insisted he'd come along and help, Jarrell
blurted out that he'd just shot Shuler by the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get Ronnie involved in this,'' Jarrell said.
``This is where Ronnie comes in. Ronnie came in after the fact.
Marty's already dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said he turned against Chandler when prosecutors
threatened to seek the death penalty against him and his son for
the murder. He said Chandler never offered to pay him $500 to kill
Shuler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecutor and his people know this,'' he said. ``But he
wanted to make this a murder for hire. This is what I found out
later. This is why he was pressing me to say I killed Shuler for
the money, which is just a damned lie. It had nothing to do with
money at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors Joe Hubbard and Harwell Davis have strongly denied
ever pressuring Jarrell on what to say. ``I don't remember any
inconsistencies, certainly none about the motive,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was scheduled to be executed in March 1995 but received
a stay, allowing his habeas corpus petition, a challenge to the
constitutionality of his conviction and sentence, to run its
course.
</P>
<P>
   During the prison interview, Chandler declined to discuss why or
whether he helped Jarrell bury Shuler's body. ``That's irrelevant
to this case, due to the fact I'm charged with murder-for-hire,''
he said. ``If they want to charge me with that, let them charge me
for that. But don't charge me with murder-for-hire, because that's
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's lawyer, Jack Martin of Atlanta, notes that Chandler
``was convicted of a murder on the testimony of a witness who
everyone now says is not worthy of belief and who has sworn he lied
at Ronnie's trial. ... How can we in good conscience allow a man to
be executed on the testimony of such a discredited witness?''
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge James Hancock, who presided over the
trial and over post-trial hearings, ruled that Jarrell's current
testimony ``is suspect and unworthy of belief.'' Instead, Hancock
found the four members of the prosecution team to be ``honest and
forthright'' when they testified. ''Nothing in the record suggests
that any of them is being untruthful, let alone all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   During trial, prosecutors implicated Chandler in the
disappearances of two men who are said to have stolen pot from his
fields. Jeff McFry and Patrick Burroughs disappeared in 1990, and
although Chandler never was charged formally with killing them,
prosecutors presented evidence to support it.
</P>
<P>
   But the government witness who testified against Chandler about
the McFry disappearance now has come forward and said she was
pressured by agents and prosecutors to lie. And a man whose son
testified about the Burroughs disappearance has rebutted his son's
testimony, saying he turned against Chandler in exchange for a good
deal from prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock ruled that, taken in context of the case, the evidence
about the disappearances ``was of trifling significance.''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Erickson has said in court motions
that the recantations are ``not credible and, therefore, would not
probably produce a different verdict at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's appeal may stand on even firmer ground on the
contention that his trial lawyer, Drew Redden, a former Alabama
State Bar president, was so ineffective during the sentencing phase
that a new one should be ordered.
</P>
<P>
   After Chandler was convicted, Redden asked Chandler's wife,
Deborah, to round up witnesses who could speak up for Chandler the
next day. Deborah Chandler drove three hours to Piedmont that night
and called her preacher, who agreed to testify, but Redden did not
summon him.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Deborah Chandler said, she spent the night praying.
``I was so numb,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The only people to testify on Chandler's behalf were his wife
and mother, a fact Hubbard seized on in his closing argument by
telling jurors that even ``Jack the Ripper had a mother. Charles
Manson had a mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said that shortly before Hancock scheduled post-trial
hearings, he spent an afternoon at Chandler's parents' house and
one person after another came in and described how Chandler had
helped them. Forty-one witnesses came to testify on his behalf,
although Hancock cut off testimony after 27 took the stand. All
said they would have testified at trial if Redden had asked them.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Heath said that when Chandler saw her son running around
Piedmont's projects with no shoes, he bought the child two pairs.
Elaine Freeman said that when her neighbor's son died in an auto
accident, Chandler gave the family money because they couldn't pay
for the burial. Jerry Masters said Chandler helped build a
fellowship hall at church and ``didn't charge a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler built a porch so a disabled man could get in and out of
his house, he surprised needy mothers with bags of groceries and
opened his wallet for charities, witnesses testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the classic example of an inadequately defended
capital sentencing,'' said David Bruck, counsel for the Federal
Death Penalty Resource Center. ``On the night before, you can't
leave it up to the stricken wife to prepare the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   To have a capital defendant who is known for generosity and good
deeds ``comes around once in a blue moon,'' he said. ``There's no
question that it would have made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say in court motions that the witnesses who
now have come forward knew Chandler ``primarily in the years before
his illegal activities began.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Hancock said it was ``a close call'' whether the
new character evidence would have made a difference, but he denied
a new sentencing trial.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said Hancock is predisposed to rule against him. In an
order issued before Chandler's trial began, Hancock wrote,
``Jarrell was an alcoholic lackey for Chandler who for $500, or
maybe simply a fifth of liquor, likely would have done anything
Chandler directed him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said he spends much of his day reading the Bible. He
composes hymns and writes poems.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his cell during his allotted one hour a day to
exercise, saying it provides him an escape from the situation he's
in. ``You're in misery,'' he said of Alabama's death row, where the
condemned are electrocuted in a converted cell amid the other
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Chandler exudes what appears to be a genuine optimism
that he will walk out of prison a free man. ``I didn't know
anything about the law then,'' he said. ``But they're not going to
do that to me anymore. We're going to win, that's for sure.

 &HT;    Discrimination rules protect New Orleans' `transgenders'
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In the bathroom at Lucky Cheng's, a young man in
baggy shorts is applying a smoky blue-grey shadow to his eyelids.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm Chad _ well, in a minute, Ariana,'' he says, adding that,
like Cher, he claims no last name. In a few moments, he will emerge
from the bathroom, resplendent in a floor-length green-sequined
gown, ready for another night on the job.
</P>
<P>
   By day, Chad is a psychology major at the University of New
Orleans; by night, Ariana is one of eight drag queens on staff at
Lucky Cheng's in the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Boys will be girls and girls will be boys in America's
live-and-let-live city. And if you harass, intimidate or
discriminate against Chad/Ariana or anyone like him/her, you might
get six months in jail and a $500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   A city ordinance, passed recently as part of a larger hate
crimes package, protects ''transgenders'' _ cross dressers,
transsexuals or anyone who identifies with a gender other than his
or her own.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the deepest part of the South, even if this is New
Orleans,'' says Jean Taylor, explaining why the ordinance is
needed. Taylor is a ''pre-operative'' transsexual who also works at
Lucky Cheng's. She is tall and voluptuous, thanks to breast
augmentation paid for by a boyfriend after she staged what she
calls a ''dramatic nervous breakdown.'' The rest of her is male,
but she, unlike Chad, dresses exclusively as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a lot of friends who work as women and people don't
know it,'' she says. ''They need protection so they can't get fired
if their boss finds out.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is especially important for people who decide mid-career
they want to change sexes, either with surgery or by cross
dressing, says Chris Daigle, chairman of the Louisiana Lesbian and
Gay Political Action Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know someone who has one or two advanced degrees and began a
process of changing her sex and was fired because of it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This is now illegal under the hate crimes ordinance _ as long as
he or she has a note from a doctor saying the cross dressing or the
sex change is the result of a ''gender identification disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the ordinance is not a license to dress in
drag on a whim. If a male employee walks in one day in Dockers and
loafers and the next day in Givenchy and stilettos, the boss can
say something, or even fire him.
</P>
<P>
   ''An employer can't run a business if someone one day presents
themselves as a man and the next as a woman,'' Daigle said. ''This
ordinance is not for the occasional cross-dresser.''
</P>
<P>
   Three states and about a dozen cities _ New Orleans is the only
one in the deep South _ have laws protecting transgenders from
harassment and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans has a long history of being a haven for
cross-dressers and transsexuals, Daigle said, attracting them from
less accepting cities around the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more tolerant here than in other places,'' Chad says,
although Taylor protests that New Orleans is five years behind New
York and Los Angeles. ''Still,'' Chad continues, ''(cross dressers)
leave their smaller towns and come here because there are a lot of
transsexual/transvestite bars and clubs here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the French Quarter there are at least six drag bars
and clubs, including Papa Joe's Female Impersonators, Lucky
Cheng's, and Oz, where every Wednesday there are ''drag races,'' a
contest to see who in the audience can change into women's clothes
the fastest. On Mardi Gras, the drag queen fashion show in the
French Quarter is as popular as the parades on St. Charles Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's perceived by many that it's all in the French Quarter,
but we have all walks of life living in all parts of the city,''
says Earl Jackson, executive director of the New Orleans Human
Relations Commission, which drafted the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so thrilled that the city wants to protect
transgenders. The Rev. Marie Galatas of the New Creation Christian
Church protested this and similar city measures to protect gays and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely opposed to that,'' she says. ''It contributes
towards the downfall of society, and it is confusing to children to
have their city leaders endorsing such schizophrenic behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The maximum penalty for violating the new ordinance is $500 and
six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not much, but for a corporation, there is the fear of the
stigma of being a company that discriminates,'' Daigle said.

 &HT;    Woolly worms wary about this winter
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Georgia's coastal Sapelo Island, the ants seem to
be busier than usual and the squirrels seem to be building thicker
nests.
</P>
<P>
   To Cornelia Bailey, the matriarch of the island's Hog Hammock
community, it means one thing: a cooler than normal winter. ``When
the ants start storing up food early, you know to brace yourself
for a cool winter,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains of North Georgia and Tennessee, folk who are
wise in the way of weather also are predicting colder-than-normal
weather. Some of the few woolly worms that are around this year are
solid black, and spiders are weaving webs close together _ signs of
a hard winter, the mountaineers say.
</P>
<P>
   This winter could be a ``humdinger,'' says Helen Lane of Crab
Orchard, Tenn., who is famous in her neck of the woods for
predicting the weather from nature's signs.
</P>
<P>
   Those prognostications, however, don't square with the official
science-based forecasts of the National Weather Service, which is
predicting a warmer and drier winter overall for Georgia _ with
occasional blasts of cold air due to the La Nina weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   But long before there were scientists and meteorologists with
Doppler radar and supercomputers, generations of farmers and other
rural folk were predicting the weather by observing nature.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Joe Stiles, a botanist and an instructor at the Rabun
Gap-Nacoochee School in Rabun County in Georgia's northeast corner,
has kept track of weather folklore in the mountains for years.
``For each fog that forms in August, there supposedly will be a
snowfall in winter,'' he says. ``Thick corn shucks also mean a cold
winter, and so does a hot summer.''
</P>
<P>
   If the hot summer omen is correct, ``then I guess we're headed
for a cold winter,'' Stiles says.
</P>
<P>
   On Sapelo Island, Bailey says you can observe how animals are
building their nests or beds to figure out what the weather is
likely to be. ``If a hog starts bunching up the straw in its pen to
build a thicker bed, you know it's going to get cold, and you
better put more cover on your own bed,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But the creature most ingrained in weather folklore this time of
year is the woolly worm, an inch-long fuzzy caterpillar also called
the woolly bear. The town of Banner Elk, N.C., had its 21st annual
Woolly Worm Festival last weekend, and festival forecaster Charles
VonCanon ``officially'' forecast a cold and snowy winter based upon
the particular coloration of the voracious caterpillars.
</P>
<P>
   According to mountain folklore, the more solid-black the woolly
worms, the colder the winter. The more solid brown, the milder. If
more worms are black on the ends and brown in the middle, that
means winter will start and end hard. Brown ends and a black middle
mean a mild fall and early spring but a harsh midwinter.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles says that a few years ago he and several of this students
gathered 177 woolly worms, ``and I thought we would be able to
disprove the idea that the caterpillars can predict the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Stiles' surprise, the coloration of the caterpillars
coincided most of the time with the changes in weather, ``and we
weren't able to prove a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem in Rabun County this season, says Stiles, is a
shortage of woolly worms. Some people say it's due to the dry
summer killing vegetation the caterpillars normally feed on.
</P>
<P>
   But Stiles theorizes the scarcity has to do with the general
absence of the honeybee, which has been decimated by parasitic
mites.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles says that with fewer honeybees there is less pollination,
which means fewer plants for the woolly worms to munch on.

 &HT;    Weather wiser through new technology
 &HT;    WITH GRAPHIC; WINTER-SIDE
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Armed with a network of buoys, satellites,
supercomputers and other state-of-the-art devices, climate
scientists are rapidly gaining the ability to detect even slight
changes in ocean temperature, air pressure and other conditions
that will help them predict global weather changes with greater
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this work is being concentrated in the tropical Pacific
Ocean, where two weather phenomena _ El Nino and La Nina _ develop
periodically and influence global weather patterns by changing
ocean temperature. The words are Spanish for boy and girl,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   A cyclical warming and cooling in the eastern half of the
tropical Pacific has been known since the 1800s, and the cycles
probably have been around for eons. But only in the past 25 years
or so have scientists begun to understand the global impacts of
warm El Nino and cold La Nina episodes.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino and La Nina are extremes of what is known as the ENSO
(El Nino/Southern Oscillation) cycle. The cycle lasts about four
years.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina arises when trade winds return to the eastern Pacific,
bringing to the surface of the sea deeper, colder water that
replaces the abnormally warm waters of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   The latest El Nino made its debut last March and spawned severe
weather around the world, including storms that battered California
and heavy rainfall this spring that damaged Georgia crops.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the curtain has fallen on El Nino, and the lights have come
up on its lesser-known sister. The effects of the La Nina weather
phenomena are more pronounced in winter.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, La Nina will mean a drier, warmer winter
than usual for the Southeast; colder-than-normal winter
temperatures in the Central Plains and Midwest; unusually wet
weather in the Pacific Northwest; and colder, wetter weather in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   For the Northeast, the forecast ``represents a major change from
the very mild winter experienced last year in association with the
strong El Nino,'' said Anthony Barnston, a researcher with the
Climate Prediction Center. ``What we're looking at with La Nina is
a tilt of the odds toward a colder winter in the Northeast with
more snow _ and perhaps bigger storms _ than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The coldness up north could affect Georgia. While the Peach
State's winter is expected to be drier and warmer, ``Georgia could
get occasional blasts of very cold air funneling down from the
Northeast,'' says Gerry Bell, another researcher with the Climate
Prediction Center. The cold snaps could last several days, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The last strong La Nina occurred in the winter of 1988-89. The
current episode began developing in the eastern tropical Pacific in
late May and June. Ocean temperatures dropped by up to 10 degrees
Fahrenheit, signaling the end of the 1997-98 El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   The impacts of the two weather phenomena in summer are not as
well understood as their winter effects, but scientists now know
that fewer Atlantic hurricanes occur during El Nino episodes, while
La Nina is associated with more.
</P>
<P>
   In general, El Nino and La Nina are causing scientists to
rethink what is average for weather. Temperature and precipitation
averages are based on records that go back to the 1800s, and
weather conditions during El Nino and La Nina cycles have been
averaged in with those from ``neutral periods'' that occur between
the cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to begin looking at what is average for a La Nina,
for an El Nino and for neutral years, and then make our forecasts
based on how much the weather will deviate from the norm during
those periods,'' says Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and other climate scientists say the ability to make
long-range forecasts is rapidly improving. In the past few years,
the Climate Prediction Center has begun using a network of buoys
laden with monitors to keep tabs on ocean conditions and determine
when El Ninos and La Ninas are developing and how strong they might
be. Weather satellites also gather reams of data for the climate
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The data are fed into computers and climate models to help
forecasters make better predictions.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service recently said it will lease a new
supercomputer that will improve its weather, flood and climate
forecasts. The new high-performance Class VIII computing system
will allow the Weather Service to operate more sophisticated models
of the atmosphere and oceans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supercomputers are the key to advances in weather
forecasting,'' says James Baker, administrator of the National
Oceanics and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists doubt computers ever will totally replace human
brain power for making long-range forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best forecasts still come from our own experience and
knowledge,'' says Bell. ``Our experience tells us that if we have
certain weather conditions, we know there will be certain
effects.''

<P>
   MIDEAST-PALESTINIANS (Ramallah, West Bank) _ Yasser Arafat has a
tough crowd to please. Palestinians, from the elite strata of the
intellectual class to the angry ranks of the refugee camps, believe
the agreement signed at the White House on Friday is mostly a
reiteration of actions already promised in the 1993 and 1995
accords in Oslo and never undertaken. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-RDP (Washington) _ After Friday's White House
extravaganza of rhetoric and hope, as Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed an
interim peace accord that was 19 months in the squabbling, those
who stand to lose most by the deal were quick to respond. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-BAILOUT (Washington) _ The United States is preparing to
commit American taxpayer funds as part of a lending program of at
least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, and with it the rest
of Latin America, from the worst effects of the financial turmoil
circling the globe, according to U.S. and foreign officials
assembling the program. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-DIVISIONS (Erfurt, Germany) _ It is a measure of the
task facing Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who will head an
untried coalition of Social Democrats and Greens, that Germany has
not yet defined itself in a way that reaches across its former
chasms. ``This is simply not a finished country,'' one Western
diplomat said. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   LEIPZIG-MALL (Leipzig, Germany) _ The immense railway terminal
in this eastern German city stands like a temple to modern
transport and commerce. But store owners in narrow downtown lanes
are praying that it will not mean the end of their trade. Last year
marked the completion of a two-year, $230 million overhaul of
Europe's largest rail terminus into Europe's largest shopping mall.
By John Tagliabue. (EDS: This story, which was held earlier in the
week, is now cleared for publication.)
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-MURDERS (Buenos Aires, Argentina) _ Even by Argentine
standards, the country has been treated to a barrage of recent news
coverage about suspicious deaths. Though on the surface the deaths
do not seem to be linked in any way, and may simply be a series of
macabre coincidences, the news reports have spawned vague
suggestions in the last several weeks that organized crime or the
Menem government itself is involved and blocking the cause of
justice. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   MONGOLIA-MYSTERY (Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia) _ Who killed
Sanjaasuren Zorig? From the apartment blocks, offices and countless
bars of this capital city to the nomadic tents across the endless
countryside, Mongolians have been obsessed with the question in the
three weeks since the man known as the father of their democracy
was stabbed to death by masked attackers. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   KAZAKHSTAN-POLITICS (Almaty, Kazakhstan) _ In the past eight
weeks, Akezhan Kazhegeldin says, his press aide was attacked by
masked men, a weekly close to him was firebombed and he was shot
at. If the intended message is that Kazhegeldin, 46, a businessman
and former prime minister, should drop out of next January's
presidential election, he is not listening. By Steve LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-NONDEFECTOR (United Nations) _ Despite rumblings that he is
on the verge of defecting, the half-brother of President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq, Barzan el-Takriti, who is an envoy in Geneva, has
sidestepped the question. By Youssef M. Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-TALKS (Geneva) _ The United States, China and the two
Koreas agreed Saturday to create two working parties to explore a
peace treaty and to examine confidence-building measures on the
peninsula, home to the most heavily defended border in the world.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   ABORT-DOC-SLAIN _ Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician with a
practice in suburban Buffalo, N.Y., returned home from the
synagogue Friday night with his wife, Lynn, and greeted his four
sons. Then he stepped into his kitchen, where a sniper's bullet
crashed through a back window and struck him in the chest, police
said. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   GLENN-SHUTTLE _ The countdown is set to begin Monday morning for
a space flight that will not make history or any new heroes but has
everything to do with history and an aging hero, John Glenn. By
John Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   NEV-LAND-AUCTION (Carson City, Nev.) _ The federal government is
preparing to auction 27,000 acres of public land near Las Vegas
estimated to be worth $500 million to $1 billion, with almost all
of the proceeds to stay in Nevada instead of going to the Treasury.
</P>

MIDDLE EAST PEACE DEAL'S LIKELY LOSERS ARE QUICK TO RESPOND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J.)  (See also MIDEAST-PALESTINIANS) 
(js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After Friday's extravaganza of oratory and hope, as
the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, signed an interim peace accord that was 19
months in the squabbling, those who stand to lose most by the deal
were quick to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The accord essentially transfers another 13 percent of the West
Bank to full or partial Palestinian control, in return for specific
Palestinian steps to crack down on terrorism and Islamic radical
organizations like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish settlers living in the West Bank, first seized from
Jordan in 1967, threatened widespread protests after blocking roads
during the nine days of negotiations that were held on Maryland's
eastern shore. In the Gaza Strip, the leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, warned that the agreement ``cannot erase Hamas.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Clinton, apparently, there was an element of contrition
through good deeds in his intensive labors in search of peace. In a
speech Friday night to black religious leaders, Clinton said he was
honored to have held the summit talks. ``I felt that it was a part
of my job as president, my mission as a Christian and my personal
journey of atonement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address Saturday, Clinton again urged
Palestinians and Israelis to be brave in the face of criticism,
threat and even violence from those opposed to reconciliation.
``Keeping the peace process on track will require continued courage
by Israelis and Palestinians in the months ahead,'' Clinton said.
``But this agreement shows what is possible when the will for peace
is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   And he vowed that ``America will continue to work for a just and
lasting peace in this land that is holy for so many people
throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, America will have to, most analysts agree, since the
Palestinians and Israelis have become dependent on Washington to
push them toward difficult choices. Friday's agreement was a
completely American proposal, conceived and drafted by U.S.
diplomats, a far cry from the spontaneous give and take that a
final settlement will require.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction through the Arab world was predictably mixed, with
praise from Jordan, whose ailing king was so important to the deal.
In Syria, the official news media ridiculed it as a Palestinian
surrender and an Israeli trap.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, a frequent mediator in the Israeli-Arab conflict, was
cautious in its approval. Tunisian papers said it remained to be
seen whether Israel stuck to its side of the deal but the
government of Oman, in what appeared to be the first official
reaction in the region, welcomed the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Early reaction to the accord was positive on Capitol Hill. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., praised it as ``testament to the fact
that seemingly intractable disputes can be resolved when the
political will exists to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D.-N.J., echoed some of the Israeli
right's concerns when he said: ``Prime Minister Netanyahu
sacrificed a tangible victory for an intangible promise of security
by chairman Arafat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, however modest, the agreement restores life to the Middle
East peace effort and opens the way for talks on a final resolution
of the 50-year-old fight over whether the Palestinians will have a
state.
</P>
<P>
   The deal snagged at the last minute over the fate of the spy
Jonathan Jay Pollard, but Clinton was finally able to preside over
a White House signing ceremony, joined as host by a visibly ailing
King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement set a detailed timetable for the Israelis to
withdraw from 13 percent more of the West Bank in three phases over
12 weeks once the agreement is ratified. That would bring to 40
percent the total territory that the Palestinians control fully or
partly. In return, the accord outlined specific steps by the
Palestinians to fight terrorism and formally amend their charter to
expunge calls for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the accord, Arafat and Netanyahu shook hands
Friday. They spoke words of peace and determination, but they made
no attempt to pretend that the accord meant they had achieved a
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat vowed that the Palestinians would ``never leave the peace
process'' and ``never go back to violence and confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu campaigned for office as an opponent of the Oslo
accords, by which Israel and the Palestinians recognize each
other's right to live in peace and commit themselves to
negotiations on a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But this agreement, a senior U.S. official said Saturday, puts
Netanyahu firmly in the camp of trading land for peace, ``a
remarkable shift for a leader of Likud.''

COMMENTARY: PROTECTING ABORTION CLINICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (Eds: See also ABORT-DOC-SLAIN) 
(mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bomb went off about 7:30 in the morning, just as Emily Lyons
was heading into work. The damage was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my left eye and it damaged my right eye,'' Ms. Lyons
said in a telephone interview on Thursday. ``Just today I got a
contact lens. It's a big deal for me. It's the first time I'm able
to see in nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lyons, a registered nurse, was walking into the New Woman,
All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham, Ala., last Jan. 29 when
the homemade bomb exploded. It killed an off-duty policeman, Robert
Sanderson, who worked as a security guard at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lyons was almost killed. ``It pretty much mangled my right
hand,'' she said. ``And my little finger was broken and didn't heal
right, so I've got a permanently polite little pinky, like when you
drink tea. The lower right side of my abdomen had a hole the size
of your fist in it. They had to repair that. They had to remove
part of my large and small intestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of my kneecaps were full of nails. They had to open those
up. Remove the nails so the joints would move again. My left leg
was broken. They had to repair that. And my body is covered with
dark spots. Long dark spots. That's where all the nails went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortions were performed at the clinic and it had been a target
of protesters for years. The bomb exploded a week after the 25th
anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision
that legalized abortion. The person who planted the bomb has not
been caught.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lyons is married and the mother of two teen-age daughters.
Her job at the clinic was to counsel women who were considering an
abortion. For that she almost paid with her life.
</P>
<P>
   This week Ms. Lyons will take a small political step that she
hopes will help the many men and women who face similar dangers.
She will appear in a television ad in New York criticizing Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., for voting against a bill designed to
protect doctors and other health care workers and their clients
from violent acts by anti-abortion extremists.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is sponsored by the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League. The bill, which passed and was signed into
law by President Clinton in 1994, made it a federal crime to attack
or blockade an abortion clinic. It was sponsored by Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., who is running against D'Amato for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's office did not respond to questions last week about
why he had opposed the bill, which was known as the Freedom of
Access to Clinic Entrances Act.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, the league's president, said, ``It took several
deaths to finally have Congress take a serious look at the fact
that in some communities across the country law enforcement
officials either were not able to address the problem or they,
frankly, were not willing to take action because some of them
agreed with the protesters.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote for the bill was not a vote in favor of abortion. It was
a vote against the use of violence and murder to achieve a
political end. As Ms. Michelman said, ``It was about enforcing the
rule of law in a civilized society.''
</P>
<P>
   The law has helped reduce violence at abortion clinics, but the
problem, as the attack in Birmingham showed, is still a serious
one. A survey by the Feminist Majority Foundation found that nearly
25 percent of abortion clinics were targets of violence or threats
of violence in 1997. The survey said the clinics were plagued by
``blockades, invasions, bomb threats and bombings, arson threats
and arsons, chemical attacks, death threats and stalking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lyons said that as she began the long, slow recovery from
her wounds she felt compelled ``to do whatever it takes in the
future to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   She taped the ad on Friday. In it she says, ``When a bomb ripped
through my clinic I almost lost my life, and it will never be the
same. When Al D'Amato had a chance, he voted against protecting
women's health clinics from anti-abortion terrorists. I am
determined to stop this violence against women, so I'm speaking
out.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Ms. Lyons how she and her family were doing emotionally
in the aftermath of the attack. ``Pretty well,'' she said. ``It's
what life has dealt us this year. You take it and go with it.''

CHAMPION YANKEES WILL NOT TAKE PAGE FROM MARLINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago this week the Florida Marlins executed a double play
unique in baseball history. First they won the World Series and
then they planned the instant demolition of the World Series
champions. Fortunately for baseball and its fans, that scenario
will not occur this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins' brain trust waited only four days from the last
game of the World Series to lay the groundwork for the destruction
of the 1997 champions. The New York Yankees' strategic planners
won't take much longer than that to lay the groundwork for moves
that they hope will turn the 1998 champions into 1999 champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins' method has become one of the ugliest developments
in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have second thoughts, but I have done a lot of
thinking about it,'' commissioner Bud Selig said when asked if the
Marlins should have been prevented from dismantling their team.
``While I still understand the reasons for it, I wish even more
fervently that it hadn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlins players and fans, drastically reduced though their
number may be, are also sorry it happened. The Marlins shed 68
percent of their players and lost 26 percent of their attendance.
</P>
<P>
   As astute a businessman as H. Wayne Huizenga, soon to be the
former owner, is supposed to be, he scuttled two economic
opportunities with his demolition project. He lost out on the
attendance increase that invariably follows a championship, and he
lost the chance to generate public support for a new ball park.
</P>
<P>
   His actions left even his friends wondering why he bothered
spending the money he did, knowing how much he would lose and how
fragile the chances were for getting to the World Series in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner and the Yankees, on the other hand, are not
going anywhere; nor are they going to embarrass baseball. In
contrast to Huizenga, Steinbrenner will do what he thinks has to be
done to repeat, not regress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of people in our business to treat every year
different,'' said Detroit Tigers general manager Randy Smith,
discussing the Yankees and next season. ``You look at their club
and what they still have in their farm system, and they have a
terrific situation. Look at the balance of the club up and down the
lineup. Look at the pitching depth. They're going to be awful tough
in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith said, if the Yankees lose a player, they can
go out on the market and replace him.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees can also pursue a player without losing one.
Speculation has sprung up, for example, on whether or not the
Yankees might go after Mo Vaughn, a free agent, and trade their
incumbent first baseman, Tino Martinez, even though he has led the
team in runs batted in each of his three years with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation about Vaughn has been fueled by the close
relationship his agent, Tom Reich, has with Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Offering his personal view of the matter, Reich said: ``The
Yankees, aside from having a great team, have the best chemistry
team I've seen since the 1970s. It has as much a bearing on their
success as their talent. I would think they'd like to try to keep
that team together. The Yankees have a very good first baseman
who's a terrific guy and a part of this chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   The makeup of the team was reflected in the the way the Yankees
played on a daily basis. Barely two months into the season, they
had an 11-game lead with a 46-13 record, and they could have
coasted the rest of the way. But they played as though every day
they were a game out of first and had to win that day to gain a
share of the top spot. They compiled a 68-35 record (.660) the rest
of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the rest of their season with the experience of the 1984
Detroit Tigers and the 1990 Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers started 35-5, then tailed off to 69-53 (.566) the
rest of the way. The Reds began 33-12, then struggled at 58-59, a
losing record, through the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at how they go about it more than how they do it,''
Sparky Anderson, who managed the 1984 Tigers, said during the World
Series. The former manager is known for hyperbole, but in assessing
the Yankees he didn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of THE very best teams I've ever watched,'' he
said. ``You never remember walking into the Yankees clubhouse and
seeing so many professionals. I would have been very proud to
manage that team because they are professional-acting people. This
team has done baseball proud, along with McGwire and Sosa. They've
contributed so much to the whole game. At times I'm overwhelmed
watching them.''

   Emotional Ceremony
</P>
<P>
   When Bud Selig presented George Steinbrenner with the World
Series championship trophy, the commissioner reduced the owner to
tears. Steinbrenner later explained that he goes so far back with
Selig, to 1973, that the emotion of the moment just overcame him.
Selig said he, too, felt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot with George,'' Selig said. ``There
have been, as he said, a lot of ups and downs. But through it all
we've been able to maintain a remarkably good relationship. When I
saw him and he saw me, and given the context of history, it was a
very emotional scene.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Selig's favorite moments with Steinbrenner occurred in
1978 when the Yankees played in Milwaukee in the last series before
the All-Star Game. Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles was hurt and
didn't play in the last two games of the series, but he nevetheless
wanted to play in the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner felt that if he couldn't play for the Yankees, he
couldn't play in the All-Star Game. During the Sunday afternoon
game, Mickey Morabito, the team's public relations director, sought
out the owner in Selig's box and told him reporters wanted to talk
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them I'm not here,'' Steinbrenner barked.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was Selig's box was right next to the press
box, and it was encased in enough glass that Steinbrenner was
easily seen by all.
</P>
<P>
   Series Share: $312,137.33
</P>
<P>
   Based on post-season shares voted by the Yankees, a full winning
World Series share will be worth $312,137.33 to the 41 members of
the Yankees who are entitled to or were voted full shares. That
total, swelled by an increase in post-season ticket prices, is a
record, surpassing the $216,870 the Yankees received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush ($178,900), Jorge Posada ($250,000) and Ramiro
Mendoza ($275,000) will receive more money from their full shares
than they earned in salaries this season. The 55 percent share Mike
Buddie will receive based on the 99 days he spent with the Yankees
in six separate visits will compute to $1,675.53 more than the
major league minimum salary.
</P>
<P>
   All Teams Equal to Williams
</P>
<P>
   If any of the Yankees' potential free agents leaves them, Bernie
Williams is the most likely candidate. Given the opportunity last
week to say the Yankees are his first choice, Williams declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say it's probably about as good as any other team right
now,'' Williams said, then a minute later added, ``We have had a
lot of history of past things that have happened between both
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He alluded to his acerbic negotiating history with the Yankees,
beginning in 1995 when the Yankees renewed his contract. That act
has been a cloud hovering over all subsequent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, people throughout baseball speculated that
the Arizona Diamondbacks already had an understanding that Williams
would join them after this season. But now word among some
front-office executives is that Jerry Colangelo, the expansion
team's controlling owner, is reluctant to pay the price even though
his manager, Buck Showalter, dearly wants Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers and the Detroit Tigers also could pursue the
American League batting champion and Gold Glove winner. The Tigers
thought they had Williams last November in a trade that they said
the Yankees reneged on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the type of guy that certainly creates a lot of
excitement if and when he's a free agent,'' said Randy Smith, the
Tigers' general manager, who is prepared to pursue a big-name
player, a departure from Detroit's past practice.
</P>
<P>
   The team's strategy is to add star-type players this winter and
next in advance of its move into a new park for the 2000 season.
``We're going to have a little more money to spend,'' Smith said.
``We feel we're getting closer to the point where we can try to
fill in the last few holes.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodger Memory
</P>
<P>
   He had told the story many times before, but the time and place
were appropriate for relating it one more time.
</P>
<P>
   When Davey Johnson was introduced as the Los Angeles Dodgers'
manager Friday, he recalled the 1966 World Series in which he
played against the Dodgers for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a base hit off a guy named Koufax,'' Johnson said. ``I
was the last guy to get a hit off him. I was very proud. I saw him
the next year at Vero Beach. I said, `Sandy, I guess you know who
got the last hit off you.' He said, `Yeah, that's why I retired.'
''

BASKETBALL COLUMN: PLAYERS SAY THEY AREN'T ENEMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a little-known agent named Stephen Woods complained
recently that the National Basketball Players Association was
derelict in its duties, the fears began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Woods called union officers overmatched in their bargaining
talks with the league's owners and said he did not want to be on
the bus that union president Patrick Ewing and vice president
Alonzo Mourning were driving off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   More fears arose last Monday when the players association lost a
decision in which an arbitrator ruled that owners could continue
withholding pay from players during the management lockout. A
half-dozen agents on the union's advisory council talked openly
about decertifying immediately and fighting the NBA in court rather
than negotiating a new labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some players were not sounding like pillars of unity either.
``We're not panicking but everyone has their own agenda,'' the
veteran guard Muggsy Bogues said Tuesday. ``I'm losing part of the
biggest payday of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   But by last Thursday afternoon, the voices of discord were gone.
Woods was escorted out of a meeting of 240 players in Las Vegas by
two security guards, the proponents of decertification called the
process a last resort and Bogues became yet another convert,
proclaiming, ``We have to stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   How did a group of athletes with widely disparate incomes and
interests hang together after having lost nearly $100 million in
salaries since the lockout began July 1?
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a common enemy,'' said Buck Williams, the former
players association president. ``Once guys saw the proposals the
league was offering, had them broken down into simple terms, nobody
was worried about their own situation anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA can blame union executive director Billy Hunter, who has
made a point to include his constituency in the negotiations and
give the floor to anyone who wants it.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after Woods withdrew the complaint he had filed
with the National Labor Relations Board, he said: ``Billy and I got
together and talked. He explained his position. I still have
concerns, but the masses have spoken and they seem to mean
business. What else can you do but get on board?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the players meeting had a profound effect of solidarity
on many concerned players who came to hear the union's message.
Besides informational material on the proposals, they heard from
Gene Upshaw and Donald Fehr, the union chiefs for the National
Football League and Major League Baseball, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone, who has taken verbal shots at the union in the past
went from a dove to a hawk overnight. ``I just started realizing
what this was all about and why we need to stay strong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight they are waging may not resonate with a public tired
of paying exorbitant ticket prices. The players essentially want to
retain their right to earn as much as possible while the owners are
determined to bring soaring salaries in line with revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter and Ewing have managed to convince the masses that
NBA commissioner David Stern is intent on forcing major
compromises, an image that seems to have permeated the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league has done what they considered impossible: they've
brought all the players together,'' said the agent Mark
Bartlestein. ``The major mistake the league has made is that it has
tried so hard to jam this down the players' throat, this idea of a
hard salary cap without any exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these guys, that's like being down 45 points and you feel
like someone is trying to embarrass you or disrespect you. These
are people who usually didn't back down from bullies when they were
growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   For a union known for its disorganization and the controversial
exits of its former executive directors, Hunter's orchestration has
been nothing short of masterful. He has tried to go toe-to-toe with
the league's propaganda machine, spewing out his own spin as fast
and voluminous as he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has reached out to players across the spectrum, but he
hasn't tried to stifle ideas,'' said the agent Bill Strickland, the
runner-up to Hunter for the job. ``Before, if someone had something
different to say, the head was cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland added: ``In the old days, when Stern said jump, the
players jumped. He dictated everything. Now you have Billy setting
times for meetings and telling them he's out of town for a personal
matter. Depending on your side, he has rightly or wrongly changed
the pace of negotiations a bit. But so what? Stern has got under a
lot of people's skin over the years.''

U.N. COUNCIL SEEKS TO OVERCOME OBJECTIONS TO KOSOVO MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Intense talks were under way Saturday in a
closed session of the U.N. Security Council to overcome Russian and
Chinese objections to a resolution that would hint at the use of
force if President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia failed to
withdraw forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Western-sponsored resolution, written by France and Britain,
has the support of the United States and seven other members of the
council, including Japan, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate goal of the discussion, however, focuses on
whether NATO can use force to protect some hundreds of unarmed,
largely European observers drawn from the 54-member Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe who will monitor the area.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is designed to support an Oct. 13 agreement reached
by U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke with Milosevic, who has
pledged to observe a cease-fire in the southern Serbian province,
withdraw Serbian security forces there and allow the return home of
ethnic-Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanians, who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population, has killed hundreds of people
and forced about 300,000 from their homes since Milosevic sent his
troops to crack down on separatist rebels in Kosovo in February.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has circulated its own resolution that would authorize
the European mission and NATO to verify Belgrade's compliance. That
version, however, omits any references to rescuing the observers
should they come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   China is equally adamant in its opposition to any use of force
by NATO. Its U.N. representative, Qin Huasun, said Saturday that
NATO could not use force against Yugoslavia without seeking
authorization from the council and described any use of force as
``brutal interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign
state.''
</P>
<P>
   As permanent members of the Security Council, Russia and China
could veto proposals they dislike.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Western draft seeks permission to ``take
appropriate steps'' to insure that Belgrade fully complies with
U.N. demands. Although NATO already has sufficient authority and
fire power to intervene in Kosovo without further U.N.
authorization, Western nations want to obtain a legal basis from
the United Nations to protect monitors in Kosovo, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   The draft affirms that ``in the event of an emergency, action
may be needed to insure their safety and freedom of movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western diplomatic lobbying is backed by a measure of
brinkmanship, however, as two of NATO's top military commanders
arrived in Belgrade on Saturday to warn Milosevic that he will face
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The two are NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen.
Wesley Clark, and the chairman of the alliance's military
committee, Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany. The U.S. Embassy in
Belgrade said the two generals would hold talks with the Yugoslav
Army's chief of staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic.

 ONEY-TRENDS-1025 &HT;    PARTIES MISS FUNDING GOALS FOR 1998 ELECTION
 &HT;    550&AMP;add

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Donors and lenders this month are pouring $2.8
million a day into the national treasuries of the Republican and
Democratic parties, according to the parties' final pre-election
reports.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't been enough to fully fund ambitious plans they
announced this summer for extra help to their Senate, House,
gubernatorial and state legislative candidates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that candidates, rather than parties, will again
raise the vast bulk of the money spent trying to win the Nov. 3
elections. That development favors incumbents, who have an easier
time raising funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has scaled back ``Operation Breakout,'' its
$37 million plan for TV and radio ads, and now expects to raise no
more than $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party has trimmed its $18 million goal for the
``Unity '98'' fund-raising drive led by President Clinton down to
$12 million and more than $1 million of that has already been
diverted to pay debts to polling and ad firms that the party hired
to help Clinton's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for the committees leading the drives gamely tried
to describe their fund-raising lemons as lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Republican Congressional Committee, Mary Mead
Crawford said her party didn't need the full $37 million because it
delayed the start of its ad campaign by one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of September, no-one was listening, so we
didn't start our program until Oct. 6,'' Crawford said. ``We can
put our message across in the last four weeks. We're in 73 markets
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic National Committee, Melissa Bonnie Ratcliff
said, ``The Unity '98 effort was a very ambitious effort and the
money is still coming in. We hope to come as close to our goal as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not how much you spend, it's how smart you spend it,''
said Olivia Morgan at the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents in safe seats felt strongly about the need for the
program. Democratic House members chipped in more than $3 million
and Republican House members chipped in more than $7 million from
their personal political accounts for the special fund-raising
drives.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pre-election reports, which cover fund-raising
through Oct. 15, show that, while this year's fund-raising was good
for a non-presidential election year, it came nowhere close to the
golden gushers of 1996, when money flowed in so thick and fast that
the parties had trouble spending it all.
</P>
<P>
   The reports show that between Oct. 1 and Oct. 15, the
Republicans raised $24.4 million and the Democrats raised $17.7
million from contributions and loans.
</P>
<P>
   Between Jan. 1, 1997 and Oct. 15, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Republicans have raised $299 million, a $96 million
increase over the $203 million they grossed at the same point in
1993-94, the last non-presidential election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Democrats have raised $192 million, a $70 million increase
over the $120 million they grossed at this point in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  But neither came close to its totals for the scandal-plagued
1995-96 election cycle, when the Republican Party had grossed $399
million and the Democratic Party had grossed $242 million at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   (Editors: Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   In this election cycle, about 63 percent of the Republican
receipts and 56 percent of the Democratic receipts consisted of
``hard money,'' which comes in limited amounts from individuals and
can be used for direct aid to federal candidates. The rest was
``soft money,'' which can be used for any purpose other than direct
aid to federal candidates, and almost always comes in huge amounts
from wealthy people, corporate treasuries and union treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the preliminary figures for gross receipts reported to
the Federal Election Commission by the two major parties for the
1993-94 election cycle:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the 18 months that ended June 30, the Republicans beat the
Democrats, $140.5 million to $80 million, in raising hard money.
They also beat them, $77.4 million to $53 million, in raising soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Between July 1 and Oct. 15, the Republicans beat the
Democrats, $48.9 million to $28.3 million, in raising hard money.
However, the Democrats beat them, $36.3 million to $32.3 million,
in raising soft money.

ABORTION PROVIDER KILLED BY SNIPER'S BULLET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician with a practice in suburban
Buffalo, N.Y., returned home from synagogue Friday night with his
wife, Lynn, and greeted his four sons. Then he stepped into his
kitchen, where a sniper's bullet crashed through a back window and
struck him in the chest, police said.
</P>
<P>
   He fell to the floor, calling for help, but he would die within
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian was one of a handful of doctors who provide abortions in
the Buffalo area, and law-enforcement officials said Saturday that
his slaying was the most deadly example of what they described as
an annual pattern of anti-abortion violence in Canada and western
New York. Slepian had endured years of picketing and harassment,
and earlier on Friday he had received a warning about possible
attacks against abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, 51, is the third abortion doctor killed in the United
States since 1993. In the past four years, three Canadian doctors
and a doctor in Rochester, N.Y., all of whom performed abortions,
have been wounded by snipers. Each of the shootings occurred within
a few weeks of Nov. 11, Veteran's Day, also known as Remembrance
Day in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Saturday that he was ``outraged'' by
Slepian's slaying and that the Justice Department was working with
local authorities to track down his killer.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki said the killer should face the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond a tragedy _ it's really an act of terrorism and,
in my mind, a cold-blooded assassination,'' Pataki said in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ward, a spokeswoman for Buffalo GYN Women's Services, the
private clinic where Slepian performed abortions, said the National
Abortion Federation had faxed a warning to the clinic Friday
morning reminding them about the four-year pattern of attacks. Ms.
Ward said the fax was sent to Slepian at his private office in
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was aware of the threat,'' she said. ``Around this time of
year, there had been shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   Amherst police said the timing of the shootings was not the only
similarity. In each case, police said a gunman, using a
high-powered rifle, fired through a window into the home of the
doctors. Last November, a doctor in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was shot in
the shoulder by a bullet fired through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Police Chief Frank Olesko said local investigators as
well as FBI agents and Canadian authorities were looking at the
possibility that the same gunman could be responsible for all of
the shootings. A task force of several Canadian and U.S. law
enforcement agencies has been investigating the attacks for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   National abortion-rights advocates expressed concern that the
slaying signaled a renewed escalation of violence against abortion
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman who shot Slepian apparently hid in a strip of woods
behind the house, then fired a single shot from a high-powered
rifle, Olesko said. Local police, FBI agents and Canadian
investigators searched the woods Saturday, but the identity and
whereabouts of the suspect remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom Press, another Amherst abortion provider who had known
Slepian for years, said, ``He believed women had the right to have
an abortion, and he followed his conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   The slaying comes more than six years after anti-abortion
protesters descended on Buffalo. In April 1992, the city was the
setting for a coordinated series of ``Spring of Life'' protests led
by members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. Nearly 200
protesters were arrested during one demonstration, and
abortion-rights groups held counter protests. Police said Slepian
was one of the doctors singled out by picketers.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with The Buffalo News, Slepian said he took the
rhetoric of abortion opponents seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1993, one month after the shooting death of a
Pensacola, Fla., abortion provider, David Gunn, Slepian spoke about
the vulnerability of doctors who provide abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably hits home a little bit because it could have been
me,'' Slepian told The Buffalo News. ``For years I've felt, and I
still feel, it could happen to me or to someone around here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1995, he told The News: ``When you're using words like
`kill' and `murder,' that's where it can lead. If the
rosary-holding churchgoers and the bishop don't think that's true,
they're fooling themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Slepian had clashed with anti-abortion protesters
outside his home. Protesters had taunted him during the Jewish
holiday of Hanukkah, calling him a ``murderer.'' One protester
later claimed that Slepian had attacked him with a baseball bat,
though the case was later settled.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian divided his practice between the clinic in Buffalo and
his private office in Amherst. Ms. Ward, the clinic spokeswoman,
said he had worked at that and other clinics for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been harassed right in front of his house,'' she said.
``His children have been harassed.'' She called him a courageous
man who followed his principles.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from Attica, N.Y., who identified herself only as Susan,
stood outside his Amherst office Saturday, weeping. She said
Slepian should not be portrayed solely as an ``abortion doctor.''
She said he had delivered her niece and her daughter and that he
kept a photo album of the hundreds of babies that he had delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he was about babies, not abortion,'' Susan said. She
said she had gone to him every three months for the past four years
for treatment of cervical cancer. ``I feel he saved my life. I feel
he is like a member of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   In Slepian's affluent Amherst neighborhood of large homes, there
was a sense of shock that this protected world could be violated.
The slogan on Amherst police cars reads, ``Safest Town in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while,'' said David Guercio, 49, a neighbor
walking by the Slepian home Saturday, ``we get a pumpkin smashed
around here, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Neel Chary, said Slepian's four sons had told
him of a horrible scene. ``They just went into a panic,'' Chary
said. ``The oldest one called the grandpa and said, `Grandpa,
Grandpa, Dad's been shot.'''

WISCONSIN: A BIZARRE TURN IN SENATE RACE  
 RHODE ISLAND: A KENNEDY LOOKS BEYOND HIS STATE  
 NEW HAMPSHIRE: SENATOR PONDERS A SPECIAL PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moved in ``a'' category.) 
(lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, already one of the most hotly
contested in the country this fall, has taken a bizarre turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic incumbent, Sen. Russell Feingold, is an outspoken
proponent of overhauling campaign-finance laws, an author of a bill
that would sharply curtail expenditures by outside groups on behalf
of candidates. In his battle with his Republican challenger, Rep.
Mark Neumann, he has been telling outside interests to stay out of
his campaign and indeed making campaign finance his main pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Neumann. He has welcomed outside money. It has flowed in,
big time, a million dollars or more of it.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it has gone into a television advertising campaign that
has hammered Feingold so hard that many national Democratic leaders
fear that the senator may lose and the Republican hold on the
Senate will be strengthened. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   There was one answer, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, concluded: outside money.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than allow the senator to pay the price, as it were,
for his stand, the committee did an end run on him on Friday and
began its own television advertising campaign on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold demanded that the ads be taken down, calling them
``lousy'' and ``negative'' and saying they did not ``fit'' in his
campaign. Then he persuaded the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle
of South Dakota, to order the committee to halt the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The committee sent back word that it would do so ``if it is
legally possible.'' The ads continued to run.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann's view of all this?
</P>
<P>
   He called Feingold a ``hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy Looks Beyond Rhode Island
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island faces a little-known
opponent in his bid this fall for a third term in Congress. So
Kennedy, a son of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and a nephew of President
John F. Kennedy, is expected to coast to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Kennedys never coast.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a Democrat (of course), is keeping an eye on his
Republican challenger, Ron Santa, a retired electrical engineer.
But his real political focus and effort are elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weeks leading up to Election Day, he is spending
more time campaigning for other Democratic candidates than he is
for himself _ helping them from coast to coast and, given the way
this works, helping himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday he was in Cleveland and Moline, Ill. On Sunday it's
Chicago and Philadelphia. Then it's on to Las Vegas on Monday; Fort
Worth, Texas, on Tuesday; Boulder, Colo., on Wednesday; and on and
on to wherever the Kennedy charisma can be deployed to raise a
crowd and some cash for a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has lost count of how many appearances he has made in
all, going back more than a year. But party officials number them
in the dozens and say he has raised at least $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the advantages that I have, coming from the family
that I come from,'' he answered frankly the other day when asked
about his peripatetic politicking.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more at work here than name recognition, say
Kennedy associates.
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, they say, Kennedy not only is helping the
party but also appears to be angling to become the next chairman of
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. That's a job that
would keep him on the go around the country well after 1998,
passing out campaign money and other political chits _ chits that
he could call in should he decide later to seek higher office, say,
for starters, a seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever course he chooses, this much already seems certain:
After a relatively quiet start on Capitol Hill, Patrick Kennedy is
beginning to make his move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become one of our party's most requested speakers and one
of our very best fund-raisers,'' said Olivia Morgan, a spokeswoman
for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ponders a Special Problem
</P>
<P>
   As he ponders whether to seek the Republican nomination for
president in 2000, Sen. Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire has a
special problem to keep in mind: New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Granite State's political pride and joy, a quadrennial
show that brings in a lot of dollars and focuses huge national
attention on New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But if Smith runs, the state's primary season, at least the
Republican part of it, almost certainly will not be much of a show.
With him in the contest, other contenders will likely shy away, on
the assumption that the favorite-son political dynamic will kick in
and the senator will win easily.
</P>
<P>
   That would be good for Smith. But it would not be so good for
New Hampshire, unless, of course, he went on to become president,
in which case all would be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, home of the
first-in-the-nation caucuses, decided to seek the Democratic
presidential nomination, the favorite-son dynamic kicked in. The
other Democratic contenders stayed away and the caucuses, as dear
to Iowans as the first-in-the-nation primary is to New
Hampshireites, turned out to be a nonevent that year, as did
Harkin's candidacy shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says he has a plan to avoid hurting the New Hampshire
primary, should he eventually decide to run for president, and he
adds that he is ``very, very close'' to a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The key for him, he explains, is Iowa, which will hold its
caucuses a week before the New Hampshire primary. If he can win in
Iowa, he says, he will be satisfied that he has national support
and will feel fully justified in running in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he has been spending a lot of time in Iowa. So far,
he reports, the feedback is ``positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't run if I don't have national support,'' Smith said a
few days ago.

WISCONSIN: A BIZARRE TURN IN SENATE RACE  
 RHODE ISLAND: A KENNEDY LOOKS BEYOND HIS STATE  
 NEW HAMPSHIRE: SENATOR PONDERS A SPECIAL PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moved in ``p'' category.) 
(lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, already one of the most hotly
contested in the country this fall, has taken a bizarre turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic incumbent, Sen. Russell Feingold, is an outspoken
proponent of overhauling campaign-finance laws, an author of a bill
that would sharply curtail expenditures by outside groups on behalf
of candidates. In his battle with his Republican challenger, Rep.
Mark Neumann, he has been telling outside interests to stay out of
his campaign and indeed making campaign finance his main pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Neumann. He has welcomed outside money. It has flowed in,
big time, a million dollars or more of it.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it has gone into a television advertising campaign that
has hammered Feingold so hard that many national Democratic leaders
fear that the senator may lose and the Republican hold on the
Senate will be strengthened. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   There was one answer, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, concluded: outside money.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than allow the senator to pay the price, as it were,

FRIENDS WORRY FOR AN ISOLATED LAWRENCE TAYLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent months, the familiar ritual, sad if no longer much of
a mystery, began to unfold again for Lawrence Taylor. He regularly
refused to return telephone calls from friends. Even a call from
New York Giants owner Wellington Mara went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's withdrawal included virtually isolating himself inside
his $1 million house in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy is holed up in his house,'' Beasley Reece, a longtime
friend of the former Giant linebacker, said, ``there is no telling
what happens to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But nearly everyone close to Taylor had an idea what might
happen, and so there was little surprise among his friends when
Taylor was arrested on drug charges last week. The pattern had
played out before, as seemingly inevitable as it was predictable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there was an almost eerie parallel between the latest
incident and his previous drug arrest in May 1996. In the earlier
arrest, Taylor was charged with trying to buy $100 of fake crack
cocaine from an undercover officer in Myrtle Beach, S.C., where
Taylor had gone to play in a celebrity golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident occurred after Taylor traveled to St.
Petersburg, Fla., to play in a celebrity golf tournament. He was
arrested in his hotel room at 2 a.m. Monday when he allegedly tried
to buy $50 worth of crack cocaine from an undercover police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him, that's all I can tell you,'' Bill Parcells, the
former Giants coach, said last week. ``I guess I'm just like
everybody else. I just hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope appears to be facing a tough fight, for friends say Taylor
may be at one of the lowest points in a life of remarkable athletic
achievement and much personal recklessness. Friends and former
teammates portray Taylor as on the verge of bankruptcy and in the
grips of a longstanding drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who was suspended a decade ago by the National Football
League for drug use, could wind up in prison as a result of his
latest arrest. Already, according to Giants officials who spoke on
the condition of anonymity, the team has paid for two trips to drug
rehabilitation for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Marshall, a friend and former teammate, said he and
others fear that Taylor may ultimately harm himself seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about that very much,'' said Marshall. ``I think it is
a real possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Another close friend, who asked not to be identified, said: ``I
wake up every morning, reading the papers, wondering when I'm going
to read about Lawrence either hurt or worse, either by his own hand
or because he did too many drugs. I love him and I worry about him.
I worry about his future.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Taylor's latest descent into trouble could be
that the strain of his glorious yet irresponsible life and career
is again taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   It has before.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 39, has been arrested three times since retiring at the
end of the 1993 season. He has pleaded guilty to filing a false
income-tax return, been issued three traffic summonses by New
Jersey state troopers for leaving the scene of an accident, had his
driver's license suspended because of outstanding parking tickets
in Newark and been questioned by a state grand jury investigating
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   After the arrest in Myrtle Beach, he told a reporter: ``My whole
world seems like it's in the toilet. Well, it's going to be in the
toilet now. . . . I ought to kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor did not go to jail because he received 60 hours of
community service and submitted to drug counseling and random drug
testing. But the Florida arrest could mean a court-ordered stay at
a drug-rehabilitation clinic or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may come down to either doing that or Lawrence going to
jail,'' said Thomas Melani, Taylor's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Taylor is not unique. There are a legion of former
N.F.L. players who have experienced difficulty handling the
adjustment from star athlete to private citizen once their playing
days are over. Mark Gastineau, the former defensive end for the
Jets, pleaded guilty to assault charges last week, as well. The
bigger the star, sometimes the bigger the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Taylor's biggest troubles stem from his obligations to
his children and former wife. Melani said Taylor pays about
$100,000 a year in alimony and child-support payments for three
children he fathered with his ex-wife, Linda Taylor, as well as
another son.
</P>
<P>
   But Melani said Taylor makes only $50,000 to $100,000 a year,
mainly from selling memorabilia on home-shopping channels, from
making personal appearances and from revenue generated from his
part-ownership of Container Packaging Corporation, a small company
in Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his financial problems, Taylor may be forced to sell
his home in Upper Saddle River, N.J. Taylor has lived there for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not keen on the idea of declaring bankruptcy,'' Melani
said. ``But it is an option he is exploring right now. He may not
have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   That Taylor, who declined to be interviewed when reached by
telephone at his home, is in financial trouble is all the more
regrettable, some say, in light of his considerable generosity. One
former teammate said Taylor, over the course of his 13-year career
with the Giants, gave a total of almost $1 million to Giants
players in need.
</P>
<P>
   But while Taylor is apt to give help, he often refuses to accept
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to engage Lawrence now,'' said Marshall, who is
president of Pro Star Athletic, a sports apparel company. ``One
minute, he's the greatest thing since sliced bread. The next
minute, he's completely different, he wants to have nothing to do
with you. He's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said many others had tried to assist the man generally
regarded as among the greatest defensive players ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can enumerate the names or the list of
people that have tried,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Some have met with modest success. Within the past six months,
Taylor was hired by the owner of an insurance-brokerage firm in
Manhattan, who idolized Taylor. Taylor worked there in public
relations for several months, and the owner, who asked not to be
identified, said Taylor was a model worker. He plans to hire Taylor
again.
</P>
<P>
   Other friends have not been as lucky reaching Taylor. A former
teammate of Taylor's recently attempted to get him a job in a
sports-business company. He also tried to arrange a meeting between
Taylor and Lem Burnham, who directs the NFL's player-assistance
program.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor responded by swearing. ``I'm LT,'' the former teammate
recalled Taylor saying defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for Lawrence to get it all back together,'' Marshall
said, ``he needs some life-threatening experience to bring him back
to us, back to his roots. When he comes back, his friends will be
waiting.''

CHARLES CLINTON KILLINGSWORTH, LABOR MEDIATOR AND ECONOMIST, 81 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Clinton Killingsworth, a labor-management economist,
mediator and university professor emeritus at Michigan State
University, died Oct. 16 at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing. He was 81
and lived in nearby Okemos, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1943, Killingsworth was a mediator and arbitrator in
labor-management disputes. At various times he was chosen to act as
the national umpire and go-between for leading steel, rubber and
airline companies on one side and their unions on the other.
</P>
<P>
   He also sat on various presidential boards appointed to head off
or settle labor confrontations in vital industries. He was a panel
chairman and special hearing officer for the National War Labor
Board in World War II, and returned to government service in the
early 1950s as vice chairman, later chairman, of the federal Wage
Stabilization Board.
</P>
<P>
   Killingsworth was an author of many articles on industrial
relations and economics for law reviews and academic journals. He
was co-author of a three-volume compendium, ``Trade Union
Publications, 1852-1940'' (Johns Hopkins Press, 1944).
</P>
<P>
   His book credits include ``State Labor Relations Acts''
(University of Chicago Press, 1948) and ``Jobs and Income for
Negroes'' (1968), which remains in print at the University of
Michigan's Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Killingsworth was born in Webb City, Mo., and graduated from
Southwest Missouri State University in 1938. He received a master's
degree in science from Oklahoma State University in 1939 and a PhD
in economics from the University of Wisconsin in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   His first academic appointment was as an instructor in political
economics at Johns Hopkins University, where he remained until
1945. He joined the faculty at Michigan State two years later, and
was named a full professor and head of the department of economics
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Killingsworth also headed the university's Labor and
Industrial Relations Center, which he helped establish in 1956. He
was promoted to university professor of labor and industrial
relations and economics in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Killingsworth's first wife, the former Beverly Kritzman, died in
1970 after 27 years of marriage. He is survived by his second wife
of 27 years, the former Jacqueline Schrecengost; a son, Mark R., of
Princeton, N.J.; a daughter, Charlotte Senour of Hermosa Beach,
Calif.; two adopted daughters, Randi Tupper of Grand Rapids, Mich.,
and Tammy Hall of Boston; and eight grandchildren.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: AFTER THE MERGER, THE FORMER CEO IS
VULNERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No man, the Bible says, can serve two masters. But it is silent
on what happens when a company has two masters, each of whom is
used to being the sole boss. The reality these days is that few
things are more likely to mess up a merger _ either before or after
it is completed _ than squabbles about the duties and prerogatives
of the two erstwhile chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest casualty of such a battle is David Coulter, the
51-year-old president of BankAmerica. Coulter was chief executive
of BankAmerica before it was taken over by NationsBank in what was
officially called a merger of equals and left Coulter No. 2 and
heir apparent to Hugh McColl, No. 1, the man who built NationsBank
(now called BankAmerica) into a giant.
</P>
<P>
   That merger became effective only a few weeks ago, not long
before the merged bank reported that profits were slashed by an
ill-fated hedge fund investment made by the bank that Coulter had
run. Analysts friendly to McColl immediately began speculating that
Coulter was a goner, and his ``resignation'' was announced last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Coulter deserved to walk the plank, he did so
without much financial pain. His compensation package will bring
him about $30 million as he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his departure highlighted what has become a major
problem: how to deal with a man _ there are few women running large
companies _ who is used to being the top guy, the one who always
gets his way, but who will now have a boss.
</P>
<P>
   Often, when two huge companies merge, the solution is for the
younger of the two chief executives to become No. 2, with a
promise, stated or implied, that he will replace the older boss at
retirement. Trouble is, there probably was at least one other
executive who thought he had a shot at the top job. So the new No.
2 not only has to get used to having a boss, but also must learn
about a new company in the presence of executives who resent his
arrival and would love to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the solution has been to let each guy stay as boss.
That was the plan when Sandy Weill and John Reed were made co-chief
executives of Citigroup, the combination of Travelers and Citicorp.
The plan may even work, although it should be noted that few
companies voluntarily choose such an arrangement except in mergers.
</P>
<P>
   A co-boss arrangement was also chosen when American Home
Products agreed to merge with Monsanto. But that deal fell apart
after the two bosses began squabbling over almost everything. It
was the third drug-industry merger of the year to fail as the
result of such bickering.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the oddest management plan yet devised for a merged
company came when Cendant was formed late last year by a merger of
HFS and CUC International. Henry Silverman, the boss at HFS, was to
run the company for a few years, with his old subordinates holding
down other top jobs. Then that whole team was to step aside and let
the old CUC team take over.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement blew up, with the former head of CUC, Walter
Forbes, forced out (with a $35 million severance package) after
investigators concluded there had been massive accounting fraud
that inflated profits for years at CUC. But even before that fraud
was uncovered, Forbes' old underlings were being forced out in what
could be viewed as a power play by the HFS team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cendant disaster is clearly extreme, but it highlights a
common problem in making a merger work. Two management teams try to
get the best arrangement they can in a merger, for themselves and
for their shareholders, and each may suspect that the other side
was not totally forthcoming about its problems. Then, when the deal
is done, all are supposed to work together.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to do. The merging companies may talk of cost
savings and strategic vision, but in the end what often counts are
the needs and wants of people who are used to running their own
show. Once you have been No. 1, being No. 2 is no fun.

U.S. RIDER GAINING SUCCESS IN FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Things _ little things like life in general, his job and
his mental health _ are going much better for Chris Horner, thank
you. He was down a lot last year in his first season as an American
bicycle racer trying to succeed in Europe, and he has been down a
lot this year too, but now it's a laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the problem was emotional: the loneliness of being a
rider far from home in a country where he had few friends and
didn't speak the language. He was often distraught. ``Can't get
much lower,'' he said at one point, telling friends in the United
States that he sometimes felt on the verge of a collapse.
</P>
<P>
   This year the problem was physical: When Horner says with a
smile that he has been down, he means it literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been crashing a lot,'' he said before he finished his
season with the final World Cup race, the Tour of Lombardy, on Oct.
11 and headed home to California. ``Got a few results here and
there, but I've mainly been on the tarmac.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my fault,'' he protested with a laugh. ``Just bad
luck. I had only one crash where I had any control over it, on a
descent where I was alone. I went too fast and went off the road.
All the other crashes have been in the field; 20 guys go down and
if you're in it, you go down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad about those crashes. This year I'd train really good,
then crash and lose everything, start from zero, come back up
again, crash, lose it again, bring it back up, crash, lose it
again. You feel terrible. I was hoping to make our Tour de France
team, but when I crashed in the Midi Libre I broke my right
wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   In most of the crashes, he added, he had been at or near the
front of the race. That is a sign of how far Horner, who turned 28
on Friday, has come since he left the Nutra Fig team in the United
States and joined La Francaise des Jeux, a French team with big
riders and a big $5 million budget, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   During his first season, Horner was rarely at the front, where
aggressive riders are found. He seemed overwhelmed, perhaps
intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Americans who ride in Europe, he was not on a team
like 7-Eleven, Motorola or U.S. Postal Service, surrounded by a
culture he had grown up in. Nor had his team signed another
American to room with him, as happened with Cofidis and Mapei.
Horner was alone, and it was small comfort to know that when Greg
LeMond started his career in France in the early 1980s, he nearly
cracked too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard year in Europe,'' Horner said when the 1997
season had still not reached its midpoint. ``Being an American
going to Europe, there's nothing you can really do to make it easy.
You just have to adapt. It just takes time. You've got to adapt,
got to.''
</P>
<P>
   So this year he adapted. First, he moved from an apartment near
Paris next door to an assistant directeur sportif, choosing instead
the sunnier climes of Nice. That sun makes people much friendlier,
he reported. Then he brought over his companion and their year-old
daughter for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was necessary to live with my directeur and his family last
year,'' Horner said. ``There was no way I could have moved down to
Nice and got the electricity turned on and the phone going. Now my
French is better and I can handle things. My French is definitely
not spectacular, but it's doable now. And having the family here
has been great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was really hard,'' Horner said, ``but this year it's
much better.'' So much better, in fact, that La Francaise des Jeux
has signed him to a new contract for next year. His teammates and
officials consider him a strong team rider and a generous worker.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I've picked up some more about bike racing,'' Horner said,
``some more about courses and just about the team in general, how
the team's working and the riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bike racing is hard. The important thing is to learn the
courses, how much energy to use and when to use it, which riders
are the ones to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first come over here, you look at all the riders as
being top riders. A lot of riders, you know their names, but you
don't actually know by sight. As the years go by, you learn what
they look like, which is a big help when somebody is going up the
road or you wonder who's with you in a break and decide tactics
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, Horner said, he has pretty much learned how to ride and
live in Europe. After time off in southern California, he will
start training for the new season. Next year, he predicted, no
crashes. Next year, smooth sailing.

BASEBALL COLUMN: YANKEES BEST? YES, BUT WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As soon as the Yankees piled together at the mound in San Diego
last Wednesday night to celebrate their World Series sweep, the
debate began.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is this the best team ever in major-league history?
</P>
<P>
   A. It depends on how you define ``team'' in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If you mean one team in one season, and in the free-agent era
that's about all you can ask, the answer is ``Yes, the Yankees are
the best.'' To support that answer, their 125-50 record is enough
(114-48 in the regular season, 11-2 in what is now known as the
postseason).
</P>
<P>
   To those who disagree, please forget the argument that this
Yankee team doesn't have many future Hall of Famers on it, that it
doesn't have a marquee megastar. All the more reason why Joe
Torre's description of these Yankees as a ``team team'' is the
perfect phrase.
</P>
<P>
   And who is to say that with so many seasons ahead of them,
Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter, Tino Martinez, Paul O'Neill, Chuck
Knoblauch, Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera won't compile the
numbers that will translate into Hall of Fame votes?
</P>
<P>
   But if you define a team in the sense of a franchise's nucleus
dominating an era in the World Series, the answer is ``Wait and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Yankees' nucleus _ Williams, O'Neill,
Martinez, Jeter, Joe Girardi, David Cone (the oldest, at 36 next
season), Pettitte and Rivera _ also won the 1996 World Series, two
out of three ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   But remember that the same nucleus didn't get past the American
League Divisional Series a year ago. That's a demerit.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Williams and Scott Brosius depart for free-agent wealth
elsewhere, if the remainder of the Yankees' nucleus helps win the
Series again next year, it would enhance the memory of what this
1998 team accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout major-league history, winning the World Series has
always been the barometer for the best teams.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the 1954 Cleveland Indians (the sluggers Larry Doby
and Al Rosen as well as pitchers Bob Lemon, Early Wynn, Mike Garcia
and Bob Feller) were in winning 111 games, when they got swept by
the New York Giants in the Series, they lost their niche in
history.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the Brooklyn Dodgers (Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese,
Roy Campanella, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges, Carl Furillo) were in
winning six National League pennants in 10 seasons from 1947
through 1956, they won only one Series from the Yankees, in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the Atlanta Braves (Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Greg
Maddux) have been in winning their National League division in
seven of the last eight seasons, they won only one Series, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And as good as these 1998 Yankees were, or even the 1996 and
1998 Yankees together, they haven't even approached the Yankee
teams that won a record five consecutive Series from 1949 through
1953.
</P>
<P>
   In that span, the Yankees had Joe DiMaggio in center field in
1949, 1950 and 1951 when Mickey Mantle was the rookie right
fielder, and then Mantle moved to center field. Two other Hall of
Famers, catcher Yogi Berra and shortstop Phil Rizzuto, were on all
five teams and another, left-hander Whitey Ford, was on the last
four.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also won four consecutive Series from 1936 through
1939 with a young DiMaggio and four other Hall of Famers: catcher
Bill Dickey, pitchers Lefty Gomez and Red Ruffing and an aging Lou
Gehrig, whose 2,130-consecutive-game streak stopped early in the
1939 season when he was afflicted with the disease now named for
him.
</P>
<P>
   For all the historic hoopla of the Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig
years, those Yankee teams won only two consecutive Series, in 1927
and 1928, as well as two others, in 1923 (without Gehrig) and 1932.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the adulation of Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, the
Yankees won two consecutive Series in 1961 and 1962, but the 1963
Los Angeles Dodgers (Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale) swept the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Except for those Yankee teams that won five and four consecutive
Series, the Oakland A's assembled by owner Charles Finley (Reggie
Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Vida Blue, Joe Rudi, Sal Bando) are the
only other team to win three consecutive World Series, in 1972,
1973 and 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Big Red Machine (Johnny Bench, Pete Rose, Joe
Morgan, Tony Perez) won back-to-back Series in 1975 and 1976, and
then the Yankees (Mr. October, Thurman Munson, Catfish Hunter) put
together their 1977-1978 double in the early years of the
free-agent era.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, only Toronto (Joe Carter, Roberto Alomar) in 1992
and 1993 has won back-to-back Series, proof of how difficult it is
for any franchise to repeat in the free-agent era when its roster
can change so much so quickly from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   That's the challenge the Yankees, with or without Bernie
Williams and Scott Brosius, face now. If they were to win the
Series again for three rings in four years, it would polish their
overall luster as the only franchise in the free-agent era to
accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   If next season's Yankees don't repeat in the World Series, these
1998 Yankees will be remembered as one-year wonders. But if your
definition of best team means one team in one season, that's
enough.

OUTDOORS: CHASING THE SWIMMING AND EATING MACHINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTAUK, N.Y. _ The muscular outboard engine on Captain David
Blinken's 20-foot flats skiff gurgled and growled pleasantly as we
left his slip in the harbor under the still, leaden skies of
October. The boys and girls and Porsches and lattes of summer were
long gone from the East End of Long Island, and this cozy,
overcrowded harbor had regained its identity as a seafarer's
outpost, where luxurious pleasure craft and monstrous, rusting
dredgers and other ``work'' ships added equal measures of character
and charm to the harborscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be looking for fish busting the surface as soon as we
round the jetty,'' said Blinken, 37, who operates the North Flats
Guiding service. ``We could find the albies'' _ false albacore _
``anywhere today.''
</P>
<P>
   The false albacore is a relatively new target for saltwater
anglers, especially flyfishers. These robust little tuna, which
typically weigh between 6 and 10 pounds, appear along the Long
Island coastline in late August and often provide fishing into the
first week of November.
</P>
<P>
   And Blinken is a relatively new type of guide _ a pioneer of
Florida Keys-style light tackle flyfishing on the inshore waters
and fertile, shallow flats of the east end, environments that teem
with bluefish, striped bass, bonita, false albacore and other
gamefish from about the middle of May until after the snow flies.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his college days at Boston University, Blinken played
drums in a band, Das Messerschmidts. Perhaps that left him
predisposed to the curious demands of fishing for false albacore, a
process in which these steel-hard and radiantly handsome fish
strafe schools of bait in brief, explosive blitzes, while a captain
tries to position a boat within the absurdly close distance
required for the flyfisher to reach the albies.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we were motoring along Gin Beach, heading toward Shagwong.
About 200 yards to our right, on Washington shoal, two dozen gulls
were balled up just above the gray-olive surface. Blinken turned
hard, approaching the birds. Wings aflutter, they pecked like
chickens at the surface, trying to snatch frenzied baitfish driven
to the top by a school of false albacore.
</P>
<P>
   The fish created small explosions and silver slashes on the
surface. They flew from the water, mouths agape, the sunlight
gleaming on their iridescent flanks. They locked onto their targets
like living missiles, and their slender dorsal fins sliced the
brine.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Franklin and I feverishly began casting as the backwash
from the boat gently lifted and pushed us into the midst of the
activity. The albies were all around the boat, boiling and ripping
the water. We cast and quickly stripped back our flies _ we were
using the slender and ethereal ``albatross'' and ``jellyfish''
pattern created by Blinken _ but momentarily the blitz was over.
The water swelled gently around us, still and unmarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to worry,'' Blinken said, grinning. ``It's the nature of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The birds began working 300 yards closer to shore, almost on the
beach. We raced over, but again wasted our opportunity. Although 30
seconds is a short interval by most standards, time seems to stop
in the heat of a blitz. It's really an eternity that lasts half a
minute. And if your captain is expert at positioning the boat, you
may get a few precious extra seconds to boot.
</P>
<P>
   I finally hooked up over the fourth pod of fish. The albie
streaked off, making a long run despite the tightly set drag on my
reel. Then it sounded, deep under the boat, forcing me to do a few
laps inside the craft. When Blinken finally tailed and hauled the
fish out of the water, I blinked in disbelief at the exquisite
design and coloration of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the albie has a distinctive bar filled with
black squiggly markings on either side of its thick olive back, a
dorsal fin that folds into a narrow slot as securely as the blade
on a good jackknife, and iridescent silver sides. The thick body
tapers off to a slender ``wrist'' just fore of the albie's
graceful, streamlined tail. This is a swimming and eating machine,
which it proved by promptly throwing up a shower of silver
baitfish, right into Blinken's lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now we know what they're eating,'' the captain said,
closely examining a badly tattered anchovy. He then held the albie
head down and dropped it in the water. Undignified as it may seem,
this is the preferred method of release. The fish vanished in the
splash.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the day, we madly chased pods of albies all
around Shagwong. Fishing the albie blitzes, you constantly crash
and burn, but always rise to fish again. By the end of the day, I
had burned out the guts of one flyreel and destroyed a line. My
fingers were blistered and bloody. Who can ask for anything more?
</P>
<P>
   We also learned that despite the ignoble taint of its name, the
only false thing about this creature is that unlike its cousins in
the tuna family, the albie's flesh is too blood-laden and rich to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   What a wonderful way for a fish to fall short of our
expectations.

HAZING, A LONGTIME NFL TRADITION, MAY HAVE SEEN ITS LAST DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 FBN-HAZING-NYT   (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing like a lawsuit to finally scare the National Football
League when it comes to the nasty subject of hazing.
</P>
<P>
   The league office and individual teams have always known that
hazing occurs. They don't like it _ they hate it, in fact _ but
rather than try to stomp it out, teams ignore it, turning their
back and crossing their fingers that no one is hurt. No one wants
to mess with tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this past off season, someone was hurt, and he
didn't simply lick his wounds and keep quiet. At the New Orleans
Saints' training camp in August, five rookies with pillow cases
over their heads were forced to run a gantlet of 25 veterans. The
rookies said they were hit with large bags of coins. Some players,
like tight end Cam Cleeland, was hit in the face so hard he had
blurred vision in one eye and wide receiver Andy McCullough had a
bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Jeff Danish, from Richmond, N.Y., required 14
stitches when he thrust his left arm and hand through a dormitory
window in an effort to stop himself after the run.
</P>
<P>
   Danish responded to the episode by suing six players, an
assistant coach and the team in United States District Court in
Madison, Wis., for $650,000. Danish accused the Saints of
negligence and is seeking damages for lost wages, impaired future
earning capacity, pain and suffering, humiliation and loss of
enjoyment of life.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit states that the incident was planned by the players
and that the team knew about it, since a player posted a notice on
a bulletin board in the dormitory and the note was seen by
defensive line coach Walt Khourey. Danish says the team should have
stopped the incident before it happened. The Saints and the NFL
have not commented on the lawsuit except to say that hazing of this
type is not tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   What the Danish lawsuit has done is send some teams into a minor
state of shock. The week the lawsuit became public, some team
general managers revealed privately that before training camp
opened next season, they were going to stress to coaches and
players the dangers of hazing.
</P>
<P>
   With Danish as a possible precedent _ it is unclear if this type
of lawsuit has ever been filed before _ teams now fear other types
of hazing lawsuits. It would not be a surprise if the NFL, in a
pre-emptive strike sometime next year, makes a sweeping declaration
that hazing of any kind is no longer tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue basically said this in a statement
soon after the Danish incident. Tagliabue called for teams to place
greater emphasis on safety to ``avoid incidents of this nature,
which are disruptive, potentially dangerous and unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Suing a team for some of the milder hazing practices may seem
ridiculous, but in a litigious society, they cannot be laughed
away. What if a player who is made to sing in front of his team
later sues for emotional distress? Can a player sue if he is
wrapped up in masking tape, covered in shaving cream and put in a
corner for an hour? It could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Hazing has been a part of professional football for as long as
the game has been around. Singing, sticking rookies in the shower
fully clothed, making them buy breakfast, all are a part of
football. The delicate part for the NFL will be filtering the
light-hearted acts from the insane.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Danish was more serious; not only did Danish
say he was injured, he was also made to practice with his injuries
and then was cut from the team before they could heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst street fight when I was a little kid wasn't this
bad,'' he said in August.

NFL NOTEBOOK: EXPANSION; FLUTIE 
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expansion Prime Topic
</P>
<P>
   The main topic at this week's owner's meetings in Kansas City is
expansion. Which city is the favorite to be the league's 32nd city,
Houston or Los Angeles? Among owners, opinions seem to be divided.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners want Los Angeles because they feel even though fans
there can be fickle, it is bad for business not to have a team in
one of the biggest media markets in the country. Other owners like
Houston because prospective owners in that city seem to be more
organized and have their financing situation in order.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, with the addition of Cleveland, there will be 31
teams, and the league wants to add No. 32 quickly so it can have
eight divisions of four teams each.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie's Prime Time
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most incredible story in the NFL now may be in
Buffalo, where quarterback Doug Flutie, who last year was playing
in the Canadian Football League, will start this week against the
Carolina Panthers in place of the injured Rob Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the organization and players firmly believe that
Johnson is a solid quarterback who could someday lead them to a
Super Bowl, Bills players said this week they feel just as
comfortable with Flutie running the offense.
</P>
<P>
   It was a telling sign when defensive end Bruce Smith, who
doesn't warm up to new teammates quickly, gave Flutie a bear hug
after the quarterback scored the winning touchdown run last week
against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   What Flutie has done in Buffalo goes beyond proving that he
could always play in the NFL, something he has always believed. Now
some other teams are beginning to believe that Flutie can indeed
lead an NFL team. That's good news for Flutie, even if it is some
10 years too late.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie can also earn some extra cash this season if by chance
Johnson stays out longer than expected with those sore ribs or gets
injured again later in the year. Flutie is set to receive a
$500,000 bonus if he gets 60 percent of the snaps. It's a long shot
he will play that much, but then again, it was a long shot for him
to be starting again for an NFL team.

SCARLET KNIGHTS ARE SWEPT BY THE GREEN WAVE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Rutgers, which had been taking baby steps
toward improving its program, looked across the field Saturday at a
team making giant steps. Tulane, a perennial loser that only two
seasons ago was 2-9, has become a fleet-footed winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Wave (6-0, 3-0 Conference U.S.A.) entered the game as
one of the nation's eight undefeated teams in Division I-A and was
ranked 22nd by The Associated Press poll. Its 52-24 drilling of
Rutgers (3-4, 1-3 Big East) before a disappointing crowd of 20,714
at Rutgers Stadium showed why.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tommy Bowden has constructed a relentless offense run by
greyhounds in green pants. Quarterback Shaun King and receiver P.J.
Franklin made the most of a gorgeous afternoon. King completed 23
for 27 passes for 320 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for 31
yards and two touchdowns. He completed 18 of 20 passes for 265
yards and four touchdowns before halftime, tying his career high
for a game. Franklin hauled in 12 receptions for 159 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   King moved Tulane's spread-out, no-huddle offense up and down
the field with dump-off passes and the occasional medium-range toss
that his fleet receivers would turn into a long gain. King threw
mostly from a shotgun formation.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Wave had not experienced a winning season since 1981
until Bowden came aboard last season and led the team to a 7-4
record. On Saturday the second-year coach worked with a heavy
heart, knowing that his brother, Terry, had quit as the coach of
Auburn the day before because he had been under increasing pressure
for a losing season.
</P>
<P>
   What used to be the city of New Orleans' running joke is now
just running. Tulane is off to its best start in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Wave rolled up 586 yards of offense to Rutgers' 343 _
161 from quarterback Mike McMahon, who completed 14 of 27 attempts
resulting in a touchdown and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded turnovers in the third quarter before Tulane
applied the knockout blow. King scrambled 7 yards for a touchdown
to give the Green Wave a 45-17 lead with 4 minutes 41 seconds left
in the third quarter, capping an 11-play, 77-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   With both defenses ranked near the bottom nationally, the first
half was predictably offensive. The Scarlet Knights were able to
score, but the Green Wave was able to score a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane broke on top when tailback Jamaican Dartez went over from
the 1-yard line. Rutgers stayed with Tulane briefly. Running backs
Gary Fauntleroy and Jacki Crooks punctured the Green Wave for
double-digit gains to lead an 8-play, 70-yard drive to tie the
score at 10-10 as time expired in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane tacked on King's 1-yard touchdown pass off a play-action
fake to tight end Joseph Aikin to creep ahead, 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tulane's Michael Jordan, knocked so woozy on a previous
play that he began walking toward Rutgers' huddle, intercepted a
McMahon pass to set up King's 71-yard touchdown bomb to Adrian
Burnette, increasing Tulane's margin to 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   King's 10-yard touchdown pass to Franklin gave the Green Wave a
31-10 lead late in the second quarter. But McMahon responded by
firing a 49-yard dart to wide receiver Bill Powell to make the
score 31-17 with 2 minutes 35 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a lifetime in this type of game. On the next
possession, Toney Converse's tackle-breaking 37-yard run gave
Tulane a first down at the Rutgers 34. A few plays later, King hit
Franklin with a 7-yard pass to make it 38-17 at the half.

UBIQUITOUS CELL PHONES MEAN CONSTANT CHATTER FOR A CAPTIVE
AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOYCE WADLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The setting was bucolic when the high-powered cell
phone couple went away for the weekend to a little inn in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The inn, said Lisa Linden and Lloyd Kaplan, public relations
partners in New York, had great charm, with a barn and a view and
Nubian goats munching on the lawn. And, as some other guests were
carrying on a rather loud conversation, Ms. Linden felt there would
be some understanding when her cell phone rang during dinner. She
stayed on for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Best to skim over the humiliating reprimand from the management
that followed and focus on Ms. Linden's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke very quietly and I thought it would be a brief call,
but it was a client in crisis,'' she said. ``You can't hang up on a
client in crisis, even if the only other sound you hear is the
goats munching. I certainly apologize to the innkeepers for
unintentionally violating the calm, but in the late '90s, is
speaking quietly on a cell phone in a dining room that is noisy a
total breach of etiquette?''
</P>
<P>
   There are several million cellular phone users in the New York
City region, according to Bell Atlantic Mobile. Statistics on how
many are yelling into their phones are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that the cell phone people are everywhere:
carrying on long, noisy, intrusive conversations on Metro-North;
conducting phone meetings in restaurants; dialing up friends when
they're sitting behind first base at a Yankee game to report
they're on television.
</P>
<P>
   Those in denial often excuse themselves with the big lie of the
'90s: I got it for the car. The hard-core users, who often feel no
need to apologize, insist they need the phones for work.
</P>
<P>
   So that now in New York, where space is shared and where
cellular conversations take place in the street and the bus and the
commuter train and thus often become everyone's conversation, a
battle of manners is being waged.
</P>
<P>
   In one camp are people like Ms. Linden, who believe that cell
phone conversations are no more intrusive than any other
conversations. In another are people like the management of the
Winged Foot Golf Club in Westchester, which found cell phones
``extremely disruptive'' and banned them three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another camp (this is, after all, New York) are the cell
phone users we must call the Unrepentant; the people who,
regardless of regulations, regardless of place, keep calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was checking my voice mail at Winged Foot and was told to
put my phone away,'' said a sports executive who was a guest and
requested anonymity because he would like to be a guest again. ``I
did it near the clubhouse. The key to using a phone on the golf
course: make sure you've got good shrubbery.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey of 2,000 Long Island Rail Road commuters,
passengers cited noisy cell phone users as one of their major
annoyances. To curtail such annoyance, Hampton Jitney riders are
asked to keep their calls to three minutes, total. Restaurants are
posting signs asking customers to refrain from using cell phones in
the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   The Unrepentant do not care.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Friedman, an entertainment reporter attending a United
Jewish Appeal benefit honoring Ahmet Ertegun, the co-founder of
Atlantic Records, was stunned to see a guest standing near the
honoree take a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's standing with Henry Kissinger, Barbara Walters and
Michael Douglas,'' Friedman said. ``Who did he think it was going
to be?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the summer stock producer who took calls during
auditions at Actors Equity. Actors, many of whom had stood in line
for three hours for a two-minute audition, were enraged. Monitors
now ask everyone at auditions to turn off their phones. The summer
stock producer, when confronted privately after auditions were
over, could not understand the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he got to New York once a year and he had to take care
of business,'' said Tony Nicosia, the director of the Actors Equity
Audition and Casting Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, which is
based in Washington, asked the advice columnist Judith Martin, who
writes under the name Miss Manners, to do an etiquette booklet on
cell phones five years ago. According to the association's
spokesman, Tim Ayers, copies are still available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be real honest with you,'' Ayers said. ``There wasn't
much demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Omnipoint Communications, a wireless-telephone
company based in New Jersey, will be publishing ``Wireless
Etiquette: A Guide to the Changing World of Instant
Communication,'' by Peter Laufer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a reputation for decorum,'' Laufer said this week
from his home in Sonoma County, north of San Francisco. ``But it's
clear to me people need a little guidance. Like one winter, I'm on
the observation deck of the Empire State Building. It was gray and
cold and really special, the snow made it quiet, and some guy was
yelling into his cell phone. He seemed to be missing the moment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Does Laufer believe it is rude to use cell phones on the train?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to use them and ways not to use them,'' Laufer
said. ``We need to train ourselves that the devices are sensitive
enough that there is no need to yell into them. We're like our
grandmothers using the long distance line; their voices go up
unnecessarily high and loud.''
</P>
<P>
   New York cell phone users have a more subjective definition: bad
manners are those things they do not do.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Roberts, the chairman of World Wide Entertainment and
Sports Corp., has four phones in his car, a cellular fax and his
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, however, is cognizant of good manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the phone into restaurants, but I try not to use it
when I'm sitting down to eat,'' Roberts said. ``My etiquette is, I
like to call out, but I don't get too many calls coming in because
I only give my number to a few important people. I never take my
phone on the golf course; that's where I draw the line. Unless it's
a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds a tip for business people. ``I always shut my phone off
when I go into a meeting. If I'm in a meeting with a guy and I need
him more than he needs me and he keeps his phone on, he just wants
to be rude. I go into a meeting with a guy who needs me more than I
need him and he keeps taking calls, that's just stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Bing, who writes a column on corporate life for Fortune
magazine, gave up his cell phone a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was using it heavily, and it was turning me into a jerk,''
Bing said. ``I almost grew one of those little ponytails; I was
aware of the urge to buy overly expensive cigars. I think in
general it's better for us all if we're not so in touch. I'm
seeking to attain a status of being marginally out of touch all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, while Bing uses a car phone, he is deeply intolerant of
cellular phones on Metro-North.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train is a place where we're all pushed together, but it's
also a place of great privacy,'' said Bing, who lives in New
Rochelle, N.Y. ``Anything that intrudes, the person who's yelling,
`When it hits 28, buy!' is deeply resented. But I don't think it's
getting worse. I think there are strong moral taboos, that there's
a hatred that washes over people who attempt an insignificant
cellular phone conversation which is so severe that's it's a
self-policing situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A sports executive who commutes from Westchester and makes phone
calls on the train says he is not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anyone other than my wife tell me I'm talking
too loud,'' the executive said. ``The people who are shunned are
the ones making those loud personal calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what constitutes proper behavior may be determined
by where you live.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Atkins, an assistant at Dan Klores public relations,
attended her sister's wedding in Italy last June in a villa near
Florence. Cell phones rang continually. In the middle of the
dinner, when the best man was making a toast to the groom, the
groom's phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``He answered it,'' said Ms. Atkins. ``I'm not kidding, I have a
picture. It was his Uncle Fredo from wherever, wishing him good
luck on his wedding. I don't think my sister cared. She was like:
`Whatever. I'm married.' My family couldn't get over it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a reason for cell phone use in Italy, Ms. Atkins
discovered. Land lines are taxed at 30 percent; cell phones are
taxed at 10 percent, and people use cell phones in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sybil Adelman, a New York comedy writer, lived for several years
in Los Angeles, where cell phones first became common.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having dinner in L.A. once, there were eight people in a
Mexican restaurant and each one of them had a cell phone,'' Ms.
Adelman said. ``I looked at them and thought, `So why did we all
have to come here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Adelman is a convert.
</P>
<P>
   Her manners have not always been perfect. There was the time
during her visit to her son's Quaker school that her phone rang
during the silent meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Adelman remains a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best use I had for the phone was when I was at the Javits
center with my sister-in-law and I lost her,'' Ms. Adelman said.
``I picked up the phone and called her.'' She had another success
story: ``My brother told me he was in a theater where a man dropped
his cell phone before the curtain went up and was frantic. Another
guy said, `Give me your number; when it rings, we'll find it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A woman visiting Ms. Adelman jumps in with her own anecdote: ``I
had a friend who was hiking in a park in England. He was lost and
it was getting dark, and he didn't know what to do. So he called
his secretary in New York and she called some park officials, and
they called him and told him how to find his way out.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all cell phone stories have happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   An account executive in her 20s has a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``A girlfriend of mine was out Saturday night with a guy she was
dating,'' she said. ``They were with a group of people going to a
bar, and my friend got into one cab and the guy got into another.
She called him in his cab from her cab and got his voice mail, so
she thinks he's ditched her. She tells all her girlfriends in the
cab what a jerk he is. She didn't realize she had left her phone
on. He called her back and played all seven minutes of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if there is a lesson in etiquette here.
</P>
<P>
   The account executive agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody should make sure the phone is turned off before they
start tearing into somebody.''

TWO FRIENDS ARE RIVALS FOR MLS CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX YANNIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Bruce Arena and Bob Bradley have been friends
since 1982 and have coached together at the University of Virginia
and D.C. United in major-league soccer. They also joined forces on
the U.S. Olympic team. But they will be rivals Sunday afternoon,
coaching against each other, when Washington and Chicago clash for
this year's MLS championship at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was Arena's top assistant the first two years United
captured the MLS title and was Arena's assistant with the Olympic
team in Atlanta as well. The two also share northeastern roots;
Arena was born in New York City, Bradley in Montclair, N.J. But
Bradley left Arena and United to become the head coach of the
expansion Chicago Fire this season.
</P>
<P>
   Joining an established league and taking a newly formed
expansion team to the championship game in its first season was an
accomplishment never before achieved in major professional sports
in the United States. After leading the Fire to a record of 20-12
in the regular season, Bradley led the Fire to a sweep of Colorado
and Los Angeles in the playoffs and he was named coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's personally thrilling to see Bob have so much success and
be recognized for it,'' Arena said after Bradley was presented with
the award on Friday. ``I'm sure his team will be the most difficult
opponent for us in the championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes our friendship so good,'' Bradley said, ``is that
it has been based on the fact that we challenge each other. For me,
it means extra to play United in the championship game because they
have set the standards in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena and Bradley have set the standards for American coaches.
They recruited well for their collegiate teams and for D.C. United
in the league's initial season.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did it alone with Chicago this season. While all MLS
teams put emphasis on Latin players, Bradley got Europeans from
Poland and the Czech Republic to go with his Americans. He built a
team that drew 32,744 in Chicago for their last playoff game, a
shootout victory over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Arena's gifts in evaluating talent, getting the most out of his
players and knowing the mentality of the American player _ pro and
college _ have made him the premier candidate for the job as coach
of the national team. In the minds of many, Arena's appointment is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a fifth national collegiate title with Virginia,
Arena lured Bradley away from Princeton to be his assistant at D.C.
United. Bradley said Arena taught him that soccer was, foremost, a
players' game and it was the players _ not the coaches _ who decide
the outcome of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Both Arena and Bradley have players good enough to decide the
outcome of Sunday's game, especially Marco Etcheverry, Washington's
Bolivian midfielder, and Peter Novak, Chicago's Polish midfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will try to neutralize Etcheverry by assigning Chris
Armas to shadow him, but no one can shadow him during free kicks
and corner kicks, and that is when Etcheverry is most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Novak is not as creative as Etcheverry, but he gets more
involved than Etcheverry in all parts of the field. Arena will
assign Richie Williams to track him down in midfield.

 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone strolled into the Yankees' clubhouse
before Friday's parade and saw Darryl Strawberry talking with other
teammates, less than three weeks after undergoing surgery for the
removal of a cancerous tumor in his colon. Feelings that Cone has
had difficulty containing in the last month welled within him
again.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional year for the veteran pitcher. He began
spring training as an enigma, coming off shoulder surgery, manager
Joe Torre repeatedly saying he wasn't counting on Cone's return
until May. Cone's rehabilitation accelerated, he started the year
in the rotation _ and pitched so poorly in April that he had
fleeting thoughts of retirement, at the same time his mother became
ill.
</P>
<P>
   But Joan Cone came through surgery for the removal of a mass
outside her chest cavity, and her son rebounded as well, after
repositioning himself from the left side to the middle of the
pitching rubber. By August, the Yankees were already being compared
to some of the greatest teams of all time and Cone led the majors
in victories _ before his arm grew tired near year's end and he
missed several chances to pick up his 20th victory.
</P>
<P>
   On the last Saturday of the regular season, however, the
35-year-old Cone reached that milestone and he could not corral
emotions that would overcome him repeatedly during the postseason,
through Strawberry's illness, after the playoffs and World Series,
when the enormity of the season _ for Cone and for the Yankees _
seemed to strike the pitcher all at once. Underneath his
sunglasses, he appeared on the verge of tears as he spoke to fans
at Friday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, Cone agreed to speak freely and intermittently
with The Times about the Yankees, their season and his season, so
long as his comments would not be published until after the
playoffs, win or lose. Some of Cone's comments made to groups of
reporters during this time are also included.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 11: The Yankees are 86-29 and on a pace to win 121 games.
Players are saying publicly that they aren't thinking about
breaking the record of 116 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all aware of the records, and that creates a sense of
urgency to it, just to keep grinding it out and push right through
to the end. I don't think anybody really talks about it on a
day-to-day basis, and it's not really on the forefront of our minds
_ but we're very aware of it. That provides extra motivation.
Players can deny it all they want, that we don't think about the
record, that we're just worried about the team. But we know what's
going on. Things are starting to mount up that are just unreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turning point was that last West Coast road trip. The
veterans, we pointed to the second West Coast swing and thought,
that's going to be the tough time. If we can get through that
second West Coast trip, we've got all those home games left and we
should be in good shape. It seems like we attacked the second West
Coast trip, just devoured it, and came back on a high. We're riding
that wave as we speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a desperation to win. Part of it is Paul O'Neill and
Tino Martinez and Derek Jeter, their approach day in and day out.
Those guys are such grinders. It's almost as if they worry about
their own internal game and how they feel, and if they don't feel
right, they're a little off, they're not happy. They have this
tremendous ability to block out everything else. The kind of game
we're playing, who we're playing, it doesn't matter. Those guys
just want to be locked in when the playoffs come. They want to try
to push through to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in this mode right now _ draw first blood. You look for
Chuck Knoblauch and Jeter to get on early, and it's nice when
O'Neill and Tino get hits early, so they don't become frustrated.
And if we don't score early, the onus goes back to the pitcher:
Hold them right there, give us another chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an advantage to having our record right now.
Certainly teams that come into Yankee Stadium think about it. I've
seen certain situations in the middle of games when we start to
mount a rally, and you can see pitchers panic a little bit. All of
a sudden we've got a big crooked number on the board, four or five
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is fear. You saw how Jim Thome got hurt the other
night and that can really rattle the cage of a team. If something
happened to Derek or one of our key everyday players, Paul or
Bernie Williams, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 22: The subject is George Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a memory like an elephant. He remembers everything.
It's an intense team, he's an intense owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone smiled, in remembering Steinbrenner's response to the dog
bite Cone suffered in June, a minor injury that forced him to miss
a start and led to the promotion of pitcher Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the dog bite, he let me know how he felt, kind of
jokingly. His attitude was like, What the heck was that _ how did
that happen? Whenever he saw me, he'd say, How's that dog bite?
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to test you and see how you respond, like with Darren
Holmes earlier this year. He said something about him and Holmes
responded the right way _ he stood up and he took responsibility
for the way he was pitching. He showed he could take a shot, not
only with the Yankees but New York itself. You have to show you can
take some criticism.''

   Sept. 21: The Yankees are sputtering a bit as the playoffs near,
playing so poorly in one game that manager Joe Torre felt a need to
chastise the team after a 7-0 loss in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't display a lot of emotion, so when he does, it's
very effective. He made sure to go around the room and ask for
opinions. He'll look at O'Neill and ask, What do you think? He'll
look at me and say, If you've got something to say, say it now.
We've really responded to his style, this year is really indicative
of that. Accept the challenge, prepare, be professional. He
commands respect, some of it for the type of career he has as a
player. It helps, too, that he worked in the media, as a
broadcaster. He always seems to say the right thing to the media. A
lot of guys in here say they don't read the papers, but they're
aware of it _ they don't dwell on it or get caught up in it, but
Joe just has a knack for saying the right thing. Not only in the
team meetings, but to the media. That's another way to communicate
to the players.''

 &HT;    Jigging spoons make for easy fishing
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde and Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK'S TIP
</P>
<P>
   For easy fishing that can catch a variety of fish, try jigging
spoons throughout the winter, according to guide Jerry Hester of
Alpharetta. Find large schools of shad near the bottom in the backs
of creeks (rule of thumb is 30 feet, says Hester), and drop the
spoon. You can catch anything from crappie and white bass, to black
bass and stripers or even walleyes. Hester caught a five-pounder on
Lanier using the technique. ``Usually when you find a large
concentration of shad, there's some kind of game fish around,''
Hester said. Jig the spoon by lifting to about waist high, then
letting the lure fall back down. Use spoons between one-half and
one ounce. ``Bigger spoons tend to weed out the smaller fish,''
Hester said. ``But you'll get more bites on the smaller spoon.''
</P>
<P>
   SHARP SHOOTER
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cobb of Carrollton won his ninth Georgia State
Muzzleloading Championship. His mother, Bunny, won her eighth
Ladies title. But both were overshadowed this year by an
11-year-old girl. Mary Amelia Taylor of Frisco City, Ala., shot a
perfect 50 _ five shots in the bulls-eye _ to win the Sub Junior
Championship. Great shooting, but it was how she did it that amazed
the members of the Georgia Federation of Muzzeloading Clubs
competing in Columbus. Taylor's target had just two bullet holes.
One, a little larger than the other, was the entry point for four
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SHELVES
</P>
<P>
   You'll get lots of how-to information, but what might make Shaw
Grigsby's first endeavor as a author most entertaining is his
perspective on the ``magical sport'' of bass fishing. ``Bass Master
Shaw Grigsby: Notes on Fishing and Life'' (National Geographic
Books, $19.95), co-written with Atlanta-based novelist Robert
Coram, chronicles the Gainesville, Fla., angler's love of fishing.
``It's not just a fishing book,'' said Grigsby, in Atlanta last
week promoting the book. ``It's about how you learn a lot of things
about life through fishing.'' The book still contains enough
instruction to satisfy the most information-hungry anglers,
including tips, tackle and techniques. ``If you like fishing you'll
enjoy it,'' Grigsby said. ``If you don't, you'll still get an
understanding of someone's passion.''
</P>
<P>
   FEED WITH CARE
</P>
<P>
   People who put corn and other feed out for wildlife should be
careful not to threaten the animals they are trying to help,
according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Wildlife
Resources Division. There is a possibility that the grain used as
wildlife feed is contaminated with aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are
produced by a fungus which contaminates grain stored under warm,
humid conditions and can cause health problems in many species of
wildlife.

 NEW YORK: the players.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sept. 27: The day after Cone wins his 20th game, his emotions
are still simmering as he recounts his postgame exchange with
catcher Joe Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the clubhouse when the game ended, and I was doing OK
until I saw Joe and I saw how much it meant to him, too, after what
we went through this year. I just lost it, absolutely lost it, and
I never really did get it back until I got done talking to all of
you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 28: The Yankees are on the eve of the playoffs, and in
spite of their 114 victories in the regular season, conventional
wisdom is that they need to win the World Series to validate their
record and confirm their greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling good about things, we're playing well, we've won
seven straight. I think everyone is extremely focused on what we
need to do, and this is the most professional, focused team I've
ever been a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Name one player you think is going to do well in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Brosius. He's got that glint in his eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1: Torre calls a meeting and informs the Yankees that colon
cancer has been diagnosed in Darryl Strawberry. Cone _ also shaken
by the death of his former Kansas City teammate Dan Quisenberry, at
age 45 of brain cancer _ is devastated, standing alone during
batting practice, retreating to the stands to speak with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of forget about hanging a slider or the magnitude of
the game. You really begin to realize what's important when
someone's health is on the line. These sort of life-and-death
situations supersede baseball in every way. When you look back at
the last couple of days and you see what has happened to Dan
Quisenberry and his family, it shakes you up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl is going to have a lot of confusion and he is going to
be scared. We are all scared. But the prognosis is good. From what
we hear, there has been early detection and there is an excellent
chance of full recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 12: Cone is preparing to pitch Game 6 of the American
League Championship Series against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very good to be in this position after what happened
last year. I kind of felt like I let our team down last year, when
I told Joe Torre I was ready to go and in reality, I probably
fooled myself. This is really the first full year I have had with
the Yankees, the first time I have gone into the postseason where I
have been relatively healthy and felt good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cone labors, giving up a grand slam to Jim Thome and nearly
losing a 6-0 lead. Cone departs with the Yankees leading by a run
and they go on to clinch the series and he is the winning pitcher.
Afterward, however, it is apparent in Cone's face that he is very
unhappy with the way he pitched, the way his arm stiffened so
quickly in the middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 20: Cone starts Game 3 of the World Series and again, he
labors, his arm tires. But the Yankees come back and win in the
late innings _ Brosius hits a three-run homer to propel the Yankees
into the lead and to the verge of a sweep _ and Cone appears
relieved after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the brink of something special. There's going to be a
lot of arguments historically about where this team fits in. But
we've got one more game to go. It's the most professional team, the
best team in baseball. We've won 114 games in the regular season,
and I'm very proud to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 23: Cone stands in front of his locker as the Yankees
prepare to depart for the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some emotion today when I saw Darryl here. I walked in
the clubhouse and bam, there he is. I knew he'd be here, but to
physically see him, it really gets you, the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the look on Scott Brosius' face after he hit the
three-run homer and was rounding the bases in Game 3, and the look
he had on his face when he made the final play _ just a genuine,
sincere look of emotion on his face. That says it all. You feel
pretty lucky to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play for a team that's better than the sum of its
parts and you're part of that equation _ it's overwhelming, when
you have a team that really buys into that philosophy. How do you
top it?''

 &HT;    Making sense of BSC formula
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been cussed, discussed, ridiculed and
rationalized. It's the new Bowl Championship Series Standings, and
on Monday it will be coming to your front door.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is a simple one. Because there is no playoff in
Division I football, the powers that be were looking for an
objective way to determine the nation's top two teams, which this
year play in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship. The
polls, representingthe opinions of 132 sportswiters and coaches,
were the height of subjectivity.
</P>
<P>
   So a formula was created that still uses the Associated Press
(media) and USA Today/ESPN (coaches') polls but adds as components
computer rankings, strength of schedule, and won-loss records.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a complicated formula that uses such terms as
``quartile'' and ``standard deviation.'' The standings haven't been
released yet, but the media already has complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formula is complex, but in order to make it as fair and
scientific as possible, it has to be complex,'' said SEC
Commissioner Roy Kramer, the coordinator of the Bowl Championship
Series. ``But the more (the formula) is out there, the more people
will appreciate how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans, used to seeing their teams ranked near the top of the
polls because of tradition, might be disappointed with the results.
For example, Tennessee was ranked No. 3 in the AP poll and No. 4 in
the USA Today/ESPN poll, going into Saturday's game with Alabama.
Given the traditional success of the SEC, the top team in the
conference tends to be treated very well by the pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee's Bowl Championship Series ranking could be below
No. 3, because the conference will be rated lower than normal
because of the performances of Vanderbilt (0-6), South Carolina
(1-6), and Auburn (1-5). In the latest Sagarin ratings of
conferences, the SEC was fourth behind the Big Ten, Pac-10 and Big
12.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about the Bowl Championship Series formula is
that it rewards teams for playing strong non-conference schedules
and penalizes teams that don't. Kansas State, for example, even if
it wins the Big 12 and goes 12-0, could finish behind an 11-0 UCLA
and 11-0 Ohio State because the Wildcats played such a weak
nonconference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formula isn't perfect, but most people agree that it is
certainly better than what we had, which was just relying on the
polls,'' Kramer said. ``It's a sincere effort to reward the best
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   So get out your calculators and sharpen up a couple of No. 2
pencils, sports fans. The debate begins in earnest on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   HOW THE BCS STANDINGS WORK
</P>
<P>
   The BCS Standings, released Monday for the first time, will be
used to determine which two teams will play for the national
championship in the Fiesta Bowl. The standings are derived from
four components. The two teams with the lowest point total will
play for the championship. The components are:
</P>
<P>
   Polls
</P>
<P>
   The poll component is an an average of a team's ranking in the
Associated Press media poll and the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll. If
a team is ranked No. 1 in one poll and No. 2 in another, its
average is 1.5
</P>
<P>
   Computer rankings
</P>
<P>
   Three computer rankings _ Jeff Sagarin, Seattle Times, and New
York Times _ are averaged for the second component. In order to
prevent unusual differences that might occur because of the
computer formular, an adjusted deviation formula will be used so
that no ranking will vary more than 50 percent from its lowest
ranking in the polls. For example, if a team has computer rankings
of No. 3 and No. 5 in two of the lists and No. 12 in a third, that
12th- place ranking would be adjusted to No. 6 (the average rank of
3 plus 5, which is 4, plus 50 percent of that number, or 2, to
equal 6). In this case, the team's computer ranking would be 4.67
(3 plus 5 plus 6, which is 14, divided by 3, to equal 4.67).
</P>
<P>
   Strength of schedule
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of this component is the won-loss record of the
team's opponents. The other third comes from the records of the
opponents' opponents. To get the component, the team's strength of
schedule is divided by 25. Example: If a team's schedule was ranked
28th, its strength of schedule component would be 1.12 (28 divided
by 25).
</P>
<P>
   Team record
</P>
<P>
   Each loss represents one point; wins do not count. Example: If a
team is 10-1, it gets one point in this component.
</P>
<P>
   How the ranking is put together
</P>
<P>
   Using the examples above, a team with a record of 10-1 would get
its BCS ranking by adding the following components: Polls (1.5),
computer rankings (4.67), strength of schedule (1.12), and team
record (1 point for the loss) for a total ranking of 8.29.

 &HT;    At 44, DeBerg's body, instincts preserved
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The alarm clock in Steve DeBerg's body only rings in
the morning, around 6, when he starts each day without benefit of
blaring music or sound. It has not chimed in his life, however, has
not alerted him that, at 44, he should be at home enjoying the
spoils of a creditable NFL career. Or working in an office
somewhere. Or tending to the yard. Or ...
</P>
<P>
   Or anything other than playing football. And yet, DeBerg is a
quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons, and could receive significant
playing time _ perhaps even start for banged-up Chris Chandler _
today at the Meadowlands against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale of the improbable, a middle-aged man playing a
young man's game at the highest level, and after a four-year
hiatus, no less. This isn't the stock market or computer sales or
carpentry. The NFL is physical warfare that borders on brutality.
It's no place for a 44-year-old. No ordinary 44-year-old, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, where men his age wake up some mornings with pain and
soreness from tasks as simple as carrying luggage, Steve DeBerg
insists he experiences none of it. Monday, the morning after taking
shots from the New Orleans Saints en route to helping the Falcons
to a 31-23 win at the Georgia Dome, DeBerg said he was pain-free.
No extra whirlpool necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' he said. ``I haven't been sore one day. Not during
training camp, not from throwing and getting a sore arm. I really
can't even explain it. I mean, I expected for it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought that I would miss maybe one day a week during
training camp. We were going twice a day, and I thought my arm or
even my legs would get sore. I was going to say to (coach) Dan
(Reeves), `Please, give me some rest.' But it never happened. I
can't even explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons strength and conditioning coach Al Miller offered an
explanation. ``God only smiles on a few special ones, and Steve's
one of them,'' Miller said. ``There were others in great shape as
older players: Walter Payton, Jerry Rice, John Elway. Can everybody
who stays in shape play in the NFL until he's 44? No. God has
smiled on him.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg resigned himself to believe just that. In 18 years in the
NFL, he has missed just six games, in 1983 because of a shoulder
operation. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why that is,'' he said. ``All I know is that they
never could hurt me. Early in my career, I used to get the hell
beat out of me. When I was young, I didn't know how to protect
myself when a guy is driving you toward the ground. Over time, your
mind makes that adjustment so that in a hundredth of a second you
move just enough to not take that direct hit. There's something in
my subconscious that protects me. It's not because I'm strong or
fast. There's just some little guardian angel watching over me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has an entire team watching over him. As the elder
statesman, he is among the most-liked players on the team. There
are no ``old man'' jokes. Rather, there's almost a reverence about
his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been around him so much that if he plays in the game we
have total confidence in him to get the job done,'' receiver Tony
Martin said. ``And off the field, he's one of the boys. The age
difference isn't even noticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   The age difference between DeBerg and his best friend, Tony
Madau, is three months. However, their daily activities are hardly
comparable. Madau is an executive for Pepsi in Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is probably the most incredible person I've ever met,''
said Madau, a friend of DeBerg since high school who played
defensive back at Nevada-Reno. ``I don't even want him playing. He
might get hurt. But he's got that thickness about him. And he's
smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in biology class in high school, he'd be sitting there
writing football plays. Then he'd say to me, `Draw a defense
against this offense.' He's studied the game all his life. It's
remarkable he's made it back. But it's something to be proud of,
too. He's what's kept me going.

 &HT;    PGA's top 30 to play course that Bobby Jones made famous
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Golf's past meets its future this week at Atlanta's
East Lake Golf Club with the arrival of the $4 million PGA Tour
Championship. East Lake is the boyhood course of amateur Bobby
Jones, who never earned a dime in official winnings as arguably the
finest player in history. The tournament beginning Thursday returns
East Lake to prominence in the golf world and will pay one of 30
players a $720,000 paycheck for winning the four-day event _ or
$10,000 per hole.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a 15-month, $25 million renovation that developer Tom
Cousins completed in 1995, East Lake, which last gained world focus
as the site of the 1963 Ryder Cup matches, is a showcase spot once
again. On the ground that Donald Ross created, George Cobb revised
and Rees Jones restored, East Lake will host the U.S. Amateur
Championship in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour's top 30 money winners will feel it this week. The
history is as thick as the Bermuda rough. For the majority of the
qualified players, East Lake will both test their talents and
appeal to their sentimental side.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones won four U.S. Opens, five U.S. Amateurs, three
British Opens and a British Amateur while holding a locker at and
an unconditional love for East Lake. He played his last round of
golf here in 1948, along with Atlanta amateur great Tommy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Another close friend was Charlie Yates, who also would
eventually win a British Amateur championship, in 1938. Four years
old when his parents moved to East Lake in 1917, Yates used to
sneak under the fence at Alston Drive, near the first hole, for a
glimpse of the teenager Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Now 85, Yates remembers, ``I can't tell you how much Bob liked
that course.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, 49, seemed more excited about walking in the
footsteps of Jones at East Lake _ the same as he does every year at
Augusta _ than he did about a chance at $720,000. Watson probably
will spend more time this week absorbing the Jones memorabilia in
East Lake's splendidly restored clubhouse than beating balls on the
practice range.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it means a lot more to play at a place like East
Lake,'' Watson said. ``The golfers are different, and we're not
playing the exact same course that Bobby played, but it's still
going to have the image and the ghost of Bobby around. It's a
historic place, a landmark of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III of Sea Island said, ``Not only is the golf course
great, but we're going back to a place that has history, rather
than leaving a place that has history. There's been so many times
that we've seen tournaments change, or they move to a TPC course,
and you lose that sense of history. It's nice to be gaining it.''
</P>
<P>
   No player is more depressed about not making the top 30 than
Smyrna's Stewart Cink. An East Lake member who carries the club's
logo on his bag, Cink said about the property and its clubhouse,
restored to its 1926 condition, ``It's almost like Graceland.'' In
the fall of 1995, when the PGA Tour was considering East Lake as a
site, getting key people to play the course was imperative for
commissioner Tim Finchem. Cousins, assisted by Atlanta resident
Billy Andrade, his Brookhaven neighbor, managed to get Love over
for a visit, both to see the clubhouse and play the course. Andrade
called Braves pitcher Tom Glavine to fill out the foursome.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got done, he said, `This place is awesome,' '' Andrade
said. ``It was important to have Davis play it, because he was on
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is speculation that East Lake might be added to a
regular rotation for the Tour Championship, along with the Olympic
Club in San Francisco, Southern Hills in Tulsa, Pinehurst No. 2 in
North Carolina and Houston's Champions Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``People asked me if I'd like the Tour Championship at East Lake
every once in a while,'' Love said. ``I said, `How about every
year?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, who will hold a press conference at East Lake on
Tuesday with members of his President's Cup team bound for
Australia in December, has played the course twice and marvels at
both the property and the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Tom Cousins has done there is fabulous,''
Nicklaus said. ``I think it will be a prototype for what could
happen in many cities in this country. I think it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk, one of several players who has played East Lake,
absorbed more than mere information on course layout and thickness
of the Bermuda rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the old, traditional layouts like the ones where
I grew up in the Northeast,'' Furyk said. ``Although they've kind
of redone it, they've kept the old characteristics. And what
they've done to the clubhouse (through a $12 million renovation) is
just beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading money winner David Duval, the defending champion of the
Tour Championship and the winner of four 1998 tournaments, played
East Lake occasionally while at Georgia Tech, 1989-92. Although
Duval's first look at the refurbished product will be Monday during
a practice round, he greatly enjoyed the course even during its
downtrodden times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when it was in bad shape, the layout itself was as good
as you saw anywhere in the country,'' Duval said. ``The place is
unbelievable. The place is pure. It was really a treat when we went
out there and the greens were good.''
</P>
<P>
   East Lake didn't have Crenshaw bentgrass greens or zoysia
fairways when Bobby Jones, Watts Gunn and Alexa Stirling toted
hickory-shafted clubs along Alston Drive in their youth, but much
of the layout remains the same. Rees Jones added some bunkers and
changed some existing ones, but every effort was made to recapture
the original topography.
</P>
<P>
   The course is basically Donald Ross, from its crowned greens to
simplistic lines. Rees Jones replaced the shallower ``splash''
bunkers with the deeper type that Ross saw in Scotland. Tougher to
get out of, they're less sprawling and more subtle from eye level,
in the style of Ross' work at Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out here,'' Cousins said, ``you feel like you're
walking on hallowed ground. Those are Bobby Jones' spike marks in
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The old-time appeal continues into the daily operation of East
Lake. East Lake's extensive caddie program has introduced hundreds
of neighborhood youths to golf. The only carts used on the course
are for players with severe medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we're going to successfully keep kids who are
disadvantaged involved in the game is through caddies,'' Watson
said. ``The last 15-20 years, caddies have just about disappeared,
because of the use of golf carts, and we're hurting the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The course will not require much learning time. For the most
part, East Lake is a straightforward layout. The variables will be
the length and thickness of the rough and the firmness and speed of
the greens. It is playing to 6,980 yards and par 70 for the Tour
Championship, with the fifth and 10th holes being played as par 4s
of 480 and 469 yards. Furyk thinks the uphill 10th hole will end up
being the toughest. ``That green is going to be tough accepting
long irons,'' he said. ``It's really going to take a precision
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   East Lake's signature hole is its 164-yard sixth, one of the
first island holes in America. The tournament's most controversial
spot, however, promises to be the par-3 18th, which will play
anywhere from 215 to 232 yards and require anything from a 3-iron
to a 3-wood. Much tougher than the par-3 18th at Congressional that
created such a stir at the 1997 U.S. Open, East Lake's 18th will be
the prime viewing spot all week.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, the favorite attempting to reach a $3 million season,
will allow history to tug him, but only to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the history makes it special going in, and I think it
makes it special when you're done,'' he said, ``but it doesn't make
a bit of difference when you're playing, because you don't have
time to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With his name already next to Jones' on the Claret Jug, Justin
Leonard said, ``I look forward to those kinds of courses with the
tradition and the history. (Architects) Donald Ross and then Rees
Jones _ those are two of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods has a strong sense of history for a 22-year-old, but
he is affected more by East Lake's entire neighborhood project. He
stood in the middle of it last month when he was in Atlanta to help
open the adjacent Charlie Yates Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a testament to all the hard work that they've done to
restore the entire community,'' Woods said. ``I think that's more
special than the history of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Love and Duval both predict that East Lake will play and feel
more like a major championship than the PGA Tour's season-ending
event. Maybe that puts O'Meara, with two majors in his pocket, in
the lead position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be cool and wet and very, very difficult,'' Love
said. ``But if it's fast and calm, it's just like anywhere _ guys
are going to shoot fairly low scores. I think it's going to play
more like a major. You have to hit fairways and greens, and the
greens have got some humps to them. You're just going to have to
play really solid golf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the scores will be that great,'' Duval said. ``I
doubt you'll get to double digits under par. It's too long and
hard.''

 &HT;    East Lake, Jones as one in eyes of the world
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bobby Jones told me this story himself, many years
ago, of course. It related to an early time in his childhood, when
East Lake was a summer resort for some of Atlanta's families,
including the Jones family. Bobby was a tot of 5 years, a spindly
child giving no hint of the handsome gentleman athlete he would
become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting on the steps of the place where we spent our
summers, a boarding house, as it was. One of the older boys who
stayed at the same house was chipping golf balls in the yard, and I
was watching him,'' Jones said. ``After awhile, he walked over to
me and asked if I'd like to hit some balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a club and hit a few, as well as I remember, then he
asked me if I would like to have a club of my own. He handed me a
club that was something like a cleek. (cq) He had it cut down to my
size and that was the first golf club I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who gave him the club was Fulton Colville, later
prominent in Atlanta society, but a name long since buried under
all the history of Bobby Jones' rise to international fame in golf.
The older boys laid out a little make-do ``course'' of their own
along the road in front of the house, and a legend was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones and East Lake grew up together and became, in the
eyes of the world, as one. Golfers have traveled from all parts of
the world to play East Lake because it was Bobby Jones' course. It
became a shrine. Before it was a golf course, East Lake was an
amusement park, on the end of the trolley that ran out of downtown
Atlanta. It later became the property of Atlanta Athletic Club,
which decided it was the choice location for a members golf club.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the hands of several course designers have been laid
upon this ground, beginning with an itinerant named Tom Bendelow.
Bendelow usually traveled with his family and is said to have laid
out fairways and greens running string, plain wrapping twine, from
one stob (cq) to another, archaic as it may sound. After Bendelow
came the renowned Donald Ross, who gave the course the basic lines
it follows today.
</P>
<P>
   Next came George Cobb, called in to elevate East Lake to
championship caliber for the Ryder Cup matches, played there in
1963. The course remained unchanged, for the most part, until Tom
Cousins, the developer and a great humanitarian, came along and
rescued the property from extinction. Cousins brought Rees Jones,
of the Robert Trent Jones family, and it was Jones' mission to
restore East Lake to the grandeur of the days when Bobby Jones was
spreading the gospel of East Lake around the world. What Cousins
has done is restore the Tudor-style clubhouse to such a state that
Bobby Jones might walk into it today and feel he was home again.
Tragedy struck East Lake twice, when the clubhouse burned to the
ground in 1912 and 1926, but like the Phoenix, it arose from the
ashes to resume its old form.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone presumptuous enough to try to re-create the history of
East Lake in anything less voluminous than ``Gone With the Wind''
is indeed presumptuous. It became the center of Atlanta social
life, although actually located in Decatur. It also became caught
in the middle of a membership split, out of which Atlanta Athletic
Club split off and relocated near Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   What remains is a reincarnation of old East Lake, recapturing
the elegance of old. There was a second East Lake course just
across Second Avenue from the original, and it was a good one. It
fell victim, though, to a housing project, through well-meaning but
doomed civic efforts, and the less said of that, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, what you see of the Tour Championship is the first major
tournament event played on historic ground, a sort of crown jewel
in Tom Cousins' unselfish aim to bring back, not just the elegance
of old East Lake, but also to keep the world reminded of a kind of
sporting life that Bobby Jones brought us, and somewhere has been
lost along the way.

 &HT;    PGA Tour's improbable pair
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was not a relationship predictable from the
beginning as can't-miss. Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara joined at the
hip? Outside of golf, California birth certificates and their
current ZIP codes, what could the two men nearly two decades apart
in age possibly have in common? Apparently, more than anyone
figured.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Woods' arrival on the PGA Tour, he and O'Meara
have become best friends. They play together off the PGA Tour for
usually modest side bets at Isleworth Country Club in Orlando,
regularly taking each other into the low 60s. They play together in
practice rounds at the majors. They hang together at Isleworth.
When people might assume Woods to be out on the town, settling into
a stretch limo, he's more likely to be at O'Meara's house, playing
with his pal's kids.
</P>
<P>
   And last Sunday, they were on the other side of the Atlantic,
playing in the finals of the Cisco World Match Play Championship.
Focused but friendly, they battled fiercely, with O'Meara birdieing
17 and 18 for the win. Woods kicked clubs, but never his opponent.
Truthfully, any time Woods cannot win, he's rooting for ``Marko.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it,'' Woods says. ``We've fed off one
another. He may have been helped more along the lines of golf,
where I've been helped more along the lines of having a big brother
around for personal help, help in growing up. Life decisions, stuff
like that. Just having a person I could bounce stuff off of. We're
a lot alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has helped O'Meara's game, lifting his competitive edge
sufficiently to secure a Masters title and British Open during a
three-month span at age 41. In turn, O'Meara has been a counselor
for Woods, advising him on priorities and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has helped both of us,'' O'Meara says. ``I think it
has helped me from the standpoint of here I am playing with this
young, very talented 22-year-old individual who has actually kind
of rekindled my spirit or my drive. I am a competitive person, like
any other player out here, and I always want to play against the
best. And if Tiger is not the best, he's right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, O'Meara said, ``I think that I'm kind of a sounding
board for him. I think he trusts me. We are good friends. He can
confide in me. And in that way, that's how our relationship has
developed, and I think it has helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Woods wasn't bouncing things off O'Meara two
years ago, when he debuted on the PGA Tour. Maybe the mess at
Callaway Gardens, when Woods walked out on the tournament and the
Fred Haskins Dinner, never would have happened.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship grew in late 1996, when Woods moved to
Isleworth, purchasing a condo there as his starter home.Before
Woods won the Masters in record fashion in 1997, the two had
prepped at Isleworth _ Woods shooting a 59 a few days before. When
O'Meara won at Augusta 12 months later, it became obvious that the
relationship had paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too much golf-wise, but I think more just growing up
as a young adult,'' Woods said. ``Having a person that is always
there and has been through it before. He's a great guy. He's kind
of taken me under his wing, kind of like a big brother, and has
shown me the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   They apparently also have helped each other with the flight of
the golf ball. Woods' trajectory has come down, aiding his distance
control. O'Meara, after a career with a low-ball reputation, is
hitting the ball higher and longer, while landing softer shots on
the greens.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the value of their more informally competitive
rounds at Isleworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things where you can't let your buddy
upstage you,'' Tiger said. ``I think we've both kind of realized
that if I can beat you here, I can definitely beat you on the golf
course in a tournament.

 &HT;    Duval hottest man on Tour since his breakthrough win
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That David Duval has figured it out is the
understatement of the PGA Tour season. Seven wins in 365 days would
be noteworthy for anyone, especially after seven runner-up finishes
in his previous 92 starts.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? What was the difference? Going from a 36-inch
waist to 32? Probably not. Looking at the yellow dot on his
Titleist at impact? Hardly. Duval's head still swivels toward the
target before the crack of titanium against balata.
</P>
<P>
   His success story is something to assist weekend hackers, tour
players who make annual visits to qualifying school and everyone in
between.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, 26, went from nonwinner to No. 1 in the world
because he quit trying so hard. Period. He quit trying to win
tournaments and allowed the process to evolve, logically,
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to learn that you don't have to play great
golf to win golf tournaments,'' Duval said before this week's Tour
Championship, where he could leave East Lake Golf Club with the PGA
Tour money title and its player-of-the-year award. ``You just have
to play and not make mistakes. ... You have to strike the ball well
to win a golf tournament, but you don't have to hit it great. You
have to hit it pretty good, and you have to make putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you win golf tournaments,'' Duval said. ``Make a
couple of extra putts, get a few good breaks and don't shoot
yourself in the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a Masters title eluded him in April after he carried a
three-stroke lead midway through the back nine, Duval's PGA Tour
colleagues show deep respect for his accomplishments. No one doubts
that he will gather a few majors eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets the putter going he's unbeatable,'' Brad Faxon
said.
</P>
<P>
   And even if all the putts aren't dropping, Duval's game is as
complete as anyone's in golf. He leads the PGA Tour statistics in
money ($2,464,408), wins (four), scoring (69.02), putting (1.720)
and birdies (4.39). He's second in total driving (combining
distance and accuracy) and second in the all-around category
(combination of all rankings).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great driver of the golf ball,'' Phil Mickelson said.
``He hits it very long and very straight, and he has a great touch
with his short irons. He's just got a complete game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always maintained that when he wins a golf tournament, he
was going to win a lot more,'' Payne Stewart said, ``because he
keeps getting himself in position to win golf tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval has put himself in position for a money title by playing
his fewest number of tournaments ever, stressing ``quality events
over quantity.'' During time off the tour, he doesn't tune in to
the Golf Channel. He likes fly fishing, having been introduced to
it a few years ago by BellSouth Classic tournament director Dave
Kaplan. He and girlfriend Julie MacArthur enjoy hanging out at
their new home, like any other Jacksonville Beach couple. No
remote-control junkie, David chews through novels the way Vijay
Singh empties buckets of range balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets away from golf, he really gets away,'' Stewart
said. ``Some guys take off, they're still at home grinding, hitting
balls. David enjoys being off the golf course as much as he enjoys
being on the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been misrepresented about the time before his first
win, at Kingsmill, last year. The why-can't-he-win questions
notwithstanding, Duval was not wrought with despair about the
situation. Only one escaped winning opportunity had really
frustrated him _ the tie for third in the 1996 BellSouth Classic at
Atlanta Country Club, when he could have shot par the final day and
won comfortably. Instead he shot 76 and lost to Paul Stankowski by
two shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final day was a very tough (conditions) day,'' Duval said,
``but it wasn't 76 tough, and I blew it. And I'm going to blow it
again sometimes, I can promise you that.''
</P>
<P>
   To Duval's credit, even when another loss occurred at the
BellSouth in 1997 and Duval himself suggested he might have been
``choking,'' he reiterated that day, ``I'm in it for the long haul.
I'm on a 20-year plan out here.''
</P>
<P>
   He ranks as one of his most enjoyable rounds the 79 he shot in
the final round of the 1992 BellSouth. Leading Tom Kite by two
shots after 54 holes, he ended up losing to him by 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me why I would say that,'' Duval said, ``and I tell
them, `Because I'm a junior in college, I'm leading in a PGA Tour
event, I have a chance to win, and I'm playing with Tom Kite.' Does
it matter I shot 79? No. Who cares?''
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts to his life have been so rapid, the rough times
are easily recalled. Four years ago, he was in his second season on
the Nike Tour. Ninety miles down the road from Atlanta, he was
beating balls over a cyclone fence on the driving range at the Nike
Macon Open, unsure of his future. He's the only player to win both
the Nike Tour Championship and the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   He has fought through personal conflicts tragic enough to make
fairly insignificant the temporary inability to win a PGA Tour
event. As a child, Duval was a bone-marrow donor to his late
brother Brent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the worst thing in my life is that I don't ever win a PGA
Tour event,'' Duval said last summer, ``then I think I'm pretty
lucky.

 &HT;    Par-3 18th promises a challenging finish
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A par-3 18th hole in a major tournament is one thing.
A par-3 18th with $720,000 on the line and a fairway wood in one's
hand is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   East Lake Golf Club's 18th hole, which has challenged members
for decades, becomes the spotlight of the Tour Championship this
week. Playing to 232 yards by the card and into the wind, the
uphill hole could demand a 3-wood to the double-tiered green.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III has played East Lake four times and never hit
anything less than a 3-iron, even with the tee moved up 15-20
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the tour's not going to sit us back there on the last
hole with a 3-wood, but I think having a par-3 to finish makes it
kind of exciting,'' Billy Mayfair said. ``It will be a great
spectator hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jack Nicklaus, who has played East Lake twice since
May, said he might prefer switching the nines for the tournament,
he said, ``I think the 18th is a very strong par 3. I have no
problem with the 18th hole being a par 3.'' Nicklaus hit a 2-iron
there earlier this month from about 215 yards.
</P>
<P>
   There are no perilous areas around the 18th green; the putting
surface is the real problem. If the flagstick is in the front of
the tiered green and a tee shot goes to the top tier, two-putting
will be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The hole is the last of three tough finishing holes. The par-4
16th is a bear at 481 yards. The 17th stretches to 453 yards with
the new, lengthened tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the 18th,'' said Jim Furyk, who toured the course last
spring. ``I don't see anything wrong with finishing on a par 3. It
looks like they could lengthen it and it would be a 3-wood. It's a
challenging hole, a tough finish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not that much different than a long par 4, minus
the tee shot,'' East Lake member Stewart Cink said. ``You've got to
(use) a 2-iron or 3-iron or 4-wood, and you've got to put it in the
right place _ below the hole, where you can get it down in two
putts. I've actually hit some 3-woods short there a little bit.''

 &HT;    East Lake Golf Club: A hole-by-hole look
 &HT;    By Rick Burton and Chad Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ EAST LAKE GOLF CLUB
</P>
<P>
   No. 1, 424 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   The drive on the opening hole requires the player to be on the
left side of the fairway to have the best shot at the green. Two
bunkers right of the green and one bunker left are ready to capture
an errant shot. The deep bunker on the right makes a back-right
hole location the toughest.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2, 192 yards, par 3
</P>
<P>
   To score well at East Lake, players can't afford to miss greens
on the short side of the flagstick. That's particularly true here.
This par 3 plays a bit shorter than the yardage, but it's a must to
put the ball on the green. The green slopes dramatically from back
to front and from left to right and is guarded by bunkers on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3, 387 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   On this short par 4, a fairway wood off the tee should leave
players with a short iron to the green. The front of the green is
guarded by two large bunkers that are especially difficult if the
hole is cut on the right portion of the green. The green slopes
from back to front and has several dominating ridges that make it
very difficult to read.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4, 440 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   A long, straight-away par 4. Players will want to avoid the two
fairway bunkers on the right to set up a mid-iron approach to this
green. The green slopes from left to right, making left hole
locations most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5, 480 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   The first of two par 5s that have been shortened to play as par
4s for the Tour Championship. This 480-yarder will play much
shorter than the yardage as the drive will pitch forward on the
downslope of the fairway. The second shot will be a long iron from
a downhill lie, making it tough to get to tight hole locations.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6, 164 yards, par 3
</P>
<P>
   This 164-yard par 3 is an intimidator, especially with the
prevailing wind pushing the ball toward the water right of the
green. The only bail-out is a bunker on the left that provides
another terrifying shot. The most challenging hole location is
front right, but back left, behind the bunker, is also tough.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7, 394 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   The seventh is a slight dogleg left that demands accuracy off
the tee. A fairway bunker along the right side will punish a drive
straying in that direction, resulting in a difficult approach shot.
The second shot must navigate two deep greenside bunkers in order
to find the two-tiered green, blind to players from the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8, 360 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   The shortest par 4 on the course is a dogleg left with bunkers
and trees on the left side of the fairway that should deter players
from cutting the corner. Although often thought of as a birdie
hole, No. 8 has a relatively small, firm green surrounded by a deep
bunker in front and thick rough on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9, 584 yards, par 5
</P>
<P>
   A long drive provides an opportunity to reach the ninth green in
two, especially if the hole plays downwind. The second shot will be
either a mid to long iron layup short of a fairway bunker on the
left, or a fairway wood try for the green in two. The green is
guarded in front by deep bunkers; anything long will be a difficult
up-and-down.
</P>
<P>
   No. 10, 469 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   The toughest par 4 on the course _ East Lake members play it as
a par 5 _ requires that the tee shot be long and to the left side
of the fairway to allow players to see the putting surface. The
second shot will be a mid to long iron into a fairly large green.
The green slopes severely from back right to front left, making lag
putting from the back a real chore.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11, 192 yards, par 3
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the wind, the tee shot to the elevated green ranges
from a 4 to a 6 iron for most players. The green is 38 yards deep
and the back portion is blind to players on the tee. A large oak
tree protects the right side of the green and the front portion is
pinched by a pair of deep greenside bunkers. Sidehill putts often
have 4 or 5 feet of break and putts from above the hole are
surprisingly quick.
</P>
<P>
   No. 12, 391 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   Most players will hit fairway woods or long irons off the tee on
this downhill par 4. An overhanging tree and deep rough on the left
side of the fairway make this hole very tough from the left side.
The right center of the fairway is the ideal location, leaving a
short iron to the green.
</P>
<P>
   No. 13, 400 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   A good driving hole. From the championship tee box, players aim
just to the right of the fairway bunkers. A left-center fairway
position is ideal. Right center is workable, but it means dealing
with the right greenside bunker on the approach. Like many others
at East Lake, the green is sloped from back to front, making ball
position on the green critical.
</P>
<P>
   No. 14, 442 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   Old oaks and tall pines make this straight-away par 4 a very
tight and demanding driving hole. Longer tee shots could leave a
difficult sidehill stance along the right side of the fairway. The
two-tiered green is bunkered on both sides, with the green sloping
from back to front. Players placing their ball below the hole will
have opportunities for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15, 495 yards, par 5
</P>
<P>
   Three tall pines on the right side of the fairway force players
to hit a fade to the best position in the fairway. With a good
drive, players can reach this short par 5 in two. A well-bunkered
green poses problems if missed long or short. One of the easiest
holes at East Lake, a par here will drop a shot to the field.
</P>
<P>
   No. 16, 481 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   This picturesque hole provides a commanding view of the Atlanta
skyline and East Lake. The fairway narrows to 25 yards in width 278
yards from the tee, making driving accuracy a premium on this long
par 4. From here a mid to long iron is needed to reach the green.
Two large bunkers await errant approaches into a large, receptive
green that slopes from back to front.
</P>
<P>
   No. 17, 453 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   Two bunkers lie to the right of the fairway landing area on this
final par 4 at East Lake. The approach is played to a large,
undulating green that is flanked by a big bunker to the right and
one short to the left. A dominant ridge crosses the center of this
green, making it tough to get the ball close to back hole
locations.
</P>
<P>
   No. 18, 232 yards, par 3
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the wind, players could use anything from a fairway
wood to a long iron on this demanding par 3. Deep bunkers left and
right of the two-tiered green leave little room for error. Any
player leaving the ball above the pin must take extra care, facing
one of East Lake's most difficult putts.

 &HT;    Lower Altamaha region favorite spot for lunker flathead catfish
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JESUP, Ga. _ Pat Brantley has a front-row seat for Flathead
Madness on the Altamaha River in southeast Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Owner of Pat's Bait and Tackle, located at the Jaycees Landing
just off U.S. 84 a few miles north of Jesup, Brantley sees
firsthand every day the effect the loved and hated flathead catfish
has on people. She watches from a rocking chair on her shop's
porch, just 20 yards from the boat ramp, where probably thousands
of record-seeking anglers have launched boats in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen it all from here,'' the young-looking 67-year-old
Brantley said on a recent Sunday morning, while rocking and
watching with son Billy. ``They come from all over _ Florida,
Atlanta, everywhere _ to catch these catfish.''
</P>
<P>
   They've seen everything from Paul Duke's state-record flathead
of 63 pounds, 8 ounces _ five pounds heavier than the previous
best, caught in June just south of the ramp and weighed at the
tackle shop _ to a variety of boat-ramp mishaps, including the
fellow who accidentally dragged his johnboat halfway up the ramp.
</P>
<P>
   ``See what I mean?'' Billy Brantley, 49, said after he and
another man helped pull the johnboat back to the water. ``You could
make a movie on what happens here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that there's no other reason to come to the
Altamaha, a beautiful muddy stretch of water that flows from the
Oconee and Ocmulgee rivers to the Atlantic Ocean. If that's not
enough, how about the Brantley's pet Hampshire hog, Snoot, who
loafs around in the yard and provides visitors an unusual photo
opportunity by chugging down a 20-ounce Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The swine has attracted the attention of media outlets all over
the country. ``People just can't believe it,'' Pat Brantley said.
``This one is a dog in a pig's body.''
</P>
<P>
   Other attractions aside, along the lower end of the Altamaha,
the flathead is putting the river on the map. Also called the
Appaloosa Cat, it grows fast and big, and its fight on even the
heaviest tackle can leave an angler spent.
</P>
<P>
   And for every 40-pounder that's pulled through the swift
Altamaha current, it becomes easier for people to forget that the
flathead is largely responsible for ruining one of the state's
finest redbreast sunfish fisheries. The flathead was introduced
illegally into the river system sometime in the 1970s and since has
infiltrated many areas of the system that includes the Altamaha,
Ocmulgee and Oconee. The redbreast population has suffered greatly;
it has been the flathead's favorite meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a fan of the flathead,'' said Jesup City
Manager Mike Deal, who says there has been talk about having a
flathead festival, including a tournament, next year. ``But if it's
going to put us on the map, then I'm OK with them. ... The
flatheads have brought a lot of people here to our river. It's not
a major boom, but it's maybe a little bit of one.''
</P>
<P>
   You see evidence of it in Jesup. Pat Brantley had T-shirts and
caps made with the slogan ``The Altamaha _ Home of the Flatheads,''
and they sell reasonably well at $12 for a shirt and $5 for a cap.
Keith Padgett's One Stop Bait and Tackle keeps a constant supply of
flathead essentials, his best-selling tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what,'' said Padgett, considered one of the better
Altamaha anglers in the Jesup area, ``if it wasn't for the flathead
catfish, we wouldn't have made it (financially) this year. It's
about the only thing that's kept me going.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer alone, Padgett sold thousands of pounds of gold fish
_ a shiner hybrid used as bait. ``That catfish is probably one of
the only things that brings money to this river,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It also brings droves of anglers looking for a fish story. Fish
as big as 90 pounds have been caught on limb lines (heavy test line
and hook tied to a bush or tree limb), and many over 50 have been
caught on rod and reel, which, because of the fish's fight, is
becoming the most popular angling method. Even Padgett kind of
stumbled onto the thrill of hooking a monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always fished this river for bass and never, ever thought
about catfish,'' he said. ``But I was sitting out one night and
thought, what the heck, I'll put a bream on (the hook) and throw it
out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just laid back relaxing and all of a sudden, that rod just
straightened out. ... Forty-eight pounds, my first one. I thought,
`I could make a habit out of this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Padgett's biggest catch was 56 pounds, 7 ounces, which took him
50 minutes to pull into the boat. He's had several bigger ones get
away, including one this summer he nicknamed ``Loch Ness'' that
straightened out the hook and never got close to the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The fish also is a good eating fish. Unlike most catfish, which
tend to become less tasty as they grow, the flathead is appetizing
at all sizes, probably because it feeds mostly on live fish.
</P>
<P>
   The common way to fish with rod and reel is with saltwater
tackle. Large gold fish are Carolina-rigged with a weight of 4
ounces or heavier, a large live-bait hook (larger than 5/0) and
minimum 30-pound test line, although most use heavier line. Many
anglers customize their boats with PVC piping cut as rod holders,
holding six rods or more. When they find a suitable spot, typically
structure-laden holes on the outside of bends, they cast and wait
for the action to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else like it,'' says angler Matt Snellgrove of
Nunez, who fishes the river frequently. ``It's natural-born
awesome.

EX-PROFESSOR IN LONG-SHOT BID AGAINST FIRST-TERM GOP CONGRESSMAN

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Rush Holt, the Democratic challenger
in central New Jersey's 12th Congressional District, was at a union
dinner here when Beverly Dey, a Ewing Township secretary, asked why
the age when she would be eligible for Social Security had risen to
66 from 65. She thought that was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   After Holt replied that he would protect Social Security, Ms.
Dey was asked whether his answer had won her over. ``He answered
part of my question,'' she said, ``but I want to hear his opponent
first before I make up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponent is the incumbent, Michael Pappas, a Republican from
Rocky Hill, and that Ms. Dey did not say ``Mike'' or ``Mr. Pappas''
to refer to the first-term congressman _ the way New Jerseyans say
``Christie'' when they mean their governor, Christie Todd Whitman _
could be taken to support the Democrat's hope that Pappas is not
yet known so well that he is unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   The district was drawn up to be a Republican stronghold, and
even Holt concedes that he has an uphill fight. Without a strong
turnout he will lose, the Democrat from Pennington tells his
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th District stretches from the Delaware River at the west
to the Raritan Bay at the east, takes in nearly 60 towns and
boroughs in five counties but no cities, and includes the
university town of Princeton, the older Trenton suburbs of Lawrence
and Ewing, the sheltered farms and villages of Hunterdon County and
the retirement communities that are springing up out of the flat
coastal plain toward the shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible district in which to campaign in,'' said
Thomas Hartmann, a retired Rutgers University political science
professor. ``It's just spread all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12th is also New Jersey's most populous and fastest-growing
district, and ranks first in proportion of residents with college
degrees, first in high school standardized test scores and second
in per-capita income. More than 60 percent of its voters are
registered as independent, and the two major parties split the
remainder. In 1996, 75 percent of the district's registered voters
went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas, 38, carried the 12th in 1996 when the seat was vacant by
10,000 votes, less than 1 percent of the total, and he did it in
part by turning out his core supporters in the segments of the
party opposed to abortion rights and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats went into this year's campaign hoping that Pappas
would be vulnerable to being painted as too conservative for the
district. But the congressman has spent this campaign focusing on
his arguments for lower and fairer taxes and avoiding the more
hard-edged social issues that helped him win the first time.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual dinner of the Delaware Township Republican Club in
Hunterdon County on Thursday evening, for example, Pappas was asked
whether his stands on abortion or gun control ever came up during
this campaign. ``Only when someone from the media asks about
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central issue of my campaign two years ago was and
continues to be balancing the federal budget and reducing the tax
burden on people such as yourselves,'' Pappas told his friendly
audience of Republicans. ``Now we're on the right track toward
reforming the tax code, and making it simpler as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Pappas focuses on only a few issues _ he also backs
preserving open space, a goal that also protects property values _
Holt offers his audiences a menu of ideas, including gun control,
preserving Social Security and the environment, and abortion
rights. But in the last few weeks he has particularly emphasized
improving education and defending patients' rights against health
maintenance organizations; the latter point brought a murmur of
approval from residents of a retirement village in Monroe Township
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, 50, often closes with an unusual concession in his appeal
for supporters to turn out on Nov. 3. ``With all this effort, with
all the campaigning and the media, we are poised to have a narrow
loss _ a narrow loss,'' he said. ``The difference between a narrow
loss and a narrow win is you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas, who first ran for elective office when he was in his
early 20s, delivers his speeches with a matter-of-fact routine,
while Holt, a former assistant director of the Princeton Plasma
Physics Laboratory and a former physics professor, still tends to
pause and hunt for thoughts before crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good,'' said Jim Schroeder, a Holt supporter and a
lobbyist for the New Jersey Education Association, the teachers'
union. ``If anything, he's a little green, but people like that _
it's fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   David Rebovich, a political scientist at Rider University, sees
it a little differently: ``I think Holt is trying hard to translate
his academic, professorial self into a more populist candidate, but
he needs a little more time on the campaign trail to hone his
arguments and to generate more enthusiasm as a plausible political
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In one regard Holt is entirely a professional at politics: he
has raised about $600,000, nearly as much as Pappas, by tirelessly
calling supporters and urging them to be willing to spend as much
to support their values as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Holt's money has now, in the last two weeks of the
campaign, gone into a sardonic radio and television campaign in
which Pappas himself is a star: they include a memorable moment
when the congressman took the floor of the House last summer to
deliver a ditty of praise for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, to
the tune of ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr,'' Pappas recites, ``now we
see how brave you are.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman has called the Holt commercials negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good _ it definitely throws Pappas on the defensive in
the sense of asking him what he does with his time down there,''
said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers. But since
Pappas is running on noncontroversial themes and no overarching
issue is stirring the voters, who are increasingly concerned about
economic instability, Baker thinks Pappas has the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Holt has put up a very spirited and aggressive campaign,''
he said, ``but the fact is that Mr. Pappas was elected in 1996 and
not much has changed since then to make people throw him out. And
with the economic problems, the electorate seems to be as nervous
as a Christmas goose, so I think this is a good year to bet on the
incumbent.''

<P>
   ``Mr. Holt has put up a very spirited and aggressive campaign,''
he said, ``but the fact is that Mr. Pappas was elected in 1996 and
not much has changed since then to make people throw him out. And
with the economic problems, the electorate seems to be as nervous
as a Christmas goose, so I think this is a good year to bet on the
incumbent.''

 &HT;    Anti-impeachment protestors rally to end Clinton inquiry
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Nichole Monroe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a rally organized entirely over the Internet,
nearly 200 Clinton supporters gathered near the White House
Saturday to protest impeachment proceedings against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying signs that declared ``Impeach Ken Starr'' and ``Stop
Tormenting Our President,'' protestors demanded that Congress
``leave the president alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Rally director Darrell Hampton of Dayton, Ohio encouraged rally
attendees to cast votes on Election Day against incumbent members
of Congress who support impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate bullies. I hate people that lie and twist the truth,''
Hampton told the crowd. ``On Nov. 3, let them know how dissatisfied
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton organized the rally by sending a flood of e-mail across
the country after Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony was
made public in September. He said his next on-line effort will be
to urge a nationwide boycott of companies that have given financial
support to the campaigns of members of Congress who support
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's e-mail was enough to encourage Jane Williams to travel
from Sneads Ferry, N.C. Williams said she was willing to spend time
and money to attend the rally because she deplores the way the
media published investigative leaks from the office of independent
counsel Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Starr spoon fed the media and they hyped it,'' Hampton
said. ``(The media) concocted an environment for the public and an
environment for misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's efforts mirror those of several local organizations
that have been founded across the country. Lea Haravon Collins,
with her husband Steve, founded the National Mad as Hell Campaign
in Iowa City, Iowa to encourage Americans to write letters to their
representatives in Washington urging an end to the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just concerned that the impeachment process will be
very bad for the long-term interests of the country,'' Collins
said. ``People feel frustrated and we wanted to give people a forum
to vent their frustrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing some distance away, Atlanta resident Byron Matheson
shook his head at the protestors, saying he disagreed with their
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they understand the facts, and I don't think
they understand the issues,'' said Matheson, who was in town for
the annual Marine Corps Marathon. ``It's about equality for the
little man being the same as for the big man. If I sat in front of
a grand jury and lied ... I'd be in jail.''

PRINCETON SENIORS NEARING A SCHOOL RECORD  
 A MICHAEL JORDAN AT PENN  
 BROWN-PRINCETON OPENER  
 TRAFFIC CHANGES, DARTMOUTH TO MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Bill Carmody, whose Princeton Tigers have won three
consecutive Ivy League basketball championships, has picked up
where the legendary Pete Carril left off. His thinking-man's team
is primed to continue its role of giant-killer this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who finished with the nation's best major college
record last season at 27-2 and were ranked as high as seventh in
the polls, are led by two All-Ivy League selections: Brian Earl, a
6-foot-2-inch senior guard, and Gabe Lewullis, a 6-5 senior
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The Class of 1999 has a three-year record of 73-13 and needs
only 16 victories to match the school record for victories by a
class, set by the Class of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian and Gabe are our captains, and it's their turn to show
our younger guys how to get it done,'' Carmody, whose roster
includes seven freshmen, said. ``We're going to take some lumps
early, but by the time our Ivy League season rolls around, I'm
hoping our freshmen don't look like freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   A Michael Jordan at Penn  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When one of your players is named Michael Jordan, you can't be
that bad. In fact, Fran Dunphy's Penn team is stockpiled with
returning veterans, including Jordan, a 6-foot guard from
Philadelphia, who led Penn in scoring (15.3), assists (131) and
steals last season en route to being an All-Ivy first-team
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Also back after a one-year absence will be Geoff Owens, the 6-11
junior center, who set a Penn record for blocked shots in his
rookie season but was out last season for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been monitoring Geoff very closely and he's been given
the OK to play,'' said Dunphy, who took the Quakers on a 7-game,
12-day summer tour through Italy, getting them prepared for their
Nov. 17 opener at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-Princeton Opener  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Dobbs' Bears, who finished 6-20 last season, are young and
inexperienced, which means they will be relying on Kamal Rountree,
the senior forward, who finished second on the team in scoring
(8.3) and rebounding (4.3) last season.
</P>
<P>
   Direct TV, the satellite program distributor, will offer
national broadcasts of Ivy League men's and women's games on Friday
nights. Brown will play at Princeton in the first of these ``Ivy
League Friday Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dobbs is looking forward to his program being showcased on
national television, he laughed as the thought of against
Princeton, the league favorite. ``This is really a dream come
true,'' said Dobbs, breaking into a sly grin.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic Pattern Changes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Faucher, who took a flight from Hanover, N.H., to the
Ivy League news media conference last week in Manhattan, got caught
in major traffic jam on the ride from La Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live four miles from Dartmouth, and there's one light
between my house and the campus,'' Faucher said. ``During my cab
ride through New York, I promised myself that if that one traffic
light back home turns red on me, I will never curse it again.''  &QL;

IN NEW YORK'S SENATE RACE, BLACK VOTERS MAY BE DECISIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `p') 
(bl) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York state's black voters are emerging as a critical factor
in the final-week strategies of both candidates in the U.S. Senate
race, which is considered so close that it could be decided by a
tiny fraction of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrat, Rep. Charles Schumer, blacks represent the
most loyal constituency in his political base. In 1992, the
Democratic Senate candidate, Robert Abrams, received 84 percent of
the black vote, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the state Democratic Party and its allies in
the labor movement are focusing much of their energy on turning out
voters in heavily black communities like Harlem and central
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Republican, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a large turnout in
heavily black districts, still thought to be unlikely, could be
very damaging if the race remains tight. In recent days, D'Amato
has been strenuously lobbying black political leaders for
endorsements that could help him pick up a few votes, or more
likely, dampen opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, there is deep concern that interest in the
race among blacks, and indeed all voters, remains extremely low. A
poor turnout would probably favor D'Amato, analysts say, because he
is better known and has a core of loyal supporters likely to vote
on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   To counter such apathy, the Democrats are increasingly invoking
President Clinton and his conflict with the Republican Party over
the Monica Lewinsky scandal to generate interest among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of opinion polls shows that, compared with any other
group, a higher percentage of blacks supports Clinton and feels
that he has been mistreated by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For black people, this is almost like a presidential election
year,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, a Democrat from Manhattan who is
a strong defender of the president.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Democratic Party and local Democratic
officials have been distributing fliers in heavily black
neighborhoods that say: ``The Republicans want to impeach our
President. Say NO and send the Republicans a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, a nonprofit group financed by the AFL-CIO, 1199
National Health and Human Service Employees Union and other
organizations allied with the Democrats will begin running
advertisements on black and Hispanic-oriented radio stations in New
York and other large cities around the country offering similar
messages.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those spots, the Rev. Jesse Jackson says the election
will be viewed as a sign of whether voters support impeaching the
president. Another spot features Hillary Clinton promoting the
Democratic agenda on issues like health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   The state Democratic Party has also assembled a get-out-the-vote
operation focusing on 700 heavily black districts across the state
where turnout has been historically low. Directed by Kevin
Wardally, a Democratic district leader in Harlem, the operation
uses a ``7-touch'' plan meant to insure that every registered voter
receives seven contacts from the party, through phone calls,
personal visits or literature, before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   A similar program helped increase black voter turnout by 17
percent in more than 800 New Jersey districts in last year's
election for governor, the Democrats contend.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is also relying on state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a
Democrat who is black, to bring out black voters for the entire
ticket. Some Democrats have raised concerns that McCall has no need
to campaign hard because he is thought to be running well ahead of
the Republican, Bruce Blakeman.
</P>
<P>
   But McCall's aides say he is working hard. And local Democratic
officials like Assemblyman Herman Farrell, the Manhattan Democratic
leader, are distributing literature in black districts bearing this
message: ``In 1993, they said that Mayor David Dinkins didn't have
a problem. We didn't vote and we got Giuliani.'' The flier
concludes, ``Now they say Carl McCall doesn't have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, at his weekly rally in his Manhattan offices, the Rev.
Al Sharpton complained that the candidates for governor and Senate
were ignoring the black community and doing almost no advertising
in black media outlets. He said he would hold a candidates' forum
this week and urged Schumer and D'Amato to attend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Sharpton, who Democrats say has worked closely with D'Amato,
saved some of his toughest criticisms for the Democrats, attacking
them for not using Dinkins in campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why you would be disloyal to the most loyal
voting bloc in the Democratic Party,'' he said. ``I fear the
Democrats are trying to out-conservative the conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as he did in 1992, D'Amato, who is running for his fourth
term, has tried to focus public attention on his endorsements from
a few high-profile black leaders, like the Rev. Floyd Flake of
Queens. He has also aggressively sought the support of the Rev.
Calvin Butts of Harlem. But Butts said he is remaining neutral
because, while D'Amato has directed important federal aid to black
communities, Schumer has been a stronger supporter of civil rights
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   That aid from D'Amato includes sponsoring legislation that
required the federal government to insure millions of dollars in
assets that were lost when the Freedom National Bank in Harlem
failed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Butts said both candidate have been working overtime to gain
support from selected black leaders. ``They are, without question,
pressing friends and associates and community leadership as they
understand it for support, endorsements, kind words,
introductions,'' Butts said. ``And it is unrelenting.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato is also counting on a number of black Democratic
officials who have close ties to him, including Rep. Edolphus Towns
of Brooklyn, to do little or nothing for Schumer. Towns has
endorsed Schumer and contends he will work for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assert that the Republicans' real goal is to
discourage turnout by black voters. They say that in past
elections, the Republicans have used their poll watchers at voting
stations in black and Hispanic communities to intimidate minority
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say those poll watchers have helped prevent
widespread voting fraud. But many Republican officials privately
acknowledge that they do not want a strong turnout among black
voters. That is one reason, they say, that D'Amato has refused to
criticize Clinton, to take a position on impeachment or to say
anything that might stir up black voters.

 By CLAUDIA ROWE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Husbands held hands with wives and
children, clutching cookbooks and waiting for hours to get a few
seconds with their idol, the self-appointed ambassador to pork fat,
Emeril Lagasse.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours, without pausing to sleep, Lagasse, the chef and
star of the Food Network's ``Emeril Live'' cooking show, rushed
from Manhattan bookstores and television studios to the Barnes &AMP;
Noble here, where he scrawled his signature, ``Bam!'' inside about
3,000 cookbooks. Extraordinary energy and charisma may be de
rigueur for celebrity chefs, but Lagasse's blunt, cabbylike style _
not to mention his exuberant use of all things buttery and
fattening _ has won him adulation more familiar to a rock star than
a gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, there's his cute little face!'' shouted one woman to her
friend as they strained to get a glimpse of Lagasse through the
crowd in the bookstore. Outside, traffic was congested for miles
and a trail of Emeril adorers snaked out the door across the mall's
back lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was well worth the wait,'' said Marie Mazzola, a former
short order cook who lives in Pleasant Valley, N.Y., and stood in
line for three hours to meet Lagasse, whom she called ``the great
man.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Lagasse's appeal is his cheerful demystification of
haute cuisine. ``Hey! It ain't rocket science, it's just cooking!''
he is fond of shouting at fans. Yet, while scoffing at fancy French
terms, he makes a court bouillon with the best and prefers to
flavor his creations with truffle oil instead of olive.
</P>
<P>
   Synthesizing Epicurean sophistication with a rowdy, freewheeling
style has sent Lagasse's popularity soaring. ``Emeril Live,'' which
is filmed in a studio on East 106th Street, is the highest-rated
show on the Food Network by far. In April, when tickets for tapings
became available, 50,000 requests flooded in and in ten minutes
blew out the network's phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Lagasse owns three restaurants in New Orleans, runs another in
Las Vegas and plans to open one more in Las Vegas and one in
Orlando, Fla., in 1999. Not surprisingly, he says he has received
numerous pleas to start a business in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a dream and, truly, I'm a New Yorker at heart,''
said Lagasse, 39, who was born in Massachusetts, lives in New
Orleans and speaks with an idiosyncratic hybrid of both accents.
``But it's just not the right timing now. I'm not one of those
he-who-dies-with-the-most-restaurants-wins type of guys.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Lagasse's success is his
appeal to young children, dozens of whom waited in line this week
to tell him they wanted to follow in his footsteps _ and dozens
more who threw tantrums in the parking lot when their parents
refused to wait another hour.
</P>
<P>
   Lagasse, who has two teen-age daughters, grew up in Fall River,
Mass., and got his first kitchen job by begging to wash pots and
pans in a Portuguese bakery because he liked the smell of fresh
bread. Twenty-five years later, with 650 people on his payroll, the
chef is fast becoming a culinary mogul, but refuses to crow about
his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to put my pants on the same way, just like anybody
else,'' he said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Such nonchalance has won the affection of millions, and it came
in especially handy when a 78-year-old woman fainted in the
restroom while waiting to meet the chef. Once revived, she refused
to get into an ambulance until Lagasse came down and signed her
cookbook.

   ``Bam!'' said the woman, Johanna Croom, echoing Lagasse's
spice-slinging mantra, as attendants strapped her to a gurney and
wheeled her away. ``It was awful to meet him in the ladies' room,''
she said the next day at home in Fishkill, N.Y. ``I'm very
embarrassed about it now, but it's fine. I got my cookbook.''

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Just a few months ago, when Republicans
relished the thought of tying their opponents to President Clinton,
few targets were juicier than Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut,
the president's golf buddy and friend of 30 years. The Monica
Lewinsky matter was not the only reason the Republicans sensed the
senator's vulnerability. After the Republican romp of 1994, Dodd
had been Clinton's choice to lead the Democratic National
Committee, which later became enmeshed in an investigation of
campaign fund-raising irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   When Dodd began his quest for a fourth term, strategists for his
Republican challenger, Gary Franks, referred to the senator's DNC
connection as ``the bomb'' _ their surest weapon.
</P>
<P>
   But as the campaign clock runs down, polls indicate that Senator
Dodd is poised for a decisive victory over an opponent who has been
hamstrung by his own mistakes and baggage. The senator seems to
have avoided picking up any scars from Franks, in part by
distancing himself from the president during the months when their
friendship looked the most potentially damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd publicly lambasted Clinton over his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, foiling many of the attacks planned by Franks. And with
the election 10 days away, Dodd has more than 100 times as much
money to spend as Franks, and the Republican candidate is facing
new questions about his personal finances. His business dealings,
including code violations at his rental properties, were among the
many factors that contributed to his losing his seat in the U.S.
House of Representatives two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, a former political consultant to Clinton who has
stayed in touch with politics in his home state of Connecticut,
said the nomination of Franks was ``tantamount to the Republicans
writing off the seat, which was a mistake.'' Morris maintained that
a candidate with a cleaner record than Franks could have made hay
out of the campaign-finance irregularities that occurred at the
Democratic National Committee on Senator Dodd's watch.
</P>
<P>
   At their first debate, held in New London on Friday night,
Franks, 45, scolded Senator Dodd, 54, like a naughty boy, calling
him ``Chris'' and occasionally shouting as he got wound up in his
charges that the senator had missed too many votes and had voted
the wrong way when he had shown up.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said it was hypocritical of Dodd to say he supported
campaign finance reform at the same time he was filling his till
from special interests. ``How do you do this?'' Franks asked,
turning to Senator Dodd. Then Franks offered a mocking impression
of Dodd discussing campaign finance limits. ``I'm for it,'' he
said, at the same time shaking his head theatrically. ``I'm really
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks has few ways to disseminate his arguments, however
passionately they are couched. The two have one more debate, on
Thursday. With neither debate televised, it appears that only a
huge gaffe would be likely to receive wide attention.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, in a departure from the pose of most candidates who say
that they really regret having to use negative advertisements, had
bragged for months about his plan for a televised blitz showing
pictures of Dodd with Clinton. The television time bought by Franks
petered out this month, though. When a federal campaign-finance
report was due Oct. 15, Franks took the unusual step of mailing it
to Washington but refusing to release it to the public. When it
became available in Washington, it showed that on Sept. 30, Franks
had $20,826 to spend, to Dodd's $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Franks was candid about his tactic. ``We wanted to have that
story run as late as possible,'' he said. A Quinnipiac College poll
was released last week showing Dodd with a lead of 32 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Then Franks had to spend much of Friday deflecting damage from
an article in The New Haven Register reporting that a lien had been
placed on his Waterbury home, and that he faced foreclosure on two
other houses he owns. In an interview before the debate, Franks
offered various explanations, first contending that the collection
actions had been politically motivated, then saying he had buyers
for the houses, and later saying he had been a victim of a
declining real-estate market. ``It's totally political,'' he said.
``We wanted to give the properties back to the bank.'' At day's
end, he took another tack, faxing a news release asserting it was
not a lien but an ``attachment.''
</P>
<P>
   While Franks has scrambled to put out fires, Dodd has cruised
around the state, collecting endorsements and announcing federal
largess. He built a huge campaign infrastructure in case he found
himself in a real race and, as a preventive measure, responded
toughly on television and in person to Franks' early charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd conspicuously hung back in the president's hour of need,
declining to join the Democrats who went on television to promote
possible escape hatches like a censure or rebuke or fine, or to
question whether impeachment fits the offense. Instead, Dodd called
the president's conduct ``reckless,'' ``shameless'' and harmful to
his staff, family and country.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of no communication between the two, Clinton phoned
Dodd shortly before this month's vote by the House to begin an
impeachment inquiry. Dodd said he made no commitment to help. ``I
was a good listener,'' he said. As he works the food tents and
ticket lines at fairs back home, he has few encouraging words for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You disappoint your enemies, and they enjoy it,'' Dodd said
between stops on a recent campaign swing. ``You disappoint your
friends, they get angry _ and I'm angry.'' He went on to say he had
no intention ``of assuming the role of defense counsel,'' and does
not want to be ``part of some team here whose responsibility is to
save the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his reluctance to defend the president, Dodd gives
the explanation being offered by many of his colleagues _ that one
day he may be a juror if the House sends articles of impeachment to
the Senate. He said he has not decided how to vote, and has not
ruled out either voting for impeachment or for some lesser
sanction.
</P>
<P>
   The question is particularly painful for Dodd, whose late
father, Thomas Dodd, also served as Connecticut's senior senator.
In 1967, the elder Dodd became one of nine senators in history to
be censured, following charges that he used campaign money to pay
bills for maids, liquor and other personal expenses. Christopher
Dodd says he believes his father did nothing wrong. But the searing
experience is sure to be brought up again and again in Connecticut
if the debate in Washington turns once again toward censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something happens to you in a town like Washington _ when
things go wrong, you can find yourself standing alone,'' Dodd said.
``I realize now that this is a business for most people, and you
shouldn't expect too much from people in this business. When things
start to go bad, it can be very lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd is a up-to-date model of the Irish politician in his genes
_ white hair and black eyebrows over a ruddy face, working town
fairs in a violet shirt and tasseled loafers, touring the state in
a Ford Explorer and drawing applause as he speaks Spanish at a
telethon for hurricane relief, or rails against the risk posed by
computerized medical records. At the Taste of Berlin food festival,
a supporter even offered him a lick of her ice-cream cone.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered as a possible presidential candidate, Senator
Dodd now seems likely to make his most lasting mark through the
women's and children's issues that are his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is enjoying his good fortune in what once threatened
to be a bruising political season. When Dodd was speaking to a
government class at Guilford High School recently, one of the
students asked why he should vote for him. Before going on to give
a serious reason, Dodd joked, ``Because I'm a hell of a guy!''

IN RETAIL MECCA, DECORATIONS MAKE ALMOST EVERY DAY SEEM LIKE A
HOLIDAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By   JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARAMUS, N.J. _ Lisa Heim has yet to buy the candy corn for
trick or treaters or organize the Batman and Robin costumes her
sons will wear for Halloween. Yet here she was one recent
afternoon, trying on shoes at Lord &AMP; Taylor, beneath holiday
wreaths, garlands and pine cones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen them this early,'' Ms. Heim said, scowling up
at the decorations. ``I'm not ready to think about Christmas. I
still haven't dealt with Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   Hers is a common lament, heard in malls across America, where
holidays seem to be tripping over one another, coming earlier every
year. Here at the Garden State Plaza, for instance, customers are
still coatless, some driving convertibles with the tops down. But
all the major stores, except one, are already draped in red and
green velvet, hung with twinkling lights and dusted with fake snow.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Lord &AMP; Taylor insisted that shoppers are
imagining this collapse of time. ``Every year you people call and
say the decorations are up earlier,'' said Sandy Lebowitz, in a
decidedly irritated tone. ``But the reality is, we anniversary
these things. Every year it's the same exact timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts tell a different story. Once, the Christmas
season began on Thanksgiving, with Santa's appearance at the Macy's
parade, said Malachy Kavanaugh, a spokesman for the International
Council of Shopping Centers. Now the average mall decorates on Nov.
7, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Becker Group, a Baltimore company that installs
holiday displays at 1,000 malls, the Christmas season has nudged
forward about three weeks in the last decade. ``They're trying to
get shoppers in the mood and stretch out the season,'' said Kathy
Hillman, Becker's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   At the Garden State Plaza, New Jersey's oldest mall, Lord &AMP;
Taylor, Macy's, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney are already dressed
for Christmas. Clerks and customers say they are dismayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is blurring,'' said a clerk in Lord &AMP; Taylor.
``It's getting ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Said a shopper at Macy's: ``I'm waiting to see them up at
Easter. It's all for the almighty dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the plaza's anchor stores, only Nordstrom remains
undecorated, adhering to a 98-year-old corporate policy that
holidays are to be celebrated one at a time. All 68 Nordstrom
stores nationwide put up their Christmas decorations the night
before Thanksgiving. Executives say they have never received a
letter of complaint. ``Maybe other stores will take heed,'' said
Betty Ann Uhlman, a Nordstrom customer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Garden State Plaza is one of four malls in Paramus. The
Chamber of Commerce has called the ZIP code, 07652, ``the Shoppers'
Address'' and boasts that ``the concentration of retailing
available here is unlike any other in America.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim could not be substantiated. But it is easy to shop
till you drop in Paramus. The 10.5-square-mile community, at the
junction of Routes 4 and 17, has 4.2 million square feet of retail
space in its four major malls, the Garden State Plaza, the Bergen
Mall, Paramus Park and the Fashion Center. There are also nine
shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   Most stores decorate one floor at a time, over the course of
weeks, creating a muddle of seasons and symbols. Macy's had pine
swags and red and gold tablecloths in one department last week,
Halloween decorations in another and spring flowers elsewhere.
Neiman Marcus had displays promoting October as Breast Cancer
Awareness Month next to a department stocked with Christmas
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom, by contrast, converts itself overnight, sort of like
Mom and Dad struggling to wrap everything and find batteries
between bedtime and dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Todd Loscalzo, the visual merchandising manager, a
squadron of store employees will work past midnight on Wednesday,
Nov. 25, installing 100 trees and garlands, 6,250 strands of
lights, 8,000 ornaments and 600 yards of quilted velvet in shades
of eggplant, cream, chartreuse and red. When the store reopens on
Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year, it will be
all aglitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's magic,'' Loscalzo said. ``Like being a child on Christmas
morning.''

44-year-olds. His hair is falling out; his bones ache in different
places every morning; and he feels, from time-to-time, that he's
too old to be running around with younger guys. They want to go out
on the town; he wants to take a Nuprin and go to bed. They want to
listen to the latest rap; he sneaks off with the Doobie Bros.
Unlike most people his age, DeBerg doesn't spend a lot of time
talking about the glory days. As the oldest starting quarterback in
the NFL, he's still living them now that Chris Chandler is
sidelined with injury. (Bunn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 22.

 &HT;    EPA supports `smart growth' plan for new mall
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The announcements of new and bigger malls come with
almost numbing regularity in Atlanta's overheated market, but the
Mills Corp.'s recent decision to build a shopping-entertainment
complex on the Atlantic Steel property in midtown was so different
that it hit like a bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it was unusual because it won't be built in a
green field beyond I-285, but on the site of a waning steel mill
minutes from the once-struggling downtown. And it won't be
surrounded by oceans of asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   But strangest of all was this: As part of an ambitious
redevelopment plan by developers Jim Jacoby and Charles Brown, the
project has the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The federal protectors of wildlife habitat see the development
as a testing ground for an evolving form of human habitat _
something they call ``smart growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that sprawl into the suburbs and beyond, and the
environmental devastation that comes with it, can be reduced by
redeveloping existing in-town areas and encouraging live-work-play
developments that can reduce the need to drive. And that should
reduce automobile emissions in places like Atlanta that are in
perpetual violation of smog standards.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the EPA officially designated Atlantic Steel a
candidate for its Project XL, a program that tries to use
short-term regulatory flexibility to get greater pollution
reduction in the long term. This is first time EPA has used the
program to help shape urban development, rather than to curb
industrial effluent.
</P>
<P>
   It means that, effective immediately, developers and governments
all across the nation will be watching the Atlantic Steel project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that has not been done elsewhere before,''
said Stan Meiburg, deputy administrator of EPA's southern region.
``If it works, it will set a national precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Steel won federal guinea-pig status by virtue of it
being in metro Atlanta, the only region in the nation currently
off-limits to most new road projects because it lacks a plan to
bring automobile emissions to acceptable levels. Underlaying that
problem is the fact that planners forecast a continuing outward
development push that will require exponentially more driving with
more congestion and more pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But air quality restrictions won't allow federal highways
officials to approve a new 17th Street bridge across the interstate
that both the developers and city of Atlanta officials have said is
an absolute prerequisite to getting the project built. That's why
the EPA's blessing under the Project XL designation is so crucial:
It may be the only way around the clean-air barricade.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the EPA on its side, the project faces potential
roadblocks. Nationally recognized experts are poking at the project
like a lab rat, using computer modeling to predict whether it will
truly produce fewer emissions than the typical suburban
development. A battery of experts are scrutinizing the design to
ensure that it isn't just another suburban mega-mall in downtown
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for the 138-acre Atlantic Steel site seems to be an
ideal test case, EPA officials said. Jacoby and Brown propose first
to clean up the industrial site, then to develop 2,000 to 5,000
residential units mixed in with a mall's worth of retail and
resturants, a hotel or two and scads of office space. The
developers want to connect the development to MARTA rail via the
proposed 17th Street bridge with a people over or light rail line
that might eventually link to other attractions in midtown and
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The 124-foot wide bridge they envision _ with wide sidewalks,
bicycle lanes, benches, trees and two to four general traffic lanes
and a rail line _ would be a virtual linear park reconnecting
midtown neighborhoods divided 40 years ago by the Downtown
Connector. They want the look, feel and mix of uses to echo those
on the other side of the freeway in the neighborhood of the Arts
Center.
</P>
<P>
   If the development passes the EPA's analysis, the bridge could
be eligible for federal highway approval, but highway officials are
concerned about the potential traffic on the Connector, which often
is gridlocked even with the Atlantic Steel site sitting virtually
unused. So the highway department will do its own impact studies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, someone _ the developer, the city, state or federal
government, or some combination _ will have to commit to pay for
the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   If those tall hurdles are cleared, there remains the daunting
task of developing and selling a massive project based on
resurrecting a vision of city-buliding from the past. Building
walkable city neighborhoods like they built them before World War
II, by designing a dense urban area that will accommodate cars
without having them dictate the look and feel of the place.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost like trying to put a genie back in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby and Brown are the master developers, and they will
contract with others to do the residential, retail and office
components. But for their plan to work, those major components
can't be entirely separated from each other, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean that Mills Corp., which has announced its plan to
build a retail-entertainment complex on one end of the property,
can't fall back on the old formula of an enclosed retail enclave
next to a vast moat of parking. It will have to build something
closer to a traditional downtown, in the open air, with connecting
streets. And it will have to make provisions for apartments and
offices to be added over shops as the area matures, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are on board with what we want to do,'' said Brian Leary,
Brown's point man on the project. ``They've never done anything
like this before, but they are very interested in doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept is in line with an emerging trend in the retail
world, said Demetri Vaches, project director for the urban design
firm Duany Plater-Zyberk of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retailers are just coming around to the rediscovery of the
concept of city,'' Vaches said. ``It's like watching blind people
grope an elephant and figure out that's what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaches works for Andres Duany, a leading national proponent of
``new urbanism,'' which calls for a return to the pre-war notion of
town-building that integrated a mix of housing types, shops and
workplaces. Duany's firm was asked by consultants for the EPA to
evaluate the Jacoby design by architects Thompson, Ventulett,
Stainback and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good design on a difficult site,'' Vaches concluded.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that about a third of the western half of the site will
have to be ``capped'' by concrete or asphalt as part of the
environmental clean-up, and may be more parking-intensive than it
otherwise might have to be. Environmental mitigation and the $76
million cost of the property might also make it difficult to keep
the residential areas affordable to those who will work there.
</P>
<P>
   Vaches questioned whether a huge retail development like the one
Mills is proposing is appropriate for the area. He thinks this sort
of entertainment-oriented, regional attraction might work best in
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important to the EPA's analysis of how well the
development's design works to reduce car trips is how it compares
to other areas. To that end, consultants are comparing the Atlantic
Steel site _ with its close access to MARTA rail, water, sewer and
other public infrastructure _ to three other areas with different
levels of infrastructure. Those sites, picked this past week, are
an undeveloped corridor in Henry County, the Fulton Industrial
Boulevard area of south Fulton County, and the Perimeter Center
area on the Northside.
</P>
<P>
   A typical suburban development in metro Atlanta with a similar
amount of commercial and residential space would occupy about 10
times as much land, with 80 percent of it under pavement, said
Georgia Tech planning Professor Larry Frank, who has acted as a
consultant to Jacoby.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, we're saying you're gonna get a certain amount
of growth in the future,'' said Geoff Anderson, who is overseeing
the analysis for the EPA. ``It's either going to go to the outlying
areas (that the Atlanta Regional Commission) projected and have
this effect on emissions, or to places like Atlantic Steel and have
this effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no other development has received the scrutiny Atlantic
Steel will get, the EPA has done other studies that showed
redevelopment closer in reduced driving, and thus emissions. In
comparing redevelopment intown to farther-out suburban development
in San Diego, Montgomery County, Md. and West Palm Beach, Fla.,
experts found reductions ranging from 28 to 42 percent in nitrogen
oxides, a key component of smog.
</P>
<P>
   While the folks with the slide rules do their thing, Jacoby and
Brown are busily trying to line up commercial and residential
developers, as well as financing. They expect to announce the major
pieces of that puzzle next month, Brown said. EPA's Anderson said
he hopes consultants will have their evaluation done by
mid-November, and then the developers will know whether they can
advance to the next series of bureaucratic steps to get the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   For Jacoby, who made his name developing Wal-Marts, and Brown,
who has done his share of large suburban developments, being at the
vanguard of a social experiment of sorts would be scary if they
weren't so confident the market is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of dawning on people that land use has something to
do with the way we live,'' Brown said. ``I don't know why it took
us so long to figure it out.''

 &HT;    Teachers hold `last safety net'
 &HT;    By Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It takes a lot to stun Buni Dunn, but the longtime
teacher and principal felt as if she had been socked in the chest
when she read the file on one of her students and learned why he
was having behavioral problems in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents were divorced, and no family member wanted him,''
recalled Dunn, principal of Alpha School in Rockdale County. The
student had lived with six different relatives in one year. ``Your
heart went out to that child because he was a neat child, and he
had been moved from pillar to post. How would you feel if you knew
no one wanted you?''
</P>
<P>
   As times become increasingly stressful, with thousands of
children suffering as a result, many of Georgia's teachers are
being asked to be part social worker, psychologist and corrections
officer.
</P>
<P>
   And they just may not be prepared to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges of education try to integrate problem-solving
techniques into their classes to help future teachers deal with
outbursts, disruptive behavior and anger among an increasingly
troubled population of schoolchildren, but teachers' ability to
handle the severity of many problems among today's students may be
overtaxed, some experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking teachers to do a lot, but we don't have any
choice,'' said Russell Yeany, dean of the College of Education at
the University of Georgia. ``We don't have the luxury of focusing
just on academic issues. The classroom has become the last safety
net.'' In many instances, school may also be the place children
feel safe to ``act out,'' what therapists sometimes call disruptive
behavior that children may not feel comfortable expressing in front
of the person who has really hurt or neglected them _ often a
parent or relative.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to get a picture of of the growing seriousness of the
problems facing Georgia's troubled students. For example, of
Georgia's 1.3 million school children last year, 13,000 were
homeless, according to the state Department of Education. The
Division of Children and Family Services investigated 48,770 cases
of child abuse in 1997. For the 1996-97 school year, 165 Georgia
school children brought guns to school, according to the State DOE.
That same year, 573,168 Georgia schoolchildren in grades K-12, or
43.4 percent, qualified for free or reduced lunches based on their
family's income level.
</P>
<P>
   Some teaching experts and teachers believe that Georgia schools
need more resources _ counselors in all grades, continued
professional development, social workers and even nurses and
doctors _ to address what some consider an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   _ A teacher in Fulton County, Ga., tells of a pants-wetting
homeless fourth-grader, whose moving from shelter to shelter caused
age regression.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Clayton County teacher tells of helping a student grieve
over the murder of his father.
</P>
<P>
   _ A DeKalb County teacher tells of taking students home from
band practice because parents aren't available to drive them.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and the people who trained them in college agree that
it's the severity of the problems they see that is the greatest
concern, not merely the number of children who need help. And the
more severe the problem, the greater the impact on the entire
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   These children affect all their classmates, teachers said,
because they demand so much time and because they often tempt other
students into misbehaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers will tell you that sometimes the addition of just one
kid will tip a class in the wrong direction,'' said Marla Brassard,
professor at education at Columbia Teachers' College and a national
expert on kids and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Even more of a concern for some is what effect these troubled
children will have on society if someone doesn't do something to
help them in the early years _ and teachers are increasingly
becoming that someone who is relied on to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is, for this 5 percent of kids who have serious
problems, do you want to add specialized training?'' Brassard said.
``If you want to look at prison costs down the road, I think the
answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic shifts in classroom environments began about 25 years
ago, according to teachers and researchers who have experienced and
studied the changes. It's not ``bad kids'' causing the problems,
teachers said. The reasons educators cite for the growing trouble
and confusion among students include larger schools, erosion of
community schools, more diverse student populations, less parental
involvement, less involvement of religious institutions, drugs,
violence, working parents who are too busy, and baby boomer parents
with a rebellious spirit who are less likely to support teachers
fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``If schools were smaller and more community-based, we wouldn't
even be having this conversation,'' Yeany said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many teachers who just aren't prepared,''
principal Dunn said. ``Teachers come out of school prepared to deal
with kids whose tummies are full, not for kids who smell or for
that kid who has more money than you can ever think of but who is
neglected because his parents are too busy .''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has made strides in reaching out to help and teach
at-risk children through such programs as pre-kindergarten and
alternative schools available in all districts, but the state only
funds guidance counselors in grades 9-12. Most of its teachers
don't receive specialized training in problem-solving or classroom
management in college, and instead take the classes later, as part
of professional development. Education experts said that is in part
because there is a limit to the time and money an education major
can spend to learn such things. Also, many said it is impossible to
set up a course that would predict some of the terrible situations
teachers find themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to have a cookbook list and say `respond this
way,''' said Don Schneider, Director of the School of Teacher
Education within the College of Education at UGA. ``But in student
teaching, you can almost predict that classroom management and
control issues will predominate the discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The College of Education at UGA, the state's flagship teaching
school, does not require a course in classroom management, and does
not have a class in violence intervention, but it does offer
several optional programs and classes that try to prepare
prospective teachers. One, Project A.C.T. Early, is aimed at
pre-school through second grade children.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Yeany and Schneider explained, students do a good amount
of role-playing n their classes that teach instructional
techniques, trying to respond in a way that will calm the
disruptive student. Besides these experiences, education majors are
required to take one semester of educational psychology. An
optional religion and education course may be the closest they get
to dealing with children from backgrounds different than their own,
such as inner-city children or the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
   Given the core requirements education students must take _
courses dealing with instructional techniques, basic subject matter
and classroom diversity _ there is not much time left for new
requirements, Yeany, Schneider and other educators said. Their
prospective employers understand the limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just very hard for any teacher, veteran and new,
to deal with the problems that we have today,'' said Jan May,
assistant principal at River's Edge Elementary in Clayton County.
``I don't know if you can get anybody exactly ready for this.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some ideas afloat to help schools help children, but
many hinge on money and some on philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas range from requiring counselors in all schools,
lowering the student-teacher ratio, lowering the student-counselor
ratio, in-home visits and mental health screening.
</P>
<P>
   Many children who act out or misbehave are mentally ill, said
Elizabeth Betemps, a University of Cincinnati nursing professor who
started a mental health screening program in the Cincinnati area.
She found that many children diagnosed with attention deficit
disorder had ``big-time depression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had children who were psychotic,'' Betemps said. ``Those
children couldn't sit still even if you held a gun to their heads.
These poor children. If they were diabetics you'd give them
insulin, but we're ignoring them.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's funding of school counselors in grades 9-12 is based
on the number of students. For every 220 students, a half-time
counselor is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would raise the question of how comprehensive can that
interaction be?'' said Schneider of UGA.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Marable, a special education teacher at Rome
High School in Floyd County and chairman of the Senate Education
committee, favors increasing funding for counselors although he
questions where the money would come from. ``But I would argue if
we can get counselors there, then we're not going to have to pay
the huge bucks later for prisons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brassard recommends in-home visits by teachers with every
child's family at least once during a school year. Yeany said such
visits would be impossible for many teachers because of their
workload.
</P>
<P>
   State School Superintendent Linda Schrenko would oppose any
state law mandating in-home visits, an education department
spokesman said. ``She would never, ever, ever support that,'' said
Donnie Porter. ``Schrenko believes in local control.''
</P>
<P>
   Marable said he may consider legislation to fund alternative
schools for students in the elementary grades and said more funding
for after-school programs could help.
</P>
<P>
   But those solutions may be like asking Santa Claus to come.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the continued education of teachers may be the best
bet, many teachers and education professors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think teachers need on-the-job training,'' said
Marilyn Gootman, professor of child development at the University
of Georgia and author of several books dealing with children who
misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   At schools like River's Edge Elementary in Clayton County,
training programs increasingly emphasizeconflict resolution, and
teach children coping skills for dealing with problem behavior by
peers. Gootman said low self-esteem and anger often are at the root
of bad behavior. Because of that, it is important to help children
identify their feelings and the feelings of others. Training
teachers to simply validate a child is important, as is showing
them there are other ways of reacting to their pain.
</P>
<P>
   But that takes time and training. Helping a child identify a
feeling and work through it can take hours from a day, Gootman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers say they are eager for help. If they cannot be
trained in college to deal with the pressing problems of today's
students, some say, they are prepared to go back to school or take
seminars to learn it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, we've got a really serious problem in our
schools,'' Brassard said. ``What we're doing is not working, and
there's an enormous amount of misery in these kids.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time Camille Wright laid eyes on East German swimmers,
they were in a pool in Concord, Calif., preparing for a 1975 meet
against the United States, a year before the 1976 Summer Olympic
Games in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I glanced at them and thought, `Wow, these are big guys,'''
Wright said. ``Then I saw a strap on one of the swimsuits and I
thought: `Oh my God, they're women! We have to swim against
them?'''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the East German women dominated the Olympic
swimming in Montreal, winning 11 of a possible 13 gold medals and
drowning the formidable hopes of the American star Shirley
Babashoff. The East German women had not won a single gold medal at
the 1972 Games in Munich, Germany, but when the Americans voiced
suspicions in 1976 that the East Germans were using
performance-enhancing drugs, they were dismissed by many as being
poor losers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Berlin wall, however, documents and court
testimony have established the existence of what was long
suspected: that East Germany operated a state-sponsored system of
providing performance-enhancing drugs to as many as 10,000 athletes
from 1968 to 1988. For East Germany, a country of 16 million
people, the illicit system gained it scores of Olympic medals, and
with those medals considerable stature for an otherwise isolated
communist state.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in what amounts to an unprecedented bid to rewrite the
history books of Olympic sports, the U.S. Olympic Committee has
announced that it will seek to have formal Olympic medals given to
American athletes who lost out to East German athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the official disclosures about the use of drugs by East
German athletes, the U.S. officials said they could wind up asking
the International Olympic Committee to upgrade or award medals to
dozens of American athletes _ as many as 50 swimmers alone _ for
events held as far back as three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a matter of fundamental fairness,'' said Bill
Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The first challenge could come within several weeks and would
probably involve the 1976 Olympic women's 400-meter medley relay,
in which Wright and her American teammates finished second to East
German swimmers. Many of the American women were deeply affected by
the East German dominance, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Babashoff, in a rare recent interview with a California
newspaper, said she had never regarded her three second-place
finishes in 1976 to be losses, saying she had been ``beaten by
men.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the International Olympic Committee has agreed to hear
the U.S. appeals, there is hardly consensus, either among American
athletes or within the international sporting world, about the
value and appropriateness of the U.S. effort to alter the official
Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
   Rewriting Records May Not Be Easy
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Germans think they are being singled out and
punished at a time when the reunified nation is making a boldly
public attempt to come to terms with its soiled athletic past by
holding trials detailing the administration of
performance-enhancing drugs to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Americans' attempt to rewrite the record books may
find itself bogged down in a tangle of troubling questions, some
already being raised by athletes and officials from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Would only American athletes benefit? Why punish former East
Germans, when athletes from many countries, including the United
States, have also been caught using drugs and are suspected of
using them on a widespread basis? How do you elevate an athlete
from fourth place to third place two decades later when that
athlete, because he or she did not then qualify for a medal, was
never tested for drugs during the Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine getting a gold medal, but it would be nice if
an asterisk were in the record books, saying they took steroids,''
said the swimmer Wright, who is now married and uses the name
Camille Wright Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, are emphatically behind the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes deserve a level playing field,'' said Frank Shorter,
who finished second in the 1976 Olympic marathon to an East German,
Waldemar Cierpinski, and is seeking a companion gold medal to the
one he won in the 1972 marathon. ``A deterrent has to be created by
letting people know that there is no statute of limitations on what
I view as fraud perpetrated on sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee, after first saying it would
not rethink the medals given to East Germans, reversed itself
earlier this year and said it would consider challenges case by
case.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, though, the committee has been extremely reluctant
to alter the results of past events.
</P>
<P>
   It did strip the Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson of his gold medal
after he tested positive for steroids at the 1988 Summer Olympics
in Seoul, South Korea. But last year it declined to award the
American boxer Roy Jones Jr. a gold medal despite an apparent case
of rigged judging at those Games. It awarded him its Olympic Order,
a high honor, but a consolation prize nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Katarina Witt, the East German Olympic figure-skating champion
in 1984 and 1988, said that drugs were not involved at all in East
German figure skating, and she assailed the effort to rewrite the
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a German expression `It's snow from yesterday,''' she
said. ``Old news. Until everyone opens their files, I don't think
it's fair to go after the Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   Hybl, as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said he was
seeking ``appropriate recognition'' for Americans, which could
include elevating silver medalists to gold medalists or placing an
asterisk by the results of races where it was determined that the
East Germans had enjoyed an unfair competitive advantage. The
proposal has support from Britain, Canada and Australia.

<P>
   Duplicate Medals as a Compromise
</P>
<P>
   Hybl said the United States did not want to strip medals from
East German athletes, many of whom apparently took
performance-enhancing drugs unknowingly or were forced to take them
to continue their careers. Instead, he would apparently settle, for
instance, for duplicate gold medals in a case where Americans
finished behind East Germans in an event in which drug use could be
documented.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would only pursue cases in which there has been an
admission of drug use or a conviction in court, Hybl said. Still,
despite the disclosures of East Germany's systematic doping of
athletes, the United States might find it impossible, short of an
admission, to gain conclusive proof that a particular athlete took
banned substances leading up to or during a particular Winter or
Summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Rogge, an influential member of the International
Olympic Committee from Belgium, told reporters in Sydney,
Australia, several days ago: ``There is absolutely not going to be
any change for things that happened more than 10 years ago. At this
stage we still have no documented evidence of doping of an athlete
on the day of Olympic competitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle with this issue, and the wrenching, ambivalent
feelings that it causes, is illustrated in the case of Anita
DeFrantz, who finished third to East Germans in the eight-oared
rowing event at the 1976 Summer Olympics and who is now a member of
the International Olympic Committee from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't know what to do,'' DeFrantz said. ``If I get
my gold or silver medal now, what good is that? I have my health
and I worked hard and did my best on that day. I'll have that all
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is entitled to seek redress, said Walter
Troeger, president of the German Olympic Committee. He added: ``If
you are going to fight doping, you should do it globally, not focus
on one country that is holding court cases for political reasons
that concern the manipulation of minors. What about countries whose
files are not open or who are not conducting investigations?''
</P>
<P>
   Donna de Varona, a gold medalist in swimming in 1964 and a
longtime activist for women's sports in the United States, said she
wondered about the fairness of rewriting history. ``How do you know
the person you're giving the medal to is positive or not?'' de
Varona said, referring to drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   While she supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's efforts, she
said, former East German athletes may be more willing to come
forward to discuss drug use and health risks if they did not face
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The American swimming federation might also find itself
vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy because it ultimately failed to
punish one of its athletes, Jessica Foschi, after she tested
positive for steroids in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to move on,'' de Varona said. Referring to the
billowing drug scandals now engulfing Olympic sports, she said:
``We've got a chance to save this movement. It's a dangerous
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Waitz Proposes Letting History Stand
</P>
<P>
   Grete Waitz, a four-time Olympian from Norway who won a silver
medal in the marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics, said she did not
believe that the U.S. proposal was equitable, because it would not
benefit athletes from other countries or athletes who were certain
that they had been defeated by cheaters but had no proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have bad feelings,'' Waitz said. ``It wouldn't be fair for
everyone. Let history be history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are not so willing to let the East German past
fade uncontested. No other country has been found to have had such
a systematic program of doping.
</P>
<P>
   The test case being prepared by the U.S. committee involves that
1976 women's 400-meter medley relay, in which an East German team
of Ulrike Richter, Hannelore Anke, Andrea Pollack and Kornelia
Ender defeated an American team of Wright, Babashoff, Linda Jezek
and Lauri Siering in 4 minutes, 7.95 seconds, trimming 5.5 seconds
off the previous world record.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Americans' case is Pollack, whose former coach,
Rolf Glaeser, admitted in a German court last summer that he had
given performance-enhancing drugs to young swimmers on the elite
Dynamo Berlin team.
</P>
<P>
   Glaeser was convicted of causing bodily harm to minors and fined
$4,000. The indictment of Glaeser alleged that from 1975 to 1984 he
administered performance-enhancing drugs to nine named swimmers,
including Pollack, according to Rich Young, counsel for the U.S.
swimming federation.
</P>
<P>
   The swimming federation and the U.S. Olympic Committee are
awaiting the German judge's written decision from the Glaeser case
to confirm that it parallels the indictment. If the evidence is
sufficiently conclusive that Pollack took banned substances, the
Americans could move to challenge the 1976 race within days of
receiving the written decision, Hybl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised they're actually doing anything,'' Wright
Thompson said. ``It was a long time ago. It would have been nice if
it happened right after we came back and people were wondering what
happened to the American women. Now, it's like `Who cares?' But
it's kind of neat to turn the tables and to know that we were
better than we thought we were.''

TACKING TO STARBOARD WITH THE GREAT SKIPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a pro-am regatta last year in the British Virgin Islands,
Russell Coutts pulled up to the dock in his 30-foot race boat and
waved everybody on board. Ten guests clambered onto the sloop, much
to the chagrin of the regatta chairman, who was organizing crews of
five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Coutts, the New Zealand America's Cup skipper,
said at the time. ``This is what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The carefree attitude about racing contrasted sharply with the
intensity that precedes most professional races. But each year at
this time, the Bitter End Yacht Club of Virgin Gorda, in the
British Virgin Islands, tweaks the fun side of the sport by
inviting elite skippers to sail with amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pro skippers really don't get to see their adoring
public,'' John Glynn, the race chairman, said in a telephone
interview last week. ``I never realized before that there are
sailing groupies out there who never get to see the experts except
on shore during an America's Cup campaign. In the pro-am, they're
on the same boat together.''
</P>
<P>
   The event this year, the seven-day Iridium Pro-Am Regatta, is
scheduled to begin Saturday with eight world-class skippers
expected. They include Coutts; Harold Cudmore of England; Paul
Cayard, J.J. and Peter Isler, Morgan Larson and Ken Read of the
United States; and Paula Lewin of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The Islers, accomplished America's Cup sailors in their own
right, like the interaction. ``It's like a Magic Johnson dream
camp, except that it's a dream camp for sailors,'' Peter Isler said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The amateurs are in heaven. ``It's racing with the stars,''
Linda Coleman, a small-boat sailor from St. Louis, said
enthusiastically. ``We're always changing boats when we race, and
the skipper tells us what to do. People try their best, and if they
can't do it, they usually get off the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islers have competed in the series about nine times in its
11-year history. The Bitter End, which is more of a hotel than a
traditional yacht club, offers its celebrity skippers free
accommodations. Guests pay as much as $3,710 for a seven-night stay
with food and access to 100 yacht-club watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all eat breakfast, lunch and dinner together,'' Peter Isler
said, ``spend afternoons on the water racing, have unlimited use of
sailboards and catamarans, then have drinks on the beach at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may sound idyllic, each skipper must bring along a
measure of patience. There have been times when a guest just plain
got tired in the middle of a sailboat tacking maneuver. It doesn't
happen often, but it's quite a sight for a professional skipper to
watch a crew member decide to plunk down in the center of the boat
during the heat of racing.
</P>
<P>
   Isler said he doesn't really mind. ``It's their event,'' he
added. ``If things get too windy or intense, you have to make sure
your crew doesn't get hurt. They can get more than their share of
bumped noggins, rope burns on their hands from not having enough
wraps on the winch, or even a black eye.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More times than not, guests who sign up for the pro-am regatta
have sailing experience, Glynn said. Chuck McNeil, a retired
commercial airline pilot from Palm Desert, Calif., figures he has
sailed in the event about seven times. He and his wife, Janet, see
the trip as a vacation, but one with lasting benefits. The couple
has made friends over the years with Coutts, and with Ed Baird,
skipper for the New York Yacht Club's 1999-2000 America's Cup
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When Baird and Coutts were in San Diego for cup racing in 1995,
Chuck McNeil played golf with the two helmsmen. But he has also
picked up a racing tip or two for the sailing he does on his own
Morgan 45 yacht.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed usually says East Coast sailors are smart sailors, but West
Coast sailors are fast sailors,'' McNeil said last week. ``But I've
learned from both of them how to watch out for a breeze, and how to
stay on the right side of the course. Most people don't get that
from regular racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura and John Wells, of Aliso Viejo, Calif., may not be able to
make it to the pro-am event this year, for the first time in 11
years. The couple owns an airplane fire-fighting business in
Southern California, and can't get away this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intense racing,'' Linda Wells said wistfully. ``You don't
just sit there and watch. You handle the jib sheets, the main
sheet, and you are absolutely sailing.''

METS CLOSE IN ON DEAL WITH PIAZZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mets continued to zero in on their prime target Saturday,
moving closer to a deal with catcher Mike Piazza. Although both the
Mets and a friend of Piazza said they had not reached agreement on
a new contract, they seemed virtually certain to do that before
long.
</P>
<P>
   The friend of Piazza said a deal was ``not completely done,''
leaving the impression that only some details needed to be worked
out. He acknowledged that the catcher's agent, Dan Lozano, and
Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, were very close to
completing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Horwitz, the Mets' spokesman, said that Phillips spoke to
Lozano Friday night and ``they're optimistic they can get something
done, but we do not have an announcement at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side has discussed details of a possible deal, but
others have said they are talking seven years for a total in the
low $90 million range.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also are close to reaching agreement with pitcher Al
Leiter, who like Piazza is eligible for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely close, but we're not quite there yet,''
Leiter said by telephone from his Florida home. ``If two sides want
to get something done, it can get done and that's what it's been
like since Day 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has sought a four-year, $32 million deal, and he
indicated that the Mets aren't quite there.

AT $566 A MONTH IN NEW YORK, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Phillip Lee complains to friends that his shower
leaked or that his stove refused to light, he doesn't get much
sympathy. Not in New York. Not when you have managed to rent a
cheap apartment. Envy, yes. Sympathy, no.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for him to make people believe that renting a
two-bedroom apartment for $566.89 a month is not as wonderful as it
sounds, but he's trying, because he wants people to know what they
may face if they happen to experience similar good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It all started back in June, when he and his fiancee decided to
move out of an apartment they were sharing with someone else and
get a place together.
</P>
<P>
   He had recently returned to New York City from Ithaca, N.Y.,
where he had studied for a master's degree at Cornell University in
hotel administration, and he knew what he faced rentwise.
</P>
<P>
   He expected to pay between $1,200 and $1,400 a month for a
studio way east on the Upper East Side, an area he likes because he
finds it ``a little low key, and not as flashy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was convenient for his fiancee, too, who was studying
interior design after deciding, as he had, that she didn't like
being a banker. (She didn't want her name used, because like him,
she is a very private person, but unlike him she is not quite so
determined to get out the story of ``Life in a Rent-Stabilized
Dream.'')
</P>
<P>
   They did what everyone does, studying the classified ads the
minute they came out, rushing to open houses where there would be a
dozen or more other potential applicants.
</P>
<P>
   They saw `'easily over a hundred'' apartments, he said, trying
to find something that suited them. ``Having two people involved
made it that much more difficult,'' Lee said. ``She wanted anything
that had character, not a rectangular box. She didn't want a
railroad. I still don't even know what a railroad is.''
</P>
<P>
   They did find a few they liked, but in each case, ``we just
missed it, or there's 10 people there, and there's always someone
making more money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So they decided to develop their own tactics. They compiled a
chart listing about 25 companies that managed apartments on the
Upper East Side, names culled by roaming streets they liked. Each
day, they called those companies, checking to see if any apartments
were about to be available.
</P>
<P>
   But that route, which seemed promising because it would have
bypassed a broker's fee, yielded nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two weeks before the lease on the apartment they were
sharing was going to expire, Lee saw a newspaper advertisement for
a two-bedroom apartment on York Avenue in the 70s for $566.89 a
month. He left a message with the broker who had placed the ad,
Douglas Hochlerin, on a Saturday, and got a call back Monday
telling him there would be an open house.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to go, even though they didn't usually bother
looking at apartments listed for less than a thousand dollars a
month, because such apartments always needed so much work. But this
one drew them because the rent was so low it might be worth making
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   When they got to the open house, on the sixth floor of an old
walkup building, they understood why the rent was so low.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dump,'' said Lee, who is now a manager at a midtown
restaurant. ``You couldn't even walk around. The old tenants had
left a couch and all their garbage. I think they just took their
Filofax and left.''
</P>
<P>
   It was so rundown, so crammed with an odd variety of things, he
said, that it looked as if homeless people had camped there.
Graffiti covered the walls.
</P>
<P>
   But they needed a place, and it had plenty of inherent charm.
The light was wonderful, streaming into a large bedroom from York
Avenue. Even the second bedroom and the small living room had
windows onto a picturesque urbanscape. And it wasn't a railroad
apartment, laid out in one long line.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they were the winning candidates. They got the
apartment, and they were thrilled. They paid their rent, and their
$2,500 broker's fee, and planned to move in immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The lease said the apartment would be painted and cleaned, so
they knew they didn't have to move out the debris themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't, but it took two weeks of constant requests for the
landlord to remove the mess. Finally, when they did move in, they
were told they couldn't use the shower because it leaked into the
apartment below, that the stove was broken and that the buzzer
didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief assessment, Lee decided he didn't want to use the
shower under any circumstances, at least in the condition he found
it. The small bathroom, just off the kitchen, had only a toilet _
with no sink _ and the shower was just awful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty nasty,'' he said. So he found a contractor and
decided that it would be worth $2,800 to have a new bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to the state of the kitchen, where rotting
floorboards give way under ripped linoleum, the bathroom now has
clean beige tile with white grout, a glass door to the shower that
lets in the light of a window, and classic white porcelain
fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation was completed on Oct. 15. ``Today is my one-month
anniversary here,'' Lee said, ``and yesterday was my first
shower.'' Until the job was done, he had been using a nearby health
club, where he had taken a one-month trial membership.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the kitchen, which Lee plans to renovate himself. He
will tear up the linoleum and plywood, put in a new piece of
plywood, and top it with stick-on parquet. And they'll buy a new
sink.
</P>
<P>
   (Although Lee says his landlord is aware of the work he has
done, Thomas Higgins of Higgins &AMP; Trippett, who specializes in real
estate litigation, cautions that tenants should protect themselves
when they do major renovations by getting written permission from
the landlord. Otherwise, Higgins said, a landlord could argue that
the lease was violated and could move to terminate it.)
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks, the buzzer was fixed, and a new metal door
was installed, replacing the old wooden one that was so rotted it
looked as if someone had chewed it on the side. Just a few days
ago, the landlord supplied a new stove. Getting the repairs done
took constant pleading and arguing, but now the couple have
everything they thought they would have the day they moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the disasters were almost comical. They hired a floor
refinisher to come in and sand the painted floors, to restore them
to their natural wood color, but the electricity wasn't working.
Con Edison insisted it was on. The problem turned out to be the
limited power going to the building. It simply won't accommodate
the sanding of floors, so they will cover them with sisal.
</P>
<P>
   The limited electricity also requires adjustments in their daily
routines. ``You can't have a hair dryer and the TV on together,''
Lee said. An air-conditioner is out of the question. ``We turn
everything off when we turn the microwave on,'' he said. And until
their new stove arrived, the microwave was on a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is well aware that some people's reaction to the hassles
will be, ``But your rent is only $566 a month.'' But he wants
everyone to understand the real price. ``You really want to tell
people they need to understand, you get what you pay for,'' he
said. ``Our lives have been nonstop chaos and frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, he hopes, the memory of the dirt, the dust and the
hassle will be gone and he and his fiancee will be able to relax
and enjoy the apartment, which they really do like. But, he said,
``If I had to do this all over again, I would probably pay my
$1,300 and move in the next day.''

STRICTER LAW ON AGING MASONRY IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In March, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani signed a measure
mandating sweeping changes in Local Law 10, the 1980 measure that
requires periodic inspections of facades of buildings taller than
six stories.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were proposed last December after bricks that
separated from a wall of a Madison Avenue office tower rained down
on the streets below.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, New York City's Department of Buildings
issued proposed regulations covering those changes. The revised
measure has been officially designated Local Law 11 of 1998. A
public hearing on the regulations has been set for Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   While there is broad consensus among officials, lawyers and
construction experts that stricter laws are needed to protect the
public from hazards posed by aging masonry on high-rise buildings,
they also acknowledge that the new regulations could carry a hefty
price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure anybody really knows how expensive this is all
going to be,'' said James Samson, a Manhattan real-estate lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Samson explained that under the original Local Law 10, exterior
walls within 25 feet of a pedestrian walkway or public space had to
be inspected every five years. In practice, he said, that usually
resulted only in the inspection of the front facade and perhaps a
side wall or two.
</P>
<P>
   Under Local Law 11, however, virtually every exterior wall of
every building taller than six stories will have to be inspected
every five years. Moreover, Samson said, while Local Law 10 applied
only to walls over six stories high, Local Law 11 requires
inspections of all four walls even if only one wall of a building
meets the height requirement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those changes, Samson said, Local Law 11 also
requires ``hands on'' inspections of any ornamental cast-stone or
terra-cotta cornices or decorations that project more than six
inches from the face of an exterior wall. The ``hands on''
requirement, he said, means that inspections of such building
elements must be conducted close-up _ from a scaffold or platform _
rather than with binoculars or telephoto lenses from nearby vantage
points, as was permitted under Local Law 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a major-league expense for many
buildings,'' Samson said. ``Just look up and down Broadway. All
that wonderful ornamentation and all those cute little gargoyles
are now going to have to be inspected.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to imposing such new requirements, construction
experts say, Local Law 11 eliminates a provision in the prior law
that allowed engineers to alert property owners to nonhazardous
conditions in their buildings without forcing them to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   John Flynn, a professional engineer in Bedford, explained that
under prior law, if an engineer detected a crack or other flaw in a
wall that was otherwise sound, the engineer could note his
observation on his report and indicate that the condition should be
monitored. If the crack or flaw remained stable and caused no
weakness in the wall, he said, the engineer could carry the item
from one inspection cycle to another as a ``precautionary''
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, conditions can be classified only as ``safe,''
``unsafe,'' or ``safe with a repair and maintenance program,'' with
the last category replacing the ``precautionary'' classification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting something in the `safe with a repair' category means
that the condition needs a repair to prevent it from becoming
unsafe,'' Flynn said, adding that if such a condition is not
corrected by the time the next cyclical inspection is conducted, it
must be reported as ``unsafe'' by the engineer.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, creates the potential for conflicts between
engineers and their clients because engineers who previously
carried ``precautionary'' items on their inspection reports from
cycle to cycle must now decide whether to classify such items as
either ``safe'' or ``safe with a repair and maintenance program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some engineers might say that if a crack in a wall caused by
normal settling hasn't moved for 50 years, the condition is
probably safe,'' Flynn said. ``But today, everybody is so
litigious, an engineer would be nuts not to put the burden back on
the building's board of directors by saying that the condition is
safe with a repair and maintenance program. No engineer wants to
assume liability for every crack in every building he inspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Ferrara, president of JMA Consultants, an engineering
consulting firm in North Bergen, N.J., said that while Local Law 11
might indeed place a greater burden on engineers by forcing them to
make difficult decisions, the stricter standards were justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Buildings was absolutely right to stiffen
these codes,'' Ferrara said. ``Watching these buildings age is like
watching an old horse in a field. He's OK today, he's OK tomorrow,
but one day you look out at the field and he's not OK anymore.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ferrara _ who was a member of Giuliani's Building Industry
Advisory Council, which helped draft the new regulations _ said
that one problem he anticipated was that property owners who wait
until the last minute to hire engineers to conduct inspections
might be in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if there are going to be enough engineers to go
around,'' he said, adding that any engineers who might be available
would be able to charge top dollar for their services.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, construction experts say, all facets of facade
inspection and repair are expected to become more expensive because
of the tight inspection timetable imposed by Local Law 11.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Varone, director of operations for Rand Engineering in
Manhattan, explained that under the new law, any previously
uninspected wall that is now subject to inspection must be studied
by March 1, 2000. Walls that were inspected during the last
inspection cycle _ which ended in Feb. 21, 1997 _ must be inspected
for the fifth cycle between Feb. 21, 2000, and Feb. 21, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, to make it possible for buildings to avoid
having to conduct costly ``back-to-back'' inspections _ an initial
inspection of uninspected walls by March 1, 2000, and then a
regular fifth-cycle inspection of all four walls between Feb. 21,
2000, and Feb. 21, 2002 _ the regulations permit property owners
who inspect all four walls between Feb. 1, 1999, and March 1, 2000,
to use that inspection to satisfy the fifth-cycle inspection
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good because it allows you to avoid double
inspections,'' Varone said. ``But it also condenses the normal
two-year inspection cycle into one year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with nearly 10,000 buildings in the city subject to Local
Law 11, construction experts say, that will almost certainly result
in higher inspection and construction costs as the owners of those
properties scramble to line up consulting contracts and
construction work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure this is going to be expensive,'' said Peter Corsell,
president of Peter Corsell Associates, a consulting engineering
company in Manhattan. ``But what are the alternatives? The risks
may vary from building to building, but every year you have
freezing and thawing taking place and every year every building
gets one year older. It might be expensive to put a scaffold on
your building and start probing around. But it could be a whole lot
more expensive to just leave the building alone and wait to see
what happens next.''

A FLURRY OF PROPOSALS FOR GAS-FIRED POWER PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELEANOR CHARLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last April the Connecticut General Assembly voted to restructure
the state's electric utilities, separating the generation of
electricity from its distribution to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The measure requires United Illuminating Co. and Connecticut
Light &AMP; Power Co. the state's only electric utilities other than
those of a few municipalities, to sell off their generating plants
by 2004. They will then become regulated monopolies in the business
of distributing electricity to customers through their existing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In July 2000, consumers will be able to choose their electric
companies as they now choose telephone companies. Their bills will
list the regulated charge per kilowatt hour from a company that
they have selected, plus the unregulated charges for generation of
power that will be competitive in the open market.
</P>
<P>
   By encouraging the construction of clean, new gas-fired power
plants, Connecticut joins 17 other states that have enacted similar
measures in an effort to reduce pollution and costs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 50 proposals to build gas-fired power plants
have been submitted in the New England region. In Connecticut 10
companies from California to Massachusetts have filed proposals to
build plants in Killingly, Meriden, Milford, New Milford, Norwalk,
Norwich, Oxford, Sherman, Southington, Sprague and Wallingford.
</P>
<P>
   Some towns have welcomed the proposals because of tax windfalls
estimated at $2 million to $4 million a year. Other communities,
where critics view the plants as polluting eyesores, may find them
eliminated by a battery of regulatory agencies that will review the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   They include the Connecticut Siting Council, the Independent
System Operator New England, a quasi-governmental agency known as
ISO New England that administers the transmission of electricity
throughout the region; the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection; and local planning, zoning and conservation
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport is the first municipality with a new natural
gas-burning plant in limited operation at the United Illuminating
site. Built by Duke Energy Power Services of Charlotte, N.C., it
will reach its full 520-megawatt capacity next year. Two existing
plants on the property will then be converted from coal to gas.
</P>
<P>
   Of two power plants proposed in Norwich by Stone &AMP; Webster
Development Corp. of Boston and Williams Energy Group of Tulsa,
Okla., Richard DesRoches, manager of the city's independent gas and
electric systems, said, ``We'll be happy to get the taxes and we
might even buy some power from Stone &AMP; Webster, the front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Milford, a citizens' group called Power Alert has been
working against plans by Sempra Energy Resources of San Diego for a
19,000-square-foot, 500-megawatt plant on a 145-acre former gravel
mine off Route 7 near Candlewood Mountain. Its twin smokestacks
would be 213 feet high and 17 feet in diameter. The prospect of
having such a structure thrust into an otherwise Arcadian landscape
has unsettled some residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the stacks will protrude above the mountain and
affect the views of all the residential properties along Candlewood
Lake,'' said Liba Furhman, a former New Milford first selectman and
chairman of Power Alert. ``We are in a zone designated as
substandard for air quality by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The valley has a microclimate in which pollutants are not
dispersed. Just because gas-fired plants are cleaner than oil- or
coal-fired plants doesn't mean that the Sempra plant will be clean.
It will be emitting tons of nitrous oxide and particulate matters
into the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Sempra chose the New Milford acreage because ``from a gas and
power perspective it has direct access,'' said Dwain Boettcher,
vice president of business development for Sempra. The Iroquois gas
pipeline traverses the site, which Sempra bought in bankruptcy
court for $2 million, and it is 2,000 feet from an electric
transmission line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping that once the people understand the benefits,
they will support the project,'' said Boettcher.
</P>
<P>
   Tax revenues, he estimates, would be $38 million over 20 years.
The $280 million plant would be built on 20 acres, another 20 acres
would be developed independently of Sempra as an industrial park,
and use of the remaining 105 acres would be determined in concert
with the town.
</P>
<P>
   Local employment prospects are minimal. Only 20 to 25 skilled
people are required to run gas-fired power plants at salaries
ranging from $40,000 to more than $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revenues don't knock your socks off,'' said Kenneth Paul,
editor of The Litchfield County Times, a weekly newspaper that has
published numerous editorials in opposition to the project. On Oct.
9, it also took the unusual step of running a full page listing the
reasons to oppose the project as an eyesore, polluter, potential
source of fires, and threat to residential property values.
</P>
<P>
   As the largest municipality in the state, covering 64.8 square
miles, New Milford is also one of the fastest growing. A
$65-million school building project now in the works is one of many
things that the mayor, Arthur Peitler, said the town needs to
finance.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ``for the last few years we have been facing
selective brownouts caused by shutdowns at the Millstone nuclear
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we need 12 new facilities?'' he asked rhetorically.
``Probably not, but I think Connecticut needs more energy than it
has now.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to make an independent evaluation of emissions that
Sempra contends will cause only a fraction of a percent change in
the atmosphere, the mayor has promised to have a $20,000
environmental-impact study done.

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Furhman lives on the New Milford-Sherman border, near a site
in Sherman where Tractebel Power, a Belgian company with U.S.
headquarters in Houston, proposed a 700-megawatt plant.
</P>
<P>
   When the 289-acre farm it planned to buy was sold to 890 Realty
Co. in New Fairfield, ``Tractebel withdrew,'' said Donna Tuck,
first selectman of Sherman. ``They knew of the one in New Milford
and felt that more plants were coming on line than were needed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tractebel has not withdrawn its application to ISO New
England, and Peter Brown, a Tractebel lawyer in New Hampshire,
would not say whether the company is negotiating with 890 Realty or
seeking other sites in Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   In Southington, a bedroom community for Hartford, Waterbury and
Meriden, a handful of the 40,000 residents have expressed concern
about how the air quality would be affected by a 720-megawatt plant
proposed on 75 industrially zoned acres by AES Enterprises of
Newton, Mass. A public hearing on the proposal is scheduled for
Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Siting Council makes the final decision on
accepting a plant, determining the effect of each proposal on the
environment, transmission capacity, fuel and water supply,
demographics and projections of growth, said Joel Rinebold,
executive director of the council. If townspeople object to a
decision, he said, ``there is no reason why they can't seek court
remedies after coming to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Approval or rejection of proposals for plants in Milford and
Meriden could be forthcoming in November and January, respectively.
Both proposals were made by Power Development Co. of Boston in
partnership with El Paso Energy Corp. of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They have optioned 28 acres for a 540-megawatt plant in Milford
and an 821-acre tract spanning the border between Meriden and
Berlin for a 540-megawatt plant on 30 of 321 acres that lie in
Meriden. The remaining land, said Kenneth Roberts Sr., chief
operating officer for the Boston company, ``would buffer the plant
from surrounding neighborhoods and be dedicated to conservation in
both towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's 500 acres are required for an easement to the Iroquois
pipeline and the hookup for power transmission, both located there.
Bonnie Therrien, town manager of Berlin, noted that there were
concerns about the 3 million gallons of water that the plant will
need daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin is on wells, and there isn't enough water in the
aquifers to draw that much,'' she said, ``and Meriden applied for
water that New Britain controls from Hart's Pond, but it was
allocated to Southington.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joseph Marinan of Meriden said, ``The town fully supports
the project and fears that the water problem could scuttle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month Citizens in Defense of Oxford will appear in Milford
Superior Court. They filed a lawsuit on Sept. 15 seeking to
overturn a decision by the Oxford Planning and Zoning Commission to
allow Towantic Energy of Denver to build a 540-megawatt plant on 20
acres near the Oxford airport, as a special exception.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Sinclair of ISO, ``the market determines where
these things get placed.'' Who gets considered, he said, is
determined by a federal regulatory commission approach, on a first
come, first served basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the list of applicants gets longer the issue of fairness
comes to light,'' he said. ``Can we rearrange the sequence when a
more worthy applicant shows up at the end of the line? We are
working with the New England Conference of Public Utility
Commissioners to find a way to separate the serious from the less
serious.''

THE MAN BEHIND TIMES SQUARE'S SMOKE RINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER GRAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While New York is a city of both historic buildings
and historic signs, the signs have largely faded into history. But
Douglas Leigh, who created many of them _ including the one that
sent those Camel smoke rings wafting across Times Square _ is still
very much around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an idea man, a concept guy,'' says Leigh, 91.
</P>
<P>
   After 1900, in the decade Leigh was born, electric signs
converted Broadway near Times Square from a daytime advertising
venue to a nighttime spectacle of wriggling fish, flashing chariots
and other extravaganzas that excited the growing numbers of
passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   To the big sign companies, with their far-flung and large-scale
operations, such spectaculars were sidelines. But to the
Alabama-born Leigh, who dropped out of the University of Florida in
1927 after making $5,000 selling yearbook advertising, the big sign
was the only thing.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh started his business in 1933, with an option on a location
at Fordham Road and Crotona Avenue in the Bronx. He persuaded the
St. Moritz Hotel to put up a billboard on the site. His pay was $50
a month and a room at the hotel for a year. This gave him only
enough to eat at the Automat, he says, but it also provided a
Central Park South address for his stationery.
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1933, he came up with the idea for a steaming coffee
cup, 15 feet wide, at the southeast corner of 47th Street and
Seventh Avenue, and he sold it to A&AMP;P to advertise its coffee
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had started work in the middle of the Great
Depression, Leigh's soft-spoken sales ability helped him carve out
a very comfortable niche. Within a few years he had thrown switches
in Times Square on a blinking penguin for Kool cigarettes, a clown
tossing quoits in the shape of the Ballantine ale logo, and an
animated cartoon for Old Gold cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   During those years Leigh had been thinking about the city's need
for a big weather sign, and in 1938 he was contemplating a
Coca-Cola slogan, ``Thirst knows no season.'' The result was a
giant illuminated Coke display on the north side of Columbus Circle
that forecast the next day's weather with a 30-foot-wide dial
framing a rural house over which rain, sun, snow, clouds and other
weather effects appeared at the appropriate times. By then Leigh
controlled more than $1 million in sign contracts and was living at
1 Beekman Place.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1941, E. J. Kahn Jr. profiled him in The New Yorker and
counted him responsible in the previous seven years for 32 large
signs with more than 75,000 bulbs. ``If New York is ever thoroughly
blacked out,'' Kahn said in a reference to the war in Europe, ``no
man will take it harder.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leigh's imagination was working on that too, and the same
year he developed the Camel billboard at the southeast corner of
44th Street and Broadway, which puffed out five-foot-wide smoke
rings of steam.
</P>
<P>
   Wartime blackouts began in force in 1942, but they only
accelerated Leigh's imagination. In 1944 he told The New York Times
that he foresaw a postwar Times Square full of three-dimensional
signs in softer colors: a colossal, translucent glass of orange
juice and a huge bottle of perfume with scent puffed out onto the
street.
</P>
<P>
   He saw wind machines blowing trees and flags, searchlights
playing on blimps, bubble machines, artificial snow and fog, the
smells of coffee and cocoa and beer, even live giraffes and other
animals, making Times Square a giant performance event in the
service of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In his mind the Empire State Building tower was an excellent
glowing cigarette for Lucky Strike, and the Rock of Gibraltar _
when the war was over _ was a perfect signboard for Prudential
Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 Leigh persuaded Barney Ruben, the head of the Bond
clothing store, to put up a $350,000 montage rising 90 feet above
the entire length of his Broadway store, from 44th to 45th Streets.
In Leigh's design, twin 50-foot-high figures, one male, one female,
flanked a central waterfall 27-feet high and 120-feet long. Strands
of electric lights seemed to clothe the chunky, modern Classical
figures at night, but by day they appeared nude.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and '60s, Leigh began focusing on and buying entire
buildings, including the old Times Tower in Times Square. He owned
the Times Tower until 1963, when it was rebuilt as the
marble-sheathed Allied Chemical Building.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s he was back to lighting effects, such as the red,
white and blue design he persuaded Harry Helmsley to adopt for the
Empire State Building for the 1976 bicentennial. The design
inaugurated the skyscraper's tradition of multicolored lighting.
</P>
<P>
   He also created floodlighting for the Waldorf-Astoria, the Con
Edison tower at 14th Street, the Citicorp Building at Lexington
Avenue and 53rd Street, and the four corners of 57th and Fifth
Avenue. At the same time Leigh was working on lighting master plans
for entire cities, among them Atlanta and Cincinnati. The Atlanta
plan was carried out temporarily, while the Cincinnati one is still
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh now divides his time between Oyster Bay, L.I., Palm Beach,
Fla., and an apartment at River House on East 52nd Street. His most
recent project is a floodlighting program for Donald Trump's 40
Wall Street. Trump's office said the program would be put in next
spring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years his signs have vanished, and now there is a new
generation of sign spectaculars in Times Square, among them
Spectacolor's giant ATM for Fleet Bank at 46th Street and Broadway,
with a moving bank card and money.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh says he still has ideas: for the old Times Tower he sees a
30-story building on part of the site, with a giant waterfall
pouring into one corner.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people call him these days, he says _ ``but I'm still
available.''

CONFIDENTIAL POLICE RECORDS LEFT IN RUINS OF JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Reduced now to ruins, the old Essex County Jail
remains a sinister and forbidding place. Its rotting doors, barely
hanging, are open to anyone who wants to get in, or out. There are
fissures in the corroded roof, providing views of the wide-open sky
from some cells. Even empty, the dark, cavernous cellblocks evoke
echoes of bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1800s, murderers were hanged here. In 1967, the cells
were crammed with people arrested during race riots. But the most
vivid picture that remains is of the suspects investigated by the
county's Bureau of Narcotics Control, which used the building as
its headquarters after the jail closed in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Strewn throughout the prison's cellblocks and offices, amid the
trash and other debris left by squatters and drug addicts, are
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of law enforcement records left behind
by the narcotics bureau when the unit moved out in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The records, dating from about 1970 to the mid-1980s, include
arrest reports, police booking photos, rap sheets, transcripts of
wiretapped phone conversations, search warrants and lists of
evidence. Many of the subjects of the records are still alive. Some
went to prison. Some still live in New Jersey. And the squatters
who have ready access to the building could easily find information
about them, including their addresses and Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   By state law, none of the documents should be there. According
to New Jersey's mandatory ``records retention and disposition
schedule,'' every item left in the old jail should have been
destroyed or placed in secure, permanent files. Instead, they lie
matted under broken beer bottles and stuck together in wet, moldy
cardboard boxes. In most cases, the type and the handwriting are
still legible. The photographs are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am working, a law-abiding citizen,'' said one woman whose
booking photo, fingerprint card and rap sheet were left in the old
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who lives in Newark and agreed to discuss her
criminal past on the condition of anonymity, was charged with
possessing drugs and stolen property in 1986 and served time in
jail. ``I am actually shocked,'' she said when told where the
documents were found. ``It could have gotten into the wrong hands
and done damage to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Essex County sheriff, Armando Fontoura, said county
officials were supposed to have destroyed the documents after the
narcotics bureau left. ``The county was responsible for removing
all the data, bringing the shredder in,'' Fontoura said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said members of the sheriff's department, including
the director of the narcotics bureau, Robert Scarillo, had looked
over the materials and concluded that nothing important had been
left there.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had asked the county several times to increase
security at the former jail, noting that two people had been found
dead in the building after overdosing on drugs. The most recent
victim was found in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Fontoura's remarks, the Essex County administrator,
Vincent DiMauro, said he would direct the public works department
to clear out the old jail. DiMauro said he visited the jail about
10 months ago in response to reports of homeless squatters and had
noticed file boxes but did not see the records themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I will have to take another look,'' he said. ``I will
make sure our people take a look, assemble that data, make sure the
sheriff's people look at it and make sure it's stuff that should be
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The discarded records could pose legal problems for county
officials, said Alan Zegas, president of the Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey. ``Let's say that an
individual had his or her record expunged,'' Zegas said, ``and
expungement requires the destruction of the underlying records, and
now they are out on the street and can fall into anyone's hands.
It's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential legal liabilities include defamation, invasion of
privacy and slander, Zegas said. ``If somebody has not been
convicted of any crime but was simply investigated, leaving records
out publicly exposes the individual to very severe harm to
reputation as well as potential invasion of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Zegas said, some of the records may reveal
confidential information, like the names of victims and police
informers. And the state could be exposed to lawsuits by the
victims of crimes stemming from the discovery of the documents, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The records, it seems, got lost in the shuffle sometime in 1989
after a dispute arose between the county executive at the time,
Nicholas Amato, and Thomas D'Alessio, then the sheriff, over the
use of the jail by the narcotics bureau. Amato wanted the bureau to
move so the county could sell the building. It is still owned by
the county.
</P>
<P>
   The matter ended up in state Superior Court in Newark, where
Judge Harry Margolis ordered the building evacuated because of
structural damage and other dangerous conditions. The narcotics
bureau set up trailers and a tent in a parking lot near the
building and worked from there for about six months, said James
Finkle, a longtime supervisor in the Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Finkle said the documents were probably forgotten when the
bureau moved to new offices.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by John Haviland, who also designed the original jail
known as the Tombs in lower Manhattan, the Essex County Jail was
built in 1837, a year after Newark was formally incorporated, and
served as the county's main penitentiary for 133 years. It is the
oldest government building still standing in the city and was
listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1991, it was used to film scenes for Spike Lee's movie
``Malcolm X,'' but since then, it has been empty.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are moving forward for a $350 million science park,
featuring an international center for public health, to rise on 14
acres of land surrounding the building. The former jail may one day
become part of the science park, perhaps used as a generating
plant, which would allow its outer structure to be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the jail closed, the Bureau of Narcotics Control was a
multiagency task force financed largely by the federal government,
with investigators from municipal police departments and the county
sheriff's and prosecutor's offices who worked closely with federal
agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Roberts, a former assistant county prosecutor who
directed the bureau from about 1970 to 1981, said the jail building
was used in part to keep the squad separate from the prosecutor's
main offices, which are in the county courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The narcotics squad uses confidential informants and things of
that nature,'' he said, ``and to have them parading before the
courts and the people going to court would be counterproductive. We
used it as administrative offices. We kept evidence there in some
of the cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the old jail's administrative offices were also used to
monitor and record wiretapped conversations. Today, dozens of
transcripts of such conversations, in official DEA logs, are still
in the decrepit offices, piled on rusting metal desks.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who left the bureau for a private law practice in 1981,
said that from the outset, jail cells were used as storage rooms.
``We had a detective in charge of evidence, and deep in the bowels
of the old jail we kept evidence that we confiscated and kept until
trial,'' he said. ``If it were narcotics, we kept it for a certain
period of time and then we burned it. We kept it until the case was
over and the appeals time was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more bizarre reports found in the old jail details
the arrests in the mid-1980s of two men charged with breaking into
the building and stealing items from the narcotics bureau's own
offices, including nine portable radios, a television set, two
typewriters, a sheriff's badge, a leather holster for a
9-millimeter gun and two loaded ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   Even more bizarre was a memo about an incident that occurred
while the burglary was being investigated. ``During the course of
the above investigation,'' Detective Arthur Lang wrote,
``Detectives Calvin Thomas, Derrick Westry and the undersigned
seized one military rocket launcher in front of 8 Sheffield Drive
in the city of Newark, New Jersey. Said launcher was turned over to
the evidence office.''
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the documents are routine, detailing charges
against various suspects and the efforts of the law enforcement
agents who investigated them. Architects, engineers and other
planners working on the science park have made many inspections of
the old jail, almost always escorted by police.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon Waltner, administrative and technical coordinator for
University Science Park Inc., the company developing the park, and
others who have visited the building said they had noticed the
abandoned records and other evidence, including a roomful of
confiscated gambling machines. ``There are still quite a few old
files that are in there,'' Waltner said. ``It's a scary place,
isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Another person who noticed the discarded records was Camilo
Vergara, a Manhattan photographer and historian who is working on a
book about American ruins and is using the old jail as a subject.
Earlier this month, Vergara returned to tour the building with a
reporter and two historians, Kenneth Jackson of Columbia University
and Clement Price of Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see those records and all the time people took in putting
those records together,'' Vergara said. ``They have bearing on
people who for all you know may be walking right outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Vergara said he was drawn to the old jail for its architecture
and history and had been awed by the eeriness of a place that once
housed as many as 400 prisoners and where gallows once stood in a
courtyard. ``It's a wonderful building,'' he said. ``It is a real
ruin, with the smells, with the dilapidation, the paint falling,
the plaster falling. This is not a flimsy structure. It was built
to last.''
</P>
<P>
   David Abramson, a Newark architect who was hired by University
Science Park to conduct a study on possible uses for the building,
has suggested that it be used as a power-generating plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible structure, one of grandeur and decay,''
said Abramson, adding that he expected any plans for the building
to be hotly debated. ``This has been and will continue to be and
will become a controversial issue. The historic preservation
community looks at this, rightly, as a very significant resource.''

3 METS MINOR LEAGUERS APPEAL GANG-RAPE CONVICTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorneys for the three Mets minor-league players convicted last
week for the April gang-rape of a 17-year-old woman have filed
separate motions for the verdict to be overturned, and for a new
trial, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kessler, a state-appointed private attorney representing
Natividad Tavarez, was the first to file this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, and we talked to just everybody in the
courtroom while the jury was deliberating, the only six people who
thought the state proved its case were the six jurors,'' Kessler
said. ``Every reporter, the cops, the prosecutor _ they all thought
the verdict was going to be not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bruhn, another state-appointed private attorney, filed on
behalf of Jose Brea Tucent. Assistant Public Defender Peter Kenny
filed for Milton Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The three convicted players face 8 to 12 years in prison,
according to the prosecutor Steve Levin, at their Dec. 28
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on the Buffalo, N.Y., high school senior, who was in
Florida for spring break, took place on April 14 in Port St. Lucie,
Fla., where the Mets minor leaguers were participating in extended
spring training. In the trial, Levin said the men targeted the
woman because she was naive and scared. According to police
authorities, the woman, whose identity is being withheld, reported
that she was cornered in a room rented by Rosario and forced to
have sexual intercourse with the four players before being allowed
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Two other players charged in the case, Vicente Rosario and Ruddi
De La Cruz, are scheduled to be tried next month. All the players
are 18 years old, except Rosario, 20, and all are from the
Dominican Republic. Rosario, who attended George Washington High
School in Washington Heights, N.Y., is a legal alien, while the
others have visas that have expired.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kessler and Kenny think it is significant that the circuit court
judge who oversaw last week's trial, C. Pfieffer Trowbridge, has
asked that the victim's entire testimony be transcribed for him.
This came in response to Kessler's motions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests he is going to read all of her testimony, to
make sure he's clear on what she said,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Kenny, who has been practicing law since 1973: ``This is
the first time I've ever heard of that being done. I take it as a
good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said the victim acknowledged during the trial that she had
intimate contact with another Mets minor leaguer who was not
charged, Yorki Guzman, on her second day of visiting Port St.
Lucie. Yet when she saw Guzman by the hotel pool on her last day in
town, he ignored her, Kenny said, and she admitted going upstairs
shortly thereafter with Rosario.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we showed pretty clearly that she was consenting when
she went up to the room,'' Kenny said. ``She admitted that she at
least wanted to kiss the guy she came up with, that he took off her
clothes all voluntarily. And she couldn't say with specificity that
she ever said no to anybody in particular or while anybody was
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said there is no question the state failed to prove
Tavarez's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl testified on the stand that she's not sure she ever
said no to my client,'' Kessler said. ``She did testify that she
got undressed in front of my client in my client's hotel room,
after she had been having sex with my client's roommate for a week,
and was about to have sex with someone else on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando-based Tony Suarez, who represents Rosario, said he
intended to request a change of venue for his trial, but he must
wait for jury selection to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may even challenge the way they pick juries down there,'' he
said. ``I mean, how is it that there are no blacks or Hispanics on
the jury?''
</P>
<P>
   Of the six jurors in last week's trial, four were women; none of
the jurors was black or Hispanic. &QL;

POLICE DOUBT WIDER LINK IN CENTRAL PARK ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police said Saturday that they saw no connection
between an armed robbery on Friday night in Central Park and other
robberies at knifepoint that have occurred in the same general area
over the last month. But detectives had developed evidence, they
said, that some of the other attacks may be the work of one or two
prolific assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a robbery, but it isn't connected to any of the other
incidents that have occurred in the park recently,'' said Sgt. Nick
Vreeland, a department spokesman. ``The similarities just aren't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Commissioner Marilyn Mode, a Police Department
spokeswoman, said that detectives had some evidence that pointed to
a single assailant in two attacks on children in the park and that
they had linked another suspect to two recent knifepoint robberies
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not conclusive but we do think that these incidents may
be related,'' she said, noting that the victims in these crimes
gave similar descriptions of the suspects and that the men followed
a certain pattern when committing the robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's robbery occurred shortly after 6:30 p.m., when a
33-year-old man was accosted as he strolled through an isolated
part of the park known as the Ramble, near the Boathouse at 77th
Street and East Drive. The victim, who has not been identified by
the police, said that a black man, 5-feet-9 inches tall and
weighing around 200 pounds, jumped from some brush with a knife and
took his wallet before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the assault at a news conference in the park
Saturday Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that crime there was still
significantly lower this year compared with the assaults and
robberies that occurred in the past. He also said that no amount of
police work would rid the city of all crime, which is at historic
lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if all men and women were angels, you wouldn't need
police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police in this city are doing a terrific job. They're
doing everything to catch the people involved in this to make not
only the park but the entire city very safe,'' he said. ``But there
will always be crime. No matter where you live in America and no
matter where you go, there always should be some concern about
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, there have been 70 robberies and 20 felony
assaults in the park, compared with 81 robberies and 25 felony
assaults during the same time in 1997, according to Police
Department crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Park Precinct has increased patrols in the area, and
officers have been making a more concerted effort to clear the park
when it is closed at 1 a.m. every morning since the rash of
attacks, Ms. Mode said.

   CHINA-FLOODS _ ZHAOYUAN, China _ Chinese are racing against time
as scores of victims from this summer's record flooding sit in
tents fearing the onset of this region's bitter winter in the next
few weeks. Authorities are working to assure they won't freeze
after being flooded out of their homes. Inundated oil wells at the
Daqing oil field 130 miles to the north shows another dimension of
flood ramifications _ the economic hit China took as agricultural
and industrial resources were swallowed by roiling waters of three
major rivers that exploded from their banks under heavy summer
rains. Already experiencing economic problems, China is paying
heavily to clean up the aftermath of floods that killed more than
3,000 people, destroyed 5.8 million homes, ravaged hundreds of
villages and cost an estimated $19 billion. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox

were a whirlwind of giant leaps _ it went from its first manned
flight to stepping on the moon in just eight years _ the second
half of the agency's life has mostly been a comfortable routine of
workmanlike space shuttle missions. That's about to change. NASA
has big plans. It's mulling a new breed of spaceship, with the
emphasis on utility and cost-effectiveness. In the works: reusable
rockets that operate at a fraction of the cost, can take off in the
kind of weather that would scrub a shuttle lunch, and turn around
in a remarkable seven days. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post). 25-30.

   SCANDAL-ELECTION_ Pundits are in search of campaigns where
Washington's impeachment-mania is having an effect. One place to

Qualls is challenging sophomore Rep. Steve Chabot. What makes this
close race inviting is that Chabot serves on the House Judiciary
Committee. He is one of only two committee members involved in
potentially close elections. The other is Democratic Rep. Mel Watt

   CHANDLER _ David Ronald Chandler is on track to be the first
person executed by the United States in 35 years. Tried and
convicted in 1991 for having a snitch killed, Chandler sits on
death row as his appeals are almost exhausted. But as he nears
execution, the case against him seems to be falling apart. In a
prison interview, his chief accuser _ in fact, the man who pulled
the trigger and handed Chandler to prosecutors _ has recanted his
trial testimony almost entirely. Chandler, also interviewed,
insists he did not. Chandler was tried and convicted as a drug
kingpin in Piedmont, Alabama, a place where it seems that nobody
could be a kingpin of anything. And the crimes and the times of
Ronnie Chandler constitute a Faulknerian saga populated by killers,
drunks and ne're-do-wells, all of whom seem related to one another
in some way. (Chandler's appeal will be argued before the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Tuesday, Oct. 27.) (Rankin,

   CROSSDRESS _ NEW ORLEANS _ New Orleans recently became one of a

intimidation of cross-dressers, transsexuals or anyone else who
identifies with a gender other than his or her biological one. It
also permits employers to fire someone for cross-dressing in the

she has a gender-identification disorder. (Rochell, Atlanta

   ATLANTA-MALL _ The EPA surprised a lot of people with the warm

believes promote ``smart growth.'' This is the first time EPA has

   TEACHPREP _ ATLANTA _ Everything today's teachers need to know,

today's teachers that even several years of schooling may not be
able to prepare them for. How to reach a child who has to take care
of alcoholic parents, how to teach a child who is being sexually
abused, or how to interest a child who is overstimulated by too
many toys and too much television are just some of the challenges
today's teachers face. Add baby boomer parents who often expect
teachers to be their personal assistants in buffing their little
ones to academic and personal perfection, and the task becomes more
daunting. (Anderson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED

   WINTER _ For decades, long-range weather forecasts have been

ability to make long-range forecasts is rapidly improving. During
the past few years, for instance, the National Weather Service's
Climate Prediction Center has begun using a network of sea buoys
laden with monitoring instruments to keep tabs on ocean conditions
and determine when El Ninos and La Ninas are developing and how
strong they might be _ and the resulting weather patterns they may
cause around the globe. Weather satellites orbiting the earth also
gather reams of data for the climate researchers. A look at the

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician with a practice in suburban
Buffalo, N.Y., returned home from synagogue Friday night with his
wife, Lynn, and greeted his four sons. Then he stepped into his
kitchen, where a sniper's bullet crashed through a back window and
struck him in the chest, police said.
</P>
<P>
   He fell to the floor, calling for help, but he would die within
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian was one of a handful of doctors who provide abortions in
the Buffalo area, and law-enforcement officials said Saturday that
his slaying was the most deadly example of what they described as
an annual pattern of anti-abortion violence in Canada and western
New York. Slepian had endured years of picketing and harassment,
and earlier on Friday he had received a warning about possible
attacks against abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, 51, is the third abortion doctor killed in the United
States since 1993. In the past four years, three Canadian doctors
and a doctor in Rochester, N.Y., all of whom performed abortions,
have been wounded by snipers. Each of the shootings occurred within
a few weeks of Nov. 11, Veteran's Day, also known as Remembrance
Day in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Saturday that he was ``outraged'' by
Slepian's slaying and that the Justice Department was working with
local authorities to track down his killer.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki said the killer should face the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond a tragedy _ it's really an act of terrorism and,
in my mind, a cold-blooded assassination,'' Pataki said in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ward, a spokeswoman for Buffalo GYN Women's Services, the
private clinic where Slepian performed abortions, said the National
Abortion Federation had faxed a warning to the clinic Friday
morning reminding them about the four-year pattern of attacks. Ms.
Ward said the fax was sent to Slepian at his private office in
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was aware of the threat,'' she said. ``Around this time of
year, there had been shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   Amherst police said the timing of the shootings was not the only
similarity. In each case, police said a gunman, using a
high-powered rifle, fired through a window into the home of the
doctors. Last November, a doctor in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was shot in
the shoulder by a bullet fired through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Police Chief Frank Olesko said local investigators as
well as FBI agents and Canadian authorities were looking at the
possibility that the same gunman could be responsible for all of
the shootings. A task force of several Canadian and U.S. law
enforcement agencies has been investigating the attacks for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   National abortion-rights advocates expressed concern that the
slaying signaled a renewed escalation of violence against abortion
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman who shot Slepian apparently hid in a strip of woods
behind the house, then fired a single shot from a high-powered
rifle, Olesko said. Local police, FBI agents and Canadian
investigators searched the woods Saturday, but the identity and
whereabouts of the suspect remained unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom Press, another Amherst abortion provider who had known
Slepian for years, said, ``He believed women had the right to have
an abortion, and he followed his conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   The slaying comes more than six years after anti-abortion
protesters descended on Buffalo. In April 1992, the city was the
setting for a coordinated series of ``Spring of Life'' protests led
by members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. Nearly 200
protesters were arrested during one demonstration, and
abortion-rights groups held counter protests. Police said Slepian
was one of the doctors singled out by picketers.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with The Buffalo News, Slepian said he took the
rhetoric of abortion opponents seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1993, one month after the shooting death of a
Pensacola, Fla., abortion provider, David Gunn, Slepian spoke about
the vulnerability of doctors who provide abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably hits home a little bit because it could have been
me,'' Slepian told The Buffalo News. ``For years I've felt, and I
still feel, it could happen to me or to someone around here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1995, he told The News: ``When you're using words like
`kill' and `murder,' that's where it can lead. If the
rosary-holding churchgoers and the bishop don't think that's true,
they're fooling themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Slepian had clashed with anti-abortion protesters
outside his home. Protesters had taunted him during the Jewish
holiday of Hanukkah, calling him a ``murderer.'' One protester
later claimed that Slepian had attacked him with a baseball bat,
though the case was later settled.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian divided his practice between the clinic in Buffalo and
his private office in Amherst. Ms. Ward, the clinic spokeswoman,
said he had worked at that and other clinics for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been harassed right in front of his house,'' she said.
``His children have been harassed.'' She called him a courageous
man who followed his principles.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from Attica, N.Y., who identified herself only as Susan,
stood outside his Amherst office Saturday, weeping. She said
Slepian should not be portrayed solely as an ``abortion doctor.''
She said he had delivered her niece and her daughter and that he
kept a photo album of the hundreds of babies that he had delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he was about babies, not abortion,'' Susan said. She
said she had gone to him every three months for the past four years
for treatment of cervical cancer. ``I feel he saved my life. I feel
he is like a member of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   In Slepian's affluent Amherst neighborhood of large homes, there
was a sense of shock that this protected world could be violated.
The slogan on Amherst police cars reads, ``Safest Town in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while,'' said David Guercio, 49, a neighbor
walking by the Slepian home Saturday, ``we get a pumpkin smashed
around here, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Neel Chary, said Slepian's four sons had told
him of a horrible scene. ``They just went into a panic,'' Chary
said. ``The oldest one called the grandpa and said, `Grandpa,
Grandpa, Dad's been shot.'''

YANKS' RADIO TEAM TALKS THE TALK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For baseball fans, the relationship with their
home-team radio broadcasters is more than just a summer fling. You
get to know them as you would neighbors or relatives, for all their
charms and foibles. Baseball announcers shout at you while riding
with you in the car. They laugh with you at the picnic table or at
the beach. And they whisper to you from the pillow in the late
innings of West Coast games.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they outlast players and managers, marriages and jobs.
The voices of the baseball announcers are as constant, in Joni
Mitchell's adroit phrase, as the hissing of summer lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Yankees have finished a remarkable season by
winning another World Series, their fans will get a four-month
respite from John Sterling and Michael Kay, who announce their
games on WABC-AM in New York. After they presided over Friday's
ceremony at City Hall, some might welcome the interval. But even
their harshest critics know that Sterling and Kay have crafted a
distinctive _ if not always distinguished _ identity alongside
their team.
</P>
<P>
   Radio announcers have habits that annoy you, habits that charm
you. There is an intimacy about radio broadcasts, far more than
with television. Even at home, with the television on, it is
tempting to turn down the sound and click on the radio for the
Sterling-Kay take.
</P>
<P>
   Compare their presentation with the audio of television
coverage, with its multiple outlets and rotating phalanx of
announcers. Television coverage lacks the narrative continuity that
comes from home-team radio broadcasters. With some of the
television announcers, even local ones like Bobby Murcer, you get
the feeling that they don't follow the team very closely and don't
care to report beyond the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   With Sterling and Kay, you sense that they have lived with the
Bronx Bombers from the first tobacco-juice squirt of spring
training to the final sunflower seed of the World Series. From
their tone and presentation, it is clear that Sterling and Kay are
quite proud of their knowledge and their rank. From two-seam
fastballs to hokey home run calls, they know their stuff and they
can talk the talk.
</P>
<P>
   They can converse for a three-hour game without often stepping
on each other's words. Bonded in the booth like astronauts in a
spacecraft, they share the air and alternate seamlessly between
roles of play-by-play and color commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The best of radio's baseball announcers _ Vin Scully, Ernie
Harwell, Mel Allen _ have been solo pilots, conversing only
occasionally with sidekicks. Sterling and Kay have a modern feel,
respecting each other's conversational rhythms, finishing each
other's thoughts. They don't hesitate to respectfully disagree on
strategy or opinion.
</P>
<P>
   With a deeper voice, a more affected delivery and more innings
as the lead play-by-play man, Sterling makes the stronger
impression. But there are times when it seems as if WABC is
presenting ``The John Sterling Show,'' and his special guests
tonight are the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   His signature home run call _ ``It is high, it is far, it is
gone!'' _ is often annoying even when it is accurate. Perhaps
Sterling's personality is appropriate for a franchise defined by
the swagger and bluster of George Steinbrenner. But is the boastful
``THUH-uh-uh Yankees win!'' necessary for a classy team that
prevails so often?
</P>
<P>
   Kay, by contrast, plays well off Sterling's bravado. A reporter
with a common voice who tries more to inform than to entertain, Kay
might tell you more than you need to know about the manager's
pinch-hitting options. And he sure can be blunt. Even in the
triumphant Game 4 on Wednesday night, he noted of Tino Martinez:
``The main reason Tino doesn't score is 'cause he's slow.''
</P>
<P>
   His few bits of shtick have worn thin, and his home run call of
``See ya!'' comes across as contrived. More convincing is Kay's
daily reminder: ``You're listening to Yankees baseball, and we
certainly do thank you for that.'' Kay sounds like a local guy
enjoying himself by working hard at his dream job and getting
better every game.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the media business know that consumers, and
bosses, often confuse the messengers with the messages. If the team
you cover does well, the audience perceives that you have done a
better job. It is the good fortune of Sterling and Kay that they
got to ride in the parade and take bows alongside the men who hit,
catch and pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the good fortune of the fans to have them in good and
bad seasons, as surrogate eyes and ears. This is what radio
baseball has always been about.

WIDMER DROPS HINTS AND GIANTS ARE SET TO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Giants will begin negotiations this week to extend the
contract of middle linebacker Corey Widmer, who can become an
unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. Similar talks may
also ensue with defensive end Chad Bratzke, the team's other top
player who is scheduled for unrestricted free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke is the team's leading tackler this year; Widmer trails
Bratzke by one tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The talks with Widmer came about in part because Widmer
expressed concern last week that he had not been approached in a
year when the contracts of several other veteran Giants had been
renegotiated and extended to keep them with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know where I fit in on the Giants' agenda,''
Widmer, a seven-year veteran and valuable cog in the defense, said
at his Giants Stadium locker on Thursday. ``I'm a bit confused.
I've seen them lock up other guys around here. I guess I'm not
basically in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to stay here, but I'm a bit curious what they're
thinking. You get to a crossroads and the timing starts to matter.
The closer you get to free agency _ if there are two games left in
the season _ you start looking at other options.''
</P>
<P>
   Told on Friday of Widmer's comments, Giants general manager
Ernie Accorsi arranged to open contract negotiations with Widmer's
agent, Frank Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were under the impression that Corey wanted to wait until
the season was over,'' Accorsi said. ``Since we now understand that
may not be the case, we'll start now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who last month said he had not heard from the Giants on
Widmer's contract status, could not be reached for comment. In
1997, the Giants talked of a possible renegotiation with Widmer,
whose salary will count $1.679 million against the team's salary
cap this year.
</P>
<P>
   With the National Football League salary cap ever expanding,
Widmer can expect a significant raise during his next contract,
wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are one of the few NFL teams under the salary cap,
with about $700,000 available this year to get a deal started. Any
renegotiated contract would be structured to credit the bulk of the
salary to succeeding years, when the league cap will rise
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi said he would be receptive to opening talks this week
with Widmer and Bratzke, who has returned from a serious knee
injury last year to play remarkably well.
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke's six sacks are second on the Giants and he has a
team-leading 43 tackles, including 31 solo tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to stay here,'' said Bratzke, a Giant since 1994.
``But it's not up to me. Certainly I'd listen to any offer they
had. I don't want to lose focus on the season; those things can be
a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke, whose 1998 salary-cap value is $1.434 million, has
recently changed agents, going from Frank Murtha Jr. to Anthony
Agnone.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi said Bratzke has to officially inform the team of his
agent change before the team can resume talks. Accorsi added,
however, that he and his predecessor, George Young, had tried in
the past to extend Bratzke's contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried very hard to sign him when he was with Frank
Murtha,'' Accorsi said.
</P>
<P>
   Another priority for the Giants is renegotiating the contract of
offensive lineman Roman Oben. Oben's contract ends this season,
too. But because he will have played only three years in the
league, he would become a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants could match any offer Oben received from another
team, but it is not a situation they relish. The episode last
winter involving the Jets, the New England Patriots and Curtis
Martin, who was a restricted free agent, proved that there are ways
to structure a deal so it is difficult to match.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent potential restricted free agent is safety
Percy Ellsworth, who has recently moved into the starting lineup.
There is also the nickel linebacker Scott Galyon, who could
probably start at weakside linebacker for many teams. He could
become a restricted free agent along with Amani Toomer, the wide
receiver who has made great strides this year and has caught three
touchdown passes. Conrad Hamilton, who has filled in ably at
cornerback for the injured Jason Sehorn, is also headed for the
restricted free agent category.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for unrestricted free agency is Gary Brown, the team's
current starter at running back.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the contract of the starting cornerback Phillippi
Sparks, whose deal expires after the 1999 season, appears to be a
part of the team's long-range plans as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Giants who have had their contracts reworked and
extended this year are the Pro Bowl linebacker Jessie Armstead,
quarterback Danny Kanell, offensive tackle Scott Gragg and
defensive tackle Robert Harris.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Donors and lenders this month are pouring $2.8
million a day into the national treasuries of the Republican and
Democratic parties, according to the parties' final pre-election
reports.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't been enough to fully fund ambitious plans they
announced this summer for extra help to their Senate, House,
gubernatorial and state legislative candidates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that candidates, rather than parties, will again
raise the vast bulk of the money spent trying to win the Nov. 3
elections. That development favors incumbents, who have an easier
time raising funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has scaled back ``Operation Breakout,'' its
$37 million plan for TV and radio ads, and now expects to raise no
more than $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party has trimmed its $18 million goal for the
``Unity '98'' fund-raising drive led by President Clinton down to
$12 million and more than $1 million of that has already been
diverted to pay debts to polling and ad firms that the party hired
to help Clinton's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for the committees leading the drives gamely tried
to describe their fund-raising lemons as lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Republican Congressional Committee, Mary Mead
Crawford said her party didn't need the full $37 million because it
delayed the start of its ad campaign by one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of September, no-one was listening, so we
didn't start our program until Oct. 6,'' Crawford said. ``We can
put our message across in the last four weeks. We're in 73 markets
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic National Committee, Melissa Bonnie Ratcliff
said, ``The Unity '98 effort was a very ambitious effort and the
money is still coming in. We hope to come as close to our goal as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not how much you spend, it's how smart you spend it,''
said Olivia Morgan at the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents in safe seats felt strongly about the need for the
program. Democratic House members chipped in more than $3 million
and Republican House members chipped in more than $7 million from
their personal political accounts for the special fund-raising
drives.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pre-election reports, which cover fund-raising
through Oct. 15, show that, while this year's fund-raising was good
for a non-presidential election year, it came nowhere close to the
golden gushers of 1996, when money flowed in so thick and fast that
the parties had trouble spending it all.
</P>
<P>
   The reports show that between Oct. 1 and Oct. 15, the
Republicans raised $24.4 million and the Democrats raised $17.7
million from contributions and loans.
</P>
<P>
   Between Jan. 1, 1997 and Oct. 15, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Republicans have raised $299 million, a $96 million
increase over the $203 million they grossed at the same point in
1993-94, the last non-presidential election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Democrats have raised $192 million, a $70 million increase
over the $120 million they grossed at this point in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  But neither came close to its totals for the scandal-plagued
1995-96 election cycle, when the Republican Party had grossed $399
million and the Democratic Party had grossed $242 million at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   (Editors: Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   In this election cycle, about 63 percent of the Republican
receipts and 56 percent of the Democratic receipts consisted of
``hard money,'' which comes in limited amounts from individuals and
can be used for direct aid to federal candidates. The rest was
``soft money,'' which can be used for any purpose other than direct
aid to federal candidates, and almost always comes in huge amounts
from wealthy people, corporate treasuries and union treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the preliminary figures for gross receipts reported to
the Federal Election Commission by the two major parties for the
1997-98 election cycle:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the 18 months that ended June 30, the Republicans beat the
Democrats, $140.5 million to $80 million, in raising hard money.
They also beat them, $77.4 million to $53 million, in raising soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Between July 1 and Oct. 15, the Republicans beat the
Democrats, $48.9 million to $28.3 million, in raising hard money.
However, the Democrats beat them, $36.3 million to $32.3 million,
in raising soft money.

PARCELLS HOPES THE GOOD JETS SHOW UP TO PLAY FALCONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Byars, who has been there with the Eagles, the Dolphins
and the Patriots, was trying to explain to the Jets what this
winning thing is all about. Welcome to the club, Keith. Even Byars'
coach, Bill Parcells, does not know what he has with this team.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are 3-3, they face a strong Atlanta Falcons team Sunday
at the Meadowlands _ and no one knows what to expect. After all,
the Jets have defeated the Patriots and the Dolphins, who at 4-2
are tied for first place in the American Football Conference East,
but lost to the Rams and the Ravens, two teams at, or near, the
bottom of their divisions.
</P>
<P>
   So, the question remains: What kind of team is this?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to set the trend sometime,'' said Byars, the heady
fullback who has been in the National Football League for 13
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling some of the guys I had the same thing at New
England. Three-and-three. Then we won eight of the next 10 games
and go 11-5 and wind up in the Super Bowl. And which way do we go
now? We didn't win eight of 10 games by talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was two seasons ago, when Parcells led the Patriots to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is six games into the 1998 season, 22 games into
Parcells' Jets rule, and maybe some things are starting to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that is what Parcells hoped after the Jets toppled
the Dolphins three games ago. Afterward, he warned his team that
the Rams were sitting in St. Louis on a bye week, soaking up all
the extra information they could to use against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells feared the Jets would not listen to him, and he was
right. They committed five turnovers, all leading to Ram scores,
and Glenn Foley was replaced at quarterback by Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jets are in a similar situation, and once more their
coach is wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them after Monday night that the Falcons' players were
watching you, and they're getting ready to play you,'' Parcells
said. ``This game,'' he said about Sunday's meeting, ``could get us
going a little bit. Our team has to understand how it's being
viewed.''
</P>
<P>
   So, did Parcells think the Jets learned something by losing to
the Rams just when they were feeling good about themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like getting a second chance to understand,'' Parcells
said. ``It's like getting hit in the face four times by a skunk
before you smell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Could he tell if the Jets smelled it yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied. ``I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets should not be caught off guard by the Falcons, who will
enter the Meadowlands with a 5-1 record after their most productive
three-game scoring splurge in team history, 116 points.
</P>
<P>
   This is, quite simply, a game the Jets have to take seriously on
its merits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, does anyone really know which version of the Jets will show
up Sunday? Give them credit for an opening-game performance that
pushed the 49ers into overtime. But a week later, against the
Ravens, the Jets yielded a 69-yard punt return for a touchdown and
an interception for a touchdown. All of last season the Jets did
not give up even one return for a score. There was also a 99-yard
scoring march by the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   In Week 3, the Jets clobbered the Colts, and the following week
they stopped the Dolphins. But then turnovers, Foley's poor
performance and Curtis Martin's absence because of a thigh injury
did them in at St. Louis. Martin was back on Monday at Foxboro, the
Jets had no turnovers and, in general, looked good.
</P>
<P>
   So here they are, a team whose offense is more powerful than it
was last season, a team with a new quarterback, an effective
running game when Martin is healthy, a collection of quality
receivers, a well-drilled defense led by a resurgent Mo Lewis, and
an erratic group of special-teamers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get through this game,'' Parcells said, ``we'll be
back to being pretty healthy.'' He was referring to the likely
return of key special-team players like Fred Baxter and Chad
Cascadden (who is also a valuable backup linebacker).
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, Parcells hopes this game will provoke a
collective consciousness among the Jets that they are good enough
to win on a regular basis. Parcells said that he thought that would
happen in last season's finale, when the Jets lost to the Lions and
blew a playoff chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do is get them to see it the way I see
it,'' he said.

recovering from shoulder surgery in the off season, pitched so

MARY CALDERONE, 94, ADVOCATE OF SEXUAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio, N.M.)  (mk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, the grande dame of sex education,
died Saturday at the Kendal at Longwood nursing home in Kennett
Square, Pa. She was 94 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease
for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Indefatigable and fired by a zeal for sexual responsibility and
realism, Dr. Calderone persuaded a recalcitrant American Medical
Association to let doctors dispense birth control as a matter of
course to their patients, and she set in motion the means of
educating schoolchildren about human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calderone did more than any other individual to convince
both the medical profession and the public that human sexuality
goes far beyond the sex act. She heralded it as a multifaceted and
vital part of a healthy life that should not be hidden under a
shroud of secrecy or limited to erotic expression.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite challenges to young audiences she addressed
was to ask for a four-letter word ending in ``k'' that meant sexual
intercourse. Over a chorus of titters, she would give her answer:
``talk.'' Then she would explain, ``We never talk to each other as
nonsexual people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calderone, the daughter of the photographer Edward Steichen,
was a woman of many talents and diverse interests who did not find
her true calling until midlife. Following graduation from Vassar
College, where she majored in chemistry, she decided to go on the
stage, but abandoned her acting career when she realized she could
never be as good as Katherine Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 30, after a failed marriage to a fellow actor, W.
Lon Martin, and the birth of two daughters, Nell and Linda, she
decided to go to medical school.
</P>
<P>
   She received an M.D. degree in 1939 from the University of
Rochester and a master's degree in public health in 1942 from the
Columbia University School of Public Health. While at Columbia she
met Dr. Frank Calderone, then a district health officer on the
Lower East Side who would soon become deputy commissioner of health
for New York City and her second husband. The couple were married
in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calderone served for some years as a school physician in
Great Neck, N.Y. In 1953 she became medical director of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, where she carried forward
Margaret Sanger's mission for family planning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 Dr. Calderone realized one of her crowning goals: She
convinced the trustees of the American Medical Association that the
nation's leading organization of physicians should disseminate
information on reproduction and birth control and endorse the
prescription of birth control measures to all patients who needed
them. The trustees' proposal was adopted, helping to move birth
control into the mainstream of American medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, as a representative of family planning, she
took part in the first American Conference on Church and Family run
by the National Council of Churches. Attended by sociologists,
religious leaders, educators and public health professionals, the
conference highlighted the suffering of thousands of people because
of ignorance about frigidity, impotence, homosexuality and
contraception.
</P>
<P>
   With five colleagues at the conference, Dr. Calderone set up an
informal committee to study human sexuality. Out of that committee
grew Dr. Calderone's signature achievement, the co-founding of the
Sex Information and Education Council of the United States in 1964.
Dr. Calderone then resigned from Planned Parenthood to turn her
attention from reproductive biology to education in human
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Better known by its acronym SIECUS, the council was created to
help teachers, therapists and other professionals establish human
sexuality as an integral part of health and health education. Under
her guidance, SIECUS became the moving force for education about
human sexuality in the schools as well as in the community. The
organization publishes ``Guidelines for Sexuality Education:
Kindergarten Through 12th Grade'' and helps schools around the
country set up comprehensive sex education programs.
</P>
<P>
   As the president of SIECUS, Dr. Calderone stood out in the 1960s
as an innovator, one of a handful of educators, scientists and
philosophers who were beginning to address the big topics of human
existence like death and sexuality. She was an unstinting advocate
for the acceptance of masturbation as a wholesome, normal and
almost universal practice for people of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calderone was far more than a female doctor championing a
cause. Her theatrical training, coupled with her carriage, poise
and authoritative voice, helped her to get her message across that
children are born sexual beings and remain so until they die and
that people of all ages need and deserve a proper sexual education.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calderone believed sex education in the schools should start
in kindergarten, and under her direction SIECUS helped to set up
sex education programs in thousands of schools throughout the
country. After stepping down from the presidency, she joined New
York University as an adjunct professor in its program on human
sexuality. She was active professionally until age 80.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from birth, Mary Steichen was a natural leader:
optimistic, determined, resilient and forthright, who from early
childhood knew how to speak her mind. At age 6, for example, she
criticized the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, a family friend, for
creating ``L'Oiseau d'Or'' with a horizontal head, a position that
she said would make it impossible for the bird to sing. Brancusi's
later bird sculptures had more uplifted heads.
</P>
<P>
   Her imposing appearance combined with her strong personality
helped her advance her causes and also to defend them against
attacks by groups like the Christian Crusade, the John Birch
Society and Moral Majority, who contended that her promotion of sex
education in schools was encouraging a premature and unhealthy
participation in sexual experience and usurping the role of parents
in guiding their children's lives. Her reply was that if parents
were doing their job properly there would be no need for
school-based sex education.

 UNDATED: sex education. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A devout Quaker and a Republican, she was once labeled by the
John Birch Society as an ``aging sexual libertine.'' She reminded
her critics that modern children were in desperate need of sex
education because they were sexually vulnerable: ``devoid of
chaperones, supervision, rules and close family relations and
subject to onslaughts of commercial sexual exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   But recognizing that a child's sexual attitudes are often shaped
before school age, Dr. Calderone also focused on educating parents.
Through SIECUS she established Parent Learning Centers to teach
adults about their own sexuality as well as their children's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 she and Eric Johnson wrote a widely praised book, ``The
Family Book About Sexuality,'' which was published in five
languages. The following year, she and James Ramey were the
co-authors of ``Talking With Your Child About Sex,'' published in
four languages.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calderone also contributed to many professional publications
and served as editor of texts on abortion and family planning.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dr. Calderone saw serendipity as a major architect of her
success, she did not always lead a charmed life. She grew up as the
daughter of a working artist. Her mother, Clara, was considered
cold, and their relationship was adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   When her parents divorced, Mary, then 10, chose to live with her
father. Not until nearly seven decades after the divorce was she
able to bury the emotional hatchet that had estranged her from her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calderone's own experiences as a mother were also difficult.
Her 8-year-old daughter, Nell, died of pneumonia, plunging her into
a debilitating depression.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to Dr. Calderone, who later became chief
administrative officer of the World Health Organization, produced
two more daughters, Dr. Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a
gerontologist, and Dr. Maria Calderone, a veterinarian in Galena,
Ohio, born almost 20 years after her oldest daughter, Linda Hodes,
a psychotherapist in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The Calderones separated in 1979 but never divorced. Dr. Frank
Calderone died in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her daughters, Mary Calderone is survived by
three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

YALE ROMPS AND GAINS TIE FOR IVY LEAD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Yale helped create a logjam atop the Ivy
League Saturday, routing Columbia by 37-14 and moving into a
four-way tie for first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (3-3), who finished last in 1996 and 1997, are now
tied with Harvard, Penn and Princeton at 2-1 in the league.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fourth victory in two seasons for Yale Coach
Jack Siedlecki, who arrived last year from Amherst. Now, Siedlecki
said: ``Anything can happen. We're a good football team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, which began this season with an astounding 24-0 upset
of the defending Ivy League champion, Harvard, is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions (2-4, 1-2), who lost for the fourth time in their last
five games, once again failed to protect their quarterback, Ted
Schroeder. He was sacked seven times, and has been sacked 17 times
in three games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On defense the Lions felt the loss of their co-captain and
middle linebacker, Jeremy Taylor, who tore a knee ligament in a
loss to Penn last Saturday; he will not play again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best linebacker in the league,'' Columbia Coach Ray
Tellier said of Taylor. ``We just didn't have it today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale's 37 points were the most a Bulldog team had scored since
a &QC; 40-38 victory over Brown in 1995, 36 games ago. The Bulldogs
rushed for 342 yards, which surprised Siedlecki, whose game plan
called for more passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``the right things all happened and that gave
us confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashad Bartholomew, a transfer from the Air Force Academy,
rushed for 194 yards, a career high, and scored Yale's last
touchdown on a 70-yard run midway through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Yale outgained Columbia, 452 yards to 210. The best effort for
the Lions came from the freshman tailback Johnathan Reese, who had
48 yards rushing and 104 yards returning kickoffs. Reese is ``as
good a running back as I've ever recruited,'' Tellier said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yale's quarterback, the left-handed Joe Walland, completed 12 of
21 passes for 110 yards and 2 touchdowns, both to tight end Brian
Scharf, and rushed for 44 yards, including a 29-yard touchdown
dash.
</P>
<P>
   Siedlecki, a college coach for 22 seasons, said of Walland,
``I've never had a quarterback like Joe, who can do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Siedlecki has added the option to his offense this year because
Walland can run it so well, as he showed Saturday in key
situations.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Columbia scored first on an opening 65-yard drive, and Yale then
scored 27 consecutive points. Its defense held the Lions to a net
of 26 yards for the rest of the first half. &QL;

HOW 'BOUT THAT JIMMY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The palm trees beyond the end zone of the Miami
Dolphins' practice field sway in a stiff South Florida breeze, but
Jimmy Johnson's hair doesn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never change.
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson's football teams. He took the Cowboys from last
place to the Super Bowl in only four years, building them into the
dominant NFL team of the early 1990s, and the same plan is
unquestionably in operation here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is,'' Johnson said, ``bring in the right people _ not
only players, but coaches, administrators, personnel people _ and
eliminate the wrong people _ those who want to detract and be
negative and take away from what you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Jimmy's Way appears to be working again. Six games into
Johnson's third season back in his adopted hometown, the Dolphins
are 4-2 and play for first place in the AFC East against 4-2 New
England this afternoon at Pro Player Stadium. A victory puts the
Dolphins in position to make good on Johnson's goal of contending
for the Super Bowl this year. The proposition is all the sweeter
because the Super Bowl will be played Jan. 31 on the Dolphins' home
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play consistent and we prepare every week, we have a
chance to win the Super Bowl,'' tight end Troy Drayton said. ``And
that's a goal to shoot for. Every team, no matter how bad or good
they are, is shooting for the Super Bowl every year. So why
wouldn't you want to be the first team in NFL history to play the
Super Bowl in your hometown and your home stadium?
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the home-field advantage in the Super Bowl would be so
amazing. You couldn't begin to describe what the atmosphere would
be like. To be the first team to do that ... Wow. Think about it.
It kind of gives you goose bumps, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not so far-fetched, because the Dolphins are playing
championship-level defense with the NFL's fourth-ranked unit
constructed of the same raw materials as those of Johnson's glory
days.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's defense bears a striking resemblance to Johnson's 1992
Cowboys and his 1987 national champion Miami Hurricanes. The huge,
dominating tackles. The speed on the outside. The big plays.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's 315-pound Tim Bowens, swift linebacker Derrick
Rodgers and rookie pass-rusher Lorenzo Bromell. They could just as
well be Russell Maryland, Ken Norton and Leon Lett; or Jerome
Brown, Daniel Stubbs and Bennie Blades.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a recipe,'' Dolphins defensive end Jason Taylor said.
``He knows exactly what he wants. He did it at UM and he did it at
Dallas and he's trying to do it here now. We've got two big horses
inside clogging the middle, and small, quick guys on the outside to
go make plays. We've got depth on the defensive line and
linebackers who can run. All the pieces he had there are in place
here.'' Defense first In building a team Jimmy's Way, defense comes
first. In Miami, Johnson has put together arguably the NFL's finest
defense. If you care to argue, he has the numbers on his side:
</P>
<P>
   No team has allowed fewer points this season than the Dolphins
(11.7 per game).
</P>
<P>
   In three games at home, Miami has allowed only seven points and
shut out its past two opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's afraid of Miami's offense, especially since Johnson has
taken the reins out of the hands of all-time NFL passing leader Dan
Marino and installed his beloved power running game. But offense
isn't what gets you to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be certain things that carry over to every
situation,'' Johnson explained. ``I believe if you're going to win
championships, you have to play outstanding defense, and I also
believe you've got to have outstanding speed and quickness on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jimmy believes it, it must be so. At least that's how he and
his players see it. No coach believes in himself more than Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a big misconception, that he's arrogant and
cocky,'' Drayton said. ``I think he just glows with confidence. And
it's infectious, because you know how he feels. You know in every
way, shape and form, he knows he's the best. Why wouldn't you want
to play for someone like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's confidence in his plan ensures the basic principle of
Jimmy's Way _ everything boils down to personnel _ never changes.
Johnson's most important job as the Dolphins' head coach and
general manager, the one he says he spends the most time on, is
evaluating talent.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Johnson moved quickly to get his players in place.
Indeed, 42 of the 53 players on the Dolphins' roster have been
acquired since Johnson arrived in January 1996, including 15 of the
22 starters. Sixteen players, six of them starters, are in their
first year with the team.
</P>
<P>
   But for every new face, another player was discarded. That's an
aspect Johnson said is no less important to his success. He must
not only identify those he wants to be part of the organization, he
must remove those from the organization who have become part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   That contributes to Johnson's reputation for ruthlessness, which
is as much a part of his mystique as his two Super Bowl rings and
his obsession with winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thought that comes to mind when you mention him is
Super Bowls, and the job he did in Dallas,'' Drayton said. ``But
you also think about a hard-nosed disciplinarian who's very
straightforward, who has cut guys from first-rounders to free
agents. The only thing he cares about is winning and
productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who understand that, who are similarly driven, have no
problem. Others better get out of the way. `Whatever it takes' Not
everyone can go along with that. When Johnson took over the
Dolphins, they couldn't go after big-name free agents because they
were $5 million over the NFL salary cap and had to release players
and restructure contracts to have enough money for draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson finally had the resources during the past off-season to
make a run at John Randle, Sean Gilbert and Chester McGlockton,
among others. None of them, however, signed with Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine Johnson's reputation played no part in
their decisions, especially since the Dolphins signed only two
unrestricted free agents this year. One, safety Brock Marion,
played for Johnson with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Marion was eager to sign with the Dolphins, not only for $8.1
million over three years. He also knows what Johnson is about and
thrives on the challenge. In that, he is joined by teammate Robert
Jones, another ex-Cowboys player who was drafted by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by having been with him, I know that Jimmy just wants to
win,'' Jones said. ``He'll do anything to win. Whatever it takes,
that's what he'll do. If it takes drilling the team a little bit
more in practice, he'll do that. If it means easing up because it's
becoming too physical, he'll do that. Whatever the ingredient is to
win, he'll use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of him. This guy's a winner, and he's going to
do what it takes to win. And if you feel the same way about
winning, and you'll do whatever it takes to win, you'll get along
just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It's never that easy, of course. Johnson would never allow that.
He wants no one to get comfortable, so he makes sure every player
is looking over his shoulder, that there is competition for every
position.
</P>
<P>
   That's great for a player like former Texas Tech star Zach
Thomas, a fifth-round draft choice in 1996 deemed too small to be
an effective NFL linebacker. By the opening game of his rookie
season, Thomas was starting because Johnson wasn't afraid to play a
5-foot-10 middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has made his coach look brilliant, leading the team in
tackles the past two seasons. This year he is again No. 1 on the
team with 66 tackles. He's on pace for a career-high 176, and also
has a sack, a forced fumble and an interception return for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jimmy, if you're making plays, it doesn't matter how big
you are,'' Thomas said. ``He doesn't care how much money you're
getting paid. He's going to play the best players. There's no
politics in it. You could go somewhere else and be backing up
someone just because he's made a name for himself, even if you're
better. It's not that way here.'' Three a charm? Here they do it
Jimmy's Way, and that means nothing is handed to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Even Marino, whose place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame is
being prepared, has been on the chopping block. When Marino
struggled last season, Johnson hinted that maybe the 37-year-old
quarterback should step aside.
</P>
<P>
   While Marino is no longer the offensive focus, he remains the
starter. But if Marino's job isn't safe, whose is?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like Dallas,'' Marion said. ``He created competition
when he was in Dallas with young guys who really wanted it, and
fast guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of players created competition all the way around
the team, so no matter who you are, when you go out to practice
you've got to battle for a position. That makes you that much
better because you become used to that competitive edge. You're
used to having to dive to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are convinced that edge can make the difference
between a good team and a championship team, and this might be the
year they prove it. When Johnson was hired, he cited his third year
as the target date for the Dolphins to contend for the Super Bowl
title.
</P>
<P>
   Miami went 8-8 in 1996 and 9-7 last year, hardly giant steps in
that direction. This is Year 3, and Johnson points out last year's
Dolphins fell two points short of a division title in a
season-ending 14-12 loss to AFC East champ New England. ``We're a
much better team this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to win it all? Jones, a rookie starter on Johnson's
first Super Bowl champion, said he sees the same things happening
this year in Miami that he saw in 1992 in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very similar because the guys now are starting to
understand each other, to understand how we play and what makes us
play better, what mentally gets to us,'' he said. ``We know how to
pull together as a group and not as individuals. Guys are always
lifting each other up. Nobody's jumping down anybody's throat when
a mistake is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what happened when I was in Dallas. That's what I
saw. It's the same type of atmosphere being created here as what we
had there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a coincidence. That's Jimmy's Way.

RANGERS TIE FLYERS, 2-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Rangers aren't a great team. They probably
won't be a good team for a while. Possibly, they might not even be
a mediocre team in what is obviously a rebuilding season. But they
do seem to be a competitive bunch that plays interesting games, at
least after eight performances of the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just seems to be a better atmosphere in our locker room
and throughout the organization,'' goalie Mike Richter said
Saturday after making 35 saves in a 2-2 tie with the Flyers that
extended the Rangers unbeaten streak to four games (2-0-2). It is a
significant turnaround for the Rangers, who began the season with
four consecutive defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's tie could have seemed like a defeat for the Rangers,
who squandered a 2-0 lead in the third period, and they managed
only one shot on goal in the period before putting two on Flyers
goalie John Vanbiesbrouck in overtime. Over all, they were out-shot
by 37-13. And the power play that led to Philadelphia's tying goal
was created when Rangers defenseman Ulf Samuelsson was penalized
for playing with a broken stick.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rangers seemed to hold their heads high as they left
this big, loud, intimidating building. Samuelsson, playing with a
fractured cheekbone protected by a face shield, absorbed many
thundering checks, several from Eric Lindros. Samuelsson and Peter
Popovic led a gritty effort by the Rangers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took hits to make plays,'' Wayne Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean scored at even strength in the first period and
Adam Graves had a power-play goal in the second for the Rangers.
Philadelphia countered with John LeClair's goal at even strength
and Rod Brind'Amour's power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers might have unraveled after the tying goal by
Brind'Amour, which came at at 9 minutes 3 seconds of the third
period. Samuelsson said he did not realize his stick was broken.
The crowd roared in anticipation of the next face-off when Rangers
Coach John Muckler called a timeout and began speaking with great
emotion to his players huddled around him at the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `There's 10 minutes and 58 seconds to go and you're
playing maybe the best team in the National Hockey League and you
don't have to play 60 minutes to beat them,''' Muckler said.
```We're sitting in a good position. Why's everybody so
concerned?'''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens, who assisted on MacLean's goal, said it was ``a
good time for a timeout'' because the Flyers were ``coming at us
hard and the fans were getting loud.'' Muckler, Stevens said,
reminded them ``that it's 2-2, not 8-2.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson said his extra head and face gear prevented him from
comprehending the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the bubble on, I can't hear a thing, and the fans
were so loud,'' he said. ``But I saw he was upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach also had much to be pleased about. ``This hockey club
battled,'' Muckler said. ``We deserved a point. We could have got
2.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly paid the price. Richter, in addition to a dozen
fine saves, absorbed collisions with Philadelphia's Shjon Podein.
Gretzky, for the second consecutive game, took a hard hit, this
time from Valery Zelepukin. Center Todd Harvey put forth another
energetic effort.
</P>
<P>
   On one shift, Harvey jousted with a Flyer. Then he blocked a
Brind'Amour shot. Then he rammed himself into the boards trying to
throw a check. Late in the third period, he got into a
high-sticking exchange with Lindros, and their coinciding minor
penalties favored the Rangers because Lindros was the better
scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   Popovic, coming back after missing two games with a severe cut
near his right eye, was credited with nine hits and five blocked
shots, best on the team in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one we prize the most,'' he said of the point in
the standings. ``We got out-shot, but we didn't get out worked.''
</P>
<P>
   By adding Popovic, Mathieu Schneider and Jan Mertzig to their
blue line, the Rangers have upgraded this core corps around the
centerpiece, the captain Brian Leetch.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Rangers' flaws are as apparent as ever,
particularly at forward. On the top line, Gretzky had two shots on
goal, Aleksei Kovalev only one and Niklas Sundstrom none. General
Manager Neil Smith returned from a scouting trip to Chicago, where
he watched the Blackhawks play San Jose. Trade rumors are rampant
around the Rangers, who need a second-line center and at least one
more scoring wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had to be encouraged by the line of MacLean, Stevens
and Tikkanen, all 33, which was assigned to check Lindros, LeClair
and Mike Maneluk as Muckler did more matching on the fly than
usual. MacLean now has two goals this season and gives the Rangers
something they have lacked since losing Mark Messier: a sniper who
can pick a spot and hit it, on the rush, on the first try.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean led the team with three shots on goal. That is good for
him, but not so good for the Rangers. Their next target: Buffalo's
Dominik Hasek on Tuesday night.

COMMENTARY: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER, ANOTHER HAILING OF
CHAMPIONS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FALLS, N.J. _ As if to make sure we do not underrate the
best-ever greatness from the good old days, the last player to hit
.400 showed up here hours after the Yankees' Broadway parade Friday
afternoon to honor an old pin-striped catcher who won more than a
handful of World Series rings, and apparently never wanted his
fiercest rivals to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   So said Ted Williams, sitting affectionately beside Yogi Berra
for the dedication of Berra's brand-new museum on the Montclair
State University campus, showing and telling how Berra used to
greet him all those years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every finger on his hand had a World Series ring,'' Williams
said. ``He'd wave and say, `Hi Ted. How ya' doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the wheelchair he has used since suffering a stroke in 1994,
Williams said he was doing just fine, though, as Yogi would have
put it, he seemed to be experiencing the symptoms of deja vu all
over again. As they were so many times when Williams was rattling
balls around and out of Fenway Park and other major league parks,
the Yankees were being celebrated as World Series winners again,
and, wouldn't you know it, over the team from Williams' hometown.
</P>
<P>
   From his home, now in Florida, he rooted for the Padres, and
wanted to believe they had a chance to climb back into contention
in Game 3, but then this third baseman who last season in Oakland
hit half of Williams' .406 in 1941, turned around Trevor Hoffman's
fastball for the Series-defining blow. And as Yogi didn't say, it
was over before it was over.
</P>
<P>
   How many times had Williams witnessed this brazen Yankee
conduct? As his cab driver had said earlier in the day when
Williams asked what he had thought of the Series: ``It wasn't long
enough.'' Which was precisely Williams' point about what typically
happens when the Yankees of most years get involved. The third
baseman he called ``Broshe,'' was more scientific proof that ``the
Yankees have something that no one has discovered yet. They get a
player who has never done anything before, and now he's knocking
things down. I mean, anybody could have got that third baseman,
but, the Yankees did. I don't know if they're injecting them with
venom, or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   At 80, with a wit as sharp as his old swing, the last thing Ted
Williams wants to do is complain that they don't make 'em like they
used to. He says today's ballplayers are bigger, stronger, faster.
On the other hand, he said the two best players he ever saw,
without question, were the now ailing Joe DiMaggio and the late
Mickey Mantle, both of whom retired decades ago. And when he said
he doesn't fancy himself as the greatest hitter of all time, he
added, ``I can't say I was a better hitter than Lou Gehrig.''
</P>
<P>
   What he was saying, in so many words, is that the best-ever
riddle is a pitch so wide only a bad-ball hitter like Yogi could
reach it, and then just to foul off. The more striking measure of
all-time greatness is this one special franchise that began winning
in 1923, and, 24 titles later, has not stopped. The most
significant legacy of the 1998 Yankees will be their powerful
expansion of the Yankees legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed they won this year because I wanted to see
San Diego win,'' Williams said. ``But I could see how good the
Yankees were. Wherever they went, it was one guy or another, 25
guys, as good at every position as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference for the museum (you don't get this honor,
Berra said, unless you're ``dead or gone''), Ralph Branca wondered
if people even remembered that the Yankees between 1949 and 1953
won five straight World Series. ``Any time you start saying, `the
greatest,' you're stretching it, really stretching it, because each
era is so different,'' said Larry Doby, knowing that any team
predating the admittance of black players to the major leagues
could be stricken from consideration on that basis alone.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, at no other point in baseball history have there
been as many small-market franchises whose resources are a small
fraction of the big-market powers. Would these Yankees have won 114
games playing in the saner financial climate of, say, the 1977 and
1978 champion Yankees, two 100-victory teams with first-rate
professionals top to bottom?
</P>
<P>
   These questions are all rhetorical, ball players being so
difficult to judge until you see them pitch and hit against each
other. Williams, in fact, said the first time he saw the stumpy
Berra come out of the dugout to catch, he said: ``Who are they
trying to kid with this guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, here they were, in the theater of Yogi's own museum, by
coincidence on the very day Joe Torre's Yankee were the kings of
New York. ``Did you know that we never had one parade?'' said
Whitey Ford, 70 years old last week. He shook his head at the
thought of those ingrate mayors, which, I guess, makes the current
one the greatest Yankee fan in the history of City Hall. &QL;

 &HT;    Auburn victory edges healing process along
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ It was 15 minutes before kickoff and Bill Oliver
had been Auburn's head football coach for less than 24 hours. From
the look of him, virtually none of those hours had included sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver was waiting his turn to take the elevator to the press
box, where he had decided to work his first game as a head coach
since 1983. The fans waiting around him were silent, unsure of what
to say and uncertain if they should invade his space.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a silver-haired woman reached over and extended a small
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good luck the rest of the year, Coach Oliver,'' she said. ''I
hope you win them all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you ma'am,'' he said, ``but right now we just want to
win one.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Bill Oliver era at Auburn began on a
positive note Saturday as Auburn beat Louisiana Tech 32-17 for its
first win since Sept. 12. The Tigers, 2-5, have four games
remaining beginning next Saturday with Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than just another victory for Auburn, Oliver said.
It was a small but necessary first step in the healing process that
now begins after Terry Bowden's sudden resignation on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden stepped down after 5 1/2 seasons, leaving Auburn's
players and fans in a state of shock. Oliver, the defensive
coordinator, was appointed interim head coach for the rest of the
season. That Auburn's players could respond in such a fashion,
Oliver said, spoke volumes about what the future could hold.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was wearing a cap, I would tip it to our players,'' said
Oliver, the former Alabama defensive coordinator who came to Auburn
three years ago. ''We always talk about adversity in football, but
these guys have really been through it. We won a football game and
we needed it badly.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 74,384, more than 10,000 below capacity, created an
eerie and uncertain atmosphere. They weren't gather to watch a
football game so much as to personally assess the damage that had
resulted from a severe family squabble.
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of emotions in the stadium _ anger, sadness,
confusion. But the most prevelant one was relief that the weekly
public bleeding over Bowden's future had finally come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after the game that the Auburn players finally
had a chance to publicly vent their feelings. Bowden addressed the
team Friday night and delivered the stunning news. Then they were
wisked into a bus and taken to a hotel in nearby Lanett for the
evening, which is their standard routine.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the guys had a sense that something was wrong before
Coach Bowden talked to us,'' center Cole Cubelic said. ''But nobody
thought he was going to be leaving immediately. We figured he would
stick it out until the end of the season. We were stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very frustrating and it hurt,'' wide receiver Karsten
Bailey said. ''But Coach Bowden will go on. He will land on his
feet. It's a very strange feeling to suddenly see your coach
walking out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next at Auburn is anyone's guess. The Tigers have
games remaining with Arkansas, Central Florida, Georgia, and
Alabama. A winning season is still a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Then the school has to decide on a full-time head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics director David Housel said Saturday he will meet with
President William Muse to discuss the process of selecting the next
coach. Housel also said that Oliver would be a candidate and that
Oliver had expressed an interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's game, Oliver would not address his desire to
have the ''interim'' label removed from his title. Rather, he felt
it was one of his duties to patch up some of the rifts in the
Auburn family created by the controversy over Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ''My job as as interim coach is to solidify some of the areas
where maybe we have split apart,'' Oliver said. ''Auburn is bigger
than any man or any two men. Now we have to pull this thing
together for the benefit of these players. We still have four games
left to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver played at Alabama from 1959-61, served two coaching
stints there, and made no secret of his desire to someday be head
coach of the Crimson Tide. But when he had a falling out with head
coach Gene Stallings after the 1995 season, Oliver came to Auburn,
where he landed his first job as a college assistant in 1966. On
Nov. 21, Oliver will be the head coach when Auburn meets Alabama in
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ''A man told me once that if you stay in this business long
enough, you'll see a little bit of everything,'' Oliver said. ''But
it would be kind of hard to top the last 48 hours.''

 &HT;    Splendor in the Bluegrass: Bulldogs pass Couch test
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ The Georgia Bulldogs came to Kentucky Saturday
to take the Couch test. They passed.
</P>
<P>
   That's only part of the story, though. Sometimes you think
you've seen it all, then you turn the page and there it is.
Something right out of fiction, like Chip Hilton or Dink Lawrence.
Here, you waited until the last play of the game, a frenzied
afternoon in Commonwealth Stadium. The Bulldogs and the Wildcats
had played 59 minutes and 50 seconds, and it had come down to this
one play.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia had a lead, 28-26. Kentucky had the ball on Georgia's
32-yard line. Just last week Hal Mumme, the Kentucky coach, had
deeked Louisiana State into complacency in the last minute, then
set up a field goal with a surprise ground play, then kicked it.
The same kicker was on the field now, Seth Hanson, sophomore from
Dallas. This was the whole ball of wax. Kick the field goal and
win; fail and lose.
</P>
<P>
   Came the snap, and it looked all right. Or maybe it was a bit
low. Anyway, the holder fumbled the ball, in wild desperation made
a run for it, then flung a wild pass, in the style of Garo
Yepremian in a long ago Super Bowl. Game over, Georgia wins.
</P>
<P>
   As irony would have it, the holder's name is Matt Mumme, son of
the coach who has brought new vigor to football in the Bluegrass
State. They've even named a street for Hal Mumme in the stadium
area. There may be an escape clause in the deal, but only if he
takes leave.
</P>
<P>
   The lad transferred here with his dad from Valdosta State and is
closing out a career in the shadows, a quarterback who played
behind Lance Funderburk, All-American at Valdosta, and now behind
Couch, the greatest quarterback that ever came out of Hyden, Ky.
(pop. 900). He is spoken of in terms of everything glorious.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, likelihood of Hanson connecting on a field goal from
49 yards was doubtful. In the first half he had kicked one from 42,
longest of his career. But it was the drama of it all, Commonwealth
Stadium held breathless while it all unraveled. Not that it will
ever replace the roundball in the hearts of deep-rooted
Kentuckians, but they have come to see some new value in the ball
with points on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, last week we made it, this week we didn't,'' said Mumme,
speaking of the field goal that wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Jim Donnan was feeling pretty cozy. It was
the Bulldogs' second close call, though actually you felt that once
they got the lead and set the course, they were safe. They were
behind 10-0 and 17-7 in the first half, but in their time of need,
Quincy Carter stepped forward. He first set out on a 49-yard run
for touchdown from shotgun depth, through a field of flailing
blueshirts. (cq) The telling blow was a pass as perfect as a
picture that Tony Small fielded over his shoulder crossing into the
end zone early in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With that bomb, Georgia took the lead and never lost it, but
lived dangerously, as in the LSU game, when Carter came of age. The
veteran freshman returned to his LSU form in this one, though
statistics hardly reflect it. Strangely, Kentucky gave Georgia a
whipping in every offensive department, even the ground game, and
Couch passed for almost 200 yards more than Carter. Carter, though,
was the leading runner of the afternoon with his 114 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran Derek Homer so much,'' Mumme said, ``because we thought
he might pop one.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Mumme rarely runs the ball with such frequency, and looks at
a fourth down as another offensive opportunity. In the game in
Athens last year, the Wildcats never punted. A scholarship for a
punter in the Mumme scheme is scholarship thrown to the wind.

 &HT;    Either way, Jets will pressure QB
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Jets have just 11 quarterback sacks, but
the Atlanta Falcons have to be concerned about the New York pass
rush in today's game. Monday night, the Jets sacked the Patriots
four times in a 24-14 win at New England.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (5-1) has allowed 25 sacks, and either injured Chris
Chandler or 44-year-old Steve DeBerg will be at quarterback. If
Chandler plays, the Jets (3-3) will know that one hit could send
him back to the sideline. They also know he makes the Atlanta
offense multi-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg is not as quick as Chandler and doesn't have as strong or
accurate an arm or as quick a release. With him at quarterback, New
York can load up even more than usual against the run. DeBerg can
throw the deep ball but not as well as Chandler, and he needs more
time to do it. With that in mind, the Falcons must:
</P>
<P>
   1. Find ways to protect the quarterback, especially on third
down, when Atlanta has given up 13 sacks. The biggest problem has
been linemen _ and sometimes running backs _ busting assignments,
especially on blitzes. Today, the offensive linemen need to stick
with their assignments. Period. Jets defensive coordinator Bill
Belichick will throw all kinds of blitzes at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   2. Run, run, run. Running back Jamal Anderson leads the NFC with
644 yards. Unless Atlanta falls way behind early, it should rely on
the run. Eventually, the pounding takes a toll on a defense.
</P>
<P>
   3. Throw deep once in a while. Assuming DeBerg is at
quarterback, Atlanta still will have an occasional opportunity to
go for broke. Wide receivers Terance Mathis and Tony Martin are
going to see single coverage from New York CBs Aaron Glenn and Otis
Smith almost all day, with minimal help deep from safeties as they
focus on slowing Atlanta's run game. The short passing game will
rule, but the deep pass should make a rare appearance.4. Be
prepared to play physically, especially on defense. Jets WR
Keyshawn Johnson (6 feet 3, 212) is bigger than all Falcons CBs,
and he'll probably be opposite Ray Buchanan (5-9, 195) mostly. If
Buchanan can jam Johnson at the line for half a second per play, it
will help a lot.
</P>
<P>
   5. Play gap-control defense on the line of scrimmage. Jets RB
Curtis Martin is an excellent cut-back runner. If the Falcons
over-pursue, they will pay the price.

 &HT;    NBA charity tour also attempt at resurrecting flagging
popularity
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With their negotiation apple eaten by an arbitrator
and their national public perception declining by the day, NBA
players have taken to the road to do some spin-doctoring and to
pledge their unity.
</P>
<P>
   The latest stop was the Hofheinz Pavilion at the University of
Houston this weekend, where several big name players participated
in a benefit game/public relations maneuver/expression of
suppressed talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling people we are not on strike,'' said New Jersey
Nets guard Sam Cassell. ``They think we're the ones who don't want
to play. We want to play, but we've been locked out. We played in
this game (Friday) to show we want to get the season started.''
</P>
<P>
   All the proceeds from the game _ which featured NBA all-stars
Penny Hardaway, Tim Hardaway, Juwon Howard, Antoine Walker, Kevin
Willis and 17 others _ went to M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Former NBA guard and current TNT analyst Kenny Smith helped
organize the game and said the players were eager to participate.
Even Michael Jordan tried to arrange his schedule to attend, but he
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys didn't just come to play,'' Smith said. ``It's for
the charities. The players have been locked out, yes, but that
means the charities have been locked out, too. So, it's a game to
unlock the charities. For every assist Avery Johnson makes during
the season, a charity in San Antonio gets a donation. For every
three-pointer Steve Smith makes with the Hawks, a charity in
Atlanta gets a donation. It's like that with every team. Some of
the organizations the players support survive with their donations.
That's lost in this lockout.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith emphasized that he hopes there would not be a need for a
series of benefit games around the country, but if the lockout was
prolonged, ``It's something the guys have said they'd like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The players hardly even wanted to consider forming their own
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because it's time to play basketball, and it's
always good to do something for charity,'' said Minnesota's Stephon
Marbury, the former Georgia Tech star. ``Guys are itching to play.
We don't want the fans thinking that we're not being reasonable.
We're trying to make a good deal like anyone else would.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 players left a meeting with union leadership in
Las Vegas last week pledging they were on the same page _ all or
nothing. ``We're in it until the end,'' Phoenix free agent forward
Antonio McDyess said.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop New York, Tuesday and Wednesday, where more than 300
players are expected to attend a negotiating session with
commissioner David Stern and his team.
</P>
<P>
   The owners _ who won the all-important arbitration case that did
not force them to pay guaranteed contracts during the lockout _
have to believe that once the players start losing paychecks their
resolve will wilt, and they'll bend on the major issues of the
Larry Bird exception and a hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of players seem committed to going the
distance _ for now, anyway. The first two weeks of the season have
been cancelled, with another two likely to be dismissed later this
week. Players will miss their first check on Nov. 15. That's when
their will should be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not accept a hard cap,'' said the Spurs' David
Robinson, who did not play in the charity game but was present,
along with Hakeem Olajuwon, as a show of support. ``This is
something worth fighting for, even it it means not playing the
whole season.''

 &HT;    Gordon: Race isn't over until it's won
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Jeff Gordon can win the Winston Cup championship if he
finishes 32nd or better in the last three races, or gains 12 points
on Mark Martin in today's Dura-Lube 500 at Phoenix International
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   But try telling that to Gordon, who in other years had
nightmares of things gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1995 led Dale Earnhardt by 309 with six races to go and 302
with four left, then won by 34.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1996 led Terry Labonte by 111 with four to go and lost by 37
to Labonte
</P>
<P>
   _ 1997 led Dale Jarrett by 77 points and Mark Martin by 87 with
one to go and won the title by 14 points over Jarrett and 29 over
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's certainly not over until it's
over,'' Gordon said Saturday. ``Any time there's a possibility it
can't be won then I have to look at that possibility. But, our
chances of that are maybe a little slimmer than maybe they would
have been last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he counted the reasons
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got the best car we've ever had here at Phoenix,
and I'm real excited about that,'' Gordon said. ``Then, we're going
to Rockingham and Atlanta, and it doesn't necessarily matter where
or when, we just want to win our third championship. We want to
come out of this season battling all the way hard at every race for
the win and being a contender to win unlike what we've done the
last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the crash with (Rusty Wallace) at Richmond had
anything to do with all those top fives, but I think the couple of
races after it certainly fired us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finished 37th, runninig only 372 of the 400 laps. The
next week, at Michigan, he set off a string of 17 consecutive top
fives, including eight victories.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon crew chief Ray Evernham now is ready to start the
countdown, despite last year's horrid finish down the stretch to
Atlanta - 35th at Talladega, fourth at Rockingham and 17th in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was almost comical and was embarrassing for
Gordon..
</P>
<P>
   Gordon wrecked his No. 1 car while warming up his tires leaving
pit road for practice. He then spent the rest of the day awaiting a
backup from the Hendrick shops in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to end the season with a flourish,'' Evernham said.
``I just want to be able to leave Atlanta this year with people
knowing if we did have a flaw or a weak spot, we went to work on it
and that we actually got it better and raced for it (championship).
It makes for a much better winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Both driver and crew chief are determined it will be. They
aren't done with the season. No matter what happens this weekend
with the championship or next weekend at Rockingham, they want to
be the competitor that's capable of winning here, at Rockingham and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a dream season with the number of wins (11), and
the consistency. What would cap this season off would be to stay
competitive all the way through Atlanta,'' Gordon said. ``We had a
good tire test there with Goodyear , and we're going back there
before we race there. We really want to run good at Atlanta and
close out the season that way. That, to me, would be the icing on
the cake for this season.''

 &HT;    Couch says eye was gouged
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ The Georgia-Kentucky rivalry certainly doesn't
rank among the SEC's most heated. But in the last two meetings,
both teams have accused the other of taking cheap shots.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Couch, the Wildcats' record-setting quarterback and a
Heisman Trophy candidate, accused an unidentified Georgia player of
trying to gouge his eye in the Bulldogs' 28-26 Saturday at
Commonwealth Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The play occurred in the first quarter, when Couch was stopped
on a quarterback sneak on third-and-goal at the Georgia 1. Couch
came out of the pile rubbing his eye and the Wildcats had to use a
timeout to regroup. On the sideline, Couch repeatedly wiped his eye
with a towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got his finger in my eye,'' Couch said. ``I guess he tried
to rip it out. I couldn't get my arms up because they were laying
on me. It was a pretty cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch said he couldn't identify the player, but when asked if he
thought the incident was intentional, he replied, ``Oh, yeah.
Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Georgia officials sent video tapes of its 23-13 win
over Kentucky in Athens to the Southeastern Conference. The
Bulldogs were upset about two late hits by Cats defensive tackle
Mark Jacobs, who allegedly hit Dogs offensive tackle Chris Terry in
the knees after a play in that game.
</P>
<P>
   Couch said his vision remained blurry for a while Saturday, but
it didn't stop him from completing 34 of 46 passes for 326 yards
with two touchdowns and a pair of interceptions.

 &HT;    East Lake club, community both revitalizing
 &HT;    By Hollis R. Towns
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When developer Tom Cousins bought the historic East
Lake Country Club in 1993, the 85-year-old Tudor-style clubhouse
had fallen into disrepair and the fairway looked more like a
worn-out softball field than a legendary golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Five years and $25 million later, East Lake has been restored to
its former glory and will host the nation's top 30 money winners on
the PGA Tour during the Tour Championship this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins' commitment didn't stop at the private country club. He
became a partner in the revitalization of the declining East Lake
neighborhood, including the East Lake Meadows housing projects,
across the street from the country club where he regularly golfs.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as ``Little Vietnam'' because of frequent shootouts,
open drug dealing and squalor, East Lake Meadows has been
transformed by Cousins and the Atlanta Housing Authority into a
mixed-income community of townhouses, trails and a lake wrapped
around a $6 million public golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition of the high-rise housing project and restoration
of the golf course made famous in the 1920s by golf legend Bobby
Jones has caused property values in nearby neighborhoods to soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can drive through the neighborhood and see, feel, hear and
touch what has been done,'' said Gregory J. Giornelli, executive
director of both the East Lake Community Foundation and the C.F.
Foundation, which are charged, respectively, with revitalizing the
neighborhood and managing the golf club. Both are owned by Cousins.
</P>
<P>
   But change hasn't come without hardship. Remaining residents of
the East Lake Meadows housing project are threatening a lawsuit to
halt the final phase of the development, which calls for more
townhouses, duplexes and the remaining nine holes of the public
golf course, because of disputes with Cousins and AHA over
temporary housing.
</P>
<P>
   Residents contend that Cousins and AHA have violated a 1995
contract with them to build temporary housing for residents whose
old apartments were demolished in the reconstruction. Those
temporary units were never built, and rather than move elsewhere in
the city, or take subsidized rent vouchers, residents want to be
allowed to move temporarily into existing units in the new
community set aside for public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins and AHA have refused, saying the new phase needs to be
``stabilized'' with permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was supposed to be a partnership, but in the end, that's
not what it turned out to be,'' said Eva Davis, an AHA board member
and president of the tenant association at East Lake Meadows. ``We
are not going to let Cousins and Atlanta Housing run over us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few argue with the short-term success of the
redevelopment. Nationally, Cousins and AHA are being hailed as
visionaries whose public-private partnership has transformed a
dying neighborhood. The catalyst was the renovation of the East
Lake Country Club, which is open only to corporate members.
</P>
<P>
   The C.F. Foundation owns the golf club, and some of the proceeds
from one-time $50,000 membership fees are plowed back into the
community in after-school programs, job training and
adult-education classes. Money also was raised to build the Charlie
Yates public golf course at East Lake, Giornelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this thing has been this successful this early
has been amazing,'' Giornelli said. ``We are thrilled.

TREMORS FELT IN LA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Vin Scully will return as voice of the Los Angeles Dodgers ...
we think.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is certain anymore in Chavez Ravine, not after a year in
which the O'Malley family sold the club to empire builder Rupert
Murdoch, the general manager (Fred Claire) was fired, two managers
(Bill Russell, Glenn Hoffman) were fired, the franchise player
(Mike Piazza) was traded, the team fell out of contention, and even
its fabled spring training complex, Dodgertown, apparently is on
the way out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are taking their first steps toward restoring
stability, hiring Kevin Malone, the former Expos GM who was Pat
Gillick's right-hand man in Baltimore, to be general manager, and
naming Davey Johnson as the new manager.
</P>
<P>
   Even the process of hiring a manager was tainted by the rebuffs
of Jim Leyland, who elected instead to accept a three-year, $6
million deal from the Colorado Rockies, and Felipe Alou, who chose
to remain with Montreal after the notoriously cheap Expos gave him
Leyland money to stay. But Malone will be given a free hand _ and,
more importantly, a generous budget _ to pursue the players he
feels can restore prominence to a team that hasn't won a playoff
game in a decade, a record that's beginning to rival the Red Sox'
for postseason futility.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will make a major run at Mo Vaughn, who they feel
would solve their need for a lefthanded hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need lefthanded bats,'' Malone said Friday at Dodger
Stadium, where Johnson was introduced as manager. ``We're
right-hand dominant. We do not have a balanced lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone had keen interest in Vaughn even for the Orioles, who
talked last fall to the Red Sox when it appeared Boston might trade
Vaughn. But Baltimore owner Peter Angelos wasn't willing to commit
to the kind of money that it would have taken to keep Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won't have that problem. They will, however, have to
clear roster space for Vaughn by trading righthanded-hitting first
baseman Eric Karros, and clear payroll space by unloading Bobby
Bonilla, who clashed with Johnson in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla almost certainly will be traded, although reports that
he is being sent to the Mets for disappointing reliever Mel Rojas
apparently are premature. A potentially worrisome situation could
develop with Gary Sheffield, who said he doesn't want to play left
field, nor does he want Bonilla to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has never been considered a ``West Coast guy,'' but one
of his close friends last week said the first baseman for at least
the last couple of years has had a place in LA and enjoys it there.
``It's not like he owns a house out there or anything,'' the friend
said, ``but he's always kept a place to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, meanwhile, brings impeccable credentials as a winner
and baggage as someone who could be difficult to deal with,
especially for the front office. But Malone, who worked with
Johnson in Baltimore, knew up front what he was getting, and he's
happy with the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put together a World Series championship
club,'' Malone said at Johnson's press conference.
</P>
<P>
   They're expecting nothing less in LA.
</P>
<P>
   ____ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   They're still sweeping the confetti out of the Canyon of Heroes,
where the Yankees paraded Friday after completing their season for
the ages, but no one should doubt that there will be changes for
the Bombers next season. Remember after they won the World Series
in 1996? Closer  &UR; John Wetteland  &LR; left as a free agent, signing with
Texas,  &UR; Jim Leyritz  &LR; was traded to the Angels, making room for
 &UR; Jorge Posada &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and one free agent lefty ( &UR; Jimmy Key &LR; ) was
replaced by another ( &UR; David Wells &LR; ). The Yankees are expected to
keep World Series MVP  &UR; Scott Brosius &LR; . Center fielder  &UR; Bernie
Williams  &LR; may be less than 50-50 to stay, though his ties to  &UR; Buck
Showalter  &LR; and Arizona may be exaggerated; a National League
executive said Colorado is a more likely destination.  &UR; David Cone
 &LR; becomes a free agent if he doesn't exercise his contract option,
and catcher  &UR; Joe Girardi  &LR; and outfielders  &UR; Tim Raines  &LR; and  &UR; Darryl
Strawberry  &LR; are all eligible, too ... In Baltimore,  &UR; Frank Wren
 &LR; becomes the latest alumnus of the Montreal front office ( &UR; Dave
Dombrowski &LR; , &UR; Dan Duquette &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Malone) to fill another club's general
manager vacancy. Wren, 40, served ably as Dombrowski's assistant in
Florida, an association that not everybody looks upon favorably.
``The only thing I know about Frank Wren is he helped dismantle the
Marlins,'' said Orioles reliever  &UR; Jesse Orosco &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who, kidding
aside, also spoke to the uncertainty in Baltimore, where there are
nine players eligible to become free agents. Angelos has said that
outfielders  &UR; B.J. Surhoff  &LR; and  &UR; Eric Davis  &LR; would be re-signed, but
both turned down contract extensions during the season. The biggest
question surrounding Wren is the degree of control he will have as
a first-year GM, when  &UR; Pat Gillick &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who had one of the best track
records in the game, was frequently vetoed by ownership, which led
to his departure after the season ... Give the Mets credit for
their preemptive strike to re-sign catcher  &UR; Mike Piazza  &LR; before he
filed for free agency. Piazza is about to become baseball's
highest-paid player, reportedly agreeing to a deal that will pay
him an average of at least $13 million for the next seven years.
Piazza will give Vaughn's agent,  &UR; Tom Reich &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a fat target at
which to aim ... The Mets also appear on the verge of re-signing
lefthander  &UR; Al Leiter  &LR; to a four-year, $32 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will have plenty of company in their pursuit of The
Big Unit,  &UR; Randy Johnson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; when he files for free agency. The
Astros will make an attempt to keep him, but the bidding is
expected to go beyond their ceiling. The Indians, whose lack of a
No. 1 starter is exposed every October, plan to make a run at him,
and the Rangers and Dodgers are potential players ... Still unclear
are the Blue Jays' intentions regarding ace  &UR; Roger Clemens &LR; . Until
the ownership situation and budget levels are established, GM  &UR; Gord
Ash  &LR; cannot say with certainty that Clemens will remain a Blue Jay.
Obviously, the Jays want to keep him ... The Padres, who are
expected to make re-signing pitcher  &UR; Kevin Brown  &LR; their No. 1
offseason priority (four years for at least $40 million, for
starters), appear likely to lose pitching coach  &UR; Dave
Stewart &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has made it clear he'd like to become a general
manager someday. Stewart reportedly has offers from both the A's
and Blue Jays to join their front offices. He was a staff ace for
both clubs ... The excitement the Padres stirred in San Diego by
making it to the World Series may pay off at the ballot box.
Surveys show that Proposition C, a measure that would use public
funds to pay 70 percent of a $411 million project to build a new
ballpark, is favored to pass, and that support for the measure grew
during the postseason. The Padres have pledged that if the measure
passes, they will remain in San Diego at least until 2024 and
spearhead an effort to drum up private investment to revitalize the
downtown neighborhood for which the ballpark is intended ... No one
who was there will soon forget the scene in Qualcomm Stadium after
Game 4, when Padres fans remained in their seats roaring for a
curtain call from their favorites, who returned from the clubhouse
waving, throwing balls into the stands, and thanking fans for their
support ... The Padres are expected to attempt to re-sign first
baseman  &UR; Wally Joyner &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but third baseman  &UR; Ken Caminiti &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
played hurt all season and was banged up beyond recognition during
the World Series, and outfielder  &UR; Steve Finley  &LR; may be allowed to
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about reforming the system of assigning umpires
to the postseason and placing the men in blue under a central
authority, such moves face major obstacles. For one, the umpires
have a formidable union and a contentious leader in  &UR; Richie
Phillips &LR; . For another, there may be contractual constraints in the
umpires' agreement with Major League Baseball that would prohibit
changes in working conditions. For the immediate future, at least,
it appears that umpires will continue to be supervised by the
respective league offices ... Fired Colorado manager  &UR; Don
Baylor &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who rejected an offer to become  &UR; Lou Piniella's  &LR; hitting
coach in Seattle, has an offer to fill the same role for  &UR; Art Howe
 &LR; in Oakland, but is still considering owner  &UR; Jerry McMorris's
 &LR; invitation to remain with the Rockies as a vice president.
McMorris has said he would like Baylor to work first with minor
league director  &UR; Paul Egins  &LR; in revamping the farm system. ``He has
a lifetime of friendships and respect in the game that are very
valuable,'' McMorris said ...  &UR; Marge Schott's  &LR; agreement to sell
her controlling interest in the Cincinnati Reds shouldn't affect GM
 &UR; Jim Bowden &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who recently signed a long-term contract extension.
But it does raise questions about the future of  &UR; John Allen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
was appointed managing executive of the club when Schott was
suspended and has generally earned high marks for his performance.
Allen's job is guaranteed only until Dec. 31. If Schott's shares
are bought by some of the team's limited partners, it would seem
that Allen would keep his job. But if an outside party buys the
club, Allen could be out ... For years, the Giants have been
denying that  &UR; Barry Bonds  &LR; could be had in a trade, and this winter
is no exception. The Giants say there's no truth to speculation
that Bonds could be going to the Braves with closer  &UR; Robb Nen  &LR; for
outfielder  &UR; Ryan Klesko  &LR; and starting pitcher  &UR; Denny Neagle &LR; . Bonds
should still be a Giant, GM  &UR; Brian Sabean  &LR; said, when the team
begins play in its new downtown ballpark. ``I fully expect him to
be in uniform and contribute as he did the last couple of years,''
Sabean told reporters last week. ``Obviously, he's our left fielder
and star player, and that's what you need when you want to go
forward and open a new stadium. We hope to be in position to build
around him, and that's what we're trying to do.'' As a 10-5 player
(10 years in the major leagues, at least five with the same club),
Bonds has the right to veto any deal.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While the Giants did not pick up the $3.2 million option on
 &UR; Orel Hershiser's  &LR; contract, they'd have interest in bringing back
the 40-year-old righthander for less money. ``If the money's not
ridiculous, I'd like to come back,'' Hershiser said ... With his
four wins in the playoffs, Wells is now tied with  &UR; Bob Gibson  &LR; and
Hershiser for the longest postseason winning streak at seven. All
of Gibson's wins, of course, came in the World Series _ in 1964,
1967 (two against the Red Sox), and 1968 ... Thank you,  &UR; Mark
McGwire &LR; : &UR;  &LR; The Cardinals already have received 5,000 requests for
1999 season tickets. At this time of year, they usually have around
500 ... Unless they're blown over by an offer, the Royals are
likely to keep  &UR; Kevin Appier  &LR; until spring training, so that teams
can gauge whether he's fully recovered from the shoulder surgery
that sidelined him for almost all of 1998. A healthy Appier at that
time would almost certainly net more in trade than he would now.
Duquette has already made his pitch ... There's usually one
injustice in the Gold Glove voting, and this year was no exception.
 &UR; Mickey Morandini  &LR; of the Cubs probably deserved the award at
second base, although it was easier to accept  &UR; Bret Boone
 &LR; receiving the nod because Boone has been jobbed in each of the
last two seasons. But Seattle first baseman  &UR; Diego Segui &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
made just one error, and Red Sox outfielder  &UR; Darren Lewis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
did not make an error while playing center field, both deserved
trophies ... The Braves and Pirates reportedly have made inquiries
about Boone's availability ... If Vaughn goes, the Red Sox may
inquire about first baseman  &UR; Paul Konerko &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was the 1997 Minor
League Player of the Year but a washout with the Dodgers before
going to the Reds in the  &UR; Jeff Shaw  &LR; deal.

TIGHT RACE MAY HINGE ON LOOSE LIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the closest, best-financed, and most
politically crucial Senate races of the year may be decided by the
question of which slight offends more people _ Charles Schumer not
showing up for a vote on a Holocaust memorial, or Alfonse D'Amato
using a Yiddish vulgarism to label Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem strange that this race, between two candidates who
differ so dramatically on the key issues of the day, is coming down
to a pair of ethnic soundbites.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why not? The 30-second spot is the main form of
campaigning in this media-drenched state. New York politics,
especially in New York City and its suburbs, have always been
driven by the clash of ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, the three-term Republican incumbent, and Schumer, his
Democratic challenger who has served in the House for as many
years, are in as tight and nasty race as might be imagined _ even
by the standards of D'Amato, whose races are always tight and
nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Just before their first formal debate, scheduled for Saturday
night, and with 10 days until the election, all polls show them
tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a war that will be won by inches,'' said Henry
Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant. ``So, it's
hand-to-hand combat over each and every inch.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has poured $15.3 million into the campaign. Schumer has
nearly matched him, spending $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has come here to campaign for Schumer. First
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has visited twice. Both are scheduled
to make at least one more fund-raiser before Nov. 3. In a year when
five Democrats may lose their Senate races _ bringing the
Republicans close to the 60-seat majority needed to block a
Democratic filibuster _ Schumer is the most likely candidate to
topple a sitting Republican.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato is not just any Republican, but the king of New York
State's suddenly thriving Republican Party. Knocking out D'Amato
would punch a large hole in the party's entire apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, when campaigning here, have painted the contest as
one of pure principle. Schumer helped write the Brady Bill on gun
control, favors the right to abortion, has voted with the labor
unions and for increases in education. D'Amato, on all these
issues, has usually voted the other way.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has emphasized different themes. He has voted for tax
cuts, aid to upstate New York, and _ true to his nickname,
``Senator Pothole'' _ brings home the federal bacon to any
constituent who asks. Schumer has voted otherwise on these issues
and, as a House member in the minority party, lacks the clout to
provide D'Amato's largesse.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, D'Amato commercials started stressing that
Schumer has missed a lot of votes lately _ more votes in the past
12 months than D'Amato has missed in the past 12 years. Schumer
explained he was campaigning for the Senate seat in a hard-fought
Democratic primary; and, anyway, most of those votes were
procedural.
</P>
<P>
   Still, D'Amato's tactic worked. Schumer stayed in Washington,
rather than come home for a $1 million Clinton fund-raiser, in
order not to miss a vote on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato went further two weeks ago, telling a group of Jews that
Schumer missed a vote to install a Holocaust exhibit in the Capitol
rotunda _ suggesting, D'Amato asserted, that Schumer is insensitive
toward Jewish issues.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange charge. Schumer is Jewish and lost relatives in
the Nazi death camps; D'Amato, though very active for Jewish
causes, is Catholic. Stranger still, Schumer let the charge roll
off his back, dismissing it as ``silly,'' but little more.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last Wednesday, while speaking to 40 Jewish supporters,
D'Amato referred to Schumer as a ``putzhead,'' a Yiddish word often
used to describe a fool.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was outraged. Sheinkopf said Schumer may have recalled
the 1992 Senate race, when the last Democratic contender, Robert
Abrams, called D'Amato a ``fascist.'' D'Amato angrily accused
Abrams of indulging in a racist slur that likened all
Italian-Americans to Mussolini. D'Amato won the race by one-half of
one percent.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato then made the mistake of denying to a TV reporter that
he ever used the word _ even though several of his Jewish
supporters who were in the room confirmed he did. Within 48 hours,
Schumer incorporated the TV footage of D'Amato's denial into a
commercial, with the punchline, ``New Yorkers can't trust Al
D'Amato.'' It fit a longstanding tagline in Schumer's ads:
``D'Amato _ too many lies for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   This twist may already be having an impact. A survey by pollster
John Zogby shows Schumer's lead among Jews growing in recent days _
though Zogby warned that the number of Jews in the poll was so
small, nothing can be reliably concluded.
</P>
<P>
   However, D'Amato's lead in the suburbs of Long Island and
Westchester County also dwindled considerably _ from a margin of 26
points to just 6 points. Sheinkopf attributed the decline to the
vulgarism.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby is less sure, but he agreed the remark could shift votes _
among not just Jews but many others who might see such language as
``un-senatorial.'' In the same speech, along these lines, D'Amato
referred to Representative Jerrold Nadler, an overweight New York
Democratic congressman, as ``Jerry Waddler.''
</P>
<P>
   It has long been assumed Schumer would win big in New York City,
D'Amato would win big upstate, and the contest would be decided in
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato also seems poised to win 35 to 40 percent of Jews in the
city and suburbs _ a very large percentage for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   If ``putzhead'' and ``Waddler'' cut into his strength among
either group, it could throw the match Schumer's way.

LAST CHANCE FOR QUIGLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only the PGA Tour allowed money to be transferred between
family portfolios, all would be well with the Quigleys. Dana, after
all, could easily spare a couple thousand, which would come in
handy for nephew Brett. But in the capitalist world of pro golf,
it's every golfer for himself or herself, and you are judged by
your numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For Brett Quigley, the numbers that matter most are 128, 6,133,
and 69. As in 128th on the money list, $6,133 out of the 125th and
final spot for full exempt status, and the 3-under 69 he put up
Friday to make the cut in the final full-field event of the season.
He is where he was a year ago, sweating things out, crunching
numbers, envisioning all sorts of scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``A serious case of deja vu all over again,'' said Brett. ``But
I've had my chances not to be in this position'' _ this week's stop
at Walt Disney World is his 29th start of the season _ ``so I can't
complain.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Brett Quigley finished 128th, just $7,250 out of the
125th spot. In the final event of 1997, he finished tied for 23d
and earned $16,560 in Las Vegas; two shots better and he would have
cracked the Top 125. As it was, he returned to the final stage of
Tour School but failed to secure full exempt status that way, so
1998 has been another year of jumping into tournaments late via the
alternates list, and basically living a more anxious lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   His uncle is in Hawaii this weekend, a week removed from his
second Senior Tour win of the year and third in 15 months. Dana
Quigley continued his storybook season last Sunday when he needed
just 23 putts in the final round (13 one-putt greens) to shoot a
closing 64 at the Raley's Gold Rush Classic in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In the gallery were his children from his first marriage,
14-year-old Devon and 17-year-old Nicole, making the win even
sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest thrill of my life,'' said Dana, who boosted his
earnings to $1,062,445, fifth on the money list behind guys named
Hale Irwin, Gil Morgan, Larry Nelson, and Jay Sigel. Not bad
company for a club pro who spent years driving the back roads of
New England to play in tournaments with $5,000 purses.
</P>
<P>
   A millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a nice ring to it,'' he said. ``It's all happened so
quickly. Having played every week, I haven't had any time off to
reflect on it, but every week has been like Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   Literally, it is Brett who is at Disney World, though it may as
well be Sunday at the US Open, considering the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the (cut) number would be 1 under, maybe even,'' said
Brett, who had opened with an even-par 72. ``I knew when the wind
started blowing that scores would be high and I knew what I needed
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the glory of golf is that a player determines his or
her own destiny, but it's hard in this situation, said Brett, not
to ``watch with one eye to see who is doing what.'' So it was noted
that the players at 120 (Franklin Langham) and 121 (David
Sutherland) just made the cut at even par, as did No. 123 (Blaine
McCallister) and No. 127 (Brett's fellow Rhode Islander, P.H.
Horgan 3d). Those at 124 (Tommy Tolles) and 129 (Mike Brisky)
joined Brett at 3 under, No. 126 (Mike Weir) was 1 under, while
Nos. 122 (Mike Springer) and 125 (Dave Stockton Jr.) missed the cut
and probably their chance at full exempt status next year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palm and Magnolia courses in the land of Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck, supermen like Tiger Woods, David Duval, and Davis Love
were at work trying to add some more pocket change. The Brett
Quigleys of the PGA Tour were dealing with more realistic thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need two rounds under par,'' said Brett Friday night. ``I
played well today, but my tendency has been to make the cut, then
let down. I've got to stay a little more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   He shot 71 Saturday, so consider his mission half-accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   A finish like last year at Las Vegas would be nice, but, then
again, it also depends on what those just ahead of him and those
just behind him do. Scoreboard watching. It's OK in baseball, but
not in golf, so Brett tried to put such thoughts out of his mind
and get back to more pressing business _ an air hockey game against
two of Brad Faxon's three daughters. It is, after all, Disney
World, where fun and games reign supreme. For Brett, how much fun
will be determined by how much game he delivers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Some people want to debate Player of the Year on the PGA Tour.
Sorry, but the case is closed:  &UR; Mark O'Meara  &LR; is it. To pick anyone
else is foolish. O'Meara won the Masters and the British Open,
played well at the US Open, made a valiant charge at the PGA, then
capped off a brilliant season by beating Woods in the World Match
Play Championship last Sunday. You cannot call them major
championships on the one hand, then dismiss them as equal to the
Michelob Championship or Shell Houston Classic on the other. Duval
won those events, as well as the World Series of Golf and the
Tucson Chrysler Classic, and he will win the money title and
probably the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average, too. And
chances are, he'd trade his pile of chips for the green jacket, a
Claret Jug, and a place in golf history _ all of which belong to
O'Meara, the Player of the Year ... It wasn't that long ago that
Duval was just another promising face in the Nike Tour crowd. Given
his smashing success in a relatively short time, you can understand
why so many players are writing out checks for $4,000 to go through
PGA Tour Qualifying School. First-stage competition was recently
held at 13 sites around the country and perhaps the most notable
miss was  &UR; Brad Elder &LR; , the former NCAA champion who left the
University of Texas early to jump into pro golf. The ultimate
journeyman,  &UR; Andy Morse  &LR; of Needham, did not advance, nor did
former New England Amateur champ  &UR; John Curley &LR; , &UR; Matt Hall  &LR; of
Brockton,  &UR; Rich Parker  &LR; of Lebanon, N.H., and  &UR; Jeff Dantas  &LR; of
Seekonk. Among the New Englanders who met with success at
first-stage competition was  &UR; Billy Downes  &LR; of Hampden, medalist at
Dayton Valley CC in Nevada, just ahead of  &UR; Warren Schutte &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the
former NCAA champ who honed his game for a few years at Pleasant
Valley. Another PV guy,  &UR; Fran Quinn &LR; , easily moved into the second
stage, as did  &UR; Peter Morgan  &LR; of Harwich,  &UR; Phil Smith  &LR; of
Chelmsford,  &UR; Jamie Neher  &LR; of Weston,  &UR; Marc Spencer  &LR; of Haverhill,
 &UR; Jason Caron  &LR; of South Yarmouth, Rhode Islanders  &UR; Brad Adamonis
 &LR; and  &UR; Rod Butcher &LR; , &UR; Joe Cioe  &LR; of New Hampshire, and  &UR; Mike Flynn &LR; ,
who grew up in Rochester, N.H., but played at Southern Methodist.
 &UR; J.J. Henry &LR;  of Connecticut, the former standout at Texas Christian
who stormed to an impressive win at the New England Amateur at New
Haven CC in July, had a strong qualifying start, shooting 7 under
to finish tied for fifth at Magnolia Greens in Leland, N.C. ...
 &UR; Geoff Sisk &LR;  of Marshfield had an outside shot at avoiding
second-stage pressure, but an 81-81 start at this weekend's Nike
Tour Championship virtually assures that he won't finish in the Top
25 on the money list, which brings a free pass to the third and
final stage. Sisk entered the weekend 35th ... What has been a long
and often unbearable season is coming to an end for  &UR; Casey Martin &LR; ,
who had to play in a glaring spotlight as he rode through the Nike
Tour in his cart. He won the first event of the year, then beat the
PGA Tour in court for the right to use the cart. He showed flashes
of talent, but mostly he struggled mightily, and entering the Tour
Championship he was 27th on the money list. An 82-83 start left him
in last place through 36 holes (there is no cut in this
season-ending event), and a spot in the second stage of Q School
beckons ... The Presidents Cup matches are some six weeks away, but
the US team suffered a blow last week when  &UR; Jumbo Ozaki &LR;  _ the
world's most overrated golfer _ reportedly told team captain  &UR; Peter
Thomson &LR;  that he would not compete for the International Team ...
Check it out: No. 253 on the Nike money list is  &UR; Pedro Martinez
 &LR; with $810.

   When they gathered last week for the 64th New England
Intercollegiate Golf Championship, more than 240 players were
treated to typical New Seabury weather (windy) and a predictable
finish (the University of Rhode Island won). It was an impressive
performance by coach  &UR; Tom Drennan's  &LR; Rams, who have not lost
against New England competition since the spring of 1997. URI
nailed down the top three spots and its 570 total was a tournament
record. Central Connecticut finished second, at 312. For Drennan,
the highlight was the shootout between  &UR; Justin Thompson  &LR; and  &UR; Jim
Salinetti &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the 1997 Mass. Amateur champion from Stockbridge. The
two talented Rams had opened with 69 and 66, respectively, so
Salinetti was a group behind Thompson in the Tuesday finale.
``(Salinetti) had a birdie putt lip out at 18 that would have tied
Thompson,'' said Drennan, who was on the course watching the drama
unfold in 25- to 35-mile-per-hour winds. Thompson finished 70_139,
Salinetti 74_140, with teammate  &UR; Josh Hillman  &LR; of Greenfield third
at 143. A three-player group tied for fourth at 148 included URI's
 &UR; Michael Sims &LR; , who next month will represent Bermuda in the World
Amateur Golf Championship in Santiago, Chile ... Clear across the
country, another local is getting a taste of big-time collegiate
golf.  &UR; Ned Yetten &LR; , a freshman from Andover, cracked the lineup at
Stanford for the first time, playing in a tournament hosted by the
University of Nevada-Reno. While Yetten played No. 5 and did not
score well, coach  &UR; Wally Goodwin &LR;  came away impressed with the
former MGA Junior champion. ``He's going to get stronger and has
started to understand that it's more than hitting golf balls; it's
moving it around the course. He's a typical freshman, adjusting to
a lot of changes, but he's a great kid _ composed and determined.''
... In that tournament, MGA Player of the Year  &UR; Justin Peters &LR;  of
Pembroke, a fifth-year senior at Nevada-Reno, shared medalist
honors with rounds of 68-72-72 ...  &UR; Robert Coco  &LR; of Foxborough
picked a great time to record a hole-in-one. It came during a
charity tournament in memory of  &UR; Brian Saegh  &LR; at Foxboro Country
Club and earned Coco a Ford Expedition that had been donated by
Jack Madden Ford of Norwood ... Finally, some bittersweet news from
 &UR; Arnold Palmer &LR; . He is nearing the end of a second round of
radiation to treat his prostate cancer, just as another family
battle looms with the illness: He reported Thursday that his wife,
 &UR; Winnie &LR; , has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. This Wednesday at
9 p.m., The Golf Channel presents a two-hour documentary, ``Arnold
Palmer: Golf's Heart and Soul.'' Narrated by  &UR; John Forsythe &LR; , it
traces Palmer's career from childhood to stardom. The sport has had
better players but never a greater gentleman.

LARGE VALUE IN SMALL BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Over the next two Sundays, Doug Flutie will play the most
important football games of his NFL career. What he does against
the Carolina Panthers and Miami Dolphins could determine his future
in the league. If he continues to lead the Buffalo Bills to
victory, it will be Rob Johnson's biggest nightmare and a big
headache for Buffalo coach Wade Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie turned 36 this week, riding the crest of two weekends of
miracles, the kind that have become familiar to the multitude of
admirers of the legendary Boston College and Canadian Fooball
League star.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie Magic was not supposed to work in the NFL. He was
considered to be a midget magician without a wand in the best
league in the world. But Flutie never accepted that, although he
did opt for Canada, where he became a six-time MVP and made a good
living.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with the CFL floundering, Flutie rejected a $1
million deal in a league few people were following and signed with
the Bills for a minimal salary plus incentives based on things he
would very unlikely see _ starts and victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills showed no more confidence in the former Heisman Trophy
winner than any of the NFL teams that had rejected him in the past.
After trading their first- and fourth-round draft choices to
Jacksonville for Johnson, a 25-year-old quarterback who had started
exactly one NFL game, the Bills immediately anointed Johnson their
starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie acknowledged that he found this surprising, but he said
little. Instead, he waited for his chance. And he prepared. When
Buffalo signed Johnson to a long-term deal in August that included
a $8.5 million bonus, Flutie still said nothing. He waited and he
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   His first chance came in the season opener against San Diego.
Replacing Johnson, who suffered a concussion in the second half,
Flutie did what he has always done: He took advantage of the
situation, leading the Bills to two touchdowns and a 39-yard field
goal attempt that could have won the game as time expired. When
Steve Christie missed on his attempt, fans in Buffalo were quick to
write it off as just another Bills loss. In New England, some were
thinking that Flutie should have been allowed to kick the field
goal himself.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson at quarterback, the losing continued against Miami
and St. Louis, and the Bills' upset of the 49ers was more
attributable to San Francisco penalties than significant
improvement in Buffalo's offense. Again, Flutie waited. And
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when Johnson went down against Indianapolis with
the point of a football jammed between his ribs and a 300-pound
Colt lying on top of him, the Bills were trailing, 9-0. By the time
Flutie was finished, they had won, 31-24. But, to the skeptics, it
was only the Colts. Everyone beats the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Flutie said little. But now he would prepare to start in
the NFL for the first time since 1989, and this time it wasn't
against the Colts. Last Sunday, with Johnson's ribs still sore, the
powerful Jacksonville Jaguars came to Buffalo thinking they would
still be undefeated entering Sunday's game against the Denver
Broncos. They left talking about Flutie, and now so is everybody in
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie beat the Jaguars the way he has beaten so many teams _
with his arm, with his legs, and with his head. He beat them with
everything he has, because that's what you have to do when you're a
5-foot-10-inch Lilliputian in a land of giants.
</P>
<P>
   It was fourth and goal at the 1 with time almost expired. The
Bills had tried and failed to score three times after Flutie's long
completion to Eric Moulds had put the ball on the 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth down, the Bills wanted to do the conventional thing:
They would send Thurman Thomas sweeping left. But, when Flutie took
the snap, Thomas ran the wrong way. Flutie reacted immediately,
faking a handoff to a plunging Thomas before rolling left on a
naked bootleg for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Across the field, Flutie's former quarterback coach at BC,
Jacksonville head coach Tom Coughlin, threw his headphones down,
later saying, ``Naked bootleg? What was naked about it? Everybody
in the stadium knew he was going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Bills didn't know it, and neither did Flutie until the
moment came. When it did, he seized it, and if he does likewise in
the next two games, Flutie will have Buffalo in the palm of his
hands and Phillips on the horns of a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   How can Phillips bring back Johnson, who the team said is
injured more severely than thought and would not be ready for
Carolina tonight and probably not for Miami Nov. 1 in Buffalo? How
does he sit down Flutie if the Bills win tonight at Carolina and
then upset the team they hate the most, the Dolphins?
</P>
<P>
   Flutie Mania has been reborn in Buffalo. The weather isn't so
bad in Buffalo, the fans say, and Doug isn't so short. He's a
winner and so are we: That's what Flutie Mania means to the good
people living on the cold edge of Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Since that touchdown scramble, Logo Athletic and Champion
Sporting Goods have been unable to supply enough Flutie replica
jerseys in Buffalo stores. And Flutie Flakes, the
not-particularly-good-tasting cereal with Flutie's picture on the
box that helps raise money for autistic children, is selling more
like hotcakes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the lagging race to sell $11 million worth of new
club seats by Dec. 1 to force a five-year extension of owner Ralph
Wilson's stadium lease has taken off. Since Flutie beat the
Jaguars, sales have averaged 100 a day. No one doubts it's because
of Flutie Fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flutie thing has exploded into something huge,'' says
longtime Bills beat writer Vic Carucci, who admits to having penned
a column that said Flutie couldn't be a success in the NFL. ``It's
a phenomenon. The fire for the Bills had banked the last few years
in Buffalo but Doug has energized the town. The genie is out of the
bottle, and I don't know if they can put it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Flutie the greatest quarterback in the NFL? No. Does he have
the most talent? No.
</P>
<P>
   Does he win games?
</P>
<P>
   Going into tonight's nationally televised game with the
Panthers, Flutie's NFL teams are 19-8 in games in which he has
played, and he is 10-5 as an NFL starter.
</P>
<P>
   What more does a guy have to do?
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Lions rookie quarterback  &UR; Charlie Batch  &LR; has seen the
NFL Films video of Minnesota wildman  &UR; John Randle  &LR; screaming at
him, ``Hey, Charlie! Hey, Charlie!,'' on various highlight shows,
but he has little recollection of it from their first meeting five
weeks ago. But now that he's the Lions' starter, Batch expects to
hear plenty from Randle Sunday at the Silverdome. ``I heard him a
couple of times, but with him screaming and the Metrodome crowd
behind him, I mean, I couldn't hear myself, let alone John
Randle,'' Batch said. ``I knew he did it a couple of times, but I
didn't think he did it as many times as he did. The crowd was so
loud, I couldn't hear myself think.'' Thinking, however, is the key
to surviving the quarterback's job, Batch believes. While he said
he understands the kind of pressure that has made  &UR; Ryan
Leaf &LR; , &UR; Kerry Collins &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Tony Banks  &LR; crack this season, he
knows one way to avoid it. ``Just don't let the outside world
confuse you,'' Batch said Wednesday ... The 49ers paid a lot of
money to free agent cornerback  &UR; Antonio Langham  &LR; in the offseason,
and Langham has been killing their beleaguered defense since his
arrival. He was finally replaced last Sunday by  &UR; Marquez
Pope &LR; , &UR;  &LR; bad back and all, after twice being scorched for long
touchdown passes. Langham's mind is so bent by what's been
happening to him that he was seen changing his shoes three times on
the sidelines during the Colts game. As one NFL personnel guy said,
``It ain't the shoes that are the problem; it's the feet in the
shoes.'' ... Where does the NFL get off saying teams can't talk
with 49ers director of football operations  &UR; Dwight Clark  &LR; and
personnel director  &UR; Vinny Cerrato  &LR; when both are working without a
contract? ... Colts president  &UR; Bill Polian  &LR; said recently that
rookie quarterback  &UR; Peyton Manning  &LR; has a core of people to whom he
can turn when times got tough, and that he is among them. Polian
pointed out that everyone needs such support when times are tough,
as they have been for Manning early in the season. Asked whom the
president of the Colts could turn to in such dark days, Polian
laughed and said, `` &UR; Marv Levy &LR; .'' Polian and Levy were together
with the Chicago Blitz of the US Football League and then built the
Bills into the great team they were during their four Super Bowl
appearances ... Although Manning has been a human turnover machine
(14 interceptions), he is far from the reason the Colts are 1-5.
They are 25th in the league in rushing, averaging 93 yards a game _
despite the presence of  &UR; Marshall Faulk  &LR; _ and were the only team
without a rushing touchdown until last weekend. Plus, they have the
worst defense in the NFL against the run, allowing 168.6 yards a
game.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Just wondering why I haven't heard lately from those BC alums
who complained this summer about references to the brittleness of
Jets quarterback  &UR; Glenn Foley &LR; . He's now 1-7 as a starter and was
replaced by  &UR; Vinny Testaverde  &LR; three weeks ago because of sore
ribs, continuing his streak of injury problems. ``His whole thing
is, can he stay out there?'' said Jets coach  &UR; Bill Parcells &LR; .
``That's been a problem for him his whole career. Can he stay out
there and be feeling good? I don't know any more about that today
than I did a year ago.'' ... Here's how  &UR; Dan Marino's  &LR; former
teammate, Jets linebacker  &UR; Bryan Cox &LR; , &UR;  &LR; looks at the aging Miami
quarterback: ``His body is 38, but his arm is still 22. He still
has the best arm in the league. You can have a guy double-covered
and see the ball sail over your head. He's gonna throw the ball
where he wants to throw the ball.''... How's this for drafting?
Both of the Panthers' original first-round picks _ Collins and
cornerback  &UR; Tyrone Poole &LR;  _ &UR;  &LR; are gone, and 1996 pick  &UR; Tim
Biakabutuka  &LR; is a third-string running back who has yet to carry
the ball this season ...  &UR; Brad Johnson  &LR; (broken leg) won't be back
in the Vikings' starting lineup until at least next weekend, but
you couldn't blame Minnesota coach  &UR; Dennis Green  &LR; if he tells
Johnson to take his time coming back.  &UR; Randall Cunningham  &LR; has come
on like gangbusters in replacing Johnson, compiling an NFL-high
121.3 quarterback rating, with 12 TDs and no interceptions ...
Don't ask me why, but the NFL recently signed LPGA player  &UR; Danielle
Ammaccapane  &LR; to wear the colors and logos of the NFL team
representing the city in which she is playing on a given weekend.
She is the first female athlete to be endorsed by the league ... If
 &UR; Dan Footman  &LR; does not get much play during next winter's free
agency period, it will be interesting to see whether he tries to
challenge the Colts' decision to put him on injured reserve for the
year. Footman believes that was done because he chose to have his
own doctor, rather than the team physician, perform his knee
operation. Footman believed he could be back in a month, but the
Colts did not agree and iced him for the year ...  &UR; Neil Smith  &LR; is
three sacks away from 100 for his career, but he's not likely to go
over the top this weekend against Jacksonville because the Jaguars
boast two of the best offensive linemen in the NFL in  &UR; Tony Boselli
 &LR; and  &UR; Leon Searcy &LR; .

PATRIOTS FEEL DEPLETED, BUT NOT DEFEATED

   MIAMI _ Rumor has it that Shawn Jefferson was being transported
to Florida in a padded crate. Silly, you say?
</P>
<P>
   If he were your only healthy veteran receiver with more than a
day and a half of game experience, wouldn't you protect him?
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson has probably never felt as loved as he has this week.
</P>
<P>
   He watched as Vincent Brisby was fitted for a hand cast to
protect his broken right index finger. He has seen Troy Brown on
crutches, walking in a cast half the size of his body after
suffering a severe ankle sprain in last Monday night's game against
the New York Jets. He saw Terry Glenn clutch his right hamstring
right before the end of Wednesday's practice. All of that left
Jefferson as the only household name among a receiving corps that
includes Tony Simmons, Anthony Ladd, and Tony Gaiter for Sunday's
AFC East battle with Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A twist of irony: The only time in Jefferson's eight-year career
when he was hurt was opening day of the 1996 season against these
very Dolphins, when he suffered a concussion. The next week, he
missed a game for the first time in his NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   After practice Friday _ a workout in which he did not
participate _ Glenn said he was hopeful that his hamstring would
feel well enough for him to play. But even if he did, he wouldn't
be at full strength, and the last thing the Patriots want is for
his injury to be exacerbated and keep him out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   And so, under sunny skies with temperatures in the 80s, the
Patriots will look for a ray of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tests the character of this team,'' said special teams
captain Larry Whigham, ``to have three receivers go down the last
two weeks, to have your starting fullback (Tony Carter) go down,
and possibly your starting defensive end (Willie McGinest). But we
have a lot of weapons on this football team. That's why we are a
good team, because we're deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge now is for Drew (Bledsoe) to spread the ball
around. We have a lot of guys who can catch the football. It's also
going to test the character of our defense and our special teams,
because we have to carry a little bit more of the load.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, what had been a well-tuned offense must now find a new
way to score with completely different personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll said at the end of the week, ``We're not
going to change our game plan,'' but how can he not? In Carroll's
most wonderful dream, Ladd catches a couple of touchdown passes,
then Simmons shows off his blazing speed and beats Terrell Buckley
down the sideline for the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, Robert Edwards rushes for 157 yards and scores three
touchdowns as the Patriots control about 35 minutes of the game
clock with their running game.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing says that can't happen. But it seems the Patriots'
defense must do Sunday what it attempted to do at the end of last
season: win the game on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had similar problems last season, often playing
without Glenn and Curtis Martin. Now, they are missing Glenn,
Carter (knee surgery), Brown, and Brisby, and have a center (Dave
Wohlabaugh) playing with a cast on his left hand, which makes it
difficult to run-block.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a strong chance that their highest-priced
defensive player, McGinest, will be kept out by a left groin
strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough to overcome, but we have to step up,''
said Patriots linebacker Chris Slade. ``Not only will the young
guys who step in have to do the job, but we're going to ask a lot
of the older guys like Shawn and Ben Coates to step up and possibly
do more. Derrick Cullors is going to have to fill in and do more.
Defensively we have to pick up the slack for our offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most adverse situation I've ever been in.
Adding to it is the fact we have to go into Miami, which is a tough
place to play anyway, with these circumstances. But it is a great
challenge for us and we'll have to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullors can relate to what Simmons, Ladd, and Chris Floyd _ who
will step in for Carter _ are being asked to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the guy who had to step in and start for Curtis
Martin,'' said Cullors. ``I had to not think too much and go out
and trust my ability. It was like they told me: `Go ahead and
start, kid.' It's a big challenge for you. It's the big leagues and
it's going to tell the team if you are the type of player the team
thinks you are.''
</P>
<P>
   The advice he'll give the three youngsters is ``the main thing
they have to do is relax. They can't be doing anything out of the
ordinary. Trust your talents and go out and do what you've done in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is down,'' said Whigham. ``Not at all. It happens in
this league. It's a chance for us to respond.''

DEMOCRATS' PLAN FOR HOUSE: LEAN RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   EVANSVILLE, Ind. _ With little fanfare, Democrats have put
together the most conservative group of US House candidates in
memory, setting up an important block of races that pit a centrist
or conservative Democrat against a Republican who holds many
similar views, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether you can out-Republican the
Republicans,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg. ``The
Democrats have concluded that in a conservative district, you run a
conservative. There are no liberals running anymore'' in such
contested races, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic strategy, which responds to the nation's overall
shift toward conservatism as well as President Clinton's effort to
include within the party many moderate and rightward-leaning ``New
Democrats,'' is especially important because so few races are
considered competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 435 House members, 402 are running for reelection. Of
those, at least 392 are likely to be reelected, according to Amy
Walter of the Cook Political Report. That leaves fewer than four
dozen competitive races, with just 26 considered highly
competitive, Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, with Republicans holding a majority of only 11 seats, the
contest for control of the House probably will come down to a
handful of tight races from Pennsylvania to Washington in which the
Democrat runs well to the right of center, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no better place to observe this trend than here
along the Ohio River Valley, where campaigns for four key
congressional districts advertise on Evansville television
stations.
</P>
<P>
   In the race that has drawn the most attention as an indicator of
national trends, Gail Riecken has been hitting many
Republican-sounding notes, favoring tax cuts and promoting herself
as a fiscal conservative. But Riecken is the Democrat, facing GOP
Representative John Hostettler.
</P>
<P>
   The three other contests are for open seats. East of Evansville,
a former All-American basketball star named Baron Hill has become
the star of a two-year-old group called the New Democratic Network
by running as a fiscal conservative, competing against Republican
Jean Leising.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Wabash River in Illinois, Democrat David Phelps, a
popular gospel singer, highlights his conservative credentials and
promotes his anti-abortion position in his race against Republican
Brent Winters. Just over the Ohio River in Kentucky, Democrat Ken
Lucas faces Republican Gex Williams, a favorite among religious
conservatives. Lucas runs ads that tout his own conservative
credentials. ``Now we can elect a prolife Democrat to Congress,''
the Lucas ad says.
</P>
<P>
   The Riecken-Hostettler contest is living up to its reputation as
the fight for the ``Bloody 8th,'' an appellation attributed to the
bare-fisted campaign style here and the fact that the seat
regularly shifts from Democratic to Republican control and back
again.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have done well here by counting on the heavy labor
base in Evansville and the more liberal constituency in the college
town of Bloomington. Riecken, an Evansville city councilor who
easily won her primary, is running as a moderate who balances
budgets and wants to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To many, it may be disappointing that I am not'' a liberal,
said Riecken. ``But it is absolutely critical'' to run as a New
Democrat in a relatively conservative district, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, have won the district by tailoring their
social and economic positions to appeal to the many blue-collar
workers.
</P>
<P>
   At a candidate forum last week, Hostettler lectured several
hundred school students on the dangers of the national debt and
never mentioned his opponent. At a break in the forum, a school
official described the 8th District as being ``progressive and
conservative.'' When a reporter asked Hostettler to explain what
that meant, he seemed to strive for an answer that would offend
neither conservatives or progressives.
</P>
<P>
   He came up with this: ``We don't like to progress away from
things that worked in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reputation of the Bloody 8th is alive and well on the
television airwaves. As Election Day approaches, the two-term
Hostettler has begun pushing many hot-button conservative issues,
searching for ones that distinguish him from Riecken. One result is
a highly controversial ad that accuses Riecken of helping gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gail Riecken is an outright liberal,'' the Hostettler ad says.
``The gay and lesbian lobbyists have her vote already. Well,
forcing churches and schools to hire homosexuals just won't fly in
southwestern Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad refers to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which
prohibits job discrimination against gays. Riecken has said that
while she supports the principle, she wouldn't vote for it because
the community opposes it. Riecken said the ad was false and should
be withdrawn. But Hostettler defended it, saying he must ``explain
the opponent's positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Riecken, meanwhile, has responded by touting her ``common sense
Hoosier values'' and gambling that voters are fed up with the
congressional impeachment inquiry, running an ad that urges
Congress to ``legislate, not investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the overriding message to voters is that there is hardly a
great divide between the candidates. In many cases, candidates in
both parties take similar positions on crime, education, health
care, and Social Security. Hostettler and Riecken each gives his or
her own party the credit for balancing the budget and fostering a
good economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The undercurrent of this campaign is that there is a
generational and ideological change that has occurred,'' said Simon
Rosenberg, executive director of the New Democratic Network, a
political action committee created two years ago that is donating
$1.5 million to moderate- and right-leaning Democratic candidates.
Not coincidentally, most of the tight races in the country feature
candidates backed by the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have got them being tough on crime, improving education
with a definite emphasis on values and fiscal responsibility,''
Rosenberg said. ``That is not the Democratic Party of 10 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Indiana, one of the most Republican states in
the country, is a testing ground for the strength of New Democrats.
Former governor Evan Bayh, a popular Democrat and the son of former
senator Birch Bayh, has followed the Clinton blueprint for remaking
the state's party in the New Democrat mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party will gravitate in this direction,'' Bayh said. ``We
have established here that sound financial management is a
necessary prerequisite, because if you are going broke you don't
have the resources to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayh is heavily favored to win a US Senate seat with the slogan,
``A fiscal conservative with Hoosier values.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayh's opponent, Paul Helmke, is one of the few GOP candidates
in the country who has tried to make a local issue out of the
Clinton scandal. One Helmke ad features the famous video clip of
Clinton saying that he did not have sexual relations with ``that
woman,'' Monica S. Lewinsky. Then the ad seeks to link Bayh to
Clinton, citing a statement Bayh made in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The hope among Indiana Democrats is that Bayh's presence at the
top of the ticket will help party members down the line. But
Indiana Democrats worry that their party's turnout, very important
in a largely Republican state, will be low.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the 8th District, nothing is being taken for granted.
Said Hostettler: ``It will the Bloody 8th for a long time.''

NEELY'S ENDEAVOR A PAGE-TURNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cam Neely, goal scorer turned author, wishes that he'd taken
notes. Now out with his new book, ``Hockey For Everybody'' (a.k.a.
``Cam Neely's Guide to the Red-Hot Game on Ice''), the former
Bruins power forward thinks back to his first days in the NHL, when
he watched Thomas Gradin, then a fellow Canuck, keep a daily
journal of his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I'd done that,'' said Neely, asked if his literary
venture, in tandem with Brian Tarcy, might lead to another book.
``I remember seeing Thomas _ I was just 18 or 19 years old _ and
thinking, `A diary, why's he doing that? Only women write in
those.' But now, I realize there's just so much stuff you forget.
What a great thing that would have been. Everything goes so fast, a
lot of it is just kind of a blur.''
</P>
<P>
   The Neely-Tarcy venture is a fun read, a cross between ``Hockey
for Dummies'' and ``One Man's View from the Top of the Iceberg.''
There's a little NHL history tossed in, some suggested drills by
ex-Bruin Dave Poulin (now head coach at Notre Dame), and overall
enough text, pictures, and diagrams to keep the reader breezing
through a couple of hundred pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, it's for fans,'' said Neely. ``Maybe it's
that fan who's just getting interested in the game, and the one who
maybe knows a little bit, but who wants to know more.''
</P>
<P>
   Three chapters are spent on forwards, defensemen, and goalies,
with Neely offering his Top 10 lists at each position. There are
some surprises in each category, notably the inclusion of Craig
Ludwig among his top 10 blue liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd get a lot of comments about some of the choices,''
said Neely. ``And, as a fan, I might ask, `Hey, why this guy and
not that guy?' But that's what it's all about. Remember, I was out
there playing against these guys, and to my mind, a guy like Ludwig
_ the days he was in Montreal _ every time I hopped over the
boards, so did he. He's fair. He's honest. And you had to work for
all the room you got when he was out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Neely ever will get out there again, toting stick
rather than pen _ a possibility first reported here late in the
summer _ the time is approaching, he said, when he'll have to get
serious about his skating. Thus far, he has skated only a cut above
the recreation level, while upgrading his off-ice workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go out there and skate by myself, but honestly, it
doesn't tell me anything,'' he said. ``I find it a waste of time. I
think I get more out of the treadmill at (conditioning consultant)
Mike Boyle's place. At some point, I've got to get out there on the
ice and see how the hip responds to hockey drills, the turning and
the planting it takes to play the game. I'm not concerned at all
about contact. It's more the motion amd movement of the hip that
concerns me. That's where I'll be able to judge, `OK, maybe I can
do this,' or, `Hey, this isn't cutting it.'''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a comeback in his future, Neely is sure about two
things: (1) It would happen this season and (2) It would be more
than a quick hello; even at age 33, he's projecting the possibility
of two seasons or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm here thinking, `Two months and see you
later,''' he said. ``I don't want to waste anyone's time with this
and, at the moment, all I can say is, I'm feeling better but there
are still some big hurdles to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to do the crime, and you're not interested in
doing the time, just go to Canada. Witness: former hockey coach
 &UR; Graham James &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who in January '97 was convicted of sexually
abusing ex-Bruin  &UR; Sheldon Kennedy  &LR; no fewer than 300 times while
Kennedy was a teen-ager playing on James's Junior A team years
earlier in Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
   For all his depravity, James was sentenced to 42 months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, with Kennedy in attendance at the parole hearing,
James was sprung from his cell and assigned to a Montreal halfway
house. One condition: He cannot be alone with any male under age
18. And, oh, he must be back home by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   The wrist-slap punishment is nearly as sickening as the crime.
What if Kennedy had been female, a teen-aged girl abused over and
over and over again? The guess here is that the sentence would have
been 20 years or more, with no ``get out of jail free'' card issued
after some 22 months of good behavior. It should have been nothing
less for James, who at his hearing made note that his actions
brought ``unwelcome suspicion on conscientious coaches around the
country ... I betrayed my role as a guardian of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, who cares about the game, the country, or even the good
guys who are coaching hockey? They honor themselves with their
day-to-day actions and, in most cases, ask for little in return,
except maybe a decent coffee machine tucked in the corner of some
exhaust-filled rink.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is Kennedy, whose mother wept when James noted in
his contrition that parents tell their children to do what the
coach tells them. Now 29, Kennedy struggles every minute of his
life to forget the atrocities foisted upon him by his one-time
mentor and coach.
</P>
<P>
   The travesty is the Canadian court system, which blew its chance
to send a message about child predators. This wasn't about hockey.
This was about ruining lives, splintering souls, stealing
innocence, and smashing trust to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple of weeks into the new season, it's clear what
1998-99 will be for Bruins fans: hockey's version of a spacer. A
spacer is the nonalcoholic beverage of choice during a night on the
town that keeps one from lining up in City Hall Plaza in November
for the imminent Cup parade. To wit: beer/diet cola/beer/diet
cola/beer/diet cola. Diet cola is the spacer in this equation. It
keeps you from euphoria (if waking up with a lampshade on your head
and a spoked-B painted on your chest is your idea of nirvana).
</P>
<P>
   Last year's mini-revival was the Bruins' beer year. They paid
the two kids they had to pay _  &UR; Joe Thornton  &LR; and  &UR; Sergei Samsonov
 &LR; _ and some good vibes began to rumble again on Causeway Street
when everyone was focused on a team that would grow together and
prosper through the years.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, the front office opted not to sign any impact
free agents, went to arbitration armageddon with  &UR; Dmitri
Khristich &LR; , &UR;  &LR; then hemmed and hawed over giving  &UR; Jason Allison
 &LR; market rate, and played the lowball lullaby with  &UR; Anson Carter
 &LR; and  &UR; Kyle McLaren  &LR; (both last seen packing for the IHL).
</P>
<P>
   The message to head coach  &UR; Pat Burns &LR; : &UR;  &LR; This time, try even
harder, big fella, even if that means wringing an ounce or two out
of  &UR; Landon Wilson  &LR; or  &UR; Randy Robitaille &LR; . The message to Bruins
fans: Don't expect more than last year; and if there is more, feel
grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tight-fisted Oilers, run by ex-Bruin  &UR; Glen
Sather &LR; , &UR;  &LR; got into the overpay game. Last week, they ended  &UR; Doug
Weight's  &LR; holdout with a two-year deal worth nearly $9 million. The
game's spiraling economics now dictate that legitimate franchises _
let's not count the expansionists, OK? _ must pay what the market
dictates as going rate, if the fan base is going to take the team
seriously, believe in it, pay to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Carter looks like a reliable No. 6 or 7 forward _ not much more
_ and that makes him worth $800,000 or more per year (less than his
agent last requested). McLaren is a No. 3 or 4 defenseman, worth
some $2 million by today's deals, maybe 50 percent more on a
three-year pact. Boston's offers have been slightly better than
half of McLaren's market rate.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that these guys make too much can go on _ and will
go on _ forever. Of course they do. But that discussion is
pointless. That's like arguing that paying $38 for a steak in
Manhattan is too much. Don't like it? Then shut up, go to Boise,
and pay $3.99 for prime rib.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins aren't paying McLaren or Carter because they can
finish somewhere close to last year's mark without them. They paid
Allison because the preseason made it painfully obvious that they
weren't going to score better than 1.4 goals per game without
someone to activate the offense. Without him, they had a sure
ticket to the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins may go nowhere even with the likes of McLaren and
Carter in their lineup. But at least they have that chance to do
something, a reason for their fans to believe, hope, dream. Without
them, they're a team that will make .500 a six-month rallying cry
(break even or bust, yahoo!) and the playoffs (if) a mere
formality. That's the message to the fan base. And until everyone
gets the message, spacer seasons like this one will never drop out
of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Hard to fathom the constant skepticism surrounding the
two-referee trial. Of course it's going to make the game better. If
everyone shooting holes in it would spend their time worrying about
their own games, their own coaching, their own management skills,
the rest of the game would be much better off, too ... Who would
have thought that Colorado, of all franchises, would be deadlocked
last week with San Jose as the NHL's last two winless franchises?
The Avalanche desperately need some chemistry, something they lost
in the dishing away of  &UR; Chris Simon &LR;  and  &UR; Mike Ricci  &LR; and the loss
of  &UR; Mike Keane  &LR; in free agency. Boston University's  &UR; Chris Drury
 &LR; has provided a little offensive pop, but the Avalanche need some
leadership from their core elite _ guys like  &UR; Patrick Roy &LR; , &UR; Joe
Sakic &LR; , &UR; Peter Forsberg &LR; , &UR;  &LR; even  &UR; Claude Lemieux  &LR; _ that they're not
getting. It's too easy to blame the malaise on rookie coach  &UR; Bob
Hartley &LR; . Someone has to step up, and fast. Drury, by the way, is
flying with Forsberg and  &UR; Adam Deadmarsh  &LR; as linemates ... In St.
Louis, ex-No. 1 draft pick  &UR; Doug Wickenheiser  &LR; is back battling
cancer. Ex-Blues teammate  &UR; Brett Hull &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now in Dallas, cleaned out
his closet before leaving town and left behind memorabilia,
appraised at $250,000, for auction later this year. The Golden
Brett has earmarked the dough for a trust fund, The Fourteen Fund,
to benefit Wickenheiser's kids ... The Islanders still don't have
 &UR; Ziggy Palffy  &LR; in the lineup. If they're not going to pay him, then
why not sell the asset (the way the Oilers essentially sold  &UR; Wayne
Gretzky  &LR; to the Kings)? Meanwhile, the Islanders drew a measly
3,000 to Uniondale for their Wednesday game with the Oilers _ the
night the Yankees clinched another World Series. More crowds that
size, and they'll have no choice but to sell Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Weight, by the way, made an immediate splash, putting up three
assists in his first two games. He has led the Oilers in scoring
for five years running _ admittedly with a couple of low totals:
74, 40 (lockout season), 104, 82, and 70. But it's not as if he's
been surrounded by the Flying Frenchmen up there ... Busy for
months now looking for a goalie, the Canucks may have found him
right in their own net. Wrentham's  &UR; Garth Snow  &LR; pocketed a 2-1
victory in Washington on Wednesday, the Canucks' first win over the
Capitals in almost six years. Rumors still persist, however, that
the Canucks will end up with  &UR; Felix Potvin  &LR; from the Maple Leafs in
a swap that would send  &UR; Pavel Bure  &LR; to Toronto (rejoining
ex-Canucks coach  &UR; Pat Quinn &LR; ). Also, don't rule out the Canucks
trying to pry  &UR; Mike Richter  &LR; from the Rangers. Remember, they made
him a free agent offer over the summer. If the Blueshirts keep
scuffling, they'll have to make some deals ... Great to see Scotty
Bowman back behind the Red Wings bench (he debuted Friday),
following offseason knee replacement and angioplasty ... No
surprise, but Neely's new book does not waste space on Messrs.
Lemieux or  &UR; Ulf Samuelsson &LR; . ``We took those chapters out,'' kidded
Neely ... Gotta like the way  &UR; Colin Campbell  &LR; came out of the gate.
The Lords of the Boards wanted a cleaner game, cutting down on the
risk of concussions, and Campbell, the league's new top
disciplinarian, has handed out the appropriate suspensions for
shots to the head ... The Ilitch family, owner of the Red Wings,
has opened a bar in Detroit called The Five Hole. I've got my idea
who the bouncer should be. Hint: I'm thinking, oh, of a technicolor
sign over the doorway ...

UNITED FOOTHOLD ABOUT TO BE CHALLENGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All Major League Soccer teams were created equal,
but the Washington D.C. United have evolved must faster than the
rest. The United have clinched playoff spots with a month remaining
the last two seasons, and in postseason play they are 14-2, with
only one loss in regulation time.
</P>
<P>
   This is a credit to the two-time champion's management and
coaching but also a condemnation of other teams. The United have
seldom been pressured in winning the Eastern Conference, though
they were extended to three games by Columbus in the conference
finals this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's MLS Cup championship should present a difficult
test. The Western Conference champion Chicago Fire, the league's
best example of spontaneous creation, are among the few teams with
the experience to present a credible challenge to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago definitely deserves to be in the championship,''
United coach Bruce Arena said. ``They are probably our most
difficult opponent in the finals in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two (MLS Cup) games were entertaining but they were
sloppy, because of the conditions. This time we will be on a good
soccer field, and you will see some good play. To me, scoring is
not an indication of a good game _ it's players attempting to play
good soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena seldom pulls punches, and his arrogance often intimidates.
But he has seemed slightly disarmed by the presence of Fire coach
Bob Bradley, his former assistant with the United and the US
Olympic team, and once a rival in the collegiate game. He defended
Bradley's defensive tactics, which frustrated Los Angeles in a
two-game conference final, as Chicago outscored the Galaxy by a
total of 2-1. That eliminated not only the Galaxy but also an
estimated 40,000 prospective fans from Sunday's attendance. The
Rose Bowl is expected to be at about half-capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can attack and they can defend as well as anybody in the
league,'' said Arena. ``I'm sure there are 10 teams who would like
to be here, so I don't think (Chicago) played too defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Arena and Bradley tied their fortunes to exceptional
foreign players in the midfield choreographer's role. The United
have Marco Antonio Etcheverry, a 27-year-old Bolivian who led them
to the '96 and '97 MLS titles and Barcelona to the Ecuadorian
championship in the MLS offseason. Chicago has Peter Nowak, a
34-year-old Pole who formerly played at TSV 1860 Munich in the
German Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches were able to compile a strong supporting cast to
complement the star players. Arena built the pressuring defense
around Carlos Llamosa, a former Colombian professional who was
working as a janitor and playing for teams in New York, and US
national team members Jeff Agoos and Eddie Pope. The goalkeeping
and right back positions have been inconsistent, but 23-year-old
Tom Presthus has emerged at goalkeeper and Tony Sanneh has filled
in on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone _ including former US national team captain John
Harkes, Richie Williams, and strikers Roy Lassiter and Jaime Moreno
_ is complementary to Etcheverry, the MLS most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago lacks depth, and Polish striker Roman Kosecki is
expected to play only a half because of a hamstring injury. ``I am
only about 50 percent now, but I'll be 100 percent by game time,''
Kosecki said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley followed the MLS plan to match the team to the
predominant ethnicity of a city, though league administrators would
have preferred more of a Mexican influence. Nowak was recommended
by Shep Messing, a former New York Cosmos goalkeeper, and Bradley
was astute enough to follow the trail to Kosecki and Jerzy
Podbrozny. After Bradley discovered Czech Republic sweeper Lubos
Kubik, he changed the defensive scheme and added two-time
Revolution defender of the year Francis Okaroh and 23-year-old C.J.
Brown as markers.
</P>
<P>
   Kubik, 34, a former teammate of Roberto Baggio and Dunga at
Fiorentina, is considered too slow for top-level European play, but
he has solidified the Fire with his positional play and lethal free
kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an expansion team but we are not rookies,'' Okaroh
said. ``We've been in championship games before. If you want to
call yourself the new champions, you've got to beat the old
champions.''

 &HT;    In sensitive Ohio race, scandal issue is muted
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When the topic in a recent radio debate between the
two congressional candidates here turned to impeachment, there was
little difference in the answers.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry by the House Judiciary Committee ``must be objective
and fair and impartial,'' said Democratic challenger Roxanne
Qualls, the mayor of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Steve Chabot, who is a member of the committee,
said, ``It's important that we not rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Qualls had let pass an opportunity to join a handful
of Democratic candidates around the country in criticizing the
GOP's handling of the impeachment inquiry against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her choice may be understandable in the midst of a hard-fought
race in a district that is evenly divided between Republicans and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Qualls has chosen to wage the campaign on clear
distinctions between the candidates on budgetary issues, health
care, education and abortion, a debate Chabot has welcomed even as
he has wondered why Qualls is not more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would be more aggressive if I were in her
position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision also has prompted second-guessing from Democratic
supporters who believe Democratic voters would respond to
suggestions that Republicans have been too partisan in their
treatment of the impeachment issue, particularly since Chabot sits
on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roxanne has been reluctant to use that issue,'' said Donald
Mooney, a Cincinnati lawyer who has been active in Democratic
campaigns. ``To me, it's a persuasive argument, but it's also a
risky one in a city where the newspapers have kept up a steady
drumbeat against Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Mooney and David Little, another Democratic activist, said they
believe the risk is worth taking because Qualls needs to make a
persuasive case for why Chabot does not deserve a third term in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot and Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.) are the only Judiciary
Committee members in competitive races for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Watt faces what may be his toughest test with voters, because
his district has been changed to comply with court rulings that
limit the use of race as a factor in drawing congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The new boundaries of Watt's district have reduced the
African-American population of what had been a majority black
district to 33 percent. Nearly half the new district consists of
North Carolinians who had been represented by someone other than
Watt.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Watt's favor are a large financial advantage,
newspaper endorsements and a lack of unity among Republicans.
Dentist Scott Keadle, the GOP nominee, defeated more conservative
candidates in the primary, and has so far been unable to win over
some backers of his vanquished opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Judiciary Committee members will not return next year.
Democrat Charles Schumer of New York and Republican Bob Inglis of
South Carolina are running for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the committee will depend on the relative
strength of each party in the next Congress. The current split of
21 Republicans and 16 Democrats is slightly more favorable to
Republicans than their overall numbers in the House, where they
control 228 out of 435 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The local Democratic Party in Cincinnati, which unveiled a new
brochure to appeal to African-American, believes there are votes to
be won by highlighting the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with photographs of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and
Nelson Mandela are these words: ``Friends stand with friends.
President Clinton needs your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, is not on the Nov. 3 ballot. But Rep. Jesse
Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.), who appeared with Qualls at a Democratic
rally Saturday, stressed that voters in this election would help
determine Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders ``would have you believe this election is
about how the president got his groove back,'' Jackson said. ``This
election has everything to do, not with private sex, but public
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chabot's district is 30 percent black, and African-Americans
have been among Clinton's most ardent defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said Democrats are going to stay home,'' local
businessman Steve Reese bellowed to 200 Democrats who turned out on
a bright morning. ``Is that true?''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd shouted its reply: ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   Chabot, who used to serve in the city and county governments, is
making his pitch to the Republican base in what is expected to be a
low-turnout election.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot, greeting fans at a Catholic high school football game
Friday night, welcomed the good wishes of hundreds of people who
seemed to know him or some member of his family personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in the right place. You've got our vote,'' was a common
refrain among the football fans in the heavily Catholic,
blue-collar area of Cincinnati, where Chabot himself played high
school football nearly 30 years ago.

CALL THIS BAND THE MIAMI GROUND MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all seems backward now in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, you could count on what you'd find there every
fall. In an uncertain world, there was at least one thing you could
rely on this time of year: The leaves would fall from the trees in
New England and footballs would fall from the sky in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But no more.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Dan Marino's career is turning from autumn to
winter, and No. 13 hands off as often as he throws. The world is
upside-down today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at tape of them and you pinch yourself,'' said
Patriots secondary coach Ron Lynn last week after watching hours of
Ma-rino handing the ball to backs with no names, even the one with
three names, Karim Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not sure it's the same team you thought it was. You
check the jerseys and the colors are the same and you check the
helmets and the fish is the same and you check No. 13 and he's the
same, but he's handing off a minimum of 25 times a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to get ready for Dan to throw the ball, thinking you
just had to contain their run and worry about him. Now you have to
stop their run and worry about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson promised when he first came to Miami that he would
change the way the Dolphins did their business. He said they would
play defense and run first, but he found they didn't do either very
well, and so things stayed the same. For two more years, Dan Marino
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, when even the San Francisco 49ers ran the ball more
than they passed it, Marino threw more than 500 passes for the 10th
time in his career. He threw them for a team that was bounced out
of the playoffs as soon as it got in, and he threw too often to the
wrong team, and so Johnson wasn't happy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fired his longtime associate, pass-happy offensive
coordinator Gary Stevens, and elevated a running backs coach, Kippy
Brown. The message was clear. Stevens had been the quarterbacks
coach, the guy who always threw the ball first. Brown watched men
run for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one believed it would change for long. Not in Marino's
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Then the season opener in Indianapolis came and No. 13 threw
only five times in the second half of a 24-15 victory and the
transformation had begun. Four times this season, Marino has thrown
fewer than 30 times. Four times the Dolphins have won. Twice Marino
has thrown more than 30 times, both times the Dolphins lost. To
quote the guru of the gridiron, Bill Parcells, ``You don't have to
get hit in the face with a dead skunk three times to know it
stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Dolphins want to run the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   They do it for the best of reasons. They do it to try to win.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, in a boring 14-0 victory over the St. Louis Rams
that lifted them into a tie with the Patriots atop the AFC East
with a 4-2 rec-ord, the Dolphins passed the ball six times in the
second half while holding it for nearly 10 of the game's final 15
minutes. They rushed for 141 yards, the fourth time this season
they topped 100, and would have gone over 200 were it not for two
questionable penalties that cost them 84 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Four is the same number of times they topped 100 all of last
season. Once again, the message had been delivered: Johnson is
going to win his way in Miami and his way is the highway, not the
flyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a much more basic offense than we were in the past,''
Marino said. ``We don't do as many elaborate things as far as
protection and as far as some of our pass patterns and reads and
things. The passing game is much more basic than what we're used
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed some. You always want to score as many
points as you can, but in the second half now we like to control
the football and not put a lot of pressure on our receivers or on
throwing it. It's a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   A little different? That's like saying painting the golden dome
of the State House purple would make things around Boston Common a
little different. It's like saying the Red Sox leading the American
League in stolen bases would be a little different.
</P>
<P>
   Shortage of receivers
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino has 45 pages devoted to him in the Dolphins' press
guide. Nowhere does it mention that he hands off well.
</P>
<P>
   He has 45 pages because he has passed for 55,416 yards. He has
45 pages because no quarterback has passed for as many yards or
thrown for as many touchdowns or had more 3,000-yard passing
seasons or needed fewer games to reach 30,000 yards passing (114)
or 40,000 yards passing (153) or 200 touchdown passes (89) or had
more seasons with 20 or more touchdown throws. He has 45 pages
because Dan Marino has passed the football better than anyone in
history.
</P>
<P>
   So why is there an emphasis on the past tense of pass these days
in Miami? Why does Johnson insist that Marino keep handing off to
people less dangerous than himself? That's in the press guide, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of Marino's 55,416 yards, 8,475 of them went to a receiver named
Mark Duper and 8,468 more of them went to Duper's teammate of 10
years, Mark Clayton. They both left Miami six years ago. The next
most prolific receiver is O.J. McDuffie, who is still with Marino.
He arrived in 1993 and has caught 2,775 yards worth of passes. He
hasn't replaced either of the Marks brothers and neither has anyone
else, and that, more than Johnson's philosophy or NFL defenses, is
what has grounded Marino's air force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any quarterback would like to have consistency at the
receivers from one week to the next, from one year to the next,''
Marino said. ``You used to have that in this league but now not as
much. People are moving around and we have been experimenting the
last couple of years with different people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be that way for a while until we get more
consistent. You just have to adjust to it the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, at age 37, they tell you to hand the ball off. And so
you do.
</P>
<P>
   Things change.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of No. 13, you think throwing the football,''
said Lynn. ``Dan still does it great, but with all the zone rushes
and the receiver changes he's had over the course of time, running
the ball has become a critical factor for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've thrown fewer times with less success this year than in
the past but they've had good control of the clock and they haven't
turned the ball over as often, and they've established a standard
of toughness with the way they try to run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan can still zing it. He just doesn't have the same set of
circumstances now. He doesn't have Clayton and Duper.''
</P>
<P>
   No, he has McDuffie and Oronde Gadsden, a combination that
doesn't particularly strike fear in the hearts of defensive backs.
McDuffie is a productive receiver who can be dangerous at times.
Gadsden wasn't even in the 560-page Miami media guide when it was
published. Behind those two stands Lamar Thomas, who in five full
seasons in the NFL has averaged just a little more than one catch
per game.
</P>
<P>
   Marino has no Clayton to make acrobatic catches, no Duper to
press a defense deep and make it sweat. He also has no Yatil Green,
who was supposed to become the next Clayton or Duper last year but
fell victim to knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Green is on injured reserve this year, the same place he was
last year. He can't run, so the Dolphins must.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems weird to say it, but first you've got to stop the
run,'' said Patriots linebacker Chris Slade. ``You sort of want to
force Dan to throw. For so many years the coaches used to beat it
in your head _ `We've got to stop Dan Marino!' _ that it's
unbelieveable to be saying that. It's an adjustment, but they've
got a balanced attack now, not Duper and Clayton.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have concluded that Marino can't throw the way he used to.
They have whispered that his arm strength isn't what it was and
that a basically immobile statue has grown even more set in stone
in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick
Jauron would like to know who was wearing Marino's number two weeks
ago when the Dolphins fell behind and had to do it the old way.
</P>
<P>
   That day Marino completed 30 of 49 passes for 323 yards and two
touchdowns, and it was like the old days. Footballs filled the air.
Defensive backs reached for Prozac, not Gatorade. Jauron reached
for Excedrin and six defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Marino made them all sweat but, in the end, the Dolphins lost.
</P>
<P>
   And so they ran 32 times last Sunday against St. Louis while
Ma-rino threw only 26 times. They controlled the ball for 9:58 of
the final 15, crunched out yards and first downs on the ground and
won, 14-0, holding their lead with the legs of Abdul-Jabbar and
rookie John Avery rather than on the strength of No. 13's arm.
</P>
<P>
   A throwback game?
</P>
<P>
   Today, when the Patriots square off with Miami and Marino at Pro
Player Stadium to fight for supremacy in the AFC East, that is how
the Dolphins will try to win again. They will throw when they have
to but run when they can.
</P>
<P>
   They will use a huge offensive line built like the one Johnson
had in Dallas. They will run two tight ends more than anyone in New
England is used to seeing in Miami. They will motion that tight end
to the middle and use him or 242-pound fullback Stanley Pritchett
to wham-block the interior of the defense time and again to create
running room between the tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, they will have No. 13 hand off as much as they can.
The only thing that could turn back the clock is if Drew Bledsoe
and New England's offense can turn up the heat on the scoreboard
lights; but with their own corps of healthy receivers down to Shawn
Jefferson, seldom-used rookie Tony Simmons, practice squad refugee
Anthony Ladd, and just signed ex-Patriot Tony Gaiter, that seems
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   So what will Marino do? As often as possible, he'll try to get
out of Abdul-Jabbar's way while the Patriots move eight men into
the box at the line of scrimmage and dare the most prolific passer
in NFL history to throw to his own corps of little-known receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Not many expect that Marino will be allowed to accept that
challenge very often. But one old hand who has seen Marino throw
for too many yards for too many years believes, in the end, that
things may not have changed as much as people say.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Clay has watched the tapes and seen the handoffs and all
of that. But, in the end, he says things are not always what they
appear, even in Johnson's Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Marino is still the key to stopping the Dolphins,'' the
Patriots free safety cautioned. ``To stop the Dolphins, you've got
to stop Dan Marino. They can run it 35 times a game, but that's all
they're doing. Just running to run. We get a lead on them and all
that running is for naught. They'll win with him throwing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing better defense so they can run more and hold
the score down and use up the clock, but he's the same guy he
always was. If anything has changed, it's the talent around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still competitive as hell. He just doesn't have the same
faith in the guys around him. They've made changes in what they do,
but the change is not in Dan Ma-rino. It's in the rest of their
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan can still zip it. It's unfortunate to see a guy who's had
the kind of career he's had go through what he's had to lately
because he's not doing what he really wants to do. If running helps
them win, he's all for it. But you better never forget one thing.
Dan Marino is a passer.''
</P>
<P>
   The best passer ever _ even on the days when someone tells him

&HT;    DIPLOMATIC MINUET LED TO AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a designations) (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS   AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most intensive diplomatic effort of Bill
Clinton's career took place amid shaded country paths and
sun-splashed terraces, dark libraries and attic offices decorated
with Halloween cobwebs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mideast peace conference that finished Friday mixed tense
confrontations and tender moments. One pivotal 24-hour period, for
example, started with Israeli diplomats threatening to leave and
loading their suitcases into US government vehicles _ and climaxed
with an emotional dinner speech by a 62-year-old king debilitated
by cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I was on my deathbed, I would come for peace,''
Jordan's King Hussein told Clinton, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu,
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after an extraordinary nine days, President Clinton
prevailed with charm, perspicacity, mastery of minute details, and
occasional comic relief. Clinton also resorted to promises of
money, something that American presidents of this century have used
far more than military power to get their wishes overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton had something more important than money: He had the
weight of his office. Americans may say the office has been
tarnished by a sex scandal, but a presidential visit overseas
carries great heft, especially for people such as the Palestinians,
who yearn for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, participants said, Clinton and other US
negotiators privately made a decision during a stalemate on
Wednesday: The president would offer to make a historic trip to
Palestinian-controlled Gaza. While there, he would watch as
Palestinian officials revoked all the clauses of a charter calling
for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple gambit, and it worked. The Israelis, who had
balked at making concessions to Palestinians until the 26
anti-Israel clauses were publicly rebuked, plunged back into the
last round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The ``mini-summit'' took two days longer than the talks at Yalta
at the end of World War II. Although the goals of the Wye River
negotiations were modest, success was not assured. The players were
recalcitrant, bitter, even hateful. During the entire time on
Maryland's Eastern Shore, Arafat, the former guerrilla, and Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, the former general, barely made eye
contact and never shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   The deal Clinton put together was very much the same agreement
his top aides had proposed for 18 months, but this time it was
delivered after at least 77 hours of the president's time.
</P>
<P>
   What took place at the pastoral conference center was classic
diplomacy, filled with arm-twisting, entreaties, and long nights of
cigar smoking by a president and prime minister who don't quite
trust each other _ and for face-to-face meetings between two
regional leaders who trust each other even less.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In grenade attack, a warning
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Americans insisted that only the State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, would be allowed to speak for
the parties, and he would limit his comments to procedural matters
so the diplomats could do their work unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted less than two days. Early on the afternoon of
October 17, a Saturday, in Hebrew and Arabic, the Israeli and
Palestinian spokesmen quickly complained of slights and broken
promises by their opponents, just in time for the evening news back
home.
</P>
<P>
   A battle of spinning and counterspinning had commenced. The most
interesting thing, the participants said, was its inaccuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The participants agree that a frustrating stalemate had settled
in that Saturday and again Sunday, when Vice President Al Gore
joined Clinton at the 1,000-acre retreat. No one wanted to budge on
the most basic issues: the Israelis demanded an end to broken
promises that the Palestinians would pursue terrorists; the
Palestinians demanded that Israeli troops finally begin
withdrawing, as previously agreed, from 13.1 percent more of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things looked pretty bleak,'' one of the Americans involved in
the talks remembered Saturday. The president, he said, spoke to the
Israelis and Palestinians with an air of resignation, saying,
``Maybe we ought to recognize that this isn't going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was letting the two parties know they would be worse off
on their own than they were with American mediators. It didn't save
the day, but discussions continued.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Monday, Prime Minister Netanyahu awoke to learn
that a Palestinian had thrown a grenade into a crowded bus station
in southern Israel, injuring more than 60 people. Clinton used the
attack as a warning, saying that ``the whole thing,'' meaning the
faltering peace process, was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   No one disagreed. Gradually, an innovative and risky deal took
shape to let the CIA oversee Palestinian police investigations of
terrorists and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton returned to Wye Plantation for a briefing
with Secretary of State Madeleine K. &UR;  &LR; Albright, National Security
Adviser Samuel R. Berger, Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, and CIA
director George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   In discussions with Netanyahu and Arafat that started at 8 p.m.
and stretched through the night, Clinton went through an
``inventory'' of the issues being debated. It was the first time
all proposals had been considered together, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged his guests to settle some disputes quickly and
``reserve the harder ones for later,'' Ross said. It was a key
moment, he said, because the president showed that each side could
compromise without giving up too much.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``No going back''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Palestinians got an earful from Israeli Trade
and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky, who has a special stature
because he advocates the peace process. But Sharansky said that
even Israeli doves needed a sign of good will from the
Palestinians: a renunciation of the anti-Israel clauses of the
Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a wrenching experience in our society,'' in
surrendering land for peace, Sharansky said, according to an
observer. ``We know that we've crossed over and there is no going
back. Now we need to see the equivalent on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   In a private meeting earlier that day, Clinton, Albright, and
Ross had come up with the idea of offering the presidential visit.
The Americans used a poker tactic: They held the ace but they
didn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it in our back pocket,'' one of the Americans said.
Just to get things going, Clinton talked vaguely of a ``joint
appearance'' sometime with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Israelis threatened to leave because the
Palestinians wouldn't budge on the charter. Although news reports
suggested the American hosts were anxious, members of the
delegation dismissed the whole incident as an obvious ``ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Netanyahu was requesting that their US hosts organize
transportation to the airport, an Israeli delegation was working
out complicated wording of a document with American legal experts.
``Do you really want to have this kind of a discussion?'' one of
the Americans teased. ``Aren't you going to miss your plane?''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, amid the distractions, the Israelis came up with a
plan: What if Clinton would personally watch as the Palestinian
legislators voted to annul the offending parts of their charter?
</P>
<P>
   It was the same idea the Americans came with the day before,
their ace.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans smiled.

NAVY RALLIES PAST BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowly and sorrowfully, Boston College's football team trudged
off the field at Alumni Stadium Saturday, heads bowed. Their
despair was readily apparent as the Eagles, tears streaming down
their cheeks, filed through the narrow portal that led to their
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The mood around The Heights was funereal after BC squandered a
28-10 fourth-quarter lead and suffered a stunning 32-31
nonconference loss to Navy before a crowd of 42,877. The Eagles,
with their fourth consecutive loss, dropped below the .500 mark
(3-4) for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very bad,'' senior Mike Cloud said. ``We have a few guys
in there who are really upset, tears on their cheeks.''
</P>
<P>
   With no timeouts and 41 seconds left, the Eagles staged a
gallant comeback after Navy's staggering 22-point outburst in the
fourth, driving 63 yards in 37 seconds to pull into field goal
range. Junior John Matich, who had made a 43-yarder with 4:36 left
to give BC a 31-25 lead, lined up for a 40-yard attempt with four
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But it all went for naught as Matich's kick sailed wide left. Or
the port side, to use a nautical term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was a tough afternoon,'' said BC coach Tom
O'Brien, whose team must regroup for a tough Big East road game at
Miami Saturday night. ``That's a tough way to lose a football game.
We hung in there at the end of the game and went down the field. We
have an opportunity to kick a field goal and win the game and we
just didn't make the kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Matich, who was no stranger to the pressure of a game-winning
situation after converting such kicks as a freshman at Hawaii and
as a sophomore last year against Pittsburgh, stood expressionless
at the Navy 30 after missing the kick, staring at the uprights
while Midshipmen celebrated around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I couldn't believe it,'' said Matich. ``I couldn't
remember the last time I had missed. I just figured I would make
it. That's what was going through my mind; I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as mind-boggling were the final statistics.
</P>
<P>
   BC rolled up a season-high 610 yards total offense. Cloud,
needing just 34 yards to reach 1,000 _ halfway to his goal for the
season _ rushed for 186 yards on 29 carries and scored on runs of
35 and 12 yards. Senior quarterback Scott Mutryn completed 30 of 45
passes for 369 yards _ all career highs _ and two TDs. And senior
receiver Jermaine Walker also had a career day, making 10 catches
for 142 yards, with TDs of 11 and 46 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we basically did just about everything right today,''
said Cloud. ``Except for winning the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After BC took a 14-10 lead at intermission on Walker's 11-yard
TD, Cloud scored on a 12-yard TD run in the third and Walker caught
a dazzling 46-yard TD to extend the margin to 28-10 with 2:25 left
in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were up 28-10, I think we had an attitude of, `We're
in the clear zone now,' and that we didn't have to work as hard,''
Cloud said. ``I sensed that after some of the guys began cracking
jokes on the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles wound up as the butt of the joke when the
Midshipmen roared back to outscore them in the fourth, 22-3. John
Vereen (7 carries, 69 yards) scored twice, on runs of 2 and 8
yards, but Ryan Read registered the most dazzling score when he
beat BC's patchwork secondary and hauled in a 78-yard TD pass from
Brian Broadwater.
</P>
<P>
   After Matich converted a 43-yarder that gave BC breathing room,
31-25, Vereen tallied the go-ahead score on an 8-yard TD that was
set up by a dazzling 48-yard option pass from Ronel Reyes, a senior
wideout who had not touched the ball in his career until Saturday,
to Jason Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   As BC attempted to mount a winning drive, Mutryn committed a
critical gaffe when he fumbled at his own 27, but the defense held
firm at the 17, forcing Navy to attempt a 34-yard field goal by Tom
Vanderhorst that sailed left.
</P>
<P>
   BC had one last chance, but Matich also missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we did things right there at the end,'' O'Brien
said. ``I'm proud of the football team. We could have given up. The
game could have been over and all that. They hung in there and
fought hard at the end. But it's a tough loss for them and they're
taking it hard.''

 &HT;    Clinton had better not free Jonathan Pollard, Gingrich says
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Saturday called on
President Clinton not to consider releasing convicted spy Jonathan
Pollard as part of the Middle East peace agreement Clinton helped
broker between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Pollard's case, which Israel hopes will lead to a
pardon, is one of several conditions of the hard-fought pact that
Clinton agreed to. Another is for the CIA to help monitor the
accords.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, predicted ``very, very strong
resistance'' in Congress if the president agrees to release
Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a terrible mistake and it would send a terrible
signal to release a man who is a traitor to his own country,''
Gingrich said. ``He still knows a great deal that will harm the
intelligence community.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to a speaking engagement in Lawrenceville at the Gwinnett
Council for Seniors, the speaker said it makes no difference that
Pollard was spying for a country friendly to the United States.
Gingrich acknowledged that Israel has the right to conduct
intelligence, but he said Pollard is ``an American who betrayed his
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, who is Jewish and worked as a civilian naval
intelligence analyst, is serving a life sentence, mostly in
solitary confinement, at a Butner, N.C., military prison.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Gingrich's remarks, White House spokeswoman Julia Payne
noted that Clinton on Friday had said only that he would review
Pollard's case and had made no commitment to release him.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, after more than a decade of Israeli denials, a
spokesman for Netanyahu admitted that Pollard was acting as an
agent for Israel when he stole American military intelligence.
Pollard plead guilty in 1986 to supplying Israel with U.S.-gathered
information, and was convicted of treason. His prosecutors
contended that he was paid $50,000 for the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national security will be very, very badly undermined if
we go forward with the release of this spy,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker also said that using the CIA to monitor the peace
agreement ``would be major mistake.'' Instead, he said, a new
department, separate from the CIA, should be created to conduct the
monitoring.

CARDONA WINS BY GOOD DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pito Cardona and his people had a decision to make a week ago.
Depending on how you look at such things, they either did a very
smart thing or a very stupid thing, but one thing is sure: They did
the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona is a 23-year-old Connecticut lightweight who has been
rising fast, having recently gained the International Boxing
Federation's No. 1 rating. A few weeks back, Cardona and his
handlers agreed to accept $30,000 to fight Golden Johnson in Miami
on an ESPN2 ``Friday Night Fights'' show Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   This seemed to be a wise business move since Cardona holds the
US Boxing Association lightweight title and Johnson the North
American Boxing Federation version. The money was good by the
standards of the industry's bottom rungs, and it would mean more
exposure and a chance to lift himself in the World Boxing
Association and World Boxing Council ratings as well.
</P>
<P>
   Then the phone started to ring. On the line were people trying
to put together a world title fight at Foxwoods for Cardona,
pitting him against the best 135-pound fighter in the world, Shane
Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona was offered $100,000 to take the Nov. 14 HBO fight on
short notice because he is a good draw in Connecticut and because
he was already in training.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardona and his handlers saw that as part of the problem. He
was in training, but not to fight Mosley. He was training to fight
Johnson, not the best lightweight in the world. So they declined.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, wiseguys whispered to Cardona that an
``injury'' could always get him out of the ESPN2 date and into the
more lucrative Mosley fight, for which the purse increased to
$150,000 not long after Cardona first turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   As the wiseguys waited for Cardona's people to take the money
and run, enter something you don't see much in boxing: morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Johnson fight was made,'' explained Cardona's promoter,
Frank Gelb. ``I've had a long relationship with Russell Peltz, the
matchmaker for ESPN _ sometimes good and sometimes bad, but we've
always lived by our word. I explained that to Pito and he had no
problem going through with the Johnson fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the extra money they offered, we'd agreed to take
the Johnson fight from Day 1, and ESPN has been good to Pito. We
were committed by our word. I was hoping it would be an easy fight
and maybe Pito would take a few days off and go back in the gym and
fight Mosely because that's a big fight. That didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an easy fight, the Johnson match turned into a war in
which Cardona hurt his left hand in the second round and suffered a
12-stitch cut over his left eye that rendered him unavailable for
the Mosley match.
</P>
<P>
   Many wiseguys were quick to say, ``I told yah,'' to Cardona's
people, shaking their heads sagely because most young fighters in
Cardona's position would have pulled out of the ESPN2 show for the
bigger money and exposure of the Mosley match.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardona has no regrets. He stood by his word, wasn't
browbeaten into a title shot he wasn't ready for, and won a split
decision, making him both NABF and USBA titleholder. That allowed
him to retain his No. 1 IBF ranking, along with the WBA's No. 3
rating and a No. 5 spot in the WBC, and has him negotiating a title
fight with the winner of the Jean Baptiste Mendy-Alberto Sicurella
WBA title fight next month while retaining his position as Mosley's
mandatory challenger if the champion continues to campaign at 135
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were trying to make me take that fight right away, but
you've got to get mentally prepared for a fight like that,''
Cardona said. ``No matter how much money they offered me, I wasn't
going to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said, `You've got to take a title shot when it
comes,' but I'm 23 and I have a lot of faith in myself and my team.
When my time comes, I'm not going to go there just to be able to
say I got a title shot. I'm going there to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to fight Mosley because people say he's the best
light-weight out there. But not on a short-notice deal. I'd signed
to fight Johnson and I was going to go through with that first.
That's who I trained for and that's what I said I'd do. I didn't
even think about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   When you listen to Israel ``Pito'' Cardona talk for a few
minutes about such things, you realize he's more than a Boy Scout
troop leader in New Britain. He's a Boy Scout himself, a guy who
believes in being prepared and living by your word in a business in
which a man's word often isn't worth much.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing has a long and stained history of guys pulling out of one
fight to take a more lucrative one. Had Cardona done that, he
wouldn't have been the greatest to do it, just the latest. But for
an assortment of reasons he didn't, so now he must wait to see
whether Mosley defeats James Leija, who stepped in to fill the
void. If he does, the next question will be whether Mosley chooses
to move up to the junior welterweight division, as many think he
might next year, or stay behind to fight Cardona in January or
February.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, says Cardona, next time his title shot comes, he'll
be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand if I get hurt and never get a title shot I lost
$150,000,'' he said, ``but I never imagined being in this position,
so if nothing else happens I'm already higher than I ever thought
possible, and I just believe my time is coming. When they say,
`Here's your chance to fight for the belt,' I want to come out of
the ring wearing that belt.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sugar Ray Leonard  &LR; has signed  &UR; Bronko McKart  &LR; to a
promotional/managerial deal with his new company ... These are not
the best of times for British promoter  &UR; Frank Warren &LR; . His
heavyweight,  &UR; Frans Botha &LR; , &UR;  &LR; should have ascended to the No. 1
ranking in the IBF, but IBF president  &UR; Bob Lee  &LR; is calling for a
boxoff to determine a new No. 1 that Warren wants no part of but
may have to sue to overturn. But that's the least of it. Warren
also has problems with his leading revenue producer,  &UR; Prince Naseem
Hamed &LR; . Warren is suing  &UR; Don King &LR; , &UR;  &LR; his former partner, and being
countersued by him but also was recently charged with value-added
tax violations in England involving $3.2 million. If convicted, he
could face imprisonment, and this all comes in the midst of a
muddled picture over who actually controls Hamed's contract. In an
attempt to avoid his legal problems in the United Kingdom, Warren
put Hamed's contract on file with a company in the US headed by his
new partner and a former King associate,  &UR; Sterling MacPherson &LR; . Now
there are questions as to who legally controls that contract, while
back in England, Hamed's brother has just taken out a promoter's
license of his own. Wonder why he'd do that ... Former  &UR; Oscar De La
Hoya  &LR; trainer  &UR; Emanuel Steward  &LR; anticipates a tough fight for his
former student Nov. 21 against ex-WBA titleholder  &UR; Ike Quartey  &LR; but
not an impossible one. ``Ike is stronger than people think,''
Steward said. ``He'll force Oscar to fight. But I think Oscar has
too much hand and foot speed for Ike. This is Oscar's first real
fight, and I think it will raise him to another level.'' ... Newly
crowned WBA welterweight champion  &UR; James Page  &LR; didn't have long to
celebrate his victory over  &UR; Andrei Pastriev  &LR; in France. The Duvas,
who promote  &UR; Jose Luis Lopez &LR; , &UR;  &LR; secured a court order barring the
WBA from recognizing it as a title fight because Pastriev and Lopez
should have been matched in an elimination battle for the title
stripped from Quartey when he agreed to fight De La Hoya. But the
Acaries brothers in France got a judge in Paris to overrule the US
court, ordering the WBA to continue calling the event a world title
fight. King, who promoted the bout, said he had not gone to the
French court to challenge the US ruling, saying it was the
Acarieses' idea. Probably was, but all it really means is Page, who
scored a stunning one-punch knockout of Pastriev, will eventually
be forced to do the right thing and meet Lopez, who probably should
have been awarded the title the night he twice dropped Quartey ...
Before  &UR; Mike Tyson  &LR; fights at the MGM Grand in December, he's
already facing a bigger fight in court with King. Tyson's new
adviser,  &UR; Magic Johnson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said Monday after Tyson regained his
license to box that ``I'll be the closest guy to him, making all
the decisions. Johnson's statement implied that he had replaced
 &UR; Shelley Finkel &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who had been advising Tyson, but Friends of
Shelley immediately began whispering, ``Shelley's still the guy.''
Maybe he is, but before long somebody who thinks he's in is going
to be out, and that usually means another lawsuit. Just what Tyson
needs. Tyson is currently ``advised'' by Finkel, Johnson,  &UR; Irving
Azoff &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Jeff Wald &LR; , &UR;  &LR; plus a half-dozen LA lawyers led by
 &UR; Ralph Branca's  &LR; nephew ... Despite claims of having an
overwhelming case against King, word is Tyson's legal team has
already been negotiating a settlement with the bombastic promoter,
who said last week, ``I don't care to promote Mike anymore. I just
want to get paid.'' So does everybody else associated with Tyson.
He has made more than $100 million in purses in his last six fights
yet is broke, owes the IRS $13 million, has borrowed from Azoff and
others to stay afloat, owes new attorneys and accountants, and even
owes $75,000 to the six-man psychological team that examined him in
Boston ...  &UR; Lou Savarese  &LR; is still being held as a possible
opponent for  &UR; Lennox Lewis  &LR; if the  &UR; Evander Holyfield  &LR; fight can't
be made. Meanwhile, it seems likely that Holyfield's WBA mandatory
defense vs.  &UR; Henry Akinwande  &LR; will be ignored by the organization
because of Akinwande's inability to pass a test for hepatitis B ...
Forget about a  &UR; Felix Trinidad &LR; - &UR; Pernell Whitaker  &LR; fight on Dec. 5.
That date is now Tyson's, and the outcome of Trinidad's suit with
King to free himself from a promotional deal has thrown things into
limbo. Whitaker may take a tuneup fight in the interim. He is
training in San Antonio at old friend  &UR; Joe Souza's  &LR; gym ...  &UR; Floyd
Mayweather Jr. &LR;  is showing once again that he fears no one. He has
agreed to meet  &UR; Angel Manfredy  &LR; in December, the first defense of
the WBC junior lightweight title he won from  &UR; Genaro Hernandez &LR; . &UR;  &LR; 
``I have a lot of respect for both guys because they're going right
to the next best guy available,'' said HBO Sports vice president of
programming  &UR; Lou DiBella &LR; . ``Both guys want to be a star, and this
is the way to do it. Someone comes out of this a major fighter.''
...  &UR; Razor Ruddock's  &LR; comeback is on hold because of a minor wrist
operation to remove a bone spur. He'll be out of commission until
January ...  &UR; Hector Camacho  &LR; and his son,  &UR; Hector Jr. &LR; , will do
battle Oct. 23 but thankfully not against each other. The son will
fight on Fox that night while the father appears on ESPN2 in a
battle for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vinny Pazienza's  &LR; Nov. 6 fight on ESPN2 is still going forward
at Foxwoods but without opponent  &UR; Kevin Pompey &LR; . Turns out Pompey
signed the contract despite an injury that will require surgery ...
 &UR; Dana Rosenblatt's  &LR; people are negotiating for him to fight  &UR; Keith
Mullings  &LR; for the WBC 154-pound title. The Malden middleweight
reports the reason for his unexplained fatigue at the end of recent
bouts has been diagnosed as a salt deficiency. He is now on
supplements for sodium. As for 154, Rosenblatt said, ``I'm willing
to do it because I made 158 pretty easily. If I don't fight
Mullings, what do I do in the meantime? I've got to make a living,
and  &UR; Bob  &LR; ( &UR; Arum &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Rosenblatt's promoter) doesn't have any of the
middleweight champions, so we have to go somewhere else.''
Rosenblatt is hoping to fight once at 154 before the end of the
year and then get his title shot in February under a De La
Hoya- &UR; Frankie Randall  &LR; (or  &UR; Oba Carr &LR; ) fight ... The WBC is in a
dispute with Lewis over the sanctioning fee for his recent
mandatory defense with  &UR; Zeljko Mavrovic &LR; , &UR;  &LR; sources in Connecticut
say. The bout, which was staged at the Mohegan Sun casino,
reportedly carried with it a $4 million purse for Lewis but the
contract said it was only $2 million. When the WBC was handed a
sanctioning fee $40,000 short of its percentage of $44 million, it
refused to accept the check.

SEVERAL RICH SUBJECTS TO COVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Picked-up pieces while worrying about John Harrington's
purse strings and Terry Glenn's hamstrings ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Mike Piazza's $91 million, seven-year deal ($13 mil per year)
sets the ceiling for Mo Vaughn. It beats Pedro Martinez's $12.5
million per, and no doubt Mo is going to want to land somewhere in
the middle. Good business move by the Red Sox, dragging their feet
on this one. When Mo said in March, ``The price goes up every
day,'' he wasn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Is it possible that Bill Parcells was right about Glenn?
Glenn has been dropping passes this year, always seems to be on the
shelf, and there are questions about his commitment to conditioning
and rehab that might avert chronic hamstring pulls. Parcells said
Friday that Glenn will not play Sunday. Don't know if this was
inside info, a well-educated hunch, some kind of a grudge, or
wishful thinking. Let's see if Glenn plays.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Yankees best ever? The wins (125 in all) are there, and they
did go 11-2 in the postseason, but when I looked out and saw Jorge
Posada, Scott Brosius, and Ricky Ledee, I sometimes wondered. Then
I came across Game 6 from 1975 on Classic Sports Friday night and
heard Dick Stockton say, ``Due up for the Reds in the 11th, Pete
Rose, Ken Griffey, and Joe Morgan (followed by Tony Perez and
Johnny Bench; George Foster of 50-homer fame was further down in
the order),'' and I wondered again.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Chris Canty says if we don't like his dancing, we don't have
to watch. Fine. But why can't Canty's teammates and coaches stop
him from firing up the opposition with his insipid and premature
celebrations? He's being paid to make plays. So make the plays and
sit down. As Jim Brown used to say about looking calm when he
reached the end zone, ``I like to act like I've been there
before.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Jimy Williams was right and wiseguys like me were wrong about
Pete Schourek. The crafty lefty pitched great in Game 4 and Pedro
Martinez was set up for Game 5. By the way, not only is ``Peter
Schourek'' an anagram for RUTH KEEP SCORE, ``Pete Schourek'' can
also be scrambled into KEEP CURSE HOT. And people think we make
this stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Remember, the Red Sox promised you they wouldn't let Vaughn
leave for a mere draft pick, the same way Roger Clemens did.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Anybody miss the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; The Dominique Moceanu story is troubling. Too many young
female athletes run into trouble with Svengali coaches or
controlling/-demanding parents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Rented out your house for the Ryder Cup yet?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; In that ``No Rest for the Beer Man'' commercial, I keep
wondering what that shapely young lass sees in Joey the Beer Man.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Former pitcher Jim Colborn is playing a third base coach in
Kevin Costner's next baseball film. Too bad Costner didn't hire
Wendell ``Send 'Em In'' Kim.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Can Gino Cappelletti come out of the booth to catch a few
passes Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; The late Gov. Frank Sargent, a rabid outdoorsman, had to be
the only Massachusetts governor ever profiled in Sports
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Sunday's game is the kind the Patriots must win if we are to
consider them Super Bowl timber. The Pats have plenty of excuses
because of injuries, but the Dolphins are not that strong and New
England has to show it can bounce back from adversity. Patriot fans
had visions of running the table after the impressive thrashing of
Kansas City, but leave it to the Tuna to expose all the holes and
bring out the fears of Patriot Nation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Tell us again, why was it necessary to dump Jimmy Hitchcock?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Bruins-Canadiens Thursday at the New Garden. This should
still be a big deal, especially with the Rick Pitino AC locked out
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Doug Flutie and the Bills come to Foxborough Nov. 29. And
where do you plan to be Dec. 27 when the Patriots finish their
season against the Jets at the Meadowlands?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Jon Miller is the best baseball broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Yankee fans should never forget Orlando Hernandez. New York
was threatened only once in the playoffs and that was when it
trailed the Tribe, 2-1, in Cleveland. Folks were still talking
about Chuck Knoblauch's brain lock and wondering whether the
Yankees would go up in smoke until El Duque stuffed Cleveland in
Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Sometime between now and Christmas, I expect the dreaded call
from the boss: ``We need you to fly to (fill in your best guess)
for the press conference to announce the signing of Mo Vaughn.''

PUTTING THE FUTURE ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They don't get standing ovations when they're finished skating.
They don't get flowers showered on the ice after their routine
(although one skater did get tossed a teddy bear). And they
certainly don't get introduced as ``former Olympic medalists.''
</P>
<P>
   No, these skaters are not past Olympic champions, but they might
well be future ones. So while fans are enjoying the performances of
world-class figure skaters at ``An Evening with Champions'' over
the weekend, they are also getting a sneak peek at future stars.
</P>
<P>
   The 29th skating gala at Harvard, which concludes Sunday with a
1 p.m. show, is known for attracting name skaters like Surya
Bonaly, Oksana Baiul, and Ludmila and Olga Protopopov. But local
athletes performed routines to open up the show, and about half of
the skaters on the program are not yet household names. But they
hope to be _ if not soon, then by the time the 2002 Olympics in
Salt Lake City come around.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, they are on the cusp of stardom and have to
balance their ``other'' life with their skating life.
</P>
<P>
   Take 19-year-old Amber Corwin, a sophomore at Cal State-Long
Beach. She condenses her classes into three days a week from 8 a.m.
to noon, then skates.
</P>
<P>
   Corwin was sixth in the US nationals last year and second in the
junior champions series. Now she has graduated to the senior
circuit, and her goals are higher.
</P>
<P>
   First on her agenda is to make it on the US world team, where
her competition includes Michelle Kwan and Nicole Bobek. Corwin's
next dream is the Olympics. And though she's not yet a marquee
name, Corwin is known in skating circles for being the first
American woman to execute a triple-triple combination, which she
first performed in the '97 nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Corwin said she's glad that skaters such as Tara Lipinski have
retired ``to make room for amateurs like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Delmore, 19, is the current world junior champion and a
junior at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teachers and I are stressing now because I have three
midterms when I get back,'' said Delmore, who practices skating
only about two hours a day ``because I have a burnout theory that
if you can maximize your time on the ice, then you don't need to
train all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   So he goes to classes, then practices, then sends a progress
report to his coach, Shirley Hughes, in Maryland via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Delmore, who is headed to the Skate America competition
in Detroit next weekend, has graduated from the junior ranks, the
Olympics are his main goal. And like Corwin, he's glad that skaters
are turning pro to make room for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no one (in line for Salt Lake City) that you
saw in Nagano except for Michel Weiss,'' Delmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the youngest of the young blood is Sarah Hughes, the
13-year-old to whom a teddy bear was thrown after she skated her
routine Friday night. The eighth-grader from Long Island, who
skates 2-3 hours a day, is the reigning junior champion.
</P>
<P>
   As for the skaters with top billing, well, they definitely got
the reception to which they've become accustomed, as the crowd gave
standing ovations to pair dancers Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze, the '98 world silver medalists, and to Olympians _
and new dance couple _ Maya Usova and Evgeny Platov. Master of
ceremonies Paul Wylie, dressed in a tuxedo, surprised and dazzled
the crowd when he put his microphone aside to burst into the
skaters' finale and perform his trademark scratch spin.
</P>
<P>
   Baiul, the 1994 gold medalist, skated last and took control of
the crowd even though she turned triple jumps into doubles and
almost touched the ice on more than one occasion. When she took a
tumble on a jump in the dramatic finale of her program, she
finished and gave a shrug. But then, showing the star treatment she
has come to expect, Baiul skated over to Wylie and asked for a
do-over, telling him and the audience, ``My coach will kill me if I
don't get that.'' He obliged, and Baiul reskated the last part of
her program.
</P>
<P>
   When she nailed the jump, the crowd cheered, and as she took her
curtsy, Baiul blew a kiss to Wylie and the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of aplomb and determination was obviously not
lost on the Olympic wannabes. Her star quality hasn't lost its
sparkle.

&HT;    DIPLOMATIC MINUET LED TO AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a designations) (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS   AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most intensive diplomatic effort of Bill
Clinton's career took place amid shaded country paths and
sun-splashed terraces, dark libraries and attic offices decorated
with Halloween cobwebs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mideast peace conference that finished Friday mixed tense
confrontations and tender moments. One pivotal 24-hour period, for
example, started with Israeli diplomats threatening to leave and
loading their suitcases into US government vehicles _ and climaxed
with an emotional dinner speech by a 62-year-old king debilitated
by cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I was on my deathbed, I would come for peace,''
Jordan's King Hussein told Clinton, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu,
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after an extraordinary nine days, President Clinton
prevailed with charm, perspicacity, mastery of minute details, and
occasional comic relief. Clinton also resorted to promises of
money, something that American presidents of this century have used
far more than military power to get their wishes overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton had something more important than money: He had the
weight of his office. Americans may say the office has been
tarnished by a sex scandal, but a presidential visit overseas
carries great heft, especially for people such as the Palestinians,
who yearn for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, participants said, Clinton and other US
negotiators privately made a decision during a stalemate on
Wednesday: The president would offer to make a historic trip to
Palestinian-controlled Gaza. While there, he would watch as
Palestinian officials revoked all the clauses of a charter calling
for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple gambit, and it worked. The Israelis, who had
balked at making concessions to Palestinians until the 26
anti-Israel clauses were publicly rebuked, plunged back into the
last round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The ``mini-summit'' took two days longer than the talks at Yalta
at the end of World War II. Although the goals of the Wye River
negotiations were modest, success was not assured. The players were
recalcitrant, bitter, even hateful. During the entire time on
Maryland's Eastern Shore, Arafat, the former guerrilla, and Israeli
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, the former general, barely made eye
contact and never shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   The deal Clinton put together was very much the same agreement
his top aides had proposed for 18 months, but this time it was
delivered after at least 77 hours of the president's time.
</P>
<P>
   What took place at the pastoral conference center was classic
diplomacy, filled with arm-twisting, entreaties, and long nights of
cigar smoking by a president and prime minister who don't quite
trust each other _ and for face-to-face meetings between two
regional leaders who trust each other even less.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In grenade attack, a warning
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Americans insisted that only the State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, would be allowed to speak for
the parties, and he would limit his comments to procedural matters
so the diplomats could do their work unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted less than two days. Early on the afternoon of
October 17, a Saturday, in Hebrew and Arabic, the Israeli and
Palestinian spokesmen quickly complained of slights and broken
promises by their opponents, just in time for the evening news back
home.
</P>
<P>
   A battle of spinning and counterspinning had commenced. The most
interesting thing, the participants said, was its inaccuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The participants agree that a frustrating stalemate had settled
in that Saturday and again Sunday, when Vice President Al Gore
joined Clinton at the 1,000-acre retreat. No one wanted to budge on
the most basic issues: the Israelis demanded an end to broken
promises that the Palestinians would pursue terrorists; the
Palestinians demanded that Israeli troops finally begin
withdrawing, as previously agreed, from 13.1 percent more of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things looked pretty bleak,'' one of the Americans involved in
the talks remembered Saturday. The president, he said, spoke to the
Israelis and Palestinians with an air of resignation, saying,
``Maybe we ought to recognize that this isn't going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was letting the two parties know they would be worse off
on their own than they were with American mediators. It didn't save
the day, but discussions continued.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Monday, Prime Minister Netanyahu awoke to learn
that a Palestinian had thrown a grenade into a crowded bus station
in southern Israel, injuring more than 60 people. Clinton used the
attack as a warning, saying that ``the whole thing,'' meaning the
faltering peace process, was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   No one disagreed. Gradually, an innovative and risky deal took
shape to let the CIA oversee Palestinian police investigations of
terrorists and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton returned to Wye Plantation for a briefing
with Secretary of State Madeleine K. &UR;  &LR; Albright, National Security
Adviser Samuel R. Berger, Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, and CIA
director George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   In discussions with Netanyahu and Arafat that started at 8 p.m.
and stretched through the night, Clinton went through an
``inventory'' of the issues being debated. It was the first time
all proposals had been considered together, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged his guests to settle some disputes quickly and
``reserve the harder ones for later,'' Ross said. It was a key
moment, he said, because the president showed that each side could
compromise without giving up too much.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``No going back''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Palestinians got an earful from Israeli Trade
and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky, who has a special stature
because he advocates the peace process. But Sharansky said that
even Israeli doves needed a sign of good will from the
Palestinians: a renunciation of the anti-Israel clauses of the
Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a wrenching experience in our society,'' in
surrendering land for peace, Sharansky said, according to an
observer. ``We know that we've crossed over and there is no going
back. Now we need to see the equivalent on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   In a private meeting earlier that day, Clinton, Albright, and
Ross had come up with the idea of offering the presidential visit.
The Americans used a poker tactic: They held the ace but they
didn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it in our back pocket,'' one of the Americans said.
Just to get things going, Clinton talked vaguely of a ``joint
appearance'' sometime with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Israelis threatened to leave because the
Palestinians wouldn't budge on the charter. Although news reports
suggested the American hosts were anxious, members of the
delegation dismissed the whole incident as an obvious ``ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Netanyahu was requesting that their US hosts organize
transportation to the airport, an Israeli delegation was working
out complicated wording of a document with American legal experts.
``Do you really want to have this kind of a discussion?'' one of
the Americans teased. ``Aren't you going to miss your plane?''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, amid the distractions, the Israelis came up with a
plan: What if Clinton would personally watch as the Palestinian
legislators voted to annul the offending parts of their charter?
</P>
<P>
   It was the same idea the Americans came with the day before,
their ace.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans smiled.

PREMATURE BABY BORN TO COMATOSE PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROLINE LOUISE COLE   AND ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LAWRENCE, Mass. _ Known to her nurses simply as Baby Girl,
she arrived at 4 p.m. Friday, born at least 14 weeks early to a
comatose mother who doctors say never could have consented to sex,
or known she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Now the premature newborn is in critical condition at New
England Medical Center, and her 24-year-old mother is at Lawrence
General Hospital, fed through a tube, and curled in the same fetal
position she has held for years.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into how a comatose woman became pregnant at
the Town Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center has conjured up
nightmarish images of a helpless patient, surrounded by caregivers
and still at risk for a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Because she is considered a rape victim, the identity of the
mother is being protected by officials.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they are outraged, while health-care providers
at the Lawrence facility were sickened to hear word of the
pregnancy and then learn that the men working with them may be
among the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source familiar with the case, investigators will
request blood samples from each of the male employees at the
nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Essex CoUnty District Attorney Kevin Burke said Saturday, ``In
my 20 years as a district attorney, I have never seen anything like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Public Health officials were at the facility
and will continue their work Sunday, conducting their own
investigation at Town Manor, which recently received high marks
from that state agency following a surprise inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnancy was discovered Monday, investigators say, when
staffers noticed that the woman, who has been comatose at the
facility for nearly four years, seemed physically stressed. She was
taken to a private physician for an examination, Town Manor
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents and police were notified of her pregnancy, more than
five months advanced at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A physician did examine her recently,'' said Charles Leonard,
a spokesman for Town Manor's parent company, Sun Health Care. The
New Mexico-based company owns and manages 35 nursing homes in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is unique physiology to a comatose patient, and the last
thing I think you would be looking for in a comatose patient is
these kind of symptoms,'' Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a pretty fundamental explanation as to how it
went undetected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to how it happened, that's a question we all want
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard flew to Boston from his Washington office to speak with
staffers, provide information to investigators, and respond to the
public relations crisis for the residential home. The facility
houses 96 patients of various ages and needs.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnant woman was transported by ambulance from the
residential home at midday Friday, when staffers noticed she was
bleeding, according to Public Health Commissioner Howard K. Koh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is very premature, somewhere between 20 and 26
weeks,'' said Ellen Murphy, a Lawrence General Hospital
spokeswoman. The baby was delivered vaginally in the hospital's
emergency room. ``Because she was so premature, she was immediately
Medflighted to New England Medical Center in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday night, Town Manor officials said they could not
confirm that a patient had delivered a baby, but Saturday they said
they withheld the information from reporters until the woman's
parents had been notified.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Town Manor facility's good record, Koh said, ``The
big question is whether this is an isolated, terrible tragedy or
indicative of a systemic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts law requires that criminal background checks be
conducted on nursing home employees, and Leonard said that
officials did comply with that law. However, he said that, like
many in the field, he is unsure whether administrators receive
complete criminal histories, since some employees move from one
state to another.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes owned by the Sun Health Care Group have been
linked to several controversies in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, a 35-year-old woman who was being
rehabilitated in a Quincy, Mass., home was charged with
manslaughter in the death of another patient, an 89-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a nurse's aide at the Wilmington Woods Nursing Center
in Wilmington, Mass., was charged with nine counts of mistreating
patients _ including forcing one to eat her own feces, and
slapping, kicking, and spitting on others.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company faced strikes from 140 workers at
Massachusetts facilities in Lowell and Brighton. On Saturday, some
of those workers took to the picket line outside the Brighton
facility.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 110 employees, nurses, aides, and security staff
employed at Town Manor, Leonard said. The patient, whose room was
close to the nurses' station, was seen several times a day, Leonard
said, by nurses and aides who work on any one of the three
round-the-clock shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The patient was also visited regularly by friends and relatives
who are allowed 24-hour access, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say how the woman lapsed into a coma, citing the
woman's and her family's privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Town Manor spokeswoman Karen Gilliland said the woman cannot
communicate in any way.

   Showers and thunderstorms will develop across Arizona Sunday as
a core of very fast jet stream winds associated with a potent
low-pressure system over the southern Great Basin lifts moderately
moist air. Farther west, building westerly winds will gust to 40
mph or more across the deserts of southern California, setting the
stage for blowing dust and sand.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will fall at high elevations in the mountains of southeast
Idaho, Utah, southwest Wyoming and western Colorado as the potent
low churns eastward.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Hurricane Mitch strengthened over the western
Caribbean Sea, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph. On Sunday,
Hurricane Mitch may take a westward jog before approaching Jamaica.
If, however, Hurricane Mitch continues to forge northward, the risk
that the Caribbean island will be lashed with hurricane or tropical
storm-force winds by the end of the day will rise.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and spotty showers will affect the northern Great Lakes
region Sunday as an upper-level low pressure system, which tracked
from California to Montana and then the northern Plains over the
past several days, finally arrives. Showers could reach
southwestward of the low across parts of the upper Mississippi
Valley as moist winds from the southwest converge near the low.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp cold front will forge into northern New England Sunday,
escorted by a few widely separated showers. Farther south, high
clouds streaming east from the low over the Great Lakes will dim
the sun over parts of northern Pennsylvania and western New York.

   Focus: Destiny of Water
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tropical moisture that swirled around the eye of
Supertyphoon Zeb over the western Pacific Ocean nearly two weeks
ago fell as snowflakes over the northern Sierra Nevada Saturday.
Next spring, this melting snow linked to the tropics will trickle
down from the high Sierra into reservoirs. Some of it will
evaporate quickly, only to eventually condense into cloud droplets
elsewhere. Some of it will stay in reservoirs for years. The
possible destinies of water are endless. The labyrinth of paths of
water molecules between the tropics and poles is called the
hydrologic cycle.

A FAMILIAR SPOT FOR LOVE: LOOKING BACK AT THE FIELD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ At one point during Saturday's round,
when the humidity was rising, Davis Love III turned to someone in
the gallery and said, ``It's getting pretty warm out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, however, was cool under pressure, shooting a
seven-under-par 65. He took sole possession of the lead with an
eagle on the fourth hole, and his three-round total of 14-under 202
gave him a three-stroke lead heading into Sunday's final round of
the National Car Rental Golf Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Day and Doug Martin, who both shot 68 Saturday, were tied
for second place at 11 under par, while several prominent names
lurked in contention, including Tiger Woods and Jesper Parnevik at
nine under and David Duval at eight under.
</P>
<P>
   But Love was clearly the man to beat at Walt Disney World,
playing another superb round Saturday after shooting a 64 on
Friday. Starting the day in a six-way tie for first place, Love
emerged from the pack in familiar fashion, taking advantage of the
Magnolia Course's par-5 holes with booming drives, and hitting
accurate approach shots that led to numerous birdie opportunities.
It was a solid performance from tee to green by a proven winner who
was playing with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Love did not guarantee victory on Sunday, but he liked his
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this situation a bunch,'' said Love, the 1997 PGA
champion who won most recently in April at the MCI Classic.
``You're going to be nervous, but I know what it's going to take.
Guys are going to try and knock me off. But I know they'll be
thinking, `Well, if he gets a little bit ahead, I'm not going to be
able to catch him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody caught Love Saturday once he took sole possession of the
lead. After making his first birdie at No. 3 with a five-foot putt,
Love eagled the par-5, 552-yard No. 4, reaching the green in two
shots with a drive and a 1-iron, then making a 40-foot putt. That
gave him a two-stroke lead at 10 under par, and he remained in
command. He stretched his lead with a birdie at the par-3 No. 6,
hitting a brilliant 5-iron tee shot that landed two feet from the
cup for an easy tap-in. Then on the back nine, Love birdied the
par-5 10th hole, hitting his second shot just short of the green
and chipping to within two feet. He followed that by making a
20-foot birdie putt at No. 12, and Love ended the day on a high by
making a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Day and Martin will play in Sunday's final threesome, and
the players chasing Love hoped that he would falter early. But they
weren't counting on it. ``If the wind is calm, Davis can make some
birdies, and if he does that, he'll be hard to catch,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who shot a 68 Saturday, could have scored even better but
barely missed several putts. ``I had six lip-outs,'' he said.
``That's a lot of lip-outs for birdies. It's just one of those days
where the putts just didn't quite go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Love felt the same way Thursday after he opened the tournament
with a 73. But he has been superb since. And he hoped that he was
just 18 holes from victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have just thrown in the towel for the year and had a
heck of a lot of fun,'' said Love, who is 10th on this year's PGA
Tour money list. ``All I can do is win more money or win another
tournament. It's not going to get me player of the year. It's not
going to get me the money title. But I've got a lot of pride. If I
can look back on this year and say I finished second or third on
the money list, finished strong, and didn't throw in the towel,
that will mean something to me.''

 &HT;    NASA set to blast off into new missions, adventures
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Earth is the cradle of the mind _
but one cannot eternally live in a cradle.'' _ Konstantin
Eduardovitch Tsiolkovsky, 1857-1935, considered the father of
astronautics
</P>
<P>
   Like John Glenn, NASA is playing time travel.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old former astronaut's return to space links the
national space agency with its whiz-bang past in the same month it
celebrates its 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   But while NASA's first two decades were a whirlwind of giant
leaps _ it went from its first manned flight to stepping on the
moon in just eight years _ the second half of the agency's life has
mostly been a routine of workmanlike space shuttle missions.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is working with several other countries to assemble a space
station. It's talking about sending people to Mars. And it's
mulling rocket designs that use nuclear fission, plasma, even
anti-matter. One shoots cargo out of a giant gas gun. Another
magnetically levitates astronauts over a miles-long track, then
whips them into the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   It was 5,500 years from the dawn of history to Christopher
Columbus, four more centuries to Kitty Hawk, and less than a half
century to NASA. Then, in 40 years, the agency did what our ancient
forebears could only imagine as they threw rocks to scare away the
stars. Men or their machines went to the moon, to the points of
light at our solar system's outer reaches, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Well, mostly machines. The graduating class of 1998 wasn't born
the last time humans left earth's orbit for open space. In the
space race's heady days, dreamers dreamed of stations on the moon
and Mars and piloted missions to the outer planets by the turn of
the millennium. It hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA of the 1960s was staggering from the embarrassment of
having been beaten to space by the Evil Empire, which might just
use that technology to vaporize American cities before John Kennedy
could get to his secret bomb shelter on Peanut Island. Then it was
immersed in a frantic, spare-no-expense sprint to beat said
Russians to the moon for America's pride, can-do reputation and
pioneer image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dared to dream,'' NASA administrator Daniel S. Goldin said
Oct. 1 on NASA's anniversary. ``We imagined what could be possible.
And then along with our partners in industry and academia, we went
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s and 1980s, NASA had settled into the SpaceLab and
Space Shuttle programs. Then the Challenger disaster put piloted
space flight on hold for more than two years and raised questions
about whether familiarity had bred complacency and carelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Now NASA plans to replace the space shuttle in the next few
years with a new breed of spaceship that specializes in utility and
efficiency: reusable vehicles that operate at a fraction of the
cost, can take off from a number of sites and in the kind of
weather that would scrub a shuttle launch, and boast a turnaround
time of days rather than weeks. NASA will be going from Porsche to
Honda Civic.
</P>
<P>
   NASA wants to lower the cost per launch from $10,000 per pound
of cargo on the space shuttle or $5,000 on a pilotless rocket down
to $1,000 in the next decade and $100 in the decade after that. And
the agency envisions a new partnership with private companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role is to develop the high-risk technologies that
industry can not afford,'' Goldin has said. ``But we won't build
the vehicle. Industry will. NASA will be a user, not an operator.''
</P>
<P>
   The new, cheaper rockets will expand the space business:
communications and science satellites; servicing the International
Space Station; special laboratories taking advantage of near-zero
gravity; even private leisure flights into space. And maybe a trip
to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   But which NASA will lead the charge?
</P>
<P>
   There are two NASAs, complains Robert Park, a physics professor
at the University of Maryland and director of public information
for the American Physical Society, an international organization of
more than 40,000 physicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them has advanced human knowledge and given us enormous
returns for our investment in the dazzling array of space uses we
have now,'' Park says. He complains the other NASA bowed to
pressure to send Americans aboard the rickety Russian Mir station,
poured billions of dollars into the international space station
with its partners, and operated a space shuttle program he calls
``a complete waste. There is no field science that has been
measurably advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The breathtaking triumph of the Mars Pathfinder was a two-edged
sword. It showed what NASA could do working cheap _ the $266
million mission cost less than a single B-1 bomber _ and without
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``America could have a better space program for less money if
NASA would cancel the ... space station and build more
Pathfinder-type missions that are cheaper, use telecommunications
technology, and yield more science than the space station ever
will,'' said Ralph DeGennaro, executive director for Taxpayers for
Common Sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our robots get better every day; human beings haven't changed
in 35,000,'' says the American Physical Society's Park, who says
NASA can do the same thing with robots at a tenth of the cost of
people and should simply quit sending people at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants NASA to scale back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mars,'' John Pike says succinctly.
</P>
<P>
   With people?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Pike, space policy analyst for the Federation of American
Scientists, believes the technology spinoff from the space program
is ``grotesquely overplayed'' and that space flight has ``turned
out to be a lot more difficult than we thought it was.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says extending ``human presence in the solar system''
should be the top goal of NASA, and it should seek help from
Earth's two emerging superpowers, China and India, to cooperate in
space instead of competing with missiles.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's challenge is to balance politics, science, finances and
ideals to shape its future course. It says it is doing just that.
Some aren't sure it has been doing it very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA excels when our nation has a clear, binding, national
space policy,'' Keith Cowing, a former NASA scientist and head of
the Internet newsletter NASA Watch, told a House Subcommittee on
Space and Aeronautics on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not certain just what America's guiding vision for the
exploration of space should be,'' Cowing said. ``All I know is that
we are in desperate need of one.''

MISSOURI WATCHES UPSET SLIP AWAY

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ A year ago, Nebraska needed a miracle play. It
got it. The Immaculate Deflection.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Missouri needed the fortunate finish. It didn't get
it. Sophomore wide receiver John Dausman had a potential game-tying
reception slip through his arms on the next-to-last play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been ironic if we would have scored on that play
to take it into overtime,'' said Tigers coach Larry Smith, a coach
who appreciates a good story line.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 version of Missouri-Nebraska in no way resembled the
1997 passion play that the Cornhuskers won in overtime. Yesterday,
the seventh-ranked Cornhuskers' 20-13 victory against the
19th-ranked Tigers (5-2) indicates that Nebraska (7-1) is a fragile
top-10 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were ripe for the picking,'' Missouri defensive back
Harold Piersey. ``We should have beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Columbia, the Cornhuskers scored on the last play
of the game when Shevin Wiggins kicked a pass that was caught by
Matt Davison. Again this time, it was Wiggins' feet (a 53-yard punt
return) and Davison's hands (an off-the-turf reception) that led to
Nebraska's game-tying touchdown late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess I'm not a very popular guy in Missouri,''
Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
   Davison's catch on a third-and-seven play set up the first of
two touchdown runs by reserve quarterback Monte Christo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was yelling, `Get up under it, get up under it,' '' Wiggins
said as he watched Davison's dive.
</P>
<P>
   Another ill-timed kick (a 6-yard shank by Missouri punter Vince
Sebo) set up the Cornhuskers' winning touchdown drive. Nebraska
took over at the Missouri 49 and required eight plays before
Christo scored on a 3-yard run with 10:27 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's offense was rescued by Christo, a fifth-year senior
and former walk-on. His touchdowns were the first of his career as
Nebraska overcame a 13-6 halftime deficit by scoring the only two
TDs of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a blast, by far the most meaningful part of a game I've
ever been in,'' said Christo, who finished with 67 yards rushing.
``I felt like the team needed a spark in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who last season gained 386 yards against the
Cornhuskers, managed 166 yards. Nebraska, with 328, nearly doubled
that. Missouri's two touchdowns came courtesy of a fumble return by
Steve Erickson and a blocked field-goal attempt that set up a short
TD drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense won the game,'' Missouri quarterback Corby Jones, who
completed eight of 20 passes for 89 yards. ``It's disappointing to
let it get away, and the fact is the offense let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its offensive struggles, the Tigers _ who missed the
extra-point attempt after their first touchdown _ nearly forced
overtime. Missouri got a final chance when it recovered a Christo
fumble at the Nebraska 46 with 1:38 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dausman got free in the end zone, but a pass slipped
through his hands. On the next play, Jones was sacked. That's the
way last year's overtime ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hoping to do to us what we did to them,'' said
Nebraska cornerback Erwin Siney, who was beaten by Dausman on the
next-to-last play. ``I don't know if it's fun to play in games like
this, but it's fun when you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri wouldn't know.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT COLLINS, Colo. _ At the end of a beautifully sunny
afternoon, Dennis Franchione strode to midfield and warmly clasped
the hand of Colorado State quarterback Ryan Eslinger.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that he simply wished to make sure that
Eslinger's strong right arm would do no further damage to TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've had my tail whipped by these guys before,'' said
the TCU coach, after watching the Rams roll to a 42-21 Western
Athletic Conference victory over the Horned Frogs (4-3, 2-2).
``I've seen them do this before _ they're on one of their
late-season rolls where they're just about unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams (7-2, 4-1 Western Athletic Conference) were certainly
that yesterday, and the main culprit was Eslinger _ a fifth-year
senior who waited four years to become the starter after the
graduation of Moses Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better than Moreno,'' said Franchione, after watching
Eslinger (25-of-36, no interceptions) carve TCU's secondary up with
370 yards and two touchdown passes, adding a 2-yard scoring run of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day where not much worked for the Frogs, who finally
looked more like rebuilders than contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they came in here determined to stop us on the
ground,'' said Colorado State tailback Damon Washington, ``because
every time they hit me in the first half, those defensive linemen
were telling me, `You're not gonna run today.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say much, because at the time it was true. But Ryan
took care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs contained the Rams pretty well on the ground, but
Eslinger was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had receivers open all day,'' he said. ``Our line kept
them off of me and they never sacked me. It's easy to complete
passes when that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The day wasn't much better offensively for the Frogs _ who
replaced starting quarterback Patrick Batteaux for the first time
this season. Kevin Colon and finally Jeff Dover ran the TCU attack
for the game's final 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eslinger moved the Rams 80 yards in two minutes midway through
the first quarter, scoring on a keeper with 7:21 remaining for a
6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Colon came into the game and moved TCU
crisply to the CSU 21 with tosses to Michael Crawford and Mike
Scarborough. But when he threw for Jason Illian at the goal line,
CSU's Jason Craft intercepted and returned it to the 10.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Rams rolled 90 yards, with Eslinger throwing 15
yards to Dallas Davis for the score. The only consolation for the
Frogs was that they blocked both extra-point kicks.
</P>
<P>
   But Eslinger soon had the Rams back _ this time on a 60-yard
drive capped by Washington's 5-yard run 25 seconds before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Fuller provided TCU with one bright moment in the third
quarter, picking up a CSU fumble and racing 65 yards to cut it to
19-7. But the defense had to play 10 minutes, 56 seconds in the
third quarter, and it soon began to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the Rams recovered two fumbles deep in TCU
territory, scored twice more on a 23-yard Eslinger pass and an
8-yard run by Duan Ruff, and added three Derek Franz field goals.

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton may find a measure of personal
and political redemption in the peace accord he helped broker for
the Middle East last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from what could become a triumph for his presidency,
Clinton continued down the path of atonement here Saturday as he
labored for dollars for Democrats and sought to boost the dicey
re-election chances of Sen. Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Only a day earlier, a weary and hoarse Clinton watched as
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat signed their names to an interim peace
accord that may be a step toward a lasting treaty between the two
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the peace process on track will require continued
courage by the Israelis and Palestinians in the months ahead,''
Clinton said in his weekly Saturday radio address. ``But this
agreement shows what is possible when the will for peace is strong.
And I'm proud that, together, we were able to make real progress.
America will continue to work for a just and lasting peace in this
land that is holy for so many people throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For nine days and at some considerable political risk, Clinton
used his presidential prestige to keep the factions at the
bargaining table at the Wye River conference center in Maryland,
spending more than 80 hours personally haggling with the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   It's a picture of a president at work that Democrats hope will
bolster their own election chances on Nov. 3 and one that White
House officials hope will strengthen the president's position as
the House begins an impeachment inquiry next month into charges
that Clinton lied about an extramarital affair and tried to cover
it up.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the second straight week that Clinton has
demonstrated that, though wounded by the impeachment threats, the
presidency remains a potent tool. His negotiations with the
Republican majority in Congress produced a budget agreement that
favors Democratic issues and sparked an internal feud among
Republican conservatives and the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, whose daughter is married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's
brother, repeatedly has welcomed the president to headline
fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton pointed to a more personal achievement in an address
about the negotiations Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that it was part of my job as president, my mission as
a Christian and my personal journey of atonement,'' Clinton told
the church leaders at the 160th anniversary of the Metropolitan
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington. ``And I am
grateful that God gave me the chance to do this for the last nine
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Celinda Lake suggested that the Middle East
agreement will allow Democrats to show how their party is working
to produce results while the Republican majority in Congress did
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's involvement in the peace accord shows he is
still doing his job. Where are the Republicans?'' Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican pollster Ed Goeas said Clinton's job approval
rating already is so high that he is unlikely to see a big boost
from the Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious how many times Bill Clinton can claim that he has
a peace agreement in the Middle East,'' complained Goeas. ``By my
count, this is about the fourth or fifth time that he's come
forward with some big signing and said this is a breakthrough. I
think it's wearing a little bit thin, quite frankly. People aren't
watching that closely.''
</P>
<P>
   But King Hussein of Jordan, Arafat and even Netanyahu, who has a
prickly relationship with Clinton, praised the president at the
crowded East Room signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I especially want to thank President Clinton,'' Netanyahu
said. ``He is, if I can borrow a cliche, he is a warrior for peace.
I mean, he doesn't stop. He has this ability to maintain a tireless
pace and to nudge and prod and suggest and use a nimble and
flexible mind to truly explore the possibilities of both sides, and
never just on one side. That is a gift, I think a precious and
unique one, and i served us well.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Djerejian, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel and
director of Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy,
said, ``I think to the extent the president acts presidential that
can only help him with his internal travails.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``The significance of the Wye Plantation accords
will be whether or not they serve as a gateway to comprehensive
status negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians; the
process cannot stop here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the so-called final status talks are to begin within 10
days as the two sides seek to resolve the most delicate of issues
remaining from their 1993 Oslo agreement such as the creation of a
Palestinian state and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be very important for the presidential
leadership to continue in the aftermath of the Wye agreements,
Djerejian said.

METS CLOSE DEAL WITH PIAZZA  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; changes byline)   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets and Mike Piazza, their All-Star catcher,
reached agreement Saturday on the richest contract in baseball
history, a seven-year deal for $91 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tells the fans that we appreciate the fact that they came
back to watch us play after we acquired Mike,'' said Nelson
Doubleday, co-owner of the Mets. ``They wanted a marquee player, we
needed a marquee player and we got them a marquee player. And when
the fans came back, we decided it was our turn to put that nickel
into the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza could not be reached for comment, but a close friend of
Piazza's said: ``Mike's happy. He's excited about the moves the
Mets are making.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those moves would be the re-signing of pitcher Al Leiter
to a four-year deal believed to be worth $32 million, which the
Mets apparently were on the verge of doing. ``We are extremely
close,'' Leiter said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday said: ``We needed Mr. Piazza. And we need Mr. Leiter.
And we're lucky enough to be in a market where we're able to afford
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza batted .328 with 32 home runs and 111 runs batted in last
season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Florida Marlins and the
Mets. After the Mets acquired him from the Marlins on May 22, he
hit .348 with 23 homers and 76 r.b.i. in 109 games.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Piazza makes it very likely that catcher Todd
Hundley, who has long been the Mets' popular player but struggled
badly this season after returning from elbow surgery, will be
elsewhere next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Todd Hundley, and the Mets are better off having him on
the team,'' Doubleday said of the former All-Star. ``But he's got a
career. And it would be difficult with him and Mike there together.
But we have no plans to put him at the end of the diving board and
bounce him out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley had said that he expected to be traded if the Mets
re-signed Piazza, which was why he requested a contract clause
limiting the teams he could be traded to. The clause, which the
Mets granted, allows Hundley to pick 12 teams to which he cannot be
dealt.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was eligible for free agency once the World Series ended,
but did not file. The Mets did not begin negotiations with him
until last Wednesday, but the talks progressed quickly, and
Saturday the two sides agreed on a contract that averages $13
million a year, including a $7.5 million, two-part signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza will receive salaries of $6 million in 1999, $11 million
in 2000, $12.5 million in 2001, $9.5 million in 2002, $14.5 million
in 2003 and $15 million in both 2004 and 2005, said a person
familiar with the negotiations. He will be paid $4 million of the
signing bonus in 1999 and the other $3.5 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The contract includes amenities such as a suite on the road and
a luxury box for games at Shea Stadium and a clause that limits the
teams to which Piazza can be traded. Piazza and the Mets will each
pick four teams, and if there is duplication, the Mets cannot
choose another team.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza surpassed pitcher Pedro Martinez of the Boston Red Sox,
who last December signed a six-year contract averaging $12.5
million a year, as the highest-paid player in baseball history.
Piazza earlier this year rejected the Los Angeles Dodgers' offer of
$84 million for six years, or $14 million a year _ $1 million a
year more than the deal he accepted from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether they could re-sign Piazza had hung over
the Mets while they fought, unsuccessfully, for a playoff berth
throughout the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza struggled at the plate with runners in scoring position
after he joined the Mets, and he was roundly booed at Shea Stadium,
putting in question his desire to stay with the team. But after the
Mets announced on Aug. 5 that they would postpone any contract
discussions with him until after the season, it appeared that he
began to relax. And for the last two months of the season Piazza
all but carried the Mets offensively, turning the boos to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley now appears to be the loser. Phillips promised Hundley
that he would not trade for Piazza three days before he did. Then
there damaging reports were leaked from within the Mets'
organization questioning Hundley's work and drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, in early June, Hundley began to work in the minor
leagues on learning how to play the outfield. But after 34 starts
in left field for the Mets, the experiment was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has two years left on a contract that has a guaranteed
payment of $11.7 million remaining. If other clubs are convinced
that Hundley is healthy and can catch without throwing problems,
the Mets should be able to get good value in return. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With an agreement in place with Piazza, Mets General Manager
Steve Phillips was next expected to finish negotiations with Alan
Hendricks, Leiter's agent. Leiter has sought a four-year, $32
million deal. Leiter said early Saturday that he and his agent had
not heard from Phillips since Wednesday, but speculated that the
general manager had been focusing on Piazza.

EXPLORER (Phoenix) _ Why is John Glenn fit enough for a physically

the near future _ particularly for young and midlife Americans who
are willing to learn a lifestyle lesson from him and the other
silver-haired Indiana Jones types like him. Some seniors may wonder
why the Ohio senator would even want to subject himself to all the
trouble and risk of his space flight. If they can't relate to his
excitement and sense of exploration, they probably aren't

JOHN FORCE MAY BE BEST DRAG RACER OF ALL TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS, Texas _ The numbers scream volumes about John Force,
seven-time NHRA Funny Car champion, longest-playing interview in
drag racing and arguably, the sport's greatest driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be the greatest talker out there. That's because I love
people,'' said Force, whose stream-of-consciousness outlook on life
is as much a part of his schtick as his grease-stained racing suit
and his incessant paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I am,'' said Force, 49, a Californian by
birth and a rambling man by design. ``The greatest drag racer? I
wouldn't take offense to it. I'd appreciate that. I'll take the
compliment. I ain't too proud to be humble.''
</P>
<P>
   With 69 career victories, Force is the winningest Funny Car
driver in the history of the National Hot Rod Association and
third-winningest in professional drag racing overall. Only retired
10-time Pro Stock champion Bob Glidden (85 victories) and reigning
and four-time Pro Stock champion Warren Johnson (71) have taken
more quarter-mile prisoners than Force.
</P>
<P>
   All seven of Force's Funny Car championships, and 64 of his
victories, have come during the 1990s, including the past five
titles in succession.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport in which the names of ``Big Daddy'' Don Garlits, Don
``The Snake'' Prudhomme, Tom ``The Mongoose'' McEwen and Ed ``The
Ace'' McCulloch are recalled with near-reverence, ``Brute'' Force
fits right in.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly where? Maybe at the head of the all-time starting
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I can say that . . . I have seven titles, maybe
eight,'' said Force, who will roll into final eliminations of the
13th annual Revell Nationals at the Texas Motorplex today with a
47-point lead over Ron Capps in the championship chase. ``Based on
that, you can say, `He's the greatest driver.' I believe that if
you lined up all the greatest drivers in the world, I don't know
who's the greatest in history. But I bet I could stand right with
them, and I'd be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Force locked up the No. 1 qualifying position with
the quickest elapsed time in Funny Car history, 4.787 seconds at a
track-record speed of 322.81 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Force said that 20 years ago, when he only dreamed about
strapping into a nitromethane-burning, 6,000-horsepower Funny Car,
he worshipped at the altars of Prudhomme and Kenny Bernstein. Not
surprisingly, they both won four NHRA Funny Car championships
during their careers before graduating into the Top Fuel ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really had a hero,'' said Force, a resident of Yorba
Linda, Calif. ``But I remember Don Prudhomme. I always thought Don
``The Snake'' Prudhomme was the greatest. Don Prudhomme was the bad
boy I could set my goals after. You want to make me go after a
title? Put Don Prudhomme back in a race car.
</P>
<P>
   ``And among the people I looked up to, Kenny Bernstein was a guy
I focused on on how to find money. Best guy at getting
\Rsponsorship\S money in the history of the sport _ Kenny
Bernstein, the Budweiser King.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said Force's army of sponsors for his two-car team is
proof of his business acumen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the respect for John because he is a great driver
and great for our sport,'' Bernstein said. ``Currently, John is at
the top of the list, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know about the greatest of all time. You've got to
clarify that. Do you mean driver in the cockpit or do you mean
popularity? I guess if you base it on the number of world
championships, Bob Glidden is the greatest drag racer of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said Force's run this decade certainly is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so what? Prudhomme owned the decade of the 1970s,'' said
Bernstein, a reference to Prudhomme's 35 career Funny Car victories
and championships from 1975-78. Similarly, Bernstein clicked off
consecutive Funny Car titles from 1985-88 and won 30 races in the
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owned the 1980s. So what?'' said Bernstein, who won the Top
Fuel championship in 1996 to become the first man to claim world
titles in both fuel classes. ``John's one of the greatest.
Absolutely, one of the greatest. Don't know if he is the greatest.
Don't know if there is a `the greatest,' to be honest about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Capps, who drives the Copenhagen Chevrolet Camaro Funny Car
owned by Prudhomme, said it would be difficult to rate Force ahead
of his car owner and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``John sure gives Snake a run for his money,'' Capps, 33, said.
``But you'd have to picture who you'd dread getting up and staging
a car against. I can't imagine getting up and staging a car against
Snake when he was on his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Prudhomme said he is flattered that Force holds him in such high
regard. But rating Force as the sport's greatest?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's stretching it, and with all due respect,'' said
Prudhomme, who retired in 1994 after a 29-year career in the
cockpit. ``Is John truly a champion? Yeah. But if you want to talk
about the greatest drag racer of all time, it has to be Garlits.''
</P>
<P>
   Prudhomme said Garlits, who posted 35 career Top Fuel victories,
completely changed the sport with the introduction of the
rear-engined dragster in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completely changed everything,'' Prudhomme said. ``And with
his bare hands. It was the closest thing to landing on the moon
that I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   On a different level, Force broke ground for drag racing in
1996, when he was voted driver of the year. It marked the first
time in the award's 30-year history that a drag racer had been
voted the outstanding motorsports performer over a field
traditionally dominated by NASCAR Winston Cup and Indy-car stars.
</P>
<P>
   Force said any number of his predecessors and peers, from
Glidden to Prudhomme to five-time Top Fuel champion Joe Amato,
could have won that award during their heydeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in all reality, I think there's a number of drivers that
could have done what I've done if they had the money, if they had
\Rcrew chief\S Austin Coil, if they had a company that backed them
for 12 years like Castrol,'' Force said. ``I'm not saying somebody
deserves it more. But in my world, if I win 10 titles, I'm not
going to stand up and say, `I'm the greatest.' After I leave, maybe
I'll say, `I'm the best.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And in 100 years, none of this is going to matter.''

DEFENSE HAS BEEN ZEROED IN AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MIAMI _ Gusty winds from the north, along with the first
``cold'' front of the season, blew in Friday over Miami. Also blown
in on the wind were snippets of news from the North that New
England was losing offensive players almost by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   The winds and temperatures in the 70s kept the beaches
relatively empty, but the news snippets brought joy to football
fans here. The Dolphins' defense has been exceptionally stingy at
home this season _ allowing only 7 points in three games _ and now
a depleted Patriots offense seemed less a threat than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, please,'' said Miami coach Jimmy Johnson, when asked about
the chances of a third straight home shutout. ``All I want to do is
get one more point than they get.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season started, it seemed that it would be the Patriot
defense that might be the best in the AFC East, if not the entire
AFC. The New England defense had finished last season in a blaze of
glory and the Patriots were hoping to carry that success into this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriot defense is far from what it was _ especially on
third downs _ while Miami's is even better than expected. If it
weren't for one fourth-down pass from Buffalo's Rob Johnson to Eric
Moulds, in Miami's first game of the year at Pro Player Stadium,
the Dolphins would have played three games here without allowing a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shutouts are so hard to come by in this league,'' said
linebacker Derrick Rodgers. ``You can't even think about getting
them, they're so rare. Anything can happen, a fumble down near our
goal line and things like that. But we've been playing really
good.''
</P>
<P>
   So well, in fact, that football historians need to go back a
full five seasons to find Miami's last shutout. And now they have
two this season and have gone 10 quarters, 146 opposing offensive
snaps, and 155 minutes and 20 seconds without allowing a point at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Johnson tells us not to make too much of the shutouts,''
said Rodgers. ``He says, `When people pat you on the back, they're
only trying to soften you up.' The thing is we were clicking on
those days and we were doing our jobs. We had everything together
those days; like I said, shutouts are very rare. We appreciate them
when we get shutouts and we approach every game where we want to
try to that _ but it's not going to happen every game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami defense is truly Johnson's signature on this team.
Just as he did in Dallas, Johnson has scoured the highways and
byways of America to find quick bodies who can make big plays _ he
doesn't want steady players, he wants playmakers _ and this speedy
group in Miami is exactly that. And, as was the case when the
Cowboys were forming into a Super Bowl-caliber unit, few of the
individuals are well-known. In Dallas, if you recall, Johnson
plucked Leon Lett out of Emporia State and Tony Tolbert out of
Texas-El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Zach Thomas, the best known of these Dolphins
defenders, was a fifth-round steal from Texas Tech, but defensive
end Jason Taylor, a third-round pick from Akron last year, has been
an explosive pass rusher and Jason Bromell, a fourth-round pick
this year from Clemson, has developed into a versatile tight end.
Rookie defensive end Kenny Mixon, a second-round choice, has been
strong in stopping the run while Daryl Gardener, a first-round pick
two years ago, has been very productive along with Tim Bowens at
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle in a few free agents, such as safety Brock Marion from
the Cowboys, and linebacker Robert Jones, a seven-year veteran from
St. Louis, and Johnson has a bunch of relative nobodies playing as
well as anybody. One final change was to shift the cornerbacks from
playing zone to more bump-and-run; Sam Madison and Terrell Buckley
now will press receivers on virtually every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed plays a factor in what we've been doing,'' said Rodgers.
``But I think it's more of a matter of us playing well together.
You got good guys in the middle doing a good job, anchoring in
there, and the guys on the outside are doing a good job getting up
the field, forcing the run plays back inside. And once the guys up
front are doing their jobs, us linebackers in the back are just
cleaning up.''
</P>
<P>
   The final factor, said Rodgers, is the input of the coaches _
the defensive game plans and the insistence by Johnson that hour
after hour be spent in film work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in here eight hours a day looking at films,'' said
Rodgers, ``trying to find those things that show us what offenses
are trying to do, trying to find little things, too, so nothing
surprises us on Sunday. We want to minimize the amount of plays
(opponents) will use that will be surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game against New England was supposed to be a test of
the defense's development. Buffalo was still offensively challenged
when it visited Miami and Pittsburgh (21-0 loss) was snagged in
offensive quicksand when it came here. But last week, the Dolphins
shut out the Rams, who had been piling up points. The only blot on
the defense was how Mark Brunell and Jacksonville ripped them apart
with long passes in a 28-21 loss up in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, as depleted as they are, remain ``one of the
better offensive teams in the league,'' said Johnson. ``So we're
going to have to be even better than we've been.''

   ``He even appointed an assistant who ritually offered up a live
baby chicken. Steve would look at the chick, turn thumbs down like
a Roman emperor, and then we'd all crowd around to watch the cruel,
ugly spectacle of the snake killing and eating the helpless bird.
Steve obviously understood the real psychological deal involved in
all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his interest in predators, or perhaps because of it,
Grice decided to study poetry and enrolled in the graduate writing
program at the University of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then I loved the work of Sylvia Plath,'' he said. ``It
had guts in it, blood and guts, real gritty stuff. She had the same
approach as the comic books which I liked as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I found Robert Frost. The darkness and suppressed
violence in Frost's work is probably closest to what I'm doing now.
Though it's not really his vision that grabbed me, it's his
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll take an insect and use it to open a door on the great
cosmological questions. But he doesn't turn the insect into an
abstraction. It's still an insect. I like that, because I'm an
empiricist. I don't like conclusions that aren't based on facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Grice began writing essays in 1993 while teaching a freshman
composition course at the University of Arkansas. His first
completed work, an essay on black widow spiders, was later
published in High Plains Review. A shorter version soon appeared in
Harper's, and that led to a book contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think writing is all about action and description,'' said
Grice, who is now working on a book about archaeological mysteries
uncovered in the panhandle region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a friend in the Arkansas writing program,'' he added,
``a guy from a top Eastern school, a real intellectual. But somehow
he could see through that whole game, and he came up with what he
called the `cool' test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was simple: How much cool stuff could you get on each page?
I liked that idea. Because no matter how much we intellectualize,
we all want cool things on the page.''

TAXPAYERS TAKE BACKSEAT TO THE IMF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The International Monetary Fund has more clout with the
U.S. Congress and the White House than the American taxpayer does.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems, because the spending package approved this week
provided $18 billion for the IMF. This was somewhat more than this
year's proposed tax relief that didn't survive the budget process.
</P>
<P>
   This defies understanding, because outside the capital Beltway
it's unlikely one American in 100 can tell you what the IMF is or
does.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. It's a good bet taxpayers would be more inclined to
resent taking a backseat to the IMF if they were acquainted with
the IMF's track record.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF came into being toward the end of World War II as a way
to keep from repeating the history of mistakes made after World War
I. Many historians think World War II resulted from the victors'
reluctance to help the vanquished return to prosperity after the
first war. This fostered the political instability that made
another world conflagration inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF was part of an accord that established an exchange rate
protocol and created access to financial assistance for countries
in need of a helping hand to promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   IMF supporters say the fact that a third world war has been
avoided is proof of IMF success. If it didn't exist, they claim,
world leaders would have to invent it to deal with the current
spate of global economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds plausible, but detractors say the successes came in
spite of the IMF, rather than because of it. Their contention is
that the postwar liberalization of world trade led to the economic
harmony that kept warring inclinations at bay.
</P>
<P>
   One study shows that of 137 mostly emerging economies receiving
IMF aid from 1965 to 1995, fewer than one-third made it to economic
independence from the IMF. More recently, critics point to the
rathole Russia has become for IMF money and how more than $100
billion in IMF assistance to Asia has failed to revive its ailing
economies.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, market-oriented economists find the IMF anathema
because its policies discourage economic vitality and thus tend to
make beneficiaries more dependent on its help. Some typical
IMF-dictated nostrums are higher taxes, higher interest rates,
currency devaluations and support of the status quo that often
perpetuates ``crony capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of such, one of the best arguments against continued
taxpayer support for the IMF is the fact that it is much loved by
corporate America in general and the banking sector in particular.
This isn't surprising, because banks are the biggest beneficiaries
of IMF bailouts, which tend to also soften the investment risk made
by other U.S. companies in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Since corporations are major sources of campaign finance
support, this helps explain why so many Washington powerful
political leaders are eager to help the IMF get into Uncle Sam's
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Many skeptical Republicans in Congress capitulated to demands
for more IMF aid in the budget process because GOP leadership
feared being blamed for more global economic problems. Such claims
would have been invalid, but few were willing to face such charges
in the big election of 2000, when the White House comes up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it was an easy political call given the fact that
there's no political price to pay for denying relief to the
American taxpayers who make the IMF's largess possible.

WRITER FINDS KILLER CREATURES FASCINATING _ EVEN FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUYMON, Okla. _ This midsize town in the heart of the Oklahoma
panhandle is home to hog ``factories,'' high-booted cattlemen and
one nationally known author, a man named Gordon Grice, who writes
with rare talent about things his neighbors consider chillingly
strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hunt black widow spiders,'' is the opening line of Grice's
first book, The Red Hourglass _ Lives of the Predators, a
collection of unusual nature essays published last spring and
greeted by ecstatic though somewhat tremulous reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elegant, morbidly fascinating,'' declared Richard Bernstein in
The New York Times. ``Mr. Grice's account of the world of predators
will make you look under your bed at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Grice is the ``Stephen King of nonfiction,'' opined another
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Such accolades both delighted and slightly disturbed Grice, a
33-year-old husband, father, poet and community college teacher who
does not view himself as a Gothic-prone oddity whose role in life
is to frighten people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a working writer,'' he said recently. ``And I choose to
write seriously about the things that interest me.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the things that fascinated him as child and
teen-ager were the small, deadly creatures he found in the yards,
cellars and crevices of his hometown of Guymon. What he couldn't
find in town, he sought on the surrounding short-grass prairie, a
dramatic landscape dotted with yucca and sage.
</P>
<P>
   He captured black widows, tarantulas, brown recluse spiders,
even rattlesnakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I risked my life just for fun,'' he said, ``and only
later did I figure out that I could make some dough out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Early one evening several weeks ago, as dusk came to Guymon,
Gordon Grice, wearing jeans and cowboy boots, went hunting in a
small park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do this a few times a year at most now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his old stalking skills remain, and he quickly saw an
abandoned black widow web beneath a playground seesaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' he murmured before striding off toward the park's
primitive rest room. ``An outhouse is the best place to catch
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the dilapidated, odoriferous and eerily dark facility,
Grice shone a flashlight around until he found a sloppy lacework of
spider silk stretched across a gaping hole in the masonry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm, that looks suspicious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, friendly man, Grice habitually laces his conversation
with matter-of-fact comments that do not always comfort his
companions.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, for example, he mentioned that a 1950s survey of
Texas doctors indicated that 90 percent of all black widow bites
occurred in outhouses.
</P>
<P>
   As to the effect of a black widow bite, ``well,'' he said,
``some doctors diagnose it by asking, `Is this the worst pain
you've ever felt?'''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the bite is almost never fatal, because of the
development of an antivenin, and that the excruciating pain it
brings is caused by a stunningly potent neurotoxin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems to flip a switch that opens all the body's neuro
pathways,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most harrowing sections in Grice's book details the
experience of an Alabama physician named Allan Blair who, in the
interest of medical research, subjected himself to a black widow's
bite in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Blair soon was locked in a fetal position, gasping for breath,
groaning and trembling uncontrollably, beginning to hallucinate,
his entire body racked with agony.
</P>
<P>
   And that, said Grice, is because the widow's poison is thousands
of times more powerful than necessary for its own purposes, an
anomaly that led him to ponder the existence of ``a motiveless evil
in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently undeterred by such dire speculation, at least at that
moment in the park, he reached toward the web near the outhouse
floor and deftly tore one corner with his finger. The ripping
filament made a distinctive sound, a sound that Grice first heard
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 6, my mother took my sister and me to the cellar of
our farmhouse,'' he wrote, ``and told us to watch as she killed a
widow...narrating her technique in exactly the hushed voice she
used for discussing religion or sex.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Gloria Grice, made her children pay close attention
as she first raked the spider's silk with a stick. It was thus they
learned to identify the unique crackling, parchment-ripping noise
that identifies a widow's lair.
</P>
<P>
   And that was precisely the sound Grice heard once again as he
parted the outhouse web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, this is a widow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when no spider appeared, Grice decided to give up the
night's search.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is,'' he wrote, ``that my fascination is rooted in
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Another truth, he added later, ``is that I never fit in very
well around here. I was a naturalist and skeptic even as a child. I
didn't talk about it, because that would have made my family
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   His family is devoutly religious and inclined toward
creationism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was very young, I began to feel a generalized anger at
what I saw as the injustice and hypocrisy in the world. Science
became my secret alternative religion.''
</P>
<P>
   And in that self-created, questioning world, his terror of
deadly things was transmuted into wary fascination. He began
collecting black widows to study how they killed and ate their
prey. But he never pretended, even to himself, that his interest in
predation was totally objective or scientific.
</P>
<P>
   He illustrated that insight with a pointed story.
</P>
<P>
   When he was an undergraduate at Oklahoma State University, one
of his dormitory mates, a man named Steve Ridgway, kept an 11-foot
python in his room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both lived on what was known as the `cowboy floor,' &UR; '' said
Grice, ``you know, filled with rural clod kickers like me. And once
every two weeks Steve would put on a toga and a laurel wreath, and
summon all the guys to his room for the python's feeding. MORE

VISITORS CENTER OPENS AT CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELD _ IN KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANTON, Kan. _ Even as the battles were being fought, people
elsewhere downplayed conflicts in these parts as the backwater of
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say this wasn't the thinking of the 2,500 Union
soldiers and 7,000 Confederate troops who clashed Oct. 25, 1864, at
the Battle of Mine Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The grand opening Saturday of a visitors center was to mark
another step in a century-long movement to bring more recognition
to the confrontation that took place about 60 miles south of the
Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scholars have been concentrating on the war in the east since
the war ended. The new ground is not there to be broken,'' said Kip
Lindberg, site curator for the State Historical Society. ``The new
ground for scholarship is out west.''
</P>
<P>
   Mine Creek didn't have big names like Grant and Lee, or the
bloodshed of Shiloh, but it was an important battle because it
ended the Confederates' hopes in the west.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate troops were led by Gen. Sterling Price, a former
Missouri governor and a hero of the Mexican War. Price's detractors
said he had ``the roar of a lion, the spring of a guinea pig.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 19, 1864, Price and his men crossed the Arkansas border
into Missouri on horseback, hoping to draw the attention of Union
troops farther east and south. Historians believe Price's goal was
to win Missouri over to the Confederacy, and if not, at least
return with recruits and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Union army, of course, had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Price had intended to take the Union supply center in St. Louis
but changed course and veered toward Jefferson City, Mo. The
Confederates did some damage but failed to take the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Price then set his sights on the supply post at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., but Kansas called out a militia of 16,000 to
help guard the border. To the east, Union Gen. Alfred Pleasonton's
cavalry division was in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   (The town of Pleasanton is named for the general, although it
spells its name differently. Not even Ola May Earnest, for 18 years
the president of the Linn County Historical Society, knows how that
came to be.)
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 23, Confederate and Union troops fought at Westport in
what is now Kansas City, Mo., and Price's troops began to retreat
southward into Kansas, burning and pillaging as they went.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being pursued by Pleasonton and Gen. Samuel Curtis, the
Confederates dragged along a wagon train of plunder, a herd of
cattle and a flock of sheep.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate trek south was plodding, and 100 men were taken
prisoner Oct. 24 as they crossed the Marais des Cygnes River. Some
wagons and cattle were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Six miles south, the Confederates stalled again at Mine Creek,
struggling to scale the creek's steep southern bank with horses and
wagons. This set the stage for the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Frederick Benteen arrived with the Union vanguard Oct.
25 and ordered an attack. The cavalry charge, complete with blaring
bugles and drawn sabers, quickly broke the Confederate line.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rebels enjoyed a huge numerical advantage, Union
troops were better-trained and carried superior weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Confederates were on the run, and they were exhausted,''
Lindberg said. ``They'd been in the saddle for days on end with no
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle lasted just 30 minutes. About 300 Confederate
soldiers died, 300 were wounded and 600 were captured, including
two generals.
</P>
<P>
   The Union casualties were much lighter: 15 dead and 110 wounded.
One man was captured, but he escaped two days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Union victory also saved Fort Scott, Kan., farther south,
from attack.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in greater detail at the 280-acre battlefield
site and 3,000-square-foot visitors center, which will include an
exhibit, a gift shop and a meeting room. Eventually, Lindberg wants
to offer a video or a slide presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The goal at the site, Lindberg said, is to tell the story from
the viewpoint of the men who fought the battle, not just the
generals.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the $460,000 visitors center began in April and
was supposed to be finished last month. Lindberg said, however,
that weather and other hitches would delay completion a few weeks.
About 50 percent of the exhibit was to be in place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're done, it will not only be something the historical
society can be proud of, but also the descendants of the men who
fought here,'' said Lindberg, who formerly worked for the National
Park Service at Wilson's Creek National Battlefield near
Springfield, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the money for the visitors center came from
the U.S. Department of Transportation, the rest from the state. The
Civil War Round Table of Kansas City, a longtime proponent of a
battlefield park, donated $10,000 for exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The movement to establish a park at Mine Creek dates to the
1890s, when local Civil War veterans made a request. Nothing much
happened until 1974, when the state historical society acquired 120
acres. An additional 160 acres were purchased in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early '90s the land was returned to its
native state with the planting of prairie grasses. In 1989 the
125th anniversary of the battle was commemorated with a
re-enactment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to Kansas, because this is the Civil
War battle in Kansas between uniformed troops,'' said Steve
Treaster of Shawnee, Kan., a former president of the round table.
``Everything else in Kansas was basically guerrilla activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the visitors center is the realization of a dream
for Earnest. The county historical society's museum in Pleasanton
has battle artifacts on display, including cannonballs and
bayonets. It wasn't open Saturday, though.
</P>
<P>
   At the battlefield, a walking trail goes through gently rolling
prairie grassland and a wooded area. MORE

Lockout impacts NBA veterans, rookies in different ways
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the 100th day of playing lockout limbo, Anfernee Hardaway was
more than a little antsy. His left knee, having cost him most of
last season, was almost all the way back, and there was only so
much he could do to test it in rehabilitation and workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway needed NBA-quality competition. Memphis pickup games
would not do. And the StairMaster might as well have been the rack.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the offseason bled into October, well into the part
of the calendar that announces the start of training camps, the NBA
players who fill the Rockets' Westside Tennis Club basketball court
and weight room needed another jolt of change. Workouts were
beginning to become work. Defenders were willing to back off and
watch dunks. A transfusion of new blood was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to check out a new guy in the game,'' former
Rockets guard Tim Breaux said. ``And when it's one of the big
names, you want to see what he's got, and what you got against
somebody like that. It gets everybody going.''
</P>
<P>
   First time down the court, players instinctively clear for
Breaux to take Hardaway to the basket. With a spin in the lane,
Breaux flips in a layup. And within seconds, Hardaway has the ball
and the baseline and is in full flight at Breaux.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, games are serious. On many days, defense is occasional
and a Shaquille O'Neal will post up only when the score is close to
seven and possession of the court is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, Mario Elie fouls hard to deny a layup. Players
shout instructions at rookies-in-waiting Rashard Lewis and Ansu
Sesay. Robert Horry is driving the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway takes an outlet pass, looks left and tosses a
three-quarters-of-the court soft bounce pass under the reach of two
defenders to a sprinting Lewis. Elie rebounds on one end and
finishes a break on the other. Darvin Ham catches a rebound
somewhere ridiculously above the rim, pumps and slams it in with
the dunk that shattered an NCAA Tournament backboard.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, games would slide back to more routine, and
then with Friday's influx of talent brought in for the Gallery
Furniture Charity Basketball Game, pick up again. But every day,
there is every level of NBA talent, stars and hopefuls, rookies
waiting for their first days in the real league and veterans hoping
for a few more.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout and labor impasse between the NBA players and owners
put every career on hold, but cannot begin to affect every career
in the same way. For every Anfernee Hardaway waiting to
re-establish himself as one of the league's marquee stars, there's
a Tim Breaux waiting to claim one of its cherished spots. For every
Othella Harrington waiting to cash in on dues he has paid, there is
a Rashard Lewis finding out how many are in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The star
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway hated last season. He hated not playing. He hated
whispers of doubts about his knee.
</P>
<P>
   There would be an answer, though. It would be this season. He
missed all but 19 games last season. But this season he would be
healthy and he would be back.
</P>
<P>
   And now this season might never come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating for me,'' Hardaway said. ``Because I'm one of
the few players that hadn't played all season, (the wait) is even
longer for me. Even though it's helping my knee, it's hurting my
play. I want to get back in the groove and get back used to playing
games at 7:30 instead of working out and rehabbing my knee all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more at stake than testing Hardaway's patience. After
one more season with the Magic, he would be a free agent. No matter
what system emerges from the current stare down, Hardaway has one
season to prove his knee sound and his game as spectacular as ever
before testing the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one year away,'' Hardaway said. ``I'm for whatever the
free agents are going to get. Most of the guys that are free agents
work hard. They deserve whatever the owners are willing to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``My knee is probably 90, 95 percent. I think I can be the
player, and an even better player than I ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is, he will also be expected to help heal whatever wounds
the work stoppage leaves. With Michael Jordan considering
retirement, and so many of the league's trademark stars from
Charles Barkley to Karl Malone to Patrick Ewing close behind,
Hardaway will be among the players expected to be basketball's Mark
McGwire or Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, that hangs over Hardaway's head as another nagging
reminder there is work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of guys emerging as superstars now that Michael
and Charles and those guys are (close to) retiring,'' Hardaway
said. ``Even though I have been out of the scene for a whole year I
think I can come back and play good basketball and hopefully spark
people to watch basketball again.''
</P>
<P>
   The free agent
</P>
<P>
   Harrington waited and worked for his chance. He played little
behind the Rockets' inside trio of Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin Willis
and Barkley, but he honed his talents and showed his potential.
</P>
<P>
   When Willis was traded after last season, minutes seemed to open
up for Harrington with the Rockets. And if that did not pan out, he
was a free agent with a growing reputation as a player ready for
regular playing time.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't carry a team, and his next contract would set no
records. But he had proved he belonged. It was time to find out
where.
</P>
<P>
   But as a free agent with little leverage, the signing frenzy
that is expected to follow the lockout's end will leave Harrington
with little time to be choosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My situation would have been a lot better if the lockout never
happened,'' Harrington said. ``Now, I just have to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to look at my situation and make the best decision
for me. I love it here, but as we all see, it's a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington would seem to fit into the category of players most
valuable to their present team. With little time to break in a new
pair of shoes, never mind new players, teams are expected to look
first at players familiar with their systems. For the Rockets, with
just four players under contract, this could be especially true.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrington has waited to play the field. This is his time,
even if his time is standing still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure a person is not going to come in the first day and pick
up the scheme and all of (Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich's)
philosophies of basketball,'' Harrington said. ``But you have a
whole season to pick up on that. And this coaching staff is great,
one of the most prepared and one of the most helpful. They're going
to make sure you have all the information you need to be ready and
go out there and perform well and not look bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big man can always do the things that a big man does. You're
not going to have a problem if you can rebound, run the floor, help
on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The journeyman
</P>
<P>
   For two seasons, Breaux was in the league. He was not in for
long, but drew paychecks long enough to know what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux, one of the Rockets' Continental Basketball Association
discoveries, played for the Rockets for two seasons before he was
traded to Vancouver. He was waived before the next season would
begin. After six games with the Bucks, he was waived again.
</P>
<P>
   But the start of every season brings another training camp and
another chance to stick _ every season but this season. Instead,
the hope is that in the rush to sign players, a chance will come
and this time it will be the chance that lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when it gets done, a lot of teams will be wheeling and
dealing, having to get players real quick,'' Breaux said. ``I think
they'll go with guys with more experience, experience with a team.
I hope that can help somebody like me. I would like to come back
here. But who knows how things will work out?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard guys talk about Europe, but not many. Now, I think
a lot more guys will be serious about going over there now because
of the ruling and they're not getting paid soon. I think you'll see
a lot more guys go over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been considering it for a long time. I'm waiting for a
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie
</P>
<P>
   Lewis could have been playing. He could be working with coaches,
honing skills with other gifted teen-agers on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he chose to make the jump from Elsik High School to the
NBA, waited through the entire first round until his selection by
the SuperSonics in the second round, and then kept on waiting for
the career he did not want to wait to start to finally begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any second thoughts about my decision,'' Lewis
said. ``I stay with my decision 100 percent. It will still be OK.
One day, I will be in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis knew the lockout was a possibility when he made his
decision. But that day didn't seem so far away when he decided he
wanted his first day in the NBA to come as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting through 31 NBA draft picks was horrible. This is worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the lockout would be over by now,'' he said. ``The
only thing I can do is to keep playing every day, work on my
mistakes and keep working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has been helping me out, showing me things and
talking to me. I'm going to keep coming out here every day and keep
working on my game. It's really helping me. I can tell I'm getting
better at some things. I'm learning. I don't know if I would be
doing better if I was with my team working. But I don't think about
that. I don't have any second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is make the best of the situation and keep
working.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all any of his new peers can do. They work out and wait,
and every now and then, just to keep things interesting, clear out
one side of the court to test each other's mettle.

Players cite competition, financial advantages as reasons for
living in Houston
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Nick Van Exel had no intention of ever living in Texas again. It
was enough that his work would force him to visit the state's three
largest cities. That was beyond his control as his employer, the
Los Angeles Lakers, insisted he play in every NBA city.
</P>
<P>
   But the offseason was his, and he would spend none of it in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam Cassell would sooner give up the ball in the backcourt
than his chamber of commerce sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept on me, telling me I had to move to Houston, I had to
check it out,'' said Van Exel, now with the Denver Nuggets. ``Sam
can get anybody to do just about anything he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is, I went to Trinity Valley Junior College in
Athens, Texas. It was the worst two years of my life and I thought
I would never live in the state of Texas again, not knowing what
the state was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   He found out that with everything it is about, it is also
becoming perhaps the most popular home for NBA talent, most not
needing Cassell's talent for persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is not to NBA players what Los Angeles is to actors or
New York is to cabdrivers. A few dozen players live in the Houston
area.
</P>
<P>
   But most players in the area believe Houston has surpassed Los
Angeles as the home base for NBA players. And there is no question
it is the fastest-growing choice as a home in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The championships made Houston a basketball city,'' former
Rockets guard Kenny Smith said. ``People could see the open arms
like at Westside (Tennis Club). There are four or five places that
treat you with open arms like this. Guys feel comfortable coming
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an athletic city. It's geared to what you want to do. The
championships brought that out. You had guys like myself, Sam
Cassell, Vernon Maxwell that play every day. Hakeem (Olajuwon) used
to come most of the time. So there were five guys in the gym. Then
we started calling people. And then it caught like fire.''
</P>
<P>
   And the reason NBA players flock to the Houston area is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has a lot of attractions for whatever you're
attracted to,'' Spurs guard Avery Johnson said. ``I moved here
because of my church and because they have a lot of gospel music
concerts here, and the school systems in Fort Bend County. For
other guys, it may be something else. But whatever you're
interested in, they have it in town.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA players living in the Houston area include the Lakers'
Shaquille O'Neal and Robert Horry, the Jazz's Chris Morris, the
Wizards' Otis Thorpe, the Suns' Mark Bryant and almost all of the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local guys, guys that played for the Rockets or played at the
University of Houston, used to play down at Fonde (Recreation
Center),'' former Rockets player Rodney McCray said. ``Now there's
guys in town from all over the NBA, and not just the NBA, but Major
League Baseball, and the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of guys who live here that don't play for the
local teams. A lot of guys you run into at the restaurants, the
movie theaters, the bowling alleys. I ask, `What are you doing in
town, are you visiting somebody?' And they'll say, `I've been
living here four or five years.'''
</P>
<P>
   And for all the factors that draw players to the area, many are
drawn to what Houston does not have, a state income tax.
</P>
<P>
   But this is something of an overrated factor, several players
said. Some states will assess income tax to employees of companies
in their state. Several states with NBA teams tax visiting players
for games they play in their state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lack of an income tax, a healthy economy and low
housing costs for players often buying first homes appeal to
players, and the word has spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically, it's an advantage to live here,'' Johnson said.
``There's no state income taxes and it's not as expensive as some
of those other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Players cite everything from the nightlife to the attitude
toward pro athletes, but the overwhelming reason given is the
growing collection of NBA talent.
</P>
<P>
   The reputation has spread quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Said rookie Keyon Clark of the offseason competition: ``This is
the best run anywhere. This is where I'll live, as soon as I start
getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to play against guys on a consistent basis that I
perform against in the league,'' Johnson said. ``That's the only
way I can get better. I love going over to Rice University and
working out with the team. But over here (Westside) is where guys
like Nick Van Exel and Sam Cassell are. Those are guys I need to
battle to keep my game sharp. It used to be Fonde and now it's at
Westside. But there's always good competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time another player makes that discovery, more are lured.
There are still plenty of opportunities to work out with NBA
players in Los Angeles. New York, Chicago and Atlanta can put
together their share of NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   But Cassell said: ``There's more competition here than anywhere.
You can't beat this. A lot of guys are wise to the finances and
that it's just a great place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they are not, he has been known to tell them.

KINGS LOOK FOR HEALTHY GOALIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The Kings made it through Saturday with no
injuries to their goaltenders, possibly their most important
accomplishment to date this season.
</P>
<P>
   It probably helped that they didn't have a game, didn't
practice, and simply had to sit on an airplane to fly from Tampa to
Greensboro for this afternoon's game against the Carolina
Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said Manny Legace probably will make his
third start in goal as the Kings (2-2-2) attempt to snap an 0-1-2
skid while playing the third game of their five-game trip. He'll be
backed up by Ryan Bach, who saw his first NHL action Friday in
relief of Legace, who suffered a mild concussion midway through a
3-2 loss to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are scheduled to skate this morning. Goalie Stephane
Fiset will practice, as he did on Friday. He is believed to be
close to returning from his week-old groin strain. Jamie Storr, who
also suffered a groin strain a week ago, is still listed as
week-to-week.
</P>
<P>
   But so far Legace has done the job for the Kings, stopping 63 of
65 shots (96.9 percent) with a 1.24 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   Quick pickup: Goaltending coach Don Edwards said the Kings had
been seeking to improve their depth in net even before Fiset and
Storr were injured. They'd been looking for help since losing
Frederic Chabot to Montreal in the waiver draft on Oct.5.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said Bach was someone the Kings had been interested in
for a while. Edwards watched Bach play for Houston in the IHL last
season and was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's got an upside to him,'' Edwards said. ``He's
still fairly young and he fits in well with our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bach didn't make his NHL debut until Friday, two days
after his 25th birthday, Edwards said goaltenders take longer to
develop than skaters and Bach's age should not be held against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forwards and defensemen can get away with mistakes,'' Edwards
said. ``Goaltenders are the last line of defense. It's a longer
process of gaining experience and learning a few aspects of the
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Until being acquired from the Detroit organization by the Kings,
Bach had been stuck below four other goalies on the Red Wings'
crowded depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Powerless play: The much-touted power-play defensive tandem of
Rob Blake and Steve Duchesne lasted exactly four games. In the
fifth game, Wednesday's 1-1 tie at Florida, Duchesne sat out with a
slight groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth game _ Friday's loss _ Robinson used Doug Bodger at
the point with Blake, a change he said probably was not temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just find with Blake and Duchesne, both are thinking
offense,'' Robinson said. ``I'd rather have somebody who can play
offensively and still think defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' power play was 0 for 4 against Tampa Bay, and they
allowed a shorthanded goal. The Kings are 3 for 29 with the man
advantage this season, a decline from last season's mediocrity and
a major disappointment so far _ given that the power play was an
area Robinson targeted for improvement during the offseason.

TENSE DEBATE FOR D'AMATO AND SCHUMER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato and Rep. Charles E. Schumer
met Saturday night in their first debate, a tense and uneasy
stand-off in which D'Amato hammered Schumer for his attendance
record in Congress, while Schumer portrayed D'Amato as an
untrustworthy legislator who had embarrassed New York and
repeatedly voted with Republicans against the state's interests.
</P>
<P>
   For 59 minutes, standing behind lecterns in a television studio
in Schenectady, N.Y., the Republican senator and his Democratic
challenger used the first of what will be only two debates to
present to a statewide audience the cases that have, until now,
been made in the form of 30-second commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer sadly has put his political ambitions over the
people's needs,'' D'Amato said grimly, peering over the top of his
glasses. ``There's one fundamental fact in this election, and that
is that he's missed more votes in 12 months than I've missed in 12
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said the election came down to one word: ``The word that
will make the difference is trust. New Yorkers want to know who to
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate came just over a week before the conclusion of what
has become one of the most closely watched contests in the nation,
and most public polls show it to be a dead heat. D'Amato agreed to
only two debates; the second will be broadcast live at 1 p.m. on
Sunday on WNBC, Channel 4.
</P>
<P>
   With the race so close _ and Schumer, a Brooklyn congressman,
still not well known in many parts of the state _ the meeting
between the two men was tensely anticipated by aides to both
candidates. And from the start, neither candidate left any doubt
about what he hoped to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato turned to Schumer's attendance record within 20 seconds
of starting his opening statement. And he stuck to that one topic
ferociously, turning almost every question _ from his opinion on
whether President Clinton should be impeached to government support
for breast cancer research _ into another attack on the votes
Schumer has missed this year. Again and again, he listed the number
of committee and floor votes Schumer missed while campaigning,
asserting that Schumer had put his political advancement ahead of
his Congressional obligations.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato _ who referred to Schumer as ``Chuck,'' while the
congressman called him ``Senator D'Amato'' _ tried to goad Schumer
into discussing the one issue that the senator's advisers have
concluded could help him survive one of the most difficult
challenges of his life in public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you miss 110 votes in Congress?'' D'Amato demanded. ``Yes
or no? Have I misstated the record? I'd like to know.''
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato's efforts to engage Schumer on the subject for the
most part failed. Schumer did not dispute D'Amato's argument that
he missed many votes this year while campaigning, but said that his
lifetime voting record was 92 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And he rebutted D'Amato by reading from endorsements from
Newsday _ ``Your own hometown newspaper,'' Schumer noted with more
than a little glee, glancing up from the clipping _ and The Buffalo
News that described D'Amato's attacks on Schumer's voting record as
unrevealing of Schumer's record of accomplishment in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer largely stuck to the themes that his advisers believe
could turn the election: That D'Amato was a senator who did not
keep his word and who was more conservative than the electorate of
the state. Schumer criticized D'Amato for supporting the Contract
with America, which called for deep cuts in federal aid that would
have to New York social programs, and for opposing abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   And Schumer took note of an incident that occurred last week
that caused D'Amato some embarrassment and that was the subject of
the first question of the night: D'Amato's use of a Yiddish slur to
belittle Schumer and his description of Rep. Jerrold L. Nadler, a
Manhattan Democrat who is overweight, as ``Jerry Waddler.'' D'Amato
first denied having used the slur, but later acknowledged he had,
after friends of his who had been in the room confirmed the
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of a series of embarrassing incidents that we have
had from the senator through his 18 years and of not owning up to
the truth,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men shook hands as they entered the WRGB studios, but
not at the end. And their demeanors were markedly different
throughout. D'Amato, who can be humorous and charming, was scolding
and unsmiling Saturday night as he attacked Schumer unceasingly and
at a rapid-fire pace. Schumer, who is making his first run for
statewide office, was awkward at first, but by the end became
relaxed and expansive, smiling frequently.

AGGIES SURVIVE LAST GASP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jimmy Burch 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ In a series heavy on heart-stopping
finishes, many of them tinged with judgment calls by officials
during crunch time, it was Texas A&AMP;M's turn to breathe a deep sigh
of relief yesterday in Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-ranked Aggies squeezed past No. 25 Texas Tech, 17-10,
to retain sole possession of first place in the Big 12 South
Division standings. But the Aggies (7-1, 4-0) could not be
confident they had broken a three-game losing streak to the Red
Raiders (6-2, 3-2) until they were certain field judge Larry Weeks
ruled Tech receiver Donnie Hart out of bounds on a catch in the A&AMP;M
end zone with 1:40 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Hart outleaped A&AMP;M cornerback Sedrick Curry and made the grab on
the third-down play, but Weeks said both players came down out of
bounds, nullifying a potential touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I disagree with him,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Curry credited Weeks with making ``a great call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His foot came down on the line. I knew he was out of bounds,
but it was close,'' Curry said. ``I got excited when the ref
started waving his arms'' to signal an incompletion.
</P>
<P>
   Tech had another chance to tie the game, but Derek Dorris, a
former Azle High School standout, couldn't grab Peters' throw to
the corner of the end zone on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   By the narrowest of margins, A&AMP;M posted the latest victory in a
series that has seen the past five meetings decided by a touchdown
or less. The Aggies did so on a day when the offense gift-wrapped
10 points with first-half turnovers but overcame those gaffes with
a pair of pivotal passes.
</P>
<P>
   One came off a fake field goal, when holder Shane Lechler found
tight end Dan Campbell alone in the end zone for an 8-yard
touchdown to cap a 74-yard march in the first quarter. The other
came on a 55-yard strike from quarterback Randy McCown to tailback
Dante Hall in the final two minutes of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The play moved the ball to the Tech 6-yard line, setting up
Hall's eventual 1-yard touchdown run with 50 seconds remaining in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the A&AMP;M offense suffered through its least productive
afternoon (232 yards, 3.4 per snap) since McCown became the
starting quarterback Oct. 3 against Kansas. The Tech offense (205
yards, 3.7 per play) was equally ineffective, failing to cross the
A&AMP;M 38-yard line without benefit of a turnover until the final
drive of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our offense played, they should have beat us,'' said
McCown, who lost two fumbles, threw an interception and completed
just three of 10 passes for 71 yards. ``But our defense played
great. They saved us. Any time you can play as poorly as our
offense did and still come out with a win, it says a lot about what
kind of character your team has.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown put that character to the test by fumbling the initial
snap of the game, setting up the Red Raiders for a field-goal drive
that covered minus-4 yards. Tech's other scoring drive, a 35-yard
march, also was set up by a McCown fumble.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies managed to swing some of the early momentum back in
their direction when Lechler found Campbell on the fake field goal
on fourth-and-three from the Tech 8. The Aggies added the play
during Thursday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when we called it. But I couldn't have been more
open,'' said Campbell, a Glen Rose High School graduate. ``It
seemed like it took the ball 30 minutes to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lechler's pass finally arrived, just as Hall finally barreled
into the end zone to complete a 61-yard march in the final minute
of the first half, giving A&AMP;M a 14-10 lead at intermission. Russell
Bynum's 24-yard field goal upped the margin to 17-10 with 9:47
remaining, setting the stage for Tech's longest drive of the game
(10 plays, 50 yards) on the Red Raiders' final possession.
</P>
<P>
   That ended in heartache, however, when Hart _ limited to a
season-low two catches for 34 yards _ was ruled out of bounds on
the game's most pivotal play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just football. I'm not going to complain about the call
in the end zone,'' Tech coach Spike Dykes said. ``Sometimes those
calls go your way, sometimes they don't. This was a tough game, a
tough loss.''
</P>
<P>
   For A&AMP;M, of course, it kept the Aggies on a beeline toward a
possible berth in the Dec. 5 league championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race isn't over,'' coach R.C. Slocum said. ``But at least
we've got a little breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the chance to breathe the latest sigh of relief
in a series filled with them.

JUST CALL HIM GOOD OL' JOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The square-jawed, baby-faced college quarterback throws for more
than 300 yards and a couple touchdowns on Saturday afternoon to
lead the No. 1-ranked team in the country to another victory.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he goes out to dinner with Mom and Dad, whom he
doesn't get to see nearly enough. After a balanced meal that
includes all five food groups, he returns home to hit the sack
early and sleeps eight hours before attending church services.
Because, gee, there's another big game next week, and a fella has
to take care of himself.
</P>
<P>
   This is not taken from the dust jacket of a Clair Bee novel,
where the hero is always clean-cut and respectful.
</P>
<P>
   This is Joe Germaine's life, which only sounds as if it were
taken from a corny kid's book written in the pre-Nintendo era.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine, the starting quarterback for the top-rated Ohio State
Buckeyes, lives a life that is so wholesome it makes Wally Cleaver
look like a felon.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine, from Mesa, is devoted to his family, including parents
Joe and Phillis. He is a devout member of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Signs autographs. Enjoys interviews.
Says all the right things. Never shows up opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two boys,'' Ohio State quarterbacks coach Tim Salem
said, ``and I sure hope they grow . . .'' Well, you know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yeah, Germaine isn't a bad quarterback. As a senior this
season, he has completed nearly 63 percent of his passes for 1,863
yards and 14 touchdowns and has been intercepted only four times.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to mention him as a Heisman Trophy candidate _ and
he's as worthy as anyone _ that's fine with him, but he's more
concerned about winning the last five games and playing for a
national title in the Fiesta Bowl at Sun Devil Stadium on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would definitely be a great game for us,'' he said. ``My
home is just 10 minutes from there.''
</P>
<P>
   And his heart is, too. That's how Joe and Phillis Germaine
raised him. They not only watched him grow and mature, but they
played a huge part in it, largely because Joe let them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a real social person, so he never went out with
friends,'' Phillis said. ``He always just stayed home with us. He
let us live his life with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He still does, even though he's living across the country.
Germaine's family members see as many games as they can, and after
games, Joe always spends time with them rather than celebrating
with teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He is 23 but acts 43.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell him that he's always been old,'' Phillis said. ``Joe
has always been comfortable with himself. Some kids always try to
find their place. He never went through an obnoxious stage like a
lot of kids do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Germaine didn't go through difficult times. He kept his
feelings to himself, but he hurt badly when he wasn't recruited as
a quarterback out of Mesa Mountain View High School.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham Young and Arizona State wanted him but gave no
assurances that he would get a chance to play quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was devastated,'' Phillis said. ``He never vocalizes his
feelings, but it was a dark moment for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Germaine refused to accept that he couldn't play quarterback at
a major college. So he decided to play a year at Scottsdale
Community College, hoping someone would notice.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. After a sensational year at Scottsdale, Germaine
signed with Ohio State, where he redshirted one season and split
time at quarterback with Stanley Jackson the other two.
</P>
<P>
   While he never played at ASU, he will go down in Sun Devils
history. With his team trailing, 17-14, with 1:40 left in 1997 Rose
Bowl, Germaine led the Buckeyes on a game-winning, 65-yard
touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   In his three seasons in Columbus, Germaine has completed 60
percent of his passes, has thrown for 42 touchdowns and has been
intercepted only 16 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his three years here, you could probably count the number
of bad reads he's made on one hand,'' Salem said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until this year, Germaine had started only one game while
sharing the spot with Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine is surrounded by amazing offensive talent such as
receivers David Boston and Dee Miller and running back Michael
Wiley. But nothing has improved Ohio State's offense more this year
than Germaine's ascendence to the starting quarterback's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disrespect to Stan or the way he ran our offense last year,
but it was just real predictable,'' Miller told the ``Columbus
Dispatch.'' ``Everyone knew Stan was pretty much going to hand the
ball off or run some quarterback options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when Joe came in, the defense would make an adjustment
and put a nickel package in or a dime package. Now we have just one
man doing all that, and I think we're keeping the defenses more
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Germaine never would say such a thing about himself, but he
admitted he's enjoying this season more than any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've waited for for a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his collegiate career, Germaine has been unflappable.
Touchdown pass or interception, his facial expression rarely
changes. He always looks as if he's in the middle of taking a
chemistry test. After touchdown passes, he doesn't jump into
receivers' arms. And after interceptions, he doesn't knock over
water coolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great competitor, but I'm pretty quiet,'' Germaine said.
``I'm not going to go around and rant and rave and get anybody
pumped up with my words. My teammates respect that. I take the
approach of never letting them see you sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how he handles himself off the field, too. Few programs
in the country draw the attention and scrutiny that the Buckeyes
do. With no major league professional franchises in town, nothing
is bigger in Columbus than Ohio State football, and few people are
more famous than the Buckeyes quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an Arizona State graduate and I played at Arizona State,''
Salem said, ``but this is different back here, a lot different.
It's different Monday through Friday and not just on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a dollar for every autograph Joe has signed
during his three years here. I'd be rich. He treats people with
such great respect.'' &QL;

TWO LOS ANGELES GROUPS COMPETE WITH HOUSTON, EACH OTHER FOR NFL
FRANCHISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: also moving on the ``s'' sports wire) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Prepare to make your choice, NFL: Malibu Beach
... or Galveston Bay?
</P>
<P>
   Academy Awards ... or the Livestock Show and Rodeo?
</P>
<P>
   Gucci ... or Gilley's?
</P>
<P>
   These are among the questions facing the National Football
League as it decides whether to put its 32nd franchise in Los
Angeles or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The league will step up its auditions of franchise candidates
Tuesday when it convenes a meeting of club owners and chief
executives in Kansas City. It will survey hourlong presentations by
two prospective ownership groups from Los Angeles and one from
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is expected to award the franchise at some point next
year, with the expectation of fielding the new team in a glitzy new
or refurbished stadium by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are staggering, the issues thorny.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which has been without an NFL team since the
Raiders and Rams fled after the 1994 season, has advantages based
on the enormity and fertility of its market, but the L.A. proposals
_ one headed by developer Edward Roski Jr. at the Coliseum, the
other championed by Hollywood deal-maker Michael Ovitz at a site in
Carson, just south of downtown Los Angeles _ are vague in some of
their details, and there are substantial obstacles to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Houston counters with a stadium and ownership proposal, headed
by energy tycoon Robert McNair, that is detailed to the nickel,
with a commitment of $195 million in tax revenues and minimal
private financing.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. can't compete on that field. Its voters have opposed
commitment of tax dollars to the construction of sports facilities
_ most recently with Roski's Staples Center hockey/basketball arena
downtown _ while Proposition 218, which requires two-thirds
approval for any special-purpose tax in California, complicates the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Will the desirability of the Southern California market trump
Houston's advantages and persuade the NFL owners to overlook any
L.A. shortcomings in the areas of public participation and overall
debt?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wouldn't make the concessions,'' said Dean Spanos,
president of the San Diego Chargers. ``I think each community
should stand on its own. It should be fair, competitive and equal.
I think the merits of the deal have to be (judged) on their own and
be compared on an apples-to-apples basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd be willing to concede anything to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the players, this is a unique opportunity. When the new
Cleveland Browns begin play next year, the NFL will have an odd
number of teams, which will create scheduling snags. Once the
league adds its 32nd franchise, it might not expand again for 15 or
20 years. Thus, the loser in this game will be forced to court
established teams looking to relocate _ a process that often
involves being used as leverage until the team sweetens its current
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The financial commitment is enormous, too. Cleveland paid an
unprecedented tariff of $530 million to join the league. Given the
value of a franchise in the Los Angeles market, and stadium
construction estimates that are both in the $350 million range, the
buy-in here could push $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz project, which is tied to a proposed retail mall at
the junction of two major freeways just south of Los Angeles
proper, has generated buzz in the NFL because of his marketing
acumen and the project's freshness, while Roski's Coliseum group is
straining to overcome image problems left over from the roughshod
tenancy of the Raiders.

NFC SLIPPING AT HANDS OF QUARTERBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The AFC's revenge began at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium last
January. A 13-game Super Bowl losing streak came tumbling down in
Denver's 31-24 victory over NFC champion Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly halfway through the NFL season, the AFC has won 17 of 24
games between the two conferences. The AFC West has an 11-1 edge
over the NFC East, just a few years ago considered the best
division in football.
</P>
<P>
   How far has the NFC fallen?
</P>
<P>
   The only two winless teams _ Carolina and Washington _ are in
the NFC. The Redskins, 0-7, were the NFC East favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bye (this week), but I need three byes,'' Redskins
cornerback Darrell Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, one of two 1-6 teams in the league, won its only
game over the Redskins. Chicago lost eight turnovers in one game
and until last week hadn't scored in the third quarter since Nov.
16, 1997. The Cardinals (3-4) were supposed to be one of the NFL's
most improved teams yet are under .500 after seven games for the
10th consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of these teams might be the most frustrated. In fact, Visa
has been running a 1{-month campaign to find the ultimate fan of
every team. Contestants are asked to submit a photo and a 50-word
essay, with the winners to get a two-day trip to the Pro Football
Hall of Game in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the final week of the contest _ the deadline was
Friday _ Visa hadn't received one entry from a fan of the Eagles or
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the NFC go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the quarterbacks in the AFC,'' Cardinals defensive
coordinator Dave McGinnis said. ``They absolutely have made the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFC has John Elway at Denver, Drew Bledsoe at New England,
Dan Marino at Miami and Mark Brunell at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, there's Steve Young of San Francisco, Brett Favre of
Green Bay, Troy Aikman of Dallas and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Young has been outstanding, with 17 touchdown passes and only
three interceptions this season.
</P>
<P>
   Favre is in a deep slump. He has thrown 10 interceptions _ only
the Cardinals' Jake Plummer has thrown more in the NFC. Favre's
percentage of passes intercepted is 4.7 percent, 29th in the league
among 33 quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has missed most of the season because of a shoulder
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the NFC East's lineup at quarterbacks: Philadelphia has
Bobby Hoying and Rodney Peete, who have combined for two touchdowns
and seven interceptions. In Washington, Coach Norv Turner said last
week that he doesn't have faith in either of his quarterbacks,
Trent Green or Gus Frerotte. Danny Kanell of the New York Giants
was struggling until the Cardinals came to town. Plummer has thrown
nearly twice as many interceptions as touchdowns and is the
lowest-rated starting passer in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defenses more than any year in the past are not allowing
quarterbacks to be caretakers, just hand off,'' said Gary Horton,
former Cleveland and Tampa Bay scout. ``No one ever seen more
blitzing and eight-man fronts than this year. An eight-man front is
designed to take away the run game and put pressure on quarterback.
The only way to make teams play honest defense is for the
quarterback to convert one-and-one match-ups, and they're not
converting. Until they do, teams will not back off and play
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFC's top-rated passer, Randall Cunningham, was out of
football two years ago, running a marble business in Las Vegas.
Meanwhile, a 44-year-old former NFL coach, Steve DeBerg, is
starting for the Atlanta Falcons this week. The Carolina Panthers
wasted the first draft pick in franchise history on Kerry Collins,
who was released two weeks ago after he said his heart wasn't in
it. He was picked up by the New Orleans Saints, who already had
five quarterbacks on their roster, including Heath Shuler, whom
Washington wasted the No. 3 pick overall in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many young quarterbacks in the NFC,'' McGinnis
said. ``There are two rookies _ Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf _ in
the AFC, and you can see how they've struggled.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFC's teams have made free-agent mistakes. The Redskins
spent $57 million on defensive tackles Dana Stubblefield and Dan
Wilkinson yet are 28th against the run. Green Bay lost running back
Edgar Bennett and guard Aaron Taylor in free agency to Chicago and
now has one of the league's worst running games.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings (6-0) have a two-game lead on every team in the NFC
and did the best job of re-signing their own free agents, bringing
back offensive tackle Todd Steussie, running back Robert Smith and
defensive tackle Jon Randle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the NFC's most successful coaches have gone to the AFC.

LOS ANGELES: of the Raiders.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston's bid, by comparison, appears signed, sealed and firmly
in the lead, but NFL insiders question the relevance of such a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken it to a football game,'' said one league executive.
``It's still in the first quarter. It doesn't matter who's ahead
now. ... The issue comes back to, we want to succeed with the 32nd
franchise. The membership is going to take what in their minds they
believe is best going to benefit the NFL over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect the NFL to ignore any glitter and apply its usual
criteria: best package, best prospects for making the league ever
more lucrative, highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is a larger market. It's got to be more attractive
to the NFL,'' said Jack Rains, chairman of the Harris
County-Houston Sports Authority. ``But we feel Houston is not
exactly an ugly duckling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any movie stars coming up there (to Kansas City)
with us, or beautiful girls, or any of that stuff. This is a group
of hard-nosed business people making a presentation to 31 owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ovitz wanted to bring along some of the window
dressing of his proposed ownership group _ Tom Cruise, Kevin
Costner, Shaquille O'Neal _ but the NFL told him not to bother.
</P>
<P>
   These are businessmen. Forbes magazine's list of the 400 richest
Americans includes 10 NFL owners _ one-third of the league _ and
six of them are billionaires. Their heads might be turned by
celebrity, but never distracted from the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stability is No. 1,'' Spanos said. ``No. 2, we're going to be
looking at the ownership groups, what types of individual they are,
what their financial capabilities are and how they would be as
owners. Wherever this franchise goes, they want to make sure there
is stability and long-term commitment there.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be one of several critical issues for the Coliseum
group to address this week and in the coming months. It failed to
keep both the Rams and Raiders, and numerous proposals to upgrade
the 75-year-old stadium fizzled. Many owners also have bad memories
of their visits there to play the Raiders: fights in the stands,
traffic snarls, microscopic crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Coliseum has great hurdles to overcome,'' one NFL
owner said privately. ``I know there's a tremendous amount of
negativism toward the Coliseum. There are a lot of owners who share
that view. They've got a history there they've got to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski's group, with the combined heft of L.A.'s political
machine behind it, will attempt to do exactly that this week in its
first presentation to the assembled NFL ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The group will display a model in which the insides of the
Coliseum have been scooped out and a modern facility built from
scratch inside its historic walls. Its plan will also feature a
revitalized Exposition Park, complementing the museums and
California Science Center that are already succeeding there.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for the Coliseum renovation to be funded by
$217 million in private financing, $100 million from the sale of
seat licenses (which the NFL likely will deem a liberal estimate),
$20 million in redevelopment funds and $20 million from a ticket
surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financing plan is different,'' said Roger Goodell, NFL
executive vice president for league and football development.
``They've got an arena project coming out of the ground (Staples
Center), and (it) has a track record. There are a significant
number of developments going on around the Coliseum project.
They've had some significant changes in the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Said John Semcken, executive vice president of New Coliseum
Partners: ``They can look 1.8 miles up the street and see concrete
going up in the air. And when Ed Roski says, I can do a deal; I can
navigate the political riptides and get it done, there is some
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Carson project, the NFL owners will see a design for a
brand-new stadium that will be free of the checkered history of the
Coliseum, and they'll see in Ovitz a former Hollywood agent and
Disney executive with a strong reputation for promotion and
merchandising.

LOS ANGELES: and merchandising.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many elements of this proposal that remain a mystery.
Ovitz spokesman Peter Levin would provide no financial details
beyond estimates for cleanup of the site, which is a former
landfill. (The cleanup costs will range from $22 million at best to
$38 million in the worst case, according to documents provided by
Levin.)
</P>
<P>
   Carson this past week pledged $180 million in bonds to support
the project, but it is unclear if Ovitz and his ownership group
intend to back them with stadium and mall revenues. (The annual
debt service on the bonds could run to $17 million.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are enough owners in there who know that
much about Carson yet,'' said an NFL owner. ``That's the whole
purpose for this (meeting), so that everybody can hear what has to
be said at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ovitz said recently: ``The NFL will never stick a
team again at the Coliseum. ... I'm just convinced that the best
way for the NFL to come back to L.A. is through Carson.''
</P>
<P>
   An Ovitz aide said the group would issue the league a deadline
for a decision and a ceiling for the buy-in. The Carson project
will have to be given a green light toward the end of this year or
the beginning of next, he said, or the mall project will proceed
without the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As for the franchise fee, which is undetermined but could be in
the $600 million-to-$700 million range for the L.A. market,
``that's the big, gaping hole in each model,'' the aide said.
``There's a price point beyond which we can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is not accustomed to being hurried or dictated to,
however. This is one of the most exclusive fraternities in sports,
and the Cleveland example demonstrated that there is no shortage of
candidates eager to buy in.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the Coliseum group has structured flexibility into
its ownership posture, Semcken said, so as to be poised to gain
minority interest in a team wishing to relocate to L.A. in the
event Houston gets the expansion nod.
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors complicating the Los Angeles issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking in the shadows are the Oakland Raiders, who are
embroiled in a legal dispute with the NFL over whether the Raiders
hold territorial claim to the L.A. market. The Raiders, who charge
that the NFL undermined their attempt to get a new stadium at
Hollywood Park, are also entangled in a tenant dispute in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old case in Los Angeles has not gotten to pretrial
conference yet, said the clerk for U.S. District Judge George King,
who is scheduled to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland city officials vow another court fight should the
Raiders attempt to break their lease for another move south.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, in the meantime, prepares to pitch the NFL its two
leading options.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for Anaheim and Irvine were not considered far enough
along to be invited to this meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time plan to bring football to the grounds of Dodger
Stadium ``is on the back burner because the city asked us to,''
said a Fox official, referring to City Hall's decision to marshal
all its support behind the Coliseum. If the Coliseum plan is
rejected or loses to Houston ``and the city wants to talk,'' the
official said, ``obviously we'll listen.''

DRAFT GIVES CARDS HOPE ON OFFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This being the Cardinals' open date, they are looking to the
future, a future in which quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer will continue
to get pummeled and sacked unless the team addresses the offensive
line in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The solution really is quite simple: Sign a free-agent guard and
draft tackles, using a first-round pick on one.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's  &UR; Aaron Gibson, 6 feet 6, 375 pounds is considered
the best of a very deep offensive line group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the feet to play left tackle, to be ( &UR; Tony)
 &UR; Boselli or ( &UR; Jonathan)  &UR; Ogden,'' one NFL general manager said.
``But he'll be a dominating player in the league a long time
because of his strength and run blocking. He is a real tough guy
who is built like a concrete wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them play Northwestern. He took the left defensive end
and drove him past the center. Once he gets going, you're not
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gary Horton, editor of the ``War Room'' draft publication,
calls Gibson ``a freak of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Riddell has to make him a custom helmet, he's so big,'' Horton
said. ``He has pretty good movement and flexibility for a guy his
size. He has had some problems staying in shape. But he just
envelopes you and plays with a nasty streak.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals, who have two first-round picks, their own and
San Diego's, draft Gibson, they likely will move  &UR; Anthony Clement
to left tackle. Clement, a second-round pick from Southwestern
Louisiana, was drafted as a left tackle to be the heir apparent to
 &UR; Lomas Brown. But he has missed most of the season because of a
back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Other highly rated offensive tackles are  &UR; Matthew Stinchcomb of
Georgia,  &UR; Zach Piller of Florida and  &UR; Todd Frohbieter of Arkansas
State.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb also is projected as a right tackle in the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big, wide body who is a power player,'' Horton said of
Stinchcomb, who has started since he was a freshman. ``He's a tough
guy who has good instincts but is not a great natural athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Piller, a left tackle, has had a disappointing senior season.
</P>
<P>
   Frohbieter has been hurt much of the year and could redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the juniors is UCLA's  &UR; Kris Farris, but he hasn't
made a decision about turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   Two guards could be high picks _  &UR; Tony Coates of Washington and
 &UR; Anthony Cesario of Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coates is a road grader, a tough guy who can play guard and
tackle,'' Horton said. ``He's a really good run blocker, an inside
power guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesario is a smart player who has been well-schooled in the
passing game. &QL; 
Saliva test &QL; 
Last season, Tampa Bay linebacker  &UR; Hardy Nickerson spit on San
Francisco 49ers fullback  &UR; William Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Nickerson did it again to Floyd, now of the
Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd had to be restrained by teammates and Carolina Coach  &UR; Dom
 &UR; Capers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For about five minutes, I couldn't hear anybody,'' Floyd said.
``All I could see was getting to him. That's the worst thing you
can do to a man. That's worse than slapping somebody. That's worse
than kicking somebody or punching them in the face. To spit on
somebody is probably the worst thing you can do to an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd was upset Nickerson didn't get thrown out of the game.
Nickerson was penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct and
later fined $7,500 by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the ref, `You mean if I go over there and punch him in
his mouth right now, you're going to throw me out of the game?' ''
Floyd said. ``He was like, `Yeah.' I said, `Don't you think
spitting on somebody is 10 times worse.' And he couldn't say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What made Nickerson's behavior even worse was that he sent Floyd
a letter of apology during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him in the off-season, and I humbled myself by saying,
`Hey, this is a Christian brother,' '' Floyd said. ``He made a
mistake. Everybody is entitled to a mistake. Well, the only thing
I've got to say about that is, `First time, shame on you. Second
time, shame on me.' '' &QL; 
Keep on chucking &QL; 
Don't expect Green Bay quarterback  &UR; Brett Favre to start playing
conservatively just because he has been intercepted 10 times this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Brett Favre, and you're the greatest quarterback
maybe in the history of the NFL, what do you do?'' Packers
quarterback coach
 &UR; Andy Reid said. ``You can bang your head on the wall, but what
Brett has to do is go right back to basics. You can't hesitate at
the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember what got you here. Why does this
offense have so many rings? Just believe in the things he was
taught seven years ago.'' &QL; 
Long memories &QL; 
Two years later, the Denver Broncos still can't forget that the
Jacksonville Jaguars knocked them out of the AFC playoffs in one of
the biggest upsets in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams play today at Denver's Mile High Stadium, site of
the shocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cost me 30 grand because if we beat them, we go to the
next round of the playoffs and that's $30,000 (in playoff
bonuses),'' Broncos wide receiver  &UR; Rod Smith said. ``Think about
that. People kill each other over $30,000.'' &QL; 
Losing it? &QL; 
An 0-7 start seems to have taken its toll on Washington Redskins
Coach  &UR; Norv Turner, whose team was picked to win the NFC East in
the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week before the Quarterback Luncheon Club in
McLean, Va., Turner said, ``I have talked to the players a little
bit about subtle withdrawal,'' Turner said. ``There is a subtle
withdrawal that takes place. You back away from one play one
second, and that's the situation we are in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing right now is you back away, you have the mental
errors, you have two or three in a half, and you can be in the
situation we're in.'' &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants quarterback  &UR; Danny Kanell had a mammogram six
weeks ago after doctors noticed a tumor in his chest. He had the
tumor, which turned out to be benign, removed last week. ``I have a
new appreciation for women after going through a mammogram,''
Kanell said. ``That was probably more painful than the surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have about 10,000 tickets left for the Dallas game
Nov. 15 at Sun Devil Stadium, assuring them of three crowds of over
50,000, the first time that has happened since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams starting quarterback  &UR; Tony Banks, on missing the
team plane after last Sunday's loss at Miami: ``I really didn't
think it was that big of a deal. I know my teammates aren't worried
about it. Monday's not really that important of a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta quarterback  &UR; Steve DeBerg, 44, on giving up his coaching
whistle to resume his playing career: ``I coached with a majority
of guys on this staff, and I tease them all the time that I'm

PIAZZA CONTINUES TREND OF ESCALATING SALARIES AS FREE AGENCY
BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Forget all the talk the last few years about there
being some artificial limit to the escalating salaries in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It started in 1990, when Jose Canseco received a five-year,
$23.5 million deal, the first significant jump in contracts, and on
Saturday it leaped again when Mike Piazza agreed to $91 million
over seven years to remain with the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   For years, owners and general managers have spewed the rhetoric
about how salaries are escalating beyond control, how the game will
kill itself if the payrolls continue to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? It's not happening. The size of contracts in
baseball are doing anything but shrinking. Many baseball insiders
believe, and with good reason, that the size of contracts will hit
the stratosphere this winter, especially considering the type of
free agents available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, the money will only go up,'' Cleveland
assistant general manager Dan O'Dowd said. ``Clubs are more
competitive among themselves than ever before. It's just the way
it's going to be this year and in years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Piazza out of the free-agent mix, the list of the
remaining available players looks like a virtual All-Star team. In
fact, two-thirds of the top 30 free agents have been All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the impressive group is pitcher Kevin Brown, who has
appeared in each of the last two World Series for different clubs,
Florida first and last week San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the emphasis will be on pitching. With Brown and Randy
Johnson the top two starters in the free-agent pool, there are
strong indications that each has the bargaining power to demand at
least a four-year contract that will average in excess of $10
million per season.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago that the game's first $3 million a year
player, Rickey Henderson in 1990, received more than a few raised
eyebrows, six months before Canseco raised the bar even higher.
That type of contract doesn't even merit a second look from the
baseball landscape these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a reality that we have reached a time where the
$10 million a year player is here to stay,'' New York Yankees
General Manager Brian Cashman said. ``It's not something we
welcome, but it is a fact that the $10 million player is here to
stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a notch below Brown and Johnson is a second tier of
starting pitchers featuring Al Leiter, who in all likelihood will
remain with the Mets, and Todd Stottlemyre, who will be heavily
pursued by St. Louis and the Yankees, where his father, former
20-game winner Mel Stottlemyre, is the pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Don't discount the Diamondbacks from jumping headfirst into the
free-agent pool, no matter how much they say they plan to remain
relatively quiet this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they are saddled with four more years of infielder
Jay Bell and five years with third baseman Matt Williams, this is a
club that can virtually wash away those two mega-contracts and mix
it up with the free-agent heavy hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their cash flow is incredible,'' one National League general
manager said. ``You watch, within a couple of years they're going
to be like the Orioles, Yankees and Braves. They'll be able to sign
anyone they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think (managing general partner Jerry) Colangelo is going
to sit back and watch that team lose 90 games every year? No way.
They're going to be scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The best bet has the Diamondbacks trying to lure Brown to the
Arizona desert without success. Johnson, who lives in Paradise
Valley and wants to stay home all year, could very easily wind up
wearing a Diamondbacks uniform next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Another marquee free agent who surprisingly became available is
left fielder Albert Belle, who again enjoyed another spectacular
season, smashing 49 home runs and driving in 152 runs. Don't be
surprised if the Diamondbacks make a run at Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable position players available are headlined by center
fielder Bernie Williams, who figures to be the most pursued
everyday player on the market, closely followed by first baseman Mo
Vaughn and second baseman Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti, Brian Jordan, Rafael Palmeiro and Ellis Burks are
also available and figure to receive lots of attention.
</P>
<P>
   World Series MVP Scott Brosius, who was paid $2.5 million this
season, will be one of the more fascinating free agents out there.
He's a player who has gone from virtual anonymity to the intense
spotlight and handled it well and successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is truly nothing like being a Yankee,'' Brosius said.
``I know I'm going to be in a good spot this winter, but I want to
come back. This is the only place to be a baseball player.'' &QL;

D-BACKS OWE FANS GOOD PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If they have a conscience, they will spend your money.
</P>
<P>
   Not to send a loan into early retirement. Not to settle lawsuits
regarding cost overruns. Not to enhance the garage with another
Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   No, if they have a conscience, they will look at their free
stadium. Their bloated attendance base. Their raging revenue
streams. The season ticket renewals that come due Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They will see an embarrassment of riches, a market loaded with
unemployed stars, and they will reinvest in the product.
</P>
<P>
   They will reward you. For your tax dollars and your capacity to
fill a stadium for a cellar-dwelling expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   If the Diamondbacks want to do something to ease the backlash of
a ridiculous hike in ticket prices, if they want to prolong the
honeymoon, they will do something big when the parade of free
agents officially begins. And they can start by giving their
baseball team a personality.
</P>
<P>
   They can sign both marquee pitchers _ Randy Johnson and Kevin
Brown _ and trot out the best rotation in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They can sign one ace, add Bernie Williams and call it an
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can nab Johnson, Williams and Roberto Alomar and be an
instant contender.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the easiest thing to do is spend someone else's
money. But if they can pay Jay Bell $7 million a year, they can
afford to nearly double their payroll. From $30 million to $60
million, which is where the big boys play. The neighborhood of
contenders. And that's what the Diamondbacks want, right?
</P>
<P>
   A 1-2 punch of Brown and Johnson would be ideal, providing an
huge shot of talent and toughness to go along with Omar Daal, Andy
Benes and Brian Anderson. They would still have deficiencies on
offense, but with that rotation, the Diamondbacks would be in every
game they played.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Brown wants to move closer to his hometown of Macon,
Ga., and his chances of landing in the desert are slim. Johnson,
meanwhile, has told his agent he'd love to play in Phoenix, and his
discount price for the Diamondbacks might land around $9 million
per season.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot for a 35-year-old pitcher with a history of back
problems. But the Diamondbacks need an ace, a guy who can stare a
hole through a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar should be available for $7 million per season. He would
give the Diamondbacks a leadoff hitter and some much-needed speed,
even if it moves Bell back to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the expensive dance with Williams, now rumored
to be coveted by the Texas Rangers. There is every reason for
Williams to stay in New York, except for two things: He has a
special relationship with Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter and
an agent who infuriates nearly every owner in baseball. Jerry
Colangelo is on his short list of cordial acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have gaping holes. They need a No. 1 starter
and a center fielder. They desperately need some speed; they are a
team that can't afford to play station-to-station baseball any
longer. And they need a stronger identity, something the fans can
rally around.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, there wasn't much fodder for the water cooler.
Showalter walking Barry Bonds with the bases loaded. Benes'
one-hitter late in the season. A couple of nice comebacks and one
sustained winning streak down the stretch. But aside from a few
isolated moments, the rookie season was homogenous, faceless,
flat-out boring.
</P>
<P>
   That has to change.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Diamondbacks have a payroll around $34 million,
with $26 million committed to four players _ Bell, Benes, Matt
Williams and Bernard Gilkey. They can afford to make a big splash.
They can afford to get a little loose with the Benjamins.
</P>
<P>
   And if they want to go completely crazy and abandon morality,
Albert Belle happens to be a free agent who owns a home in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if they have a conscience, they will realize what
you've given them. And they will look in the mirror, seize the
moment and spend your money where it's really needed:
</P>
<P>
   On the field. On a couple of free agents that would make this
team worth watching. &QL;

ISLANDERS BEAT SABRES, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
   (Replaces HKN-ISLANDERS-BREWER)  
 (HLW)  
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ For the second straight game, late in the
third period, the Islanders' fate lay on the stick of Claude
Lapointe. This time, he came through.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 seconds left in Saturday night's game against the
Buffalo Sabres, Lapointe picked off a clearing pass, skated in
alone on Dominik Hasek and scored his second goal of the game to
give the Islanders a 5-4 victory before 11,081 fans at Nassau
Coliseum. Lapointe had used the same backhand move on a penalty
shot against Rangers goalie Mike Richter last Thursday, but was
thwarted in the Islanders' 3-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Hasek, you don't think, you just react,'' Lapointe
said. ``I beat Hasek on a breakaway before.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapointe did more than win the game for the Islanders Saturday
night; he saved them from further embarrassment. The Islanders had
taken a 4-0 lead early in the second period, but they relaxed,
their tempo slowed, and their defense got lazy. An opportunistic
Buffalo team took full advantage, scoring four straight goals to
tie the game at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have happened to a better guy,'' Coach Mike
Milbury said of Lapointe. ``He seems to be in on a half-dozen
scoring chances every night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, notorious for their slow starts, wasted no time
Saturday night in taking a 2-0 first-period lead on goals by Gino
Odjick and Lapointe. Odjick's goal came on the power play at 2
minutes 54 seconds. Odjick, who left the game later in the period
with a groin strain, hit the puck off of Hasek's stick and through
the goalie's leg pads. Lapointe scored at 14:31 on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   One Islander did not need a packed Coliseum to get ready to play
Saturday night. Jason Dawe, who scored the Islanders' third goal,
circled this date several months ago. He was traded to the
Islanders by the Sabres last March for Paul Kruse and a minor
league defenseman. Dawe demanded a trade when his playing time
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pumped,'' he said before the game. ``I've been waiting
since last season to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawe, who went back to Buffalo during the off season to sell his
home there, is still close friends with Michael Peca, the Sabres'
captain, and Brian Holzinger. Before Saturday night's game, Dawe
said several teammates asked for advice on how to score on Hasek,
who is widely regarded as the world's best goalie. ``I can't even
tell the guys where to shoot on him,'' he said. ``Nothing works on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dawe beat Hasek with a slap shot from the top of the left
circle when Hasek was caught leaning the wrong way on the 2-on-1
break with Dawe and Mariusz Czerkawski.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Smolinski scored the Islanders' fourth goal on a breakaway
at 14:28 of the second period. It was Smolinski's first goal since
April 6.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after Smolinski's goal, things began unraveling for the
Islanders. Curtis Brown scored on a Sabres power play, cutting the
deficit to 4-1 at 18:27 of the second period. Then, with less with
17 seconds left in the period, Wayne Primeau scored Buffalo's
second goal. Dixon Ward knocked in a rebound at 5:57 of the third
period, and Holzinger capped the comeback at 6:33.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things to be learned,'' said Milbury, who told
the team before the game that a victory meant a day off on Monday.
``We won the game despite some egregious errors.''

NEW CHALLENGES: OLSON TACKLES WIFE'S ILLNESS, REBUILDING TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 EDITORS: One of a four story package on Arizona Coach Lute Olson   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON - Basketballs bounce and sneakers squeak on the new floor
of McKale Center. The rhythm is punctuated by the occasional
blowing of a whistle, followed by the echo in the nearly empty
arena of a familiar voice stopping action to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   It's October. Basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it's a normal opening of another season for the
University of Arizona, this time around a youthful but talented
group. Indications are that Coach Lute Olson, in his 16th season,
once again has successfully reloaded. Over the past 11 years, no
program in the country has a higher winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Time has not diminished Olson's enthusiasm for the job. This
year, he faces the challenge of developing four new starters to
replace those who over the past two seasons won a national
championship and followed it with a 30-win record that came one
short of returning to the Final Four. This, Olson said, is what
keeps him energized.
</P>
<P>
   But something is different for Olson, who turned 64 last month.
His face shows the strain of a battle larger than any he will face
from Stanford, or California, or UCLA in a Pac-10 game.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 45 years, Bobbi, is fighting ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   She has responded well to treatment since being diagnosed in
June, and her prognosis is excellent, according to her physician.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's cancer, a chilling word, the kind that makes you
want to drop what you're doing. Even though a good result is
probable, it's a long, hard battle, one that Olson said in an
interview this week would have caused him to take a one-year leave
from coaching if the diagnosis had been made in the autumn rather
than the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years of NCAA Division I coaching and worldwide
travel coaching national teams and giving clinics, all with Bobbi
at his side, have given Olson a unique look at life, the game, the
profession. He shared it last week _ everything from the trauma and
coping with his wife's illness, to the challenge of rebuilding his
team, to the state of college and pro basketball. &QL;

SCHRADER HOPES TO FIND WAY TO WIN SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Can Ken Schrader somehow unlock the mystery to
reaching victory lane?
</P>
<P>
   Will Jeff Gordon again be Jeff Gordon and wrap up a third NASCAR
Winston Cup championship in four years, this time with two races
still remaining on the schedule?
</P>
<P>
   And what happens if Gordon does that in today's Dura-Lube/Kmart
500 at Phoenix International Raceway, thereby bleeding the final
two races of any suspense?
</P>
<P>
   Will Roger Penske, who owns North Carolina Motor Speedway, and
Bruton Smith, who owns Atlanta Motor Speedway, send Gordon a bill
for the empty seats?
</P>
<P>
   Questions, questions and more questions.
</P>
<P>
   First things first.
</P>
<P>
   Can Schrader, who is starting from the pole position, end a
seven-year winless drought?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Schrader said. ``We worked a lot on our flat-track
program. We were excited about coming out here.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   But in 10 previous races at PIR, no driver has been good on
Saturday and won on Sunday. Not only has no one ever won from the
pole, only three winners have emerged from the first 10 starting
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news for Schrader, but good news for Gordon and Martin, who
start side-by-side in row six.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon needs to gain only 12 points on Martin to clinch the
title, which depending on where they finish the race, can be the
difference between one to four finishing positions.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Gordon, however, you'd think he was clinging to a
lifeline with the tip of his pinky finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not over until it's over,'' Gordon said with a
straight face. ``As far as I'm concerned, any time there's a
possibility it can't be won, then I have to look at that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``(However), the chances of that happening are maybe a little
slimmer than maybe they would have been last year.''
</P>
<P>
   A little slimmer? Hah. Try a lot slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon could slip away with wife, Brooke, on a one-week cruise
up the Alaskan coast and still return next week at Rockingham,
N.C., with a healthy lead.
</P>
<P>
   But don't try passing that information to Gordon. He won't
listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done with our season by far,'' Gordon maintains.
</P>
<P>
   At least Gordon acknowledges the pressure is not as great as at
this time last season, when he led Martin by 125 points after 30
races. In 1995, when Gordon won his first crown, he led Dale
Earnhardt by 147 points after the same number of races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more relaxed, I guess,'' Gordon said. ``More so
than last year, if that's what I'm comparing it to. Last year, it
was very, very intense. It was a very tight battle. I heard some
statistics about (finishing) 32nd or better (over the final three
races), and I'll clinch the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not that difficult to get in a wreck on the first lap
or to blow up on the first five laps and be sitting there 40th.
Like I said, it's not over until it's over.'
</P>
<P>
   You want to bet?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' Dale Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   And Jarrett said that before Gordon won last week's
restrictor-plate race at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hamilton warned Gordon could run the table the remainder
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wins at Phoenix, he could win the rest of them,''
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon could.
</P>
<P>
   But so could Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've been thinking about for the past two weeks is getting
to Phoenix,'' Martin said. ``Racing at tracks like Phoenix requires
skill and a good car. It's not about luck or who you draft with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like racing at a place where I can make a difference as a
driver. When you run restrictor plates, your experience and skill
is thrown out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to determine whose skill will be best at PIR,
where Martin has won before but Gordon has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plans are to come into Phoenix like we have to be a
contender to win,'' Gordon said. ``And I think we've got the best
car we've ever had here. I'm real excited about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Excited and nervous. &QL;

SEVERAL QUESTIONS STILL SURROUND TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mike Tyson's roadwork in the last week has taken him
across the country in search of a possible promoter, an opponent, a
comeback date, a settlement out of one court and some progress in
another court.
</P>
<P>
   At least Tyson won't have to search for his equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It's still sitting at Phoenix's Madison Square Garden, the gym
where Tyson said he hopes to train if, when and however he gets
answers to all the other unresolved questions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rodriquez and Ricky Ricardo of Madison Square Garden
still expect Tyson, whose license was reinstated Monday by the
Nevada Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo said Tyson's handlers indicated he would resume training
on Tuesday at the old gym on West Van Buren Street. That's when
Valley hotel rooms will become available. They've been booked for
the past week by fans in town for today's Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 at
Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's back,'' said Rodriquez, who during the past few
years has had to seek funding and loans in a battle to keep his
tiny gym open.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing about Tyson is ever certain. Six months ago, his
handlers set up a training camp in Sedona. Heavy bags, speed bags,
a ring and even a stereo system were in place. But Tyson didn't
show. He decided to stay in Las Vegas, instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sedona wasn't right,'' said Stacy McKinley, one of Tyson's
current trainers. ``But Madison Square Graden is perfect. It's an
old gym in a old neighborhood. Mike likes being around the people.
He's starting over, the place is like going back to his roots. He's
comfortable there.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, a key question is the date for a comeback by Tyson, who
last week was in New York filing depositions in his $100 million
civil suit against his former promoter, Don King.
</P>
<P>
   The former heavyweight champ probably would need training camp
of six weeks to two months in order to prepare for his first bout
since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears on June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Initial speculation put the date for a comeback on Dec. 5. Cable
television operators had left open that night in anticipation of a
Tyson bout. Now, however, it appears Tyson won't fight until at
least Dec. 12. The planned comeback might even be pushed to
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Possible opponents are a reason. The speculated list is down to
Lou Savarese of New York and Brian Nielsen of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese has said he couldn't be ready before Dec. 12. Nielsen,
a 1992 Olympic bronze medalist, just fought and won 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors that could influence Tyson's plan:
</P>
<P>
   Tyson owes $13 million to the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS
wants some money by Dec. 31. If a comeback isn't scheduled until
January, Tyson reportedly will ask a potential promoter for a loan
of $3.5 million, which will go to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   There's speculation that Kevin Rooney might be back as a Tyson
trainer. Tyson owes Rooney at least $7 million, the result of
another decision in civil court. &QL;

L.A. GROUPS SEEK NFL TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prepare to make your choice, NFL: Malibu Beach ... or Galveston
Bay?
</P>
<P>
   Academy Awards ... or the Livestock Show and Rodeo?
</P>
<P>
   Gucci ... or Gilley's?
</P>
<P>
   These are among the questions facing the National Football
League as it decides whether to put its 32nd franchise in Los
Angeles or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The league will step up its auditions of franchise candidates
Tuesday when it convenes a meeting of club owners and chief
executives in Kansas City. It will survey hourlong presentations by
two prospective ownership groups from Los Angeles and one from
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is expected to award the franchise at some point next
year, with the expectation of fielding the new team in a glitzy new
or refurbished stadium by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are staggering, the issues thorny.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which has been without an NFL team since the
Raiders and Rams fled after the 1994 season, has advantages based
on the enormity and fertility of its market, but the L.A. proposals
_ one headed by developer Edward Roski Jr. at the Coliseum, the
other championed by Hollywood deal-maker Michael Ovitz at a site in
Carson _ are vague in some of their details, and there are
substantial obstacles to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Houston counters with a stadium and ownership proposal, headed
by energy tycoon Robert McNair, that is detailed to the nickel,
with a commitment of $195million in tax revenues and minimal
private financing.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. can't compete on that field. Its voters have opposed
commitment of tax dollars to the construction of sports facilities
_ most recently with Roski's Staples Center arena downtown _ while
Proposition 218, which requires two-thirds approval for any
special-purpose tax in California, complicates the process.
</P>
<P>
   Will the desirability of the Southern California market trump
Houston's advantages and persuade the NFL owners to overlook any
L.A. shortcomings in the areas of public participation and overall
debt?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wouldn't make the concessions,'' said Dean Spanos,
president of the San Diego Chargers. ``I think each community
should stand on its own. It should be fair, competitive and equal.
I think the merits of the deal have to be (judged) on their own and
be compared on an apples-to-apples basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd be willing to concede anything to
anybody.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much at stake
</P>
<P>
   For all the players, this is a unique opportunity. When the new
Cleveland Browns begin play next year, the NFL will have an odd
number of teams, which will create scheduling snags. Once the
league adds its 32nd franchise, it might not expand again for 15 or
20 years. Thus, the loser in this game will be forced to court
established teams looking to relocate _ a process that often
involves being used as leverage until the team sweetens its current
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The financial commitment is enormous, too. Cleveland paid an
unprecedented tariff of $530million to join the league. Given the
value of a franchise in the Los Angeles market, and stadium
construction estimates that are both in the $350million range, the
buy-in here could push $1billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz project, which is tied to a proposed retail mall at
the junction of the San Diego and Harbor freeways, has generated
buzz in the NFL because of his marketing acumen and the project's
freshness, while Roski's Coliseum group is straining to overcome
image problems left over from the roughshod tenancy of the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's bid, by comparison, appears signed, sealed and firmly
in the lead, but NFL insiders question the relevance of such a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken it to a football game,'' said one league executive.
``It's still in the first quarter. It doesn't matter who's ahead
now. ... The issue comes back to, we want to succeed with the 32nd
franchise. The membership is going to take what in their minds they
believe is best going to benefit the NFL over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect the NFL to ignore any glitter and apply its usual
criteria: best package, best prospects for making the league ever
more lucrative, highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is a larger market. It's got to be more attractive
to the NFL,'' said Jack Rains, chairman of the Harris
County-Houston Sports Authority. ``But we feel Houston is not
exactly an ugly duckling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any movie stars coming up there (to Kansas City)
with us, or beautiful girls, or any of that stuff. This is a group
of hard-nosed business people making a presentation to 31 owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ovitz wanted to bring along some of the window
dressing of his proposed ownership group _ Tom Cruise, Kevin
Costner, Shaquille O'Neal _ but the NFL told him not to bother.
</P>
<P>
   These are businessmen. Forbes magazine's list of the 400 richest
Americans includes 10 NFL owners _ one-third of the league _ and
six of them are billionaires. Their heads might be turned by
celebrity, but never distracted from the bottom line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Image issues
</P>
<P>
   ``Stability is No.1,'' Spanos said. ``No.2, we're going to be
looking at the ownership groups, what types of individual they are,
what their financial capabilities are and how they would be as
owners. Wherever this franchise goes, they want to make sure there
is stability and long-term commitment there.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be one of several critical issues for the Coliseum
group to address this week and in the coming months. It failed to
keep both the Rams and Raiders, and numerous proposals to upgrade
the 75-year-old stadium fizzled. Many owners also have bad memories
of their visits there to play the Raiders: fights in the stands,
traffic snarls, microscopic crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Coliseum has great hurdles to overcome,'' one NFL
owner said privately. ``I know there's a tremendous amount of
negativism toward the Coliseum. There are a lot of owners who share
that view. They've got a history there they've got to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski's group, with the combined heft of L.A.'s political
machine behind it, will attempt to do exactly that this week in its
first presentation to the assembled NFL ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The group will display a model in which the insides of the
Coliseum have been scooped out and a modern facility built from
scratch inside its historic walls. Its plan will also feature a
revitalized Exposition Park, complementing the museums and
California Science Center that are already succeeding there.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for the Coliseum renovation to be funded by
$217million in private financing, $100million from the sale of seat
licenses (which the NFL likely will deem a liberal estimate),
$20million in redevelopment funds and $20million from a ticket
surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financing plan is different,'' said Roger Goodell, NFL
executive vice president for league and football development.
``They've got an arena project coming out of the ground (Staples
Center), and (it) has a track record. There are a significant
number of developments going on around the Coliseum project.
They've had some significant changes in the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Said John Semcken, executive vice president of New Coliseum
Partners: ``They can look 1.8 miles up the street and see concrete
going up in the air. And when Ed Roski says, I can do a deal; I can
navigate the political riptides and get it done, there is some
credibility.'' &QL; 
Intriguing option
</P>
<P>
   In the Carson project, the NFL owners will see a design for a
brand-new stadium that will be free of the checkered history of the
Coliseum, and they'll see in Ovitz a former Hollywood agent and
Disney executive with a strong reputation for promotion and
merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   There are many elements of this proposal that remain a mystery.
Ovitz spokesman Peter Levin would provide no financial details
beyond estimates for cleanup of the site, which is a former
landfill. (The cleanup costs will range from $22million at best to
$38million in the worst case, according to documents provided by
Levin.)
</P>
<P>
   Carson this past week pledged $180million in bonds to support
the project, but it is unclear if Ovitz and his ownership group
intend to back them with stadium and mall revenues. (The annual
debt service on the bonds could run to $17million.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are enough owners in there who know that
much about Carson yet,'' said an NFL owner. ``That's the whole
purpose for this (meeting), so that everybody can hear what has to
be said at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ovitz said recently: ``The NFL will never stick a
team again at the Coliseum. ... I'm just convinced that the best
way for the NFL to come back to L.A. is through Carson.''
</P>
<P>
   An Ovitz aide said the group would issue the league a deadline
for a decision and a ceiling for the buy-in. The Carson project
will have to be given a green light toward the end of this year or
the beginning of next, he said, or the mall project will proceed
without the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As for the franchise fee, which is undetermined but could be in
the $600million-to-$700million range for the L.A. market, ``that's
the big, gaping hole in each model,'' the aide said. ``There's a
price point beyond which we can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is not accustomed to being hurried or dictated to,
however. This is one of the most exclusive fraternities in sports,
and the Cleveland example demonstrated that there is no shortage of
candidates eager to buy in.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the Coliseum group has structured flexibility into
its ownership posture, Semcken said, so as to be poised to gain
minority interest in a team wishing to relocate to L.A. in the
event Houston gets the expansion nod.
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors complicating the Los Angeles issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking in the shadows are the Oakland Raiders, who are
embroiled in a legal dispute with the NFL over whether the Raiders
hold territorial claim to the L.A. market. The Raiders, who charge
that the NFL undermined their attempt to get a new stadium at
Hollywood Park, are also entangled in a tenant dispute in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old case in Los Angeles has not gotten to pretrial
conference yet, said the clerk for U.S. District Judge George King,
who is scheduled to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland officials vow another court fight should the Raiders
attempt to break their lease for another move south.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, in the meantime, prepares to pitch the NFL its two
leading options.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for Anaheim and Irvine were not considered far enough
along to be invited to this meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time plan to bring football to the grounds of Dodger
Stadium ``is on the back burner because the city asked us to,''
said a Fox official, referring to City Hall's decision to marshal
all its support behind the Coliseum. If the Coliseum plan is
rejected or loses to Houston ``and the city wants to talk,'' the
official said, ``obviously we'll listen.''

WILDCATS LACK EXPERIENCE, NOT TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 EDITORS: One of a four story package on Arizona Coach Lute Olson   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wildcats need a full-time coach, which Olson says he now can
be for them with his wife's treatment well under way.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven new players in the program, an unusually high
number. Olson has tried to keep the classes balanced to avoid a
major rebuilding. Three starting jobs are open. During his long run
in Tucson, he recalls only two situations similar to this one. In
1985, he started one senior, one junior, one sophomore and two
freshmen. In that group were guards Steve Kerr and Craig McMillan
and forwards Sean Elliott and Anthony Cook, the heart of Arizona's
first Final Four team in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The other was only two seasons ago, when Arizona had an
inexperienced sophomore center, a junior-college transfer at power
forward, two junior wings and a freshman at the point. That team
was only fifth in the Pac-10, but matured during the NCAA
Tournament and won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were just a whole lot of question marks with those two
teams, and with this team it's a similar kind of situation,'' Olson
said. ``There are just a lot of question marks.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard and center are two good spots to build around, and
that's where the Wildcats are strongest. Jason Terry, one of the
premier sixth men the past two seasons, becomes the point guard.
A.J. Bramlett, a two-year starter who was the leading rebounder in
the NCAA Tournament two years ago, is back at center.
</P>
<P>
   At shooting guard, Quynn Tebbs has the most experience, ``and
that's practically nil,'' according to Olson. Freshman Ruben
Douglas and Traves Wilson will challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``And at our 3 spot (small forward), there is just no experience
there at all,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Wessel, who was on the team last season but rarely got
into games, and three freshmen, one of whom is Richard Jefferson of
Moon Valley High, are competing. Another of the freshmen is Luke
Walton, son of basketball Hall of Famer Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   At power forward, veteran Eugene Edgerson will battle with the
player considered the prize of the recruiting class, Michael
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Wright has no experience but a lot of talent,'' Olson
said. ``I'd describe him as a warrior. He has the same kind of
intensity as (Edgerson), but he's bigger and coming in he has more
offensive skills. He can be a special player.''
</P>
<P>
   While this group will take some knocks, according to Olson, the
newcomers were judged to be among the top-five recruiting classes
in the country by nearly every magazine that ranks such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice situations there is so much to cover, and this
year there is the least amount of time to cover it because we start
so early,'' Olson said. ``We're trying to plug holes in the dike
every day. Instead of the continuity process, one day you get
something covered, then you might get a quick review the next day,
then you leave it alone for a day or two while you get two other
things covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tebbs has a little bit of an edge offensively on the others
(at shooting guard), but the others have the edge defensively.
Richard Jefferson is the most talented (at small forward), but the
others have out-rebounded him. Those are the kinds of problems
we're facing.''
</P>
<P>
   The past two seasons, Michael Dickerson was assigned to stop a
hot foe who had penetrating ability and Miles Simon took a hot
perimeter shooter. When Terry came into a game, he was free to play
for steals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Terry will get the tough defensive assignment on a guard,
inside or outside, in addition to having the new responsibility of
running the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of our fans after watching him last year were
concerned he'd be ready for that role,'' Olson said. ``Jason would
get ahead of himself sometimes. He didn't make the best decisions
with the ball. But in our early practices, he's been making very
few errors. His assist-to-turnover ratio is excellent. We chart
everything every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett, a senior like Terry, has been an effective inside
defender but he has not been a consistent inside scoring threat.
That allowed Utah to play the triangle-and-two defense that
smothered Arizona's perimeter players. With those outside players
gone, the scoring load will shift inside to Bramlett.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.J. is a much improved player,'' Olson said. ``He has played
on two successful teams. Our focus will now be different. We'll be
looking for strong scoring inside; we will be going to those guys a
whole lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett went to Pete Newell's Big Man's Camp in hopes of
improving his offensive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``His defensive work has always been underestimated, in my
opinion,'' Olson said. ``Look at the opposing numbers of big guys
against us, and none of them has ever really gone off. A.J. is a
hard worker. He's got good quickness, good size, and he's stronger
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats will be chasing Stanford, which has its key players
back from a Final Four team, and California in the Pac-10, Olson
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the performance of our league over the last couple of
years, if the Pac-10 doesn't get six teams into the NCAA
Tournament, then something is wrong,'' he said. ``The Pac-10 is
rated one of the top two or three conferences consistently. That's
an indication of where we are on the national scope now.'' &QL;

OLSON LEARNS LESSONS THROUGH WIFE'S ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olsons were in Hungary, where Lute was conducting a coaching
clinic, in June when Bobbi, 63, became ill. She was taken to a
hospital and had emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary is not a place to be seriously ill. It was awful for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe it,'' Olson said last week during an
interview in his McKale Center office. ``We were lucky to get her
out of there. After we had gotten back here, one of the people from
University Medical Center went over there on a consulting thing
with physicians, and came back and said it was the worst he'd ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian physicians found a pelvic mass but did not make the
cancer diagnosis. Bobbi Olson was referred to the Arizona Cancer
Center on the UA campus upon their return, where the diagnosis was
made: Stage 3 cancer in the pelvis and upper abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment has included two surgeries and chemotherapy. The
latest round was last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was her second one, and the first time she had this
treatment she was really, really ill,'' Olson said. ``She's had a
rough time of it. But she's doing well. We continue to be
encouraged. She had a checkup Monday, and Bobbi was really excited
about what they didn't find.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career, Olson did not attend the
summer camps around the country for high school prospects. Instead,
he sent associate coach Jim Rosborough to recruit. Olson stayed
home with Bobbi while they were learning exactly what she had and
how they would proceed with treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were still a lot of people betting that by the time
practice started I would be taking a leave,'' Olson said.
``Obviously if it had been a situation where this had happened in
the fall of the year, there's no question I would have taken a
one-year leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said family has always come first to him. When he got the
UA job in 1983, Olson's grown children and extended family moved to
the desert with him. The Olson have five children and 11
grandchildren. One of his granddaughters is on the UA women's
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   He has maintained a family atmosphere in the UA program as well,
giving players the option to blackball any potential recruit with
whom they are not comfortable. His office is a shrine to his
players. Old team photos cover the walls. There are trophies
celebrating their successes. In the foyer are framed front-page
newspaper accounts of Arizona's 1997 national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The office is as immaculate as one would expect of a man known
for his crisp blue blazers and finely groomed hair. But for this
chat, there is no blazer, the Olson trademark. He is dressed
casually, in slacks and a polo shirt. He is relaxed, as best a man
can be while his wife is undergoing treatment for cancer. He is not
the chairman of the board delivering a third-quarter earnings
report _ the kind of uppity image some associate with him. He is
just a guy, speaking freely, easily, able to smile despite the
tribulations facing him.
</P>
<P>
   He is as curious as a reporter, asking questions about the NBA
and its labor issue that has led to a lockout that threatens the
season. Olson, who lettered in football, basketball and baseball at
Augsburg (Minn.) College, remains a big sports fan.
</P>
<P>
   His heroes in the business are common men who were great at what
they did, John Wooden and Dean Smith, two of the few ahead of him
on the career coaching lists.
</P>
<P>
   Another of his heroes is Bobbi, who has nurtured him yet kept
him on an even keel, from the depths of public criticism to the
heights of international accolades. She is not afraid to lampoon
his stuffy image.
</P>
<P>
   Both Olson and the program have suffered a sense of loss while
she recovers. Bobbi has been almost as much a part of the program
as Lute, attending every game, usually right behind the bench, home
and road. She is the matriarch of the program, a friend to the
players who come to UA from all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   What has transpired with her hasn't necessarily changed his
perspective, but reinforced it, Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think less probably with me than it might be with some
people because family has always come first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this puts it even more into perspective. It's not about
winning games. It's not about what you do. You have to make your
living, yes, but it's not about that, and this really puts into
perspective what's really important. It's family.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by his wife's progress in treatment, Olson prepares
for a season that will take him to normal retirement age. He has
given no indication that this will be his final season at the helm.
Olson is under contract through 2002. &QL;

 EDITORS: One of a four story package on Arizona Coach Lute Olson   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having an elite program that is recognized on the national scene
does have its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats recruit premier players, but those premier players
are becoming more inclined to stay only a year or two before being
lured by the big money in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Mike Bibby is an example. Freshman forward Michael Wright
could be of that caliber as well.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of losing key players early has become a
consideration when recruiting, Olson said. It's difficult to
scramble to fill an unexpected hole because most top players commit
during the early signing period in November. Seldom does a quality
player wait until the spring of his senior year to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saving grace for us with Mike leaving after two years is
that we got Jason Terry in the class ahead of him,'' Olson said.
``When you've got a player as good as Mike, you're not going to be
able to recruit a player at that position the next year, or the
next while he's there. They see that spot already filled. It really
does create problems for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what it changes is that you try to recruit the players with
a variety of skills who are not one-dimensional. In Jason Terry's
case, he can play anywhere on the perimeter for us, yet now when we
need a point guard he can play there. Our two freshmen guards are
probably more wings than they are points, yet I would feel that
after a year in the program, either of them could play anywhere on
the perimeter as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Creation of a rookie salary cap in the NBA has not reduced the
early departures. To the contrary. Players have become more
inclined to leave early to get the clock started so they can become
free agents sooner, becoming eligible for the really big money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think the rookie cap would make a lick of
difference,'' Olson said. ``That's the problem as soon as you put a
limit on a guy. I think there needs to be a similar kind of thing
drawn up and agreed to like in professional baseball, where if a
kid enters a four-year school, he knows he's got three years before
he can come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is a legal problem with some of it (baseball
received an antitrust exemption from Congress), but it's obvious
that it's hurting the NBA and hurting the college game. There's no
way in the world kids are ready for what they face in the NBA with
all the money and the off-court problems before they're at least 20
years old, and maybe later.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he believes frustrated pro fans are turning to the
college game in the wake of a lockout and labor dispute that
threatens the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also with the actions of some of its players, guys getting
arrested, I think it's turning more and more people off,'' Olson
said. ``When you have salaries that have gotten totally out of
whack, and when you read about all the negative things that are
happening with some of the younger guys that are supposedly going
to be the future of the league, it doesn't look good for the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   College athletes who are on scholarship are precluded from
holding a job or receiving other income. They generate billions of
dollars for universities in gate receipts, advertising and most
importantly, television revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he believes they should receive a stipend, but he
doubts it will happen because of federal laws that mandate gender
equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us agree they should, but the reality of it is
there is no way that they can,'' he said. ``Look at it here at the
University of Arizona. We have 18 sports, but football and
basketball have to make all the money for ourselves and 16 other
sports as well. The number of NCAA Division I athletic programs
that operate in the black is a small minority. I hear Dick Vitale
talking about it and other national figures talking about it, that
these athletes are the guys who make the money, therefore they
deserve some of it. Well, they don't understand the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think down the line you'll see four or five men's
sports and 10 to 12 women's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson bases his reasoning on simple bottom-line math. If
stipends are awarded to 98 athletes on football and men's
basketball scholarships, then 98 would have to be awarded to
women's sports, as well. No one has that kind of money available.
</P>
<P>
   ``With current federal law, I don't see how you can give
stipends,'' Olson said. ``You can say that those who make it should
be rewarded for it, but that's not the way the law is written.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the college game remains sound, in Olson's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``College basketball is always going to be college basketball
regardless of how many guys come out,'' he said. ``There are always
going to be guys to take their place. In college, we have the color
surrounding the game, the alums, the fans. It's different from what
it is in the NBA. Look at last year. How can anyone say it was hurt
by the guys who came out the previous year? We had enthusiasm, we
had attendance, we had a great tournament. Everything. The college
game is in great shape.'' &QL;

GRETZKY WON'T GIVE WARNING ON RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the question that is starting to pop up in several cities
around the league: Could this be  &UR; Wayne Gretzky's last season in
the NHL?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always asking me. My kids ask every day,'' said
Gretzky, the game's all-time leading scorer and holder of almost
every scoring record that exists. ``I honestly don't know. I do
know if I decide to quit, I won't tell anybody until there's about
a month to go in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a farewell tour. That's the only thing my agent,
 &UR; Mike Barnett, and I disagree about. I've had victory laps for 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Muckler, Gretzky's former coach in Edmonton and his
current coach with the Rangers, doesn't think the Great One is
ready to walk away just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked into the practice rink the other day and said, `Who
do I complain to about my ice time? I'm not getting enough,' ''
Muckler said. ``I'd just played him 28 minutes on back-to-back
nights. Believe me, he's still having fun. There's still a smile on
his face. He works harder than anyone in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky also was leading the Rangers in scoring after seven
games with a goal and five assists. But just in case, mark down
Dec. 30 on your calendar. That's the day Gretzky makes his only
visit to America West Arena this season. &QL; 
Grumpy young men &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peter Forsberg is angry. No, make that mad as hell. The
Colorado Avalanche center blames himself for the team's horrendous
0-4-1 start and says he's simply not pulling his weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at yourself in the mirror,'' Forsberg said, ``and you
almost feel ashamed. I'm hard on myself, but when you haven't won
in five games, you can't look around the room and expect somebody
to step it up. ``You'' have to pick it up, and that's what I have
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played better than this before, so there's no reason I
shouldn't be able to play better than I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Forsberg hasn't been so bad. He still was searching
for his first goal entering the weekend, but he led the club with
six assists and was a plus 5 last weekend during a 5-5 tie with Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter sometimes is too demanding,'' Coach  &UR; Bob Hartley said.
``But in my book, it's easier to try to slow down a thoroughbred
than to try to get a donkey going.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Colorado goalie  &UR; Patrick Roy feels like a
jackass himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the heck is wrong with me. I wish I knew,''
said Roy, who started 0-3-1 with a 3.69 goals-against average.
``I've got to play with more intensity. I'm soft right now, and I
have to start to play hungry.'' &QL; 
Back in the saddle &QL; 
 &UR; Scotty Bowman kept everyone in the dark about his plans on whether
to return as head coach of the Detroit Red Wings. He made it
official last week, announcing his comeback after summerlong
concerns about his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy I was able to go through the stress test,''
joked Bowman, 65, who was behind the bench Friday night when the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champions lost to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   It was a welcome sight to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's special,'' Red Wings forward  &UR; Doug Brown said.
``It's like having one of our star veterans back in the lineup. It
can only strengthen the team.'' &QL; 
Weight watchers &QL; 
A week after he said  &UR; Doug Weight wasn't worth it, Edmonton Oilers
GN &UR; Glen Sather bit the bullet and signed his No. 1 center to a
two-year contract worth $7.75 million _ only $250,000 less than
what Weight had been demanding.
</P>
<P>
   The deal got done when agent  &UR; Steve Bartlett met with Sather
over lunch at the Plaza Hotel in New York. The bill was almost as
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a salad the size of a scoop of ice cream. Cost me $50
for lunch,'' Bartlett quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Weight spent a good portion of his contract dispute in the
Valley, where he has a summer home. But for the past few weeks,
believe it or not, the skilled playmaker hung out near his hometown
in Detroit working out with a boxing coach.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to see Weight drop the gloves any time soon, ``but
boxing was pretty cool,'' he said. ``I lost about eight or nine
pounds doing it.'' &QL; 
Kilger on the block &QL; 
Don't look now, but it appears former Coyotes center  &UR; Chad Kilger
might get dealt by the Chicago Blackhawks, possibly to the New York
Rangers in a package deal for a top-four defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Kilger, obtained in the deal in March that brought  &UR; Keith
 &UR; Carney and  &UR; Jim Cummins to Phoenix, has done little this season and
even has been moved to wing because of his ineffectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   If GM  &UR; Bob Murray had to do it over again, he never would have
pulled the trigger with the Coyotes'  &UR; Bobby Smith, who's looking
smarter every day. &QL;

COYOTES, DUCKS TO RUMBLE?  
 HIT ON BRIERE ELEVATES RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ When Ruslan Salei elbowed Daniel Briere in the head
and then slew-footed him with a trip, flipping him end over end,
knocking him unconscious and sending him into convulsions, the
Coyotes chose not to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting decision, considering the rookie Briere
stands barely 5-foot-9 and weighs maybe 185 pounds soaking wet.
Hockey teams are supposed to protect their mighty mites, not let
them get steamrolled by defensemen who check in at 6-2, 205.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll play them again. We'll remember what happened,'' Coyotes
captain Keith Tkachuk said after that fateful preseason game in
Phoenix three weeks ago. ``It's something we'll all file away for
safe keeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's the day.
</P>
<P>
   Retribution figures to take center stage at 6 p.m. at the
Arrowhead Pond when the Coyotes clash with the Mighty Ducks. Briere
is back, just having been recalled from the minors on Friday. So is
Salei, who is eligible to play for the first time since serving a
five-game suspension without pay for the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be concerned about that. All we care about is winning
the hockey game,'' Tkachuk said. ``We're more worried about Teemu
Selanne and Paul Kariya than whatever that guy's name is. What, is
he from Russia or something?''
</P>
<P>
   He's from Minsk, Belarus, and there is no guarantee, that the
23-year-old Salei will even be in the lineup. Coach Craig Hartsburg
hinted he might choose to sit him, saying the Ducks' defense has
played well without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long year and he'll get his chances,'' Hartsburg said.
``But whether or not it's (this) game, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk said he ``could care less,'' but he hopes Salei plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we know what he did to Danny was cheap. He picked
his spot pretty good. But we'll see how he does with the big
boys,'' Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Salei plays or not, these two teams
already have created a healthy, heated rivalry. It began two
seasons ago, when the Ducks ousted the Coyotes from the playoffs in
the first round, a seven-game series that was punctuated by a
controversial quote and a questionable hit.
</P>
<P>
   It began with some inflammatory comments from Coyotes defenseman
Oleg Tverdovsky, a former Duck, who called Anaheim ``basically a
one-line hockey team,'' and added, ``I want to kick their butts.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Game 6 of the series, Anaheim's Ted Drury drilled
Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick with a knee-on-knee leg whip, which
knocked Roenick out of commission for several weeks and contributed
largely to the Mighty Ducks' victory in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are great examples of what fuels rivalries,'' said
Anaheim enforcer Jim McKenzie, who spent the past three seasons
mixing it up for the Coyotes/Jets before being traded to the Ducks
this summer for forward J.F. Jomphe, now in the minors. ``Two years
ago, it was exactly that. Something Oleg said blew that up, the
fans jumped on it, and used it to their advantage. All those little
things add in to make the fire even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Salei hit on Briere, a play Salei swears was clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything wrong,'' he said. ``I didn't try to hurt
him. I didn't do anything on purpose. I just skated there and hit
him. I didn't want to hurt him or give him a concussion. It was a
clean hit.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his hefty suspension and $1,000 fine, the maximum allowed
under NHL rules, Salei called it, ``Unbelievable and
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but that's what the Coyotes said of his hit on Briere the
night the former first-round draft pick turned 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cheap shot, no question about it,'' Roenick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dirty play, plain and simple,'' right wing Rick
Tocchet said. ``It was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have been on the receiving end of too many of those
themselves the past few years. Several NHL teams have made a habit
of taking runs and liberties on Anaheim's two biggest stars, Kariya
and Selanne. The Coyotes did it themselves in the playoffs,
shadowing them with check after check to try and slow down the
high-scoring linemates.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks may have solved that problem by bringing in the
likes of McKenzie and fellow tough guy Stu Grimson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got those two guys, there was a clear message that
there's going to be some respect now,'' Selanne said. &QL;

DRAKE'S INJURY MISDIAGNOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Dallas Drake has a fracture is his left ankle. But now
it turns out that it happens to be about a six-year-old injury and
it won't keep him sidelined four to six weeks, as previously
reported.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he practiced with the Coyotes on Saturday and could
possibly be in the lineup tonight when the team meets the Mighty
Ducks of Anaheim at the Arrowhead Pond.
</P>
<P>
   According to General Manager Bobby Smith, the team's medical
staff misdiagnosed the extent of the injury when Drake slipped and
fell in practice last week. X-Rays showed a fracture _ the result
of an injury in 1992 _ but a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging
test proved he only suffered a bruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did hurt it,'' Smith said, ``There was evidence of an old
fracture there that was misread, probably because of all the
swelling. But there's no damage to the bone or any ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, we were quite frustrated when we thought he'd
be out four to six weeks, but it's terrific news he'll be back
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake accompanied the team to Anaheim Saturday, but Smith wasn't
prepared to say if the veteran will play today or whether he will
make his return Monday at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say, but he is possible for (tonight),'' Smith
said. &QL;

LEES FERRY TROUT FISHERMEN FACE NEW KEEP RELEASE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With little ado Saturday, the Arizona Game and Fish Commission
approved a major management change at Arizona's best trout fishery,
a 15-mile stretch of the Colorado River below Lake Powell known as
Lees Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, regulations at Lees Ferry include a slot limit, where
trout between 16 and 22 inches are protected and must be returned
immediately to the river when caught. There also is a two-trout bag
and possession limit.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation, which goes into effect Jan. 1, sets a
16-inch maximum size limit and allows a two-trout bag limit and a
possession limit of four fish.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that no fish over 16 inches can be kept. It
also means that anglers can keep two fish the first day of fishing
and have a possession limit of four on the second and subsequent
days.
</P>
<P>
   Lees Ferry may be the best trout fishery in Arizona, but it's
not the most popular. That's because it is both remote and also a
blue-ribbon fishery. The latter means that only flies and lures can
be used to catch trout.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves out people who want to use live bait such as worms
or prepared bait to fish for trout. These are the common trout
anglers. Take out your kids, bait their hooks, throw them out into
the water and wait for a bite.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Janisch, former Game and Fish fisheries chief who now is the
chief of the information branch, handled the presentation since his
successor in fisheries has not been named.
</P>
<P>
   Janisch said current management of water flows below the
Colorado River is much more conducive to natural reproduction of
trout at Lees Ferry. The population of trout, he said, has outgrown
the food base. He said traditional stockings of trout would be
discontinued unless there were poor reproduction years.
</P>
<P>
   Since anglers also can't keep many fish, that has added to the
problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janisch said the fishery was almost devastated by continuous low
flows, parasite infections and starvation. Since 1995, he said, a
new management plan of water flows through the Grand Canyon has
produced high flows and much better conditions for the trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, a trout could grow to 20 inches in four to five
years,'' Janisch said. ``Now the chances of growing an 18-inch
trout are very small.''
</P>
<P>
   A trout usually lives no longer than eight years, he said, and
any large trout at Lees Ferry are about that old.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish began an intensive program about three years ago
to determine how quickly the trout were growing.
</P>
<P>
   A series of public meetings bolstered the department's
recommendation for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Many anglers were concerned about a lack of trout over 18
inches. The new regulation will protect big fish and allow a larger
number of smaller trout to be kept. At the meetings, 23 percent of
those who attended strongly approved this plan. Eleven percent
strong disapproved it.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists hope the new regulation will allow trout to reach 16
inches in their third year. It now takes four to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Cohen of Mesa, an avid fly-fisherman who represented both
Trout Unlimited and the Arizona Wildlife Advisory Council, a
consortium of conservation groups, supported the new regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is moderate, appropriate and an acceptable
alternative,'' he said. Cohen also said he didn't believe it was a
cure-all for the problems at Lees Ferry. &QL; 
Other actions &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners also approved adding Water Lake Ranch, a new
recreation area in Gilbert, to the urban fishing program. The
addition had strong approval by the public that was surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Fain Lake near Prescott, which is intensively managed for
channel catfish, also got new regulations. The catfish limit will
be reduced to four from 25 on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Janisch said chances of catching 25 cats wasn't likely when the
lake was unmanaged. He said now that Game and Fish is stocking the
lake regularly, allowing a large limit would be poor management.
</P>
<P>
   The department hopes the management change will allow more
people to catch catfish. &QL;

BLISS WINS TRUCK RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DEWAYNE SMITH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mike Bliss, no stranger to Phoenix International
Raceway's winner's circle, got a late start Saturday in the GM
Goodwrench/AC Delco Craftsman Truck race.
</P>
<P>
   But he was in a big hurry to finish and won the event with a
near-track-record speed of 103.669 mph in his Team ASE
Racing-sponsored Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss, a resident of Milwaukie, Ore., and the entire 36-car
field _ not to mention the 40,000-plus spectators _ had to wait 48
minutes after the scheduled 12:30 p.m. start for the green flag to
fall because of a trackwide electrical failure.
</P>
<P>
   Track officials said an car accident near Avondale caused the
power outage.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR timing officials got the race under way once temporary
power had been established.
</P>
<P>
   Although the win is Bliss' first at PIR in the trucks, he has
won three open-wheel races on the pavement, including a
supermodified event in 1986 and Silver Crown (championship dirt
cars) in 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss began the 186-mile chase from the pole position, leading
laps 58 through 77 and again from lap 133 to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We adjusted the truck all day, and my crew chief, Barry
(Dodson), did a great job,'' Bliss said. ``I drove easy those last
10 laps. I was not going to spin out. I was not going to blow a
tire. I was easy on the brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhilaration of the victory is tempered because Bliss and
Dodson will split up after the season finale Nov. 8 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad when I sit here and think about how great we are,
and we're going different ways,'' Bliss said. ``We've been so close
this year. We almost won Vegas last year. We're going to go there
and kick some butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming second place was Greg Biffle of Vancouver, Wash., after
starting 17th. Ron Hornaday of Palmdale, Calif., the winningest
NASCAR truck racer with 23 wins, was third after starting fifth on
the grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it, but there was nobody going to catch No. 2
truck,'' said Biffle, who padded his points lead in the rookie
standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out of sequence a bit on the pit stops, so I wound up
with not much left in my tires for the final laps.''
</P>
<P>
   Biffle and fellow rookie Andy Houston of Hickory, N.C., battled
up front most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were having a lot of fun,'' Houston said. ``Greg even waved
at me going down the front straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg and I have a lot of respect for each other, and it was a
lot of fun having the two of us out front with all the veterans in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday, who won the Craftsman Series race at PIR last April,
was in and out of the hunt all race but came away from the fray
with the series point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to catch up toward the end after the truck was
pretty loose,'' Hornaday said. ``I picked a different line on the
track, and that helped. I don't think I had enough to catch
Biffle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday was behind series defending champion Jack Sprague of
Spring Lake, Mich., by 28 points going into the race, but he led by
13 when the smoke cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Engine trouble forced Sprague, who started next to Bliss on the
front row, to finish 13th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all along that who has trouble will determine this
thing (points race),'' said Sprague. ``Our motor went south, and we
lost power on the straights.''
</P>
<P>
   Designed for purpose-built pickup-style racers, the Craftsman
Truck Series began in 1995. Until this year, each race featured a
10-minute shutdown at midrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that originally because we raced at so many small
tracks where they didn't have room for all the trucks to pit,''
series spokesman Owen Kearns said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the series has matured and we're competing at larger
tracks, and because the fans asked for it, we have eliminated the
break and just run the races like we do in our other NASCAR
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 27 races this year, we only used the midrace break at
two of the small tracks.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX - It was a sad sight indeed watching the Wood Brothers
and driver  &UR; Michael  &UR; Waltrip packing their bags Saturday and
returning home 24 hours before the start of today's Dura-Lube/Kmart
500 at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   But in the increasingly competitive world of NASCAR Winston Cup
racing, no one, not even some of the sport's most devoted
participants, is immune to failure.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Waltrip and brothers  &UR; Eddie and  &UR; Len  &UR; Wood's
turn to feel the NASCAR axe.
</P>
<P>
   By failing to qualify, it was the first time in 420 races dating
to 1984 that the Wood Brothers team missed a race. It also was the
first time since 1971 the team failed to make a race it attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it coming (Friday), when we qualified (44th fastest of
46 drivers),'' Len Wood said. ``It was like boom, boom, boom. I
said, `There are some (top-20 drivers) in front of us not in the
top 36.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip failed to better his first-day qualifying speed, and
because so many other top-20 drivers in the standings also couldn't
crack the top 36 qualifying positions, the younger brother of
 &UR; Darrell
 &UR; Waltrip wasn't able to make the starting grid via an owner's
provisional.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bobby Labonte,  &UR; Jeff Burton,  &UR; Dale  &UR; Earnhardt,  &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Hamilton,  &UR; Ernie
 &UR; Irvan and  &UR; Chad  &UR; Little, who passed Waltrip in the standings last
week, needed to use owner's provisionals to make the grid. And all
are ahead of Waltrip in the drivers' standings.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip received the final starting position with a past
champion's provisional, the 18th time this season he has needed to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unfortunate,'' Michael Waltrip said. ``I've started
(387) in a row without missing a race, and you come to Phoenix 18th
in the points never dreaming it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do anything about it. I remember when  &UR; Richard
 &UR; Petty loaded up and missed a race. It happens to people. It's not
the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip was No. 6 in consecutive starts among active drivers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Terry  &UR; Labonte leads with 599. &QL; 
Will he or won't he? &QL; 
There's still no final word on whether  &UR; Ernie  &UR; Irvan will start
today's race. He's still feeling the effects of a hard crash two
weeks ago at Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway and has shared seat
time this weekend with possible replacement  &UR; Ricky  &UR; Craven.
</P>
<P>
   Craven relieved Irvan after the first pit stop in last week's
race at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel all right, just not up to par,'' Irvan said. ``Right
now, I'm just not exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's (head injury) is a little bit different. It would
be hard for me to say mine's this way or that way. Right now, I
feel comfortable saying that I'm just not exactly 100 percent. It's
just going to take some time to get there.'' &QL; 
Happy hour &QL; 
 &UR; John  &UR; Andretti (126.596 mph) posted the fastest speed during the
final practice session.
</P>
<P>
   An accident involving Bobby Labonte will force him to a backup
car. He will lose a 37th starting position and start last.  &UR; Ted
 &UR; Musgrave and
 &UR; Jeff  &UR; Green also were involved, but there was no late word on
whether they will have to revert to backups.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Derrike  &UR; Cope also may have to go to a backup car after
crashing. If so, he will lose a 36th starting position.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gordon milestone &QL; 
Should  &UR; Jeff  &UR; Gordon record an 18th straight top-five finish, he
would tie  &UR; David  &UR; Pearson for the all-time mark.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's streak began June 22, 1968 at Greenville-Pickens
(S.C.) Speedway and ended Sept. 15 at Orange County (N.C.)
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's streak began June 14 at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson had seven wins during the stretch and seven runner-up
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has eight wins and five runner-up finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson won $40,000 during the 18 races.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has won $4,498,687. &QL; 
Cup runneth over &QL; 
Irvan and  &UR; Brian Simo have formed a NASCAR Winston Cup ownership
team and will begin fielding a car in a handful of races next
season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boris  &UR; Said will be the driver in the road-course races, but no
one has been picked to do the ovals.
</P>
<P>
   The major sponsor will be Federated Auto Parts.
</P>
<P>
   Simo, who with his brother founded the No Fear sports apparel
company, also drove this season on the Sports Car Club of America
Trans-Am circuit. &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
IRL driver  &UR; Jeff Ward failed in an attempt to qualify for his first
Winston Cup race. Waltrip and  &UR; Dave Marcis were the only two other
drivers not to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Jet Motorsports owner  &UR; Tim Beverley, whose driver is
 &UR; Darrell Waltrip, said the team is not for sale and is not closing
shop. &QL;

BAD NUMBERS, GOOD PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Right-handed reliever Vladimir Nunez, the first
homegrown pitcher to wear a Diamondbacks uniform, is saddled with a
fat ERA (6.35 through Friday). But the Fall League isn't primarily
about numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, it's about learning and developing. And in that regard,
Scottsdale pitching coach Darrell Akerfelds likes what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great kid,'' Akerfelds said. ``He's resilient, his arm
bounces back, he's an eager learner and a good listener.''
</P>
<P>
   Akerfelds said this Friday. As if to prove him right, Nunez then
went out and pitched two hitless innings in a 5-0 win over Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez, who is 23 and goes 6 feet 5, 240 pounds, has a fastball
clocked in the mid-90s. But the Cuban refugee has been working on
another pitch _ not exactly a split-finger fastball, but a fastball
with more movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging,'' Akerfelds said. ``I've seen some very poor
swings against some of the things he's learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez gets into trouble when he falls behind in the count, ``and
then he's got to come in with pitches hitters can handle,''
Akerfelds said. The high ERA is largely the result of only a couple
of poor outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a good job,'' Akerfelds said. ``That's where you
talk about how numbers can be deceiving.''
</P>
<P>
   By spring training, Akerfelds said, Nunez should have command of
the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be part of his plan of attack, part of his strategy in
setting up hitters,'' he said. &QL; 
Another Mota &QL; 
A familiar name stood among the Fall League batting leaders heading
into the weekend. A familiar last name, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale's Tony Mota, who was at or near the top in batting
average and hits, is the son of former major league outfielder and
pinch-hitter extraordinaire Manny Mota.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Mota, a Los Angeles Dodgers prospect, plays third
base and the outfield. He hit .319 in 65 games with Vero Beach of
the Class-A Florida State League, and .243 in 59 games with San
Antonio of the Double-A Texas League.
</P>
<P>
   A 17th-round pick in the June 1995 amateur draft, Mota was
signed out of Miami (Fla.) Springs High School by former big-league
pitcher Camilio Pascual.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Mota played 20 major league seasons, mainly with the
Pittsburgh Pirates and the Dodgers. He hit .304 and holds the major
league record with 150 career pinch-hits. He was a Dodgers coach
last season and is awaiting reassignment in the organization under
new Manager Davey Johnson. &QL; 
Chavez goes &QL; 
Oakland Athletics third baseman Eric Chavez, one of the more highly
touted Fall League players, was removed from the Peoria roster and
will not play the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   No Oakland officials were available for comment. A Fall League
spokesman cited ``personal reasons'' for the move.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was hitting .311 with one home run and eight RBI. He was
Baseball America's Minor League Player of the Year in 1998 after
hitting .328 with 22 homers and 86 RBI for Double-A Huntsville, and
.325 with 11 homers and 40 RBI in 47 games for Triple-A Edmonton.
At 20, he was the youngest player in the Pacific Coast League last
season. &QL; 
Road woes &QL; 
With ballparks located in Peoria, Maryvale, Phoenix and Scottsdale,
you wouldn't think travel would pose much of a problem. But the
Scorpions for some reason have trouble playing on the, uh, road.
Entering Saturday's game, they were 0-7 away from their home park,
Scottsdale Stadium, 7-5 in the friendly confines. &QL; 
Bright future, too &QL; 
When you're hot, you're hot. Not only did the New York Yankees win
the World Series, they have one of the hottest Fall League
prospects. Infielder Alfonso Soriano hit in 11 straight games for
Grand Canyon, with four doubles, two triples, four home runs and 15
RBIs. But the longest streak belongs to Montreal infielder Michael
Barrett, who hit in 14 straight games for Sun Cities. &QL; 
Ouch &QL; 
The Scorpions' Greg LaRocca (San Diego Padres) was hit by a pitch
in four consecutive games and five times in six games. &QL;

A PLAN FOR KIDS WHO TALK TRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They didn't just lug their mother's body to the outdoor trash
bin and dump her. They couldn't. The garbage container is shared by
several families in their Tempe neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The kids probably disguised their 148-pound load. Wrapped it in
something. Covered it with something. Hoped the neighbors didn't
notice.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be long before someone's leftover take-out food was
tossed on top of someone else's yard clippings, which were covered
over by somebody's broken lawn furniture, which was pressing down
on the decaying remains of 49-year-old Cookie Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   It happened on a Monday. The trash truck wouldn't come by until
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Aaron Jacobson and his 13-year-old sister,
Laura, told police they'd last seen their mother before leaving for
school Sept. 21. They said she'd been nagging them about being
late. After that, Cookie Jacobson seemed to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they didn't find any solid evidence of violence
inside the house. And Cookie's husband told investigators she was
taking medication for a bad back, leading some to believe she might
have gotten disoriented and wandered off.
</P>
<P>
   Only she hadn't. Her kids knew exactly where Cookie was.
</P>
<P>
   When news reporters and TV cameras showed up at the house, young
Laura told one of them, ``I think maybe she'll come back. Maybe
she'll be there tomorrow when I get home from school.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, looking troubled, said he felt helpless ``because we
don't know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But they did. &QL; 
THE TRUCK ARRIVES
</P>
<P>
   The trash truck arrived Sept. 24 shortly after 9 a.m. It was
nearly full by the time it dumped the container carrying Cookie
Jacobson onto its hold.
</P>
<P>
   The truck then drove to a plant near Sky Harbor International
Airport, where trash goes through an initial compacting. The
garbage is pushed and pounded and squeezed until about 25
compressed tons of it are loaded onto a larger truck.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe police checked the Jacobson's refuse container that day,
but they were too late.
</P>
<P>
   They doubted the kids' story, suspected they might have
something to do with their mother's disappearance, and considered
them, one officer told me, ``cold as ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Aaron told investigators he'd actually
discovered his mother dead in bed the morning of Sept. 21, and had
talked Laura into helping him load her body into the garbage
container.
</P>
<P>
   The kids said they were afraid they'd be blamed for their
mother's death, although no one seems to know why they'd believe
such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Or why they believed they could bury their troubles, along with
their mother, in the city dump.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now believe the body is somewhere in the
Butterfield Station Landfill southeast of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   They suspect Aaron of second-degree murder and Laura of
facilitation to commit second-degree murder. But there have been no
formal charges. &QL; 
A GHASTLY SEARCH
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday, 18 officers from Tempe will begin searching
the dump for the remains of Cookie Jacobson. It won't be easy. It's
a big hill of rubbish, and operators say the debris is packed tight
and hard _ about 1,500 pounds per cubic yard.
</P>
<P>
   It's like squeezing ten people into a washing machine. Or
squeezing enough odds and ends, junk and filth to match the weight
of nine people. Plus Cookie Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful we'll find the evidence we need to make our
case,'' said Sgt. Dave Lind of the Tempe Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be nasty work. Foul-smelling. Ugly. Dangerous. The
officers probably could use some assistance.
</P>
<P>
   I figure they need at least two more sets of hands _ one boy,
one girl _ to help them dig in that terrible place. The kind of
place no decent mother would send her children, and no decent
children would send their mother. &QL;

WINTER MEETINGS NEED HOT ACTION TO BUILD INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without question, Major League Baseball enjoyed a tremendous
renaissance in 1998, arguably unparalleled in the 129-year history
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that in hand, baseball cannot sit idly and believe
the game will continue moving forward in future seasons simply
because this was such a fabulous year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a time for baseball to continue to push forward. To believe
they are the big dog and things will come to them solely for that
reason would be a grave miscalculation on baseball's part. The
recent low television ratings for the World Series indicate
problems still exist.
</P>
<P>
   One way to ensure baseball will continue advancing is for the
winter meetings to somehow return to what they once were, a staple
of December when every baseball fan could get his winter fix of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   New baseball executive  &UR; Sandy Alderson, who spent the previous
17 years in the Oakland Athletics front office, is someone very
aware of baseball's needs and has always had a keen eye for
envisioning the future.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably why Alderson has been burning the phone lines,
calling every general manager and owner, reminding them of the
importance the winter meetings once held. This year they're
scheduled to take place in Nashville during the second week of
December.
</P>
<P>
   The winter meetings were always a time of activity in the
baseball world, with trades dominating the gathering of baseball
executives. In turn, baseball placed itself on the front page of
every sports section in the country at a time when football,
basketball and hockey were in the midst of their seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The winter meetings were used as a springboard toward the
upcoming season and provided for all kinds of talk and speculation
among fans.
</P>
<P>
   The last winter meetings of any significance took place in 1992
in Louisville. Baseball basically killed the winter meetings after
that season when they believed agents representing free agents were
beginning to dominate all the winter talk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alderson is smart enough to realize the benefits outweigh
the downside and he has been pushing for the winter meetings to
become what they once were. It's the type of move that can only
help baseball, which enjoyed a wonderful season and needs to
continue moving forward. &QL; 
Ivan the great &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only one player stands between  &UR; Ivan Rodriguez and the his
becoming the most prolific Gold Glove catcher in the history of the
game. That catcher, however, still has three more Gold Gloves than
Rodriguez, who won his seventh last week.
</P>
<P>
   The only catcher with more, of course, is Hall of Famer  &UR; Johnny
 &UR; Bench, generally considered the greatest catcher of all time.
Rodriguez is tied with  &UR; Bob Boone for second place on the all-time
list.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was tied with  &UR; Jim Sundberg before last week. Next on
the list are  &UR; Bill Freehan (five) and  &UR; Del Crandall,  &UR; Tony Pena and
 &UR; Charles
 &UR; Johnson, all of whom have won four Gold Gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won it so much that we almost take it for granted,''
Rangers General Manager  &UR; Doug Melvin said of Rodriguez. ``At this
stage of his career, he hopes these kind of awards lead to the Hall
of Fame. That's what's on his mind: To go to a World Series and the
Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is the only Rangers player to win a Gold Glove in the
past eight years. &QL; 
The Wright stuff &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's  &UR; Jaret Wright did not follow his rookie season the
way the Indians had imagined, but that didn't stop the club from
following the strategy it began implementing years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, still a full season away from being eligible for
arbitration, was rewarded with a fat four-year contract that will
pay him $9 million. There's also a $6 million option for a fifth
year.
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of move the Indians have become known for, tying
up their young stars through their arbitration years. Wright, last
season's postseason darling when he was barely 21, was 12-10 with a
4.72 ERA this season but was taken out of the rotation after two
poor starts (0-2, 9.82 ERA) in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just look at my numbers, it's kind of embarrassing,''
Wright said. ``I'm not proud of them. But what I learned in 1998,
you can't put a price on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who received a $250,000 signing bonus, will be paid
$750,000 next season, $1 million in 2000, $2.5 million in 2001, and
$4.25 million in 2002. &QL; 
Royal problems &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of their payroll constraints, the Kansas City Royals are
looking to peddle their two highest-paid players, pitcher  &UR; Kevin
Appier and first baseman  &UR; Jeff King.
</P>
<P>
   Appier, who at one time appeared on the verge of being a serious
Cy Young candidate, suffered through an injury-riddled season. The
Royals' board of directors (they are owned by a trust fund at the
moment) wants to slash the club's payroll from $35 million to $25
million and figure Appier's nearly $5 million next season is as
good a way as any to get halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which actually signed Appier during the strike in 1994
only to have the deal voided, has showed some serious interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not that far along yet,'' General Manager  &UR; Herk Robinson
said. ``We're talking to a lot of other clubs about a lot of
different players, but nothing is imminent.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; The others were starters, but it doesn't tarnish what he  &UR; has
 &UR; done: Yankees reliever  &UR; Mariano Rivera's 0.51 ERA in 23 postseason
appearances (35 innings) is the lowest ever for a pitcher with at
least 30 postseason innings. Next on the list are  &UR; Harry Brecheen
(0.83 in 32) and  &UR; Babe Ruth (0.87 in 31).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Let's both get our new ballparks, OK?: The shallow love fest
between San Diego owner  &UR; John Moores and Yankees boss  &UR; George
 &UR; Steinbrenner reached a level of gluttony after each took public
shots at the other's stadium in what could only be viewed as
scripted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Mudcat Grant, who is also an accomplished blues man.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And now, leading off: In the first of what surely will be at
least a dozen books on the New York Yankees' memorable 1998 season,
``New York Post'' beat writer  &UR; George King's ``Unbeatable'' debuts
Monday at bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greatness from yet another view: By finishing their season
125-50 (including playoffs), the New York Yankees were an amazing
75 games over the .500 mark. Ten of the 30 major league clubs
didn't even win 75 games in 1998. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
 &UR; Joey Cora was so steamed at being replaced by  &UR; Enrique Wilson
during the playoff series against New York that he threatened to
leave the Indians. Manager  &UR; Mike Hargrove called his bluff, telling
Cora he was free to go. Cora, who hit .059 (1 for 17) in the
playoffs, reconsidered and hung around till the end.
</P>
<P>
   Former can't-miss phenom, Cy Young Award winner to be and
certain Hall of Famer  &UR; Todd Van Poppel was dropped from
Pittsburgh's major league roster last week, marking the sixth time
since 1996 that Van Poppel has either been released or outrighted.
</P>
<P>
   The list for most career Gold Gloves by a shortstop looks like
this:  &UR; Ozzie Smith (13),  &UR; Luis Aparicio (9),  &UR; Mark Belanger (8),
 &UR; Omar Vizquel (6) and  &UR; Dave Concepcion (5).
</P>
<P>
   In a move that further indicates the Orioles will let free
agents  &UR; Roberto Alomar and  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro leave and possibly
trade closer  &UR; Armando Benitez, the club has reassigned first base
coach
 &UR; Carlos Bernhardt back to the Dominican Republic. Bernhardt was
close to all three players.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone knows the New York Yankees and Atlanta
Braves have been the most dominant clubs of the decade, winning a
combined three World Series and collectively making 11 postseason
appearances. At the other end are Detroit (760 losses) and
Philadelphia (738).
</P>
<P>
   The real reason Cleveland assistant GM  &UR; Dan O'Dowd, who was
reared in Baltimore's organization, did not get the vacant Orioles
GM job was his refusal to simply be a yes-man for owner  &UR; Peter
 &UR; Angelos. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
The Yankees, never ones to rest on their laurels, have seriously
discussed trading for such superstars as  &UR; Barry Bonds and &UR; Curt
Schilling. Expect a possible Bonds deal to become intense with the
Yankees dangling  &UR; Andy Pettitte,  &UR; Ricky Ledee and a prospect.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, which benefited immensely from pitching coach  &UR; Dave
Stewart's intensity, knowledge and respect, may lose the four-time
20-game winner to Toronto, which has its eyes on Stewart as
assistant general manager, a title Stewart has desired for some
time. If so, expect  &UR; Rick Sutcliffe to take over as Padres pitching
coach.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep ace  &UR; Kevin Brown, the Padres plan to make a
four-year, $40 million offer. Expect Brown to file for free agency
and be heavily pursued by St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Mike Piazza now signed for seven years, there is a strong
indication that New York Mets catcher/bench warmer  &UR; Todd
 &UR; Hundley has told his agent,  &UR; Seth Levinson, that he'd like to play
in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee and Cincinnati agreed to swap center fielders  &UR; Marquis
Grissom and  &UR; Reggie Sanders last week, sources said, but the
Brewers put the deal on hold until the general managers meetings in
Florida begin in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Former Colorado Manager  &UR; Don Baylor, who turned down a two-year
deal to become Seattle's bench coach, is far more intrigued with
the idea of becoming a vice president for the Rockies. Baylor also
is kicking around the idea of becoming Oakland's hitting coach. &QL;

MIDEAST MARATHON: NINE DAYS OF TALKS

 By SERGE SCHMEMANN and STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What participants at the Wye River Middle East
conference call the Long Night _ the all-night stand from Thursday
to Friday during which an agreement was finally clinched, or almost
clinched _ opened with the second crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That was when President Clinton became so angry with the way
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was treating Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, that the president slammed down his
papers and angrily walked off, exclaiming, ``This is despicable!''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton strode down the full length of the large dining room
where most of the other American, Israeli and Palestinian officials
were gathered and into the executive dining room where Americans
held private meetings. ``He made clear that there was one more
door,'' a witness said, noting that the exit was not final.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu relented, Clinton returned, and the negotiations went
into the crucial home stretch. ``People felt that was a turning
point,'' the official recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His account and those of other members of the American, Israeli
and Palestinian delegations were pieced together in interviews over
the last week.
</P>
<P>
   The first crisis, they said, had come the day before, on
Wednesday, when Netanyahu ordered the members of his team to pack
their bags in protest over what he perceived as an American
ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   The third and final crisis broke out Friday morning, at the end
of the Long Night, when everything seemed sealed and ready for
signing, when Netanyahu suddenly told Clinton that he could not go
home without Jonathan Jay Pollard, an American convicted of spying
for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ``no,'' Netanyahu said ``no deal,'' tempers flared,
Netanyahu went off for a nap, Clinton paced, and several hours of
acute suspense ensued before the exhausted negotiators emerged
under the sparkling chandeliers of the East Room at the White House
to sign on the dotted line, only minutes before sundown ushered in
the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   In between the crises, according to participants at the Wye
talks, was a process that began with several days of relative
inaction and accelerated on Tuesday evening into three days of
fierce, often emotional, sometimes angry, and almost continuous
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the moments of anger and crisis, there were
moments of levity, like Arafat's long ride on a bicycle with
bodyguards trotting along; flashes of humor, like the T-shirts
someone printed up comparing the Wye exercise to the movie
``Groundhog Day,'' in which every day repeats itself; and moments
of high drama, most notably the impassioned plea by the ailing King
Hussein of Jordan, who reminded the participants that there was a
higher purpose in what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   The conference formally opened at the White House on Oct. 15 and
moved to the Wye River Conference Center in Maryland. For the first
several days, the Israelis and Palestinians rehearsed the arguments
and accusations they had been exchanging futilely for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   Two central Israeli players, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, arrived only on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans listened, seeking to distinguish between what they
called red lines and pink lines _ between those positions that were
hard, and those that could be traded.
</P>
<P>
   The real action began Tuesday evening. After dinner, at about 8
p.m., Clinton gathered Netanyahu and Arafat; Samuel R. Berger, the
national security adviser; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright;
Dennis B. Ross, the chief American mediator; Israeli Trade and
Labor Minister Natan Sharansky, and the Palestinian negotiator Abu
Mazen, and declared that the time had come to review the critical
issues and take an inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The president took his pad of paper and, lawyer-like, grouped
all outstanding issues into two columns _ Israeli and Palestinian
core issues _ and three groups: the easiest, the hard, and the
hardest, a senior American official recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, Sharansky made an emotional address seeking to
explain that the Israeli demand for a comprehensive revision of the
Palestinian National Charter to excise the 26 articles calling for
Israel's destruction was not a propaganda exercise, but a
fundamental insistence that the Palestinians make a public
demonstration of their acceptance of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the speech swayed Clinton and Arafat, and
eventually resulted in the agreement. Sharansky's speech was one of
several key interventions by various participants at various times
that helped shape the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also spoke of the crucial role played by Mordechai,
the most moderate member of Netanyahu's Cabinet, in resolving
standoffs and in counterbalancing the conservative prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Mordechai was also crucial in drafting the
complex security arrangements that the Israelis demanded as the
major condition for relinquishing 13 percent more of the West Bank.
At Wye, as in the six months preceding the conference, Netanyahu
repeatedly insisted on ever more specific measures by the
Palestinians and, according to American officials, it was Mordechai
who declared that the security forces were satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's work began at 2:15 a.m., when Albright called
Netanyahu to congratulate him on his 49th birthday. ``Is that
really why you're calling?'' asked an incredulous prime minister.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At 4 a.m., the Americans distributed the draft of a document
that summarized the ideas exchanged on Tuesday. Later that day,
Albright's spokesman, James R. Rubin, announced that the Americans
planned to formally present the document later that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the first crisis struck. Evidently sensing that
the document was a form of American ultimatum, and convinced that
it was devoid of the concrete security measures that he required,
Netanyahu ordered his delegation to pack its bags and demanded that
the Americans provide vans and helicopters for Israel's withdrawal.
Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu's new press spokesman, appeared at the
press center two miles from the Wye Conference Center and announced
the impending Israeli departure.
</P>
<P>
   When Albright came to the Israeli compound at River House at
about 4 p.m., the suitcases were standing dramatically on the lawn.
Clinton canceled his plan to visit Wye that evening, and the
Americans suspended the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was not impressed, and by the time she came to the
Israeli compound, she was well armed. By then, she had learned that
after Netanyahu ordered his team to prepare to pull out, Mordechai
issued his own order to the large security team under his
authority, telling them to stay put. After that Mordechai went out
for a jog, and saw Albright's car. They had a chat and kissed each
other on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   So when Albright met Netanyahu, she told him that he was free to
leave, but that Israeli security people intended to continue their
negotiations with or without him.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai and Netanyahu then went off for a private ride on a
golf cart, and the crisis began to defuse. Security experts from
all three sides gathered for another three hours and concluded the
crucial security agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m., Netanyahu issued a statement declaring that he had
received assurances enabling him to stay. He sent one of his
negotiators, Yitzhak Molcho, to apologize to the Americans, and to
blame the young and inexperienced Bushinsky for the whole episode.
Whether the Israelis could have left even if they wanted to is not
certain. Their pilot reportedly got lost en route to Andrews Air
Force Base, and the Americans never ordered the helicopters they
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   So dawned Thursday, the longest day. The president arrived,
American officials recalled, and declared the order of the day:
``We are going to stay here until we finish this. We are going to
finish it today, or we're not going to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   At about 3 p.m., Netanyahu and Arafat were spotted having a
direct conversation. After about 30 minutes, they sent for Albright
to go out and ask them to meet, evidently to offset any impression
that they had become chummy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent three hours on the hard-core issues _ the charter,
the arrest of prisoners, weapons,'' an American official said.
``The glacier began to break up and they moved off maximalist
positions. They broke the ice, but they couldn't build it. So we
came back into it, and the president put down a set of ideas, and
it came together.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fatigue mounted, Clinton invited Hussein to speak to the
participants. Arriving in the evening, gaunt and hairless after a
treatment of chemotherapy for cancer, the king issued his memorable
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear a pin drop,'' a negotiator recalled. ``It
lifted everyone up and gave some impetus, which lasted, oh, an hour
or so.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when the second crisis broke. Netanyahu, Arafat and
Clinton were in a corner of the large dining room finishing the
prisoner issue, when the prime minister began issuing more demands
to the Palestinian, until he finally became abrasive. Arafat rose
up and went to another table.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key moment,'' a witness said. ``Clinton became
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Arafat is renowned in the Middle East for the tantrums he
has thrown at virtually every crucial negotiation, at Wye he had
decided to be studiously patient and polite. ``He was always
gracious and accommodating,'' a confounded Israeli reported. ``He
rode his bike, he played the game, he never lost his cool. He never
threatened to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for his behavior was his trust in Albright. It
was the secretary who regularly briefed and reassured Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Another actor who was carefully watched was Sharon, who, as he
had vowed, never shook Arafat's hand. When they were introduced by
Netanyahu, the two men acknowledged each other with a nod of the
head. Sharon, a hardliner, had repeatedly declared that he would
resist any West Bank withdrawal of more than 6 percent, but in the
end, participants said, Sharon gave no indication of holding
Netanyahu back.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued on through Thursday night and into Friday
morning. By 6:30 a.m. they appeared sewn up. Netanyahu scheduled a
news conference for 9 a.m. at Wye, to be followed by a signing
ceremony at the White House at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the final crisis, the ``7 a.m. incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Word had come that the Israel radio had announced that Netanyahu
would be bringing Pollard home. That would certainly be a prize for
the prime minister, one that would go a long way to offsetting the
fury of the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was that Clinton insisted that he never promised to
release the spy, only to consider the case once again.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the president was furious. For the next hour
and a half, he and Netanyahu talked in private, after which the
Israeli said he needed a nap.
</P>
<P>
   The president paced. The American instinct now was to give
Netanyahu a chance to back down.
</P>
<P>
   He did. At noon, Mordechai told the Americans that Netanyahu
wanted to meet. At 2 p.m., the prime minister agreed to sign
without a firm commitment about Pollard, and all that remained was
the signing. But even as he flew in his helicopter to the White
House, Clinton sent Albright to have one more discussion with
Arafat, to make sure the deal was secure.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton won plaudits from all sides, his own
included, for the extraordinary time he invested in Wye, his
evenhandedness, and the attention to detail that he demonstrated.
Arafat was lauded for his patience. And despite all the crises that
Netanyahu created, participants declared that he had made wrenching
concessions, and that if he was the most demanding, it was because
he had the most to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from a moment or two when he stepped over the line, the
prime minister dealt with the Chairman with respect,'' a senior
American participant said. ``But he was under a hell of a lot of
pressure. The portrayal of Bibi'' _ Netanyahu's nickname _ ``as an
enfant terrible, and Yasser as a Buddha, is just wrong. They were
both putting it all on the line. And everything mattered. And they
used every weapon at their disposal, except that the arsenals are
different.''

HULL AND JOHNSON: NON-RACE MEANS NO INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With nine days remaining until the Nov. 3 election, Arizonans
have no reason to hope that the governor's race will ever begin.
</P>
<P>
   One would think that, with the prize of leading one of the
nation's fastest-growing states into the new millennium hanging in
the balance, voters might have been given a substantive discussion
between the pair of humble offerings from the state's major
political parties: incumbent Gov. Jane Hull, a Republican, and her
Democratic opponent, Paul Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   They might have offered contrasting views about where the state
is now and where it is going in the 21st century. They might have
treated us to discussions, debates and exchanges. They might have
given us enough information to make an intelligent choice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we got charges, countercharges, excuses and
counter-excuses. From Johnson, we got water used as mud and attacks
on a school finance plan that was four years in the making. From
Hull, we got this message: If you want an audience with the chief
executive, you had better bring your checkbook. And election
campaigns are just programmed public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what went wrong with this year's governor's race can be
blamed on the numbers. Poll after poll, for most of this year, has
shown Hull leading Johnson by a comfortable 2-1 margin. A poll
released just last week by Channel 8 (KAET-TV) and pollster Bruce
Merrill found Hull is supported by 53 percent of respondents, with
27 percent backing Johnson. Libertarian Katherine ``Kat'' Gallant
and Reform Party candidate Scott Malcomson had 2 percent and 1
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   When simliar poll data appeared at the beginning of the
governor's race, it was not terribly surprising. Coming off the
Fife Symington scandal, voters were hungry for any form of
stability and willing to give the relatively unknown Hull the
benefit of the doubt. Johnson, meanwhile, already had one loss
under his belt, having been beaten by Chandler grocer Eddie Basha
in a messy 1994 Democratic primary. The race had produced a series
of Johnson television commercials that attacked Basha and earned
Johnson a reputation for being aggressive, ambitious, even abusive.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Hull's 2-1 lead over Johnson may have been
understandable in February, it is shocking in late October.
</P>
<P>
   The stagnant polls may be attributable to two things: what
Johnson has done during the campaign and what Hull has not done.
</P>
<P>
   In need of a good parachute to stop his free fall in the polls,
Johnson was smart to seize upon the issue of out-of-state money
pouring into an Arizona election, especially after Hull raised
$31,000 during a Las Vegas fund-raiser and then failed to provide
clear and consistent answers to questions about whether she had
ever discussed, with Nevada officials, the selling of Arizona's
surplus water.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he was dumb to push the issue too far, charging that Nevada
was so thirsty for Arizona water that housing developments were
stalled. Once that charge was proven false, political observers
were tempted, perhaps unfairly, to dismiss the entire fund-raising
charge as the rantings of a desperate man.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, the candidate, already in a hole, dug in even
further with critical comments about one of Hull's most prized
accomplishments: the Students FIRST plan.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson may or may not be correct in his assessment that the
plan is doomed because it lacks a sustained source of funding.
Nonetheless, Johnson should have realized the obvious: that after
seven years of legal wrangling and four more of political
horse-trading to get all parties to agree to Students FIRST, voters
are simply not anxious to go back to the drawing board and may
resent Johnson for faulting the half-loaf that many feel lucky to
have.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hull is feeling pretty lucky herself. Faced with an
opponent intent on self-mutilation, Hull has decided to steer clear
and let him have at it. Her lead in the polls allows her to
concentrate on running the state rather than on getting elected.
However, it also tempts her to keep quiet, to ignore Johnson's
charges, to campaign only as much as she is forced to, and as a
result to remain silent on any plans, goals, or ideas she may have
for a new term.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood Hull will be given a four-year term soon. And
voters still have absolutely no idea what she intends to do with
it.
</P>
<P>
   The voters of Arizona deserved better this year than one
candidate desperate to win and the other sure that she already has.
They deserved a race. &QL;

   Yet, during driver introductions today at the Dura Lube/Kmart
500 at Phoenix International Raceway, no NASCAR Winston Cup racer
likely will endure more boos, obscene gestures and derogatory
name-calling than Jeff Gordon, the sport's newest and also most
hated star.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the crowd's anticipated response, you'd think Darth
Vader was in town. Or Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   Aren't we talking about the same squeaky-clean guy who does
commercials for ice cream, toothpaste, Pepsi and, yes, even milk.
</P>
<P>
   Milk and ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   And the same guy who in 30 previous stock-car races this season
has driven with a Bible scripture pasted to the front of the
steering wheel, put there by his wife, Brooke, a former Miss
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   So why is this boy next door also the most despised stock-car
driver on the planet, the guy fans most would like to see go
slamming into a concrete wall?
</P>
<P>
   For all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   And for one more reason, too.
</P>
<P>
   He wins too much. And in a sport where fan loyalty to individual
drivers takes on cultlike characteristics, winning too much means
Gordon might as well be stealing food from someone else's table.
</P>
<P>
   How does Gordon react to the negative reaction? Just like you'd
expect an All-American guy would.
</P>
<P>
   With a smile. &QL; 
RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they dislike me because I'm taking wins from their
favorite driver,'' Gordon said. ``I don't know. I just really try
and appreciate the fans I do have. I'd like to thank them for their
support.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 27, entered the stock-car world five years ago, at a
time when it was beginning to mushroom into a mainstream sport.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, NASCAR attendance has grown 65 percent, to 6.1
million and licensed souvenir sales have increased from $80 million
eight years ago to $800 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   The projection is for sales to increase to $1.2 billion by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   And guess who's helped take the sport, once bound by its
Southeastern roots, to new frontiers?
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, whose California upbringing _ he moved to Indiana when
he was 13 _ also hasn't endeared him to diehard stock-car fans,
many of whom prefer their heroes to have North Carolina, Georgia
and Tennessee birthplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon drove one race in 1992, then began a full-time stock-car
career the following season. &QL; 
FAST RIDE TO THE TOP
</P>
<P>
   He was winless in 1993, but won twice in 1994 and captured the
first of two driving championships in 1995, posting seven wins.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won 10 races in 1996, finishing runner-up in the
championship, then won 10 more races last season and a second
driving title.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Gordon has been nearly unstoppable. In 30 starts, he's
won 11 times and finished in the top five an astounding 24 races.
</P>
<P>
   Should Gordon manage to finish a couple of positions ahead of
Mark Martin in today's race, which begins at high noon, he will
have clinched a third title in four years with two races remaining
on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder why fans of Dale Earnhardt, Rusty Wallace and
Dale Jarrett hardly can stomach the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that in our sport, these things
happen,'' Gordon said recently. ``You look back through the years
and when guys like Darrell Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt were winning
a lot, those guys got booed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's a good thing to have (because it means you're
winning). So I'm not ashamed of it or upset by it all. I just kind
of wave, give a smile and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   But that won't stop the Gordon haters from venting their anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't I like Jeff Gordon? Just because I don't think he's
paid his dues like some of the other drivers,'' said Holly Tinsley,
a 30-year-old full-time student at Arizona State University and a
devoted Martin fan. ``Now he's winning all the time and it's my guy
he's beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just bothers me that he wins so much. And he's so young,
good-looking and has a great-looking wife. My guy (Martin) isn't
even 40 (he's 39 years old), but he's got all these wrinkles and
looks like he's 60. Gordon needs some wrinkles because people don't
like perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like flaws.'' &QL; 
ANTI-GORDON WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Gordon doesn't appear to have any.
</P>
<P>
   But you wouldn't know that by clicking on the Jeff Gordon Haters
of America Unite home page on the World Wide Web, where after a few
minutes you'd swear Napoleon had been reincarnated as a 5-foot-7,
150-pound stock-car driver.
</P>
<P>
   Or by sliding that little mouse over to the NASCAR Fans Against
Jeff Gordon Web site, where you can scan photos of Gordon crashing
into walls, cars, fences, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Want to view a rigged photo of Gordon with spiked green hair and
an earring? Or a Gordon HATE meter? Click-click-click.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a real big Jeff Gordon fan,'' said Tom Walker,
34, of Mesa. ``But he's become greedy. He's only in the sport for
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's a cocky little guy. I wouldn't want to see anyone get
hurt, but I wouldn't mind seeing (Gordon) hit the wall and be taken
out of (today's) race.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's fans, however, also are legion.
</P>
<P>
   At the Williams-based Jeff Gordon Fan Club, Gordon's recent
success on the racetrack has meant constant telephone inquiries
requesting membership information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet we've gotten 3,000 new members the last two weeks,''
said Russ Harris, the fan club's national coordinator. ``It's
pushed us over 20,000. We've got members in all 50 states and eight
or nine countries like New Zealand, Ireland, France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people say Jeff Gordon hasn't paid his dues.
They say he's achieved too much, too soon. A lot of people don't
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I get in one-on-one conversations with these Gordon
haters (on the Internet), they can't ever tell me anything about
him. They just hate him.'' &QL; 
RIVALS' FANS FIND UNITY
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham, however, who is Gordon's crew chief and close
friend, doesn't believe the hatred exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people hate him, but they certainly don't like
him winning all the time,'' Evernham said. ``Gordon is just the guy
who unifies all the other drivers' fans, and they all boo him
together because he's a consistent winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't his best friend, I'd boo him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, a three-time Winston Cup champion who also is No. 3 on
the all-time winning list with 84 career victories, understands
what Gordon is going through. Nearly 20 years ago, it was
anti-Darrell this and anti-Darrell that every time it seemed he
turned around on pit road, especially during the 1981-82 seasons,
when he won 12 races each season and back-to-back driving titles. &QL; 
NOT SINGLED OUT BY FANS
</P>
<P>
   ``People were wearing their `Anyone but Darrell' T-shirts when I
was winning all the time, too,'' Waltrip said. ``But some of the
stuff I hear said about Jeff, I feel really bad for him. He doesn't
deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR car owner Joe Gibbs, who won three Super Bowls while
coaching the Washington Redskins of the National Football League,
doesn't believe Gordon is being unnecessarily singled out by fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how famous or what a good job a driver is doing,
only 20 percent of the people pull for any one driver,'' Gibbs
said. ``That means there's 80 percent pulling for their driver. And
that 80 percent isn't going to like the fact that other driver is
dominating things. We're talking about a loyal fan base here.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR President Bill France recognizes there are fans on both
sides of the Gordon fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate because he's a very nice young man,'' France
said of the boos for Gordon. ``America has a tough time with guys
coming in and knocking off their heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont Automotive Finishes, whose rainbow-colored decals and
logo are plastered all over Gordon's No. 24 Chevrolet Monte Carlo
stock car, sees no negatives in being the team's major corporate
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it invests millions of dollars each year, perhaps as
much as $5 million to $6 million, to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Team owner Rick Hendrick) recommended we sponsor a rookie
driver named Jeff Gordon (back in 1993), but we didn't know too
much about him,'' DuPont National Sales manager Jon Owen said.
``But it's been a tremendous ride for DuPont. As Jeff's popularity
has grown, our exposure has grown and the business has grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't put an exact (dollar figure) on it, but our
involvement certainly pays for the investment we make in NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the boos and the possibilities some fans might
refuse to purchase DuPont products because of the Gordon
association?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the booing) is really malicious,'' Owen said.
``And I'm sure there's some Earnhardt fans out who who use DuPont
paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But don't bet on it. &QL;

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is John Glenn fit enough for a physically demanding space
flight, while many other 77-year-olds can barely walk?
</P>
<P>
   Glenn may be a good example of what aging will look like in the
near future _ particularly for young and midlife Americans who are
willing to learn a lifestyle lesson from him and the other
silver-haired Indiana Jones types like him.
</P>
<P>
   Some seniors may wonder why the Ohio senator would even ``want''
to subject himself to all the trouble and risk of his space flight.
If they can't relate to his excitement and sense of exploration,
they probably aren't ``explorers'' themselves _ a category being
coined by psychologists to describe an elite group of elders who
move into their 70s and 80s at full steam and in good health,
driven by an intense interest in life.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn may be the poster boy for this active group, but he has
plenty of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's collection of ``explorer'' types includes energetic
77-year-old television personality Hugh Downs and Dr. Gladys
McGarey, pioneer of holistic medicine, and at age 77 still a
practicing doctor and foundation director. Arizona communities are
teeming with bright, healthy, energetic residents in their 70s and
older who live creative and productive lives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Miller, 78, of Scottsdale, founded an international
mining company three years ago. Jim House, 73, of Sun City Grand in
Surprise finished a bicycle ride across Arizona this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Explorers tend to stay in the orbit they established as
younger people _ they don't throw away their address books when
they turn 65,'' said Dr. James Birren, 80, of Los Angeles. He is
one of the founders of gerontology, the study of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, for example, wouldn't be going up except for the
connections and experiences he had as an astronaut and a
politician, Birren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a true explorer of space and life _ he decided he was
going into space and he made it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Elder explorers often take an artist's approach toward life,
explained Birren, creating and achieving in ways that defy
society's expectations of their age group.  &QL; 
DEVELOPING INTERESTS
</P>
<P>
   ``Just play golf? You've got to be kidding!'' said Clinton
Miller of Scottsdale. He recently signed a mining agreement in
China. He also has gone to Russia, South America and other
destinations on mining missions. On these business adventures he
descends into sometimes dangerous mines to make quick business
judgments. Mici, his supportive wife of 54 years, says she worries
about him down in those mines, but just says her prayers and
understands he needs to do what he does.
</P>
<P>
   Miller often returns to the United States full of stories that
many people aren't interested in. They want to talk about sports
and comic strips, which bore him to tears. Other friends say they
wish they had developed more interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that 25 years (in retirement) is a lot time to play
golf, which is true. It's a big world full of interesting people,''
Miller said. ``We're opening a new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his formula for active living is based on opportunities,
but inner drive is the core of it, Miller said. His advice to
younger people is that they broaden their interests beyond their
specialties, that they read books and get out there in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The new breed of elder explorers have had to serve as their own
models: In most cases, their parents or grandparents died at much
younger ages. But family genes don't seem to be a limiting factor.
</P>
<P>
   Genes are only a 30 percent to 35 percent factor in physical
aging, according to Birren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good genes are like capital. But it's how you invest and
protect that capital _ like with exercise and education _ that
makes a difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christine Cassel, chair of the department of geriatrics at
Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, agrees that
lifestyle choices make a difference, but it's more than going to
the gym regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say that it is all spirit and attitude. But money,
education, opportunities and basic health are key to late-life
vitality,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every study shows that socioeconomic status and education are
the most important factors linked to healthy aging. If we want to
put our money somewhere to get healthier people in old age, it is
education and equal opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's no sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is luck. Life is a hail of bullets, and cancer is
getting hit by a truck,'' Downs said in a crash of metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the brain is one of those things that you have to use or
lose. You're going to decay mentally if you don't take on
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Downs assigns deadlines to put himself in positions where he has
to deliver. ``Lots of time I get myself in projects and say, `Why
did I ever agree to do that?' But then I do it and enjoy it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Downs said he was a fairly timid man until age 30. During the
past half century, however, he has been more adventurous, with many
of his exploits televised. An upcoming ``20/20'' segment will
feature his two-week ordeal aboard a Russian nuclear-powered ice
breaker at the North Pole. In 1982, he ventured to the South Pole,
where he was assigned the ceremonial duty of straightening the
pole.
</P>
<P>
   McGarey says the extraordinary older people she knows are
involved in something beyond themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep going because the mission doesn't end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her formula for staying healthy is to stay fresh in spirit. She
recites a bit of wisdom from the Chinese: When the wheat is green
and the wind blows, it bends. If the wheat is dry and the wind
blows, it breaks.
</P>
<P>
   For 52 years, she has been working to bridge the gap between
conventional and holistic medicine, and to normalize the human
experience in health care _ such as fighting to allow fathers into
delivery rooms. Reared in India as the daughter of medical
missionaries, she has long believed that doctoring, at its best,
must include a spiritual component. She operates a foundation to
further that idea, and speaks to groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   What drives ``explorer'' types like John Glenn, Gladys McGarey
and Hugh Downs? Downs says that people who are still super-active
in their later years are people with enormous curiosity and inner
security. A good sense of humor usually comes with the package.
</P>
<P>
   And for some, there is a consuming need to be first or best or
just awesome.
</P>
<P>
   A good day for Jim House is bicycling 100 miles. This past week,
the retired metallurgist from Sun City Grand rode 500 miles. In the
process, he raised money to buy hundreds of kids bicycle helmets.
</P>
<P>
   He bicycles 10,000 or 12,000 miles a year. With body fat of 14
percent, House is fitter than 95 percent of people his age.
</P>
<P>
   He ran for 40 years until he wore out his knees. They don't hurt
when he rides his bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I live there are all kinds of nuts like me. Folks
running up and down the Grand Canyon in one day or to the top of
Flagstaff's Mount Humphreys,'' the highest point in Arizona, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He won a gold medal at the Senior Olympics in 1997 but it wasn't
easy. Competition is fierce in the 70 to 74 age group.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow explorer types don't ask why Glenn is going back to
space. They get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could make that trip,'' Downs said. ``I'm in about the same
shape he is. And if they asked me to go, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   He interviewed Glenn for a ``20/20'' segment this past week, and
took (and passed) some of the astronaut tests himself.
</P>
<P>
   McGarey, who has known Glenn since they were both in the same
class at Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio, said she isn't
surprised by his upcoming voyage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is such a clear person _ there is nothing hidden about
him,'' she said. ``He is doing what he is doing because he believes
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a mission, a purpose, it keeps you going. If you
have a goal involving material things _ like a beautiful house _
that's not enough to fire the spirit.''  &QL; 
EXTENDING PARTICIPATION
</P>
<P>
   Although some elders may cheer on Glenn as he demolishes
stereotypes about age, younger people can cheer that he is
extending their years of accepted participation and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific advances in the next three or four decades are
expected to push the average life span up at least to the mid-80s
and many more people will live past 100. If society doesn't
dramatically bump up its definition of ``too old,'' those extra
years will be wasted for many people.
</P>
<P>
   If Glenn's flight does not go well, another poster boy or girl
will take his place. The demographic shift is unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   If the flight does go well, however, elder Americans who cheered
Glenn for pushing open the frontier of space now will cheer him for
pushing open the frontier of time. &QL;
