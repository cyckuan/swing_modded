<HEADLINE> Cohen Says Success Achieved in U.S. Action Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said Thursday that he was satisfied with the U.S.
military action against Iraq because preliminary reports showed
his forces had achieved a "good measure of success" in hitting
Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks on the "Good Morning America" show of
the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and made a similar comment
on the Associated Press radio program.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary said that Iraqi air defense and command targets
were damaged in the first wave of strikes on Iraq. However, the
United States was not ready to declare total success.
</P>
<P>
The first spy satellite and spy plane photographs examined by
Pentagon officials Thursday morning were sketchy, Cohen said, but
he was "impressed with the accuracy" of the strikes.
</P>
<P>
About the civilian casualties in Iraq, Cohen responded curtly
to Iraqi claims that civilian targets were struck by stray cruise
missiles: "We've got the right targets."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the targets, hit by guided cruise missiles launched
from ships and anti-radar missiles launched from Navy EA-6B
fighters, were all military in nature and that the Pentagon sought
to avoid civilian casualties. The United States was not trying to
kill Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein as part of the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Army troops and 35 aircraft were en route to the
Persian Gulf region today, Cohen said. The troops are bound for
Kuwait where they will join 3,000 U.S. soldiers already on hand in
the unlikely event Iraq strikes out in response to the air assault.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes, dubbed "Operation Desert Fox," are expected to
be over by this weekend, when the Muslim holy month of Ramadan
begins. But Cohen said the U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf will remain as long as Iraq remains a threat.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Dips to Lowest in Six Months in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
dropped 1.2 percent to 14.2 billion U.S. dollars in October,
declining for a second straight month and the lowest level since
April, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. goods and service exports jumped 2.8 percent to 79.6
billion dollars in October, the best showing in a year. The
improvement reflected an increase of 720 million dollars in
shipments of agricultural products, led by big gains in sales of
soybeans, wheat and corn.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. exports of computers parts and semiconductors climbed
by 214 million dollars in October, led by increased purchases by
plants in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports also went up in October, climbing 2.2
percent to a record 93.8 billion dollars. This gain was led by
increases in crude oil purchases, which increased 281 million
dollars in October.
</P>
<P>
Imports of foreign autos and parts increased 349 million
dollars in October to an all-time high of 13.3 billion dollars.
Imports of advanced technology products also climbed to a record
high of 14.3 billion dollars, reflecting big gains in purchases of
foreign commercial airplanes and airplane engines.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of toys to stock shelves for the holidays were up 193
million dollars in the month.
</P>
<P>
For October, the deficit with Japan shot up by 17.8 percent to
6 billion dollars, the biggest since March 1995.
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of this year, the U.S. trade deficit
with Pacific Rim countries, including those hardest hit by
economic and financial chaos, was up by 34 percent to 134 billion
dollars, far above last year's gap of 110.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the improvements in September and October, the overall
deficit is still running at a record annual rate of 167 billion
dollars, according to the department.

Cohen made the remarks on the "Good Morning America" show of

press at the Pentagon later in the day.
</P>
<P>
"All the reports that I've seen to date, and they're very
preliminary, would indicate that we've achieved a good measure of
success as far as the targeting that we had in mind and what we
were able to carry out. So I'm satisfied that things are under way
and successfully so," Cohen said on ABC.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary said that Iraqi air defense and command
targets were damaged in the first wave of strikes on Iraq while
there were no casualties at all on the American side. However, the
United States was not ready to declare total success.

BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Britain
on Thursday striked five industrial establishments, different
districts in Baghdad which are heavily populated with civilians,
individual houses and Security Police building, said Iraqi
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here on Thursday evening, Sahhaf said
the five industrial establishments "are completely under long-term
monitoring regime" with camers installed in those establishments.

He said the U.S. and Britain attacked twice a small factory
for dry batteries.

Sahhaf said that teams of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
inspected the building of Security Police more than once and
found nothing in it.
</P>
<P>
"They bombarded also the Military Intelligence Service
headquarters" where UNSCOM had visited more than once, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"These are the examples to show how cheap liars are the
officials, the leaders of the American regime and the British
regime," said Sahhaf.

The U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes codenamed "Operation
Desert Fox" against Iraq at around midnight Wednesday.

PYONGYANG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea Thursday condemned the U.S. air raids on Iraq
and said President Bill Clinton's speech to his nation was
"nothing but sophistry defending the cruel strikes against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency said in a comment that the
divergences between Iraq and the U.N. weapons inspecting team
should be settled through dialogues, rather than military means.
</P>
<P>
"Intimidating a sovereign state, resorting to military actions
when the situation runs counter to its wishes, and seeking excuses
that sound reasonable are all arrogance, rudeness and despicable
behaviors," the official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The comment pointed out that the U.S. military actions revealed
the country's true intention of toppling the Iraqi government.
Clinton's speech showed the United States "as a trampler of
sovereignty, a saboteur of peace and a maniac of war," the agency
added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made a televised address from his Oval Office in
Washington Wednesday saying the air strikes on Iraq were designed
to safeguard the security of the United States and the interests
of the Americans and the people of the world.

<P>
TEHRAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran Thursday lodged strong
protest to Washington and London after one of their missiles hit
an Iranian city.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the Swiss ambassador and the
British charge d'affaires to Tehran and filed the protest,
Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
A missile from the U.S.-Britain military raids against Iraq
hit Iran's southwestern city of Khorramshahr in Khuzestan province
early Thursday morning, causing no casualties but damaging some
residential units.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain are responsible for the losses caused by
the missile attack, said the foreign ministry's director general
on Euro-American affairs on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official also voiced Iran's deep concern on the
safety of Iranian officials and pilgrims in Iraq.

The Swiss ambassador and British charge d'affaires expressed
regret that the missile hit an Iranian city by mistake and
promised to inform the concerned parties over the issue.

The Swiss embassy in Tehran has been responsible for taking
care of the U.S. interest in Iran since Tehran and Washington
severed their diplomatic relations in 1980.
</P>

After months of disputes over weapons inspections, U.S. and
British forces early Thursday launched the biggest air strikes
against Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion

<HEADLINE> World Bank Clarifies Use of Donor Funding in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank (WB) official
has clarified the destinations of donor funds the Ugandan
government has been pledged recently.
</P>
<P>
Randolph L.P. Harris, the WB resident representative in
Uganda, told a press briefing Thursday afternoon that the 2.2
billion U.S. Dollars Uganda will receive from the donors in the
next three years should be used very productively.
</P>
<P>
The funding, which accounts for one third of the country's
spending budget, will mainly be used to improve the country's
basic services, he said.
</P>
<P>
The money should go down to the grassroots so that farmers in
remote areas can become beneficiaries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic amount of fund, with 58 percent in form of grant
and the rest in form of long-term very concessional loans, will
surely improve the country's capacity.
</P>
<P>
The WB is using the government's poverty eradication action
plan as a framework for allocating aid, the official said.
</P>
<P>
When asked what they would do if Uganda was found using the
donor's fund in its defense spending, he said the Ugandan
government had pledged that the increase in defense spending will
be restricted to agreed limits and will not affect the priority
areas the donors' funding is intended for.
</P>
<P>
He said he is sure that the government is able to curb the
rampant corruption shaking the country, adding that it is the
economic performance that they focus their attention on.
</P>
<P>
The donors held its annual Consultative Group meeting in
Kampala last week and committed to give 2.2 billion Dollars to
support its growing economy.

Uganda, made the remarks at a press briefing here Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"This is a healthy thing. The Bank of Uganda has taken
measures to curb the irregularities in the financial and fiscal
sector," the official said.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni has emphasized that this is not a
matter of political will, but a matter of institutional capacity,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The reported corruption of some ministers in the privatization
process in Uganda has hit headlines here and one minister has
resigned, one is facing censure from parliament and two others
openly apologized to the public in their defense in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Uganda launched the privatization drive towards more than 100
parastatals in 1995. A total of over 80 public enterprises have
been privatized through means of selling, divesting, setting up
joint ventures etc.
</P>
<P>
The alleged increasing corruption in the process slowed down
the process and now accusing fingers are directed to the
ministers complicated in the matter.
</P>
<P>
The public has let out a loud outcry for the president to
bring the corrupt to book.

<HEADLINE> Diversified Reactions in Germany to Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Diversified voices were heard in
Germany on Thursday on the military strikes by the United States
and Britain against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said the German government
"unequivocally stands with its allies" on the issue of the strike.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is Iraqi President Saddam Hussein who provoked
the strike by not cooperating with the U.N. arms inspectors. So
the Iraqi government should be held responsible for the
consequences. The international community will not tolerate
Saddam Hussein's stands.
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said in Brussels,
where he was attending a meeting of NATO defense ministers, that
"the German government, politically, supports the U.S."
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility for these strikes lies with Saddam Hussein,
as he has not respected U.N. resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Scharping also added, "We hope that there will be a quick
political solution."
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Democratic Party voiced regret over the joint
American-British air raid on Iraq but held it necessary.
</P>
<P>
Other major opposition parties such as the Christian Democratic
Union and Christian Socialist Union have also expressed support
for the strike.
</P>
<P>
Former German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe even urged the
government to make clear its political support to the military
action and to provide logistics aid to its allied troops when
necessary.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, displeasure emerged in Germany at the air
raid.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Socialist Party said the United States and
Britain are implementing their own laws when conducting the
strike, adding that it is an action violating relevant
international laws.
</P>
<P>
Green Party experts on military control called the raid "an
adventure," while other experts suspected whether mass destruction
weapons can be totally destroyed in Iraq through the military
moves.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent) British Launch 1st Iraq Air Strikes From Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- British Tornado bombers
launched their first Iraq air strikes at 1500 GMT from a Kuwaiti
air base in the second day of U.S.-led military operations.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Royal Air Force in Kuwait was quoted by
Reuters as saying that some of the 12 Tornados deployed at this
base "are taking an active part in the campaign over Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the aircraft took off for Iraq missions
shortly after sunset in the northern Gulf "on their first mission
of the campaign."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, the warplanes stood armed and ready near the
Iraqi border, waiting for orders to carry out precision bombings
with laser guided weapons.
</P>
<P>
They had been on high alert at this base some 56 km (35 miles)
south of the Iraqi border for the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources said these Tornado bombers should be
responsible for 20 percent of the military campaign which was
launched to punish Baghdad for what Washington and London say the
failure to fully cooperate with United Nations arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkey for Missile Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday criticized
neighboring Turkey for its statements concerning the planned
installation by Cyprus of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas described the Turkish statements as
"unacceptable," saying that Greece and Cyprus' defense policies
were not defined on the basis of Turkey's desires.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said Wednesday that the deployment of the S-300 missiles
in Cyprus or Greece would threaten Turkey's security and the best
solution would be the cancellation of the missile order.
</P>
<P>
Such statements constituted a travesty of the principles and
rules of international law and at the same time illustrated the
impasses of Turkish foreign policy, Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Turkey to meet the decisions of the United Nations
and contribute to a political settlement of the protracted Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which has been divided since 1974, decided earlier last
year to purchase and deploy the Russian-made S-300 missiles to
strengthen its defense capacity, but this has been criticized by
Turkey, which has openly threatened to use force to prevent the
missile installation.

<HEADLINE> Conflict Parties in Africa Urged to Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Parties to conflicts in
Africa have been urged to compromise to bring peace to the
continent on the eve of the new century.
</P>
<P>
President of Burkina Faso and current chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Blaise Compaore made the
appeal at the opening ceremony of a mini summit of African
leaders that opened Thursday in Ougadougou, the capital of
Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Campaore said Africans have to find solutions to their many
conflicts, which he said, is at variance with the ideas of the
founding fathers of the OAU.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parties to the conflicts to approach issues with
a true spirit of African brotherhood and fraternity. African
leaders have a responsibility to find solutions to her problems
as the human being is entering the 21st century, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 18 African leaders and 30 delegations attended the
two-day meeting of the fourth ordinary session of the Central
Organ of the OAU Mechanism for conflict prevention, management
and resolution at summit level.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, the summit turned to a closed
session.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will consider the report of an OAU high level
delegation which visited Ethiopia and Eritrea in June to
investigate the border dispute of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also to consider the report by OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim on the crisis in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Other issues on the agenda include conflicts in Burundi,
Angola, Guinea Bissau and Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of all countries involved in the conflicts as well as
those of member countries of the Central Organ were present at
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Both DRC President Laurent Kabila and the rebel
representatives are now in Ouagadougou, but Kabila refused to
hold direct talks with the rebels, as has always been his
position.
</P>
<P>
In his words, he is here for the summit of heads of state and
government.
</P>
<P>
While answering Xinhua reporter's question, Salim said he is
certainly expecting a breakthrough on the DRC issue, but all
depends on the result of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the invitation of the rebel of the DRC to
the meeting, because it is a meeting of heads of state and
government.
</P>
<P>
In his report to be delivered to the summit, the
Secretary-General suggested for a two-phase solution to the DRC
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will aim at the attainment of a ceasefire,
withdrawal of foreign troops and deployment of a peace-keeping
force.
</P>
<P>
The second phase will involve political dialog aimed at a
peaceful solution to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Action Against Iraq Difficult But Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday the decision to attack Iraq was "difficult" but that
it was "absolutely the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
He said he doesn't think any serious person would believe that
a president would do that. No "astute" person would think that
Defense Secretary William Cohen and other military officials would
go along with that, added Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that "it would have been a disaster" if the United
States had stood aside and allowed Iraq to develop weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen said the first wave of air
strikes against Iraq produced "severe damage to some targets."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters that Clinton
was pleased with initial reports that the air attacks was a
"success."
</P>
<P>
Clinton met in the Oval Office with top military and foreign
policy advisers for an assessment of the first day of air strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Clinton said the military operation would
not be affected by the impeachment drama on Capitol Hill. "I'm
going to complete this mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also denied any connection between the air strikes and the
upcoming impeachment, saying "it's not true" for the connection.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Forums Satisfied with Economic Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Parties in the Zimbabwean
tripartite negotiating forums have expressed satisfaction over
Thursday's talks to resolve the country's macro-economic problems
but stressed it is the outcome of the negotiations that will
decide the way forward.
</P>
<P>
Briefing local reporters, the government, labor and private
sector representatives said formal dialog is now beginning to
take shape and hoped a social contract will be established to
salvage the country from economic ruin, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
But the representatives will have to consult with their
constituencies on the outcome of the negotiations, expected next
year, before adopting or rejecting it.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a social contract in the making in that
discussions we had, which could have been missing before, are now
being established and we can only hope that we can maintain
them," said Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister
Florence Chitauro, who was representing the government in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Items on the agenda of Thursday's talks include stabilization
of sickly Zimbabwean Dollar, the national budget, privatization
and commercialization of state enterprises and budgetary
implications on the Democratic Republic of Congo war.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said, "There was a request by both parties (labor and
private sector) that the government should move faster in
implementing the decisions it has taken."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabweans had seen their incomes being eroded by high
inflation which hit 45.1 percent in October, soaring interest
rates, and a weak currency which had lost more than 60 percent of
its value since January, and sharp increases in the price of
basic food commodities.
</P>
<P>
All the parties agreed that follow-up talks would be held next
year but had not yet come up with an exact date.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- White House Press secretary
Joe Lockhart told reporters Thursday that given the attacks
underway in Iraq, he did not expect there to be "a real outreach
effort" on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to concentrate on some other things," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more moderate Republicans over the past days
announced support for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said, however, he wasn't ready to concede defeat. "I
take the view of the great philosopher Yogi Berra. It's not over
`till it's over,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Clinton might still make good Thursday
on an earlier promise to meet with Representative Christopher
Shays, one of the few Republicans leaning toward voting against
impeachment. A meeting planned Wednesday with Shays was set aside
because of the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong scepticism about the timing of airstrikes
against Iraq, House Republican leaders postponed an impeachment
vote against President Bill Clinton but asked lawmakers to stay in
town.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to ask that all members, Republican and Democrat,
remain available... for further action possibly Friday, possibly
Saturday, but within the near future," incoming Speaker Bob
Livingston said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's decision to postpone, the president's
prospects were growing increasingly dim as one Republican moderate
after another announced support for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"I would think the votes are pretty much in place," said Rep.
Peter King, a New York Republican who favors censure over
impeachment. "Right now it certainly looks like the president will
be impeached."
</P>
<P>
Livingston said Republicans decided "in the interest of support
of our troops... the only thing that we need do is... pass a
resolution of support for our troops."
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers took up that resolution on the House floor Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt suggested that the House
"not take up impeachment until the hostilities have ended. It
shouldn't come up as long as our troops are in harm's way."
</P>
<P>
Livingston said that Republicans "have left the issue of
impeachment to the conscience of the men and women in the
Congress."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Discusses Ties With Vietnamese Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu
Jintao, who is here on a three-day official visit to Vietnam,
Thursday exchanged views with Vietnamese officials on how to
further develop the ties between their parties and countries.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Pham The Duyet, permanent member of the Political
Bureau of the Vietnamese Communist Party, and Nguyen Thi Binh,
Vietnamese vice president, Hu noted that the leaders of the two
Communist parties and two countries have maintained the tradition
of holding meetings in the past seven years since the two
countries normalized their relations.
</P>
<P>
They "have reached consensus on major questions concerning
their bilateral relations" at such meetings, which have thus
played "an irreplaceable and important role" in promoting the
relationship between the two parties and two countries and in
solving the issues left over by history, Hu was quoted as saying
by a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with and value highly the smooth development
of the ties between the two parties and two countries," said Hu,
who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the task before the two sides is to further
strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the two parties
and two countries, enrich the content of their relations and take
into the next century a more friendly Sino-Vietnamese
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that in recent years, the two countries have seen
fairly rapid development of their economic and trade relations,
but the pace could be faster in view of their potentials and their
wishes for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China last year, he recalled, Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai reached new consensus with Premier Zhu
Rongji on further strengthening their countries' economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to actively push the two countries' economic and
trade cooperation to a new level at the turn of the century, on
the basis of the results of the talks between the two premiers,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the border between the two countries, Hu
pointed out that border talks have gradually become regular since
1993 and progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached between General Secretary Jiang Zemin and
the then General Secretary Do Muoi in July last year on settling
the issue of land border before the year 2000 and concluding the
demarcation of the Beibu Gulf no later than the year 2000, in
particular, has pointed to the direction for the two countries'
border talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China attaches great importance to the consensus
and hopes to make joint efforts with Vietnam to earnestly push
ahead with the border talks and achieve more progress.
</P>
<P>
Hu praised Vietnam for its economic development and renovation
and opening-up policy, noting that the Vietnamese people, under
the leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party, have made
remarkable achievements in their cause of renovation and opening
up.
</P>
<P>
In face of the Asian financial crisis and natural disasters, he
said, the new generation of party and state leaders in Vietnam
have adopted a series of effective measures to ensure social
stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that under the leadership of the Vietnamese
Communist Party and government, the Vietnamese people will surely
overcome their temporary difficulties and realize the objectives
of national industrialization and modernization set by the Eighth
Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pham The Duyet said Vietnam attaches great importance to Hu's
official visit as it believes that frequent exchange of visits by
the two countries' leaders is very important.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that as neighbors, Vietnam and China enjoy
time-honored traditional friendship and they are both carrying out
reform and opening-up policy and focusing their efforts on
modernization. Thus, they both hope for an international
environment of peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Duyet said that in recent years, the two countries' relations
in various fields have witnessed encouraging development and their
leaders have reached important consensus on how to further deepen
their countries' cooperation and solve the border issue at the
earliest date.
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese side will, together with China, actively
implement the consensus and realize the related targets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides explored the direction and framework for
developing the relations between their two parties and two
countries in the 21st century and reached consensus.
</P>
<P>
Duyet said that to maintain the momentum of development of the
relations between the two parties and two countries, General
Secretary Le Kha Phieu of the Vietnamese Communist Party plans to
visit China early next year.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two sides signed an agreement on economic
and technological cooperation between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Hu started his visit here Thursday after
attending an informal summit among East Asian leaders and a
China-ASEAN informal leadership meeting here Wednesday.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 228 African
refugees who were living in Tanzania have been resettled in the
United States, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) announced here Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK-Russia Ties to Survive Iraq: UK Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom said on
Friday that its relations with Russia will survive allied attacks
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook agreed with his Russian
counterpart Igor Ivanov in a telephone talk that the two countries
should work together in the post-military phase of the Iraq
crisis, a spokesman for Cook told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
During the talk dominated by friendly tones, Cook expressed his
regret over Russia's decision to withdraw its ambassador from
London following the allied raids, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added, however, that both his country and Russia
stressed the importance of keeping open channels of communication
despite the ambassador's recall.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, British Defense Secretary George Robertson said he
believed ties with Russia would survive Moscow's sharp criticism
of the U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied that the level of cooperation we have with the
Russians, whether it be through NATO or the UK, is robust enough,
strong enough, and in our mutual self-interest to survive any
particular disagreement over this operation," Robertson told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Russian ambassadors from Washington and
London for consultations over the military action against Iraq,
announced in Moscow earlier Friday, surprised the British
government.

<HEADLINE> Basic Law Resource Center Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Basic Law Resource
Center was opened here Friday, aiming at promoting the
understanding of the Basic law as a constitutional document for
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Located on the Hong Kong Island, the center will provide the
Hong Kong residents with various kinds of facilities such as an
exhibition venue with display boards, an audio-visual corner for
video shows, a computer corner with access to the Basic Law
Homepage, and a comfortable reading area with books, reports,
newspaper cuttings relating to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Anson Chan, administrative secretary, said that the opening of
the Basic Law Resource Center indicates a new step that the SAR
government has made in a Basic Law promotion work with "one
country, two systems" as its theme.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the center will continuously compile the
relevant information on how to draft, promulgate, implement and
promote the Basic law, encouraging people from all walks of life,
including young people, students, civil servants, representatives
of different sectors, professionals as well as scholars to know in
depth the meaning of "one country, two systems", she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, She said: "We are committed to making the concept
of 'one country, two systems' known to the people in the world."
</P>
<P>
A computer corner with access to the Basic law Homepage has
been set up since mid November. About 3,000 people have read the
Basic Law through the homepage.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Edges Up in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers paid 1.2
percent more for goods and services in November than they did a
year ago, Statistics Canada said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The November rate is the highest level that inflation has
reached so far this year. The annual increases have ranged from
0.7 percent in September to 1.1 percent in January and May.
</P>
<P>
Price increases for cable TV services were the major
contributors to the inflation rate rise in November, the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In November, Canadian consumers paid 17.5 percent more for
cablevision services than they did twelve months earlier because
cable companies ended free trial periods for new channels and
increased prices for basic services.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, prices for new automobile vehicles, university
tuition fees, property taxes, travel tours, cigarettes and rent
also rose.
</P>
<P>
Yet, these increases were partly offset by decreases in the
prices of gasoline, computers and telephone services, the agency
said.

<HEADLINE> Third Wave of Air Strikes Against Iraq ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A third wave of U.S. air
strikes against Iraq has been ordered for Friday, a senior U.S
official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There will be another wave of attacks today," the senior
official said. The air raids began on Wednesday and continued on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to say how long President Bill Clinton
was prepared to continue with the air campaign against Iraq,
brushing aside speculation that the Muslim religious observance of
Ramadan would force an end to the effort.
</P>
<P>
The official, who participated in military strategy sessions at
the White House, said U.S. policy-makers believe Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein was caught by surprise by the attacks because he
was convinced Washington would need another military buildup
before it could take action.

<P>
The four articles, approved by the Republican-dominated House
Judiciary Committee last week, include two counts of perjury, one
of obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The debate began with the reading of the four articles of
impeachment by Paul Hays, the House reading clerk.
</P>
<P>
Illinois Republican Ray LaHood was presiding over the
impeachment debate. He warned that while the president's own
conduct is an issue -- there should be no personal abusive
language toward the president.
</P>
<P>
The debate was scheduled to start on Thursday, but delayed in
the wake of the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders decided on Thursday to debate the
impeachment articles despite the objection by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly object to this matter coming up tomorrow or the
next day or any day in which our young men and women in the
military are in harm's way," said Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to know when the troops will have completed
their mission," said House Speaker-designate Robert Livingston.
"We cannot refrain from advancing the people's business on this
critical issue."
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding a 228-206 majority, with one
independent who votes with Democrats, that would leave at least 15
Republicans needing to switch votes for Clinton to void
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
A House vote for impeachment would send the case to the Senate
for a trial, where 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, would be
needed to remove Clinton from office.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Not to Recall Envoy from Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Friday that her country will not recall
its ambassador from Russia despite Moscow's recall of its
ambassador in Washington over U.S. air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the "Today" show of the National Broadcasting
Company (NBC), Albright said she would talk to Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov on the Iraqi situation.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said she had heard reports of Russian troop
movements for unclear purpose.
</P>
<P>
Russia Thursday recalled its ambassador in protest against the
U.S. military attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain started the "Desert Fox" operation on
Wednesday. A third wave of air strikes is going to start later on
Friday or early Saturday, Iraqi time.
</P>
<P>
"I think that clearly the Russians disagree with us about the
use of force in Iraq. They, however, have no good ideas about how
to solve the problem," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
But she stressed that the U.S.-Russia relationship is a very
important one.
</P>
<P>
"We have many, many relations. And I think here the truth
is...that we will disagree with them when we must and cooperate
where we can. But I think that the overall relationship is a very
important one to both countries," she added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state said the U.S. is not planning to recall
its ambassador in Moscow. "We think it's very important to keep
the channels of communication open."
</P>
<P>
"I think that it is important for us to understand that this
relationship is more than about Iraq," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
On resolving the Iraqi crisis, Albright said the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of destroying Iraq's mass
destruction weapons can still go back to Iraq to do inspections if
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would comply.
</P>
<P>
"We think that a really functional UNSCOM, a strong UNSCOM with
professionals, could go in after this and Saddam Hussein could
comply, and then we can go to the comprehensive review," she
said.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Guerrilla Group Starts Handing in Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A Northern Irish Protestant
guerrilla group started handing over weapons Friday, becoming the
first paramilitary group to decommission in the province.
</P>
<P>
The weapons surrendered by the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)
included several blast bombs and detonators.
</P>
<P>
The LVF's move marks the first time a Northern Irish guerrilla
group has agreed to disarm in 30 years of intercommunal strife.
</P>
<P>
The handover came hours after Northern Ireland's political
parties reached an accord on new political institutions for the
British-ruled province, and on a number of all-Ireland bodies.
</P>
<P>
The LVF's move heightens pressure on the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) to end its refusal to give up at least part of its huge
arsenal of weapons and explosives. Last week the IRA repeated it
had no intention of disarming immediately.
</P>
<P>
Politicians hoped the political breakthrough and the handover
by the LVF would lift the faltering peace process out of a gloom
that had settled on it in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Explains Attack on Iraq in Letter to Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton, attempting to heal a rift, has written to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin defending the U.S. decision to attack
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, told
reporters that Clinton's letter, sent Thursday night, makes a case
for the joint attack with Britain, the "Desert Fox" operation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also recalled that the United States and Russia had
worked together in a difficult attempt to work out a peaceful
resolution of Iraq's resistance to U.N. weapons inspections, Leavy
said.
</P>
<P>
When diplomacy failed, Clinton wrote, it was necessary to use
force. He urged Yeltsin to put their disagreement in a larger
context of the important U.S.-Russian relationship.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin Thursday recalled Ambassador Yuli M. Vorontsov to
protest the attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There is little likelihood Yeltsin will change his mind. Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov rebuffed a telephone appeal Thursday
from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Recalling an ambassador for consultations is a traditional way
of registering extreme displeasure. Yeltsin's action is a major
setback for the Clinton administration in its drive for worldwide
support for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday that her
country would not recall its ambassador in Moscow despite Russia's
move.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the "Today" show of the National Broadcasting
Company (NBC), Albright said she would talk to Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov over the Iraqi situation.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said she had heard reports of Russian troop
movements and that the purpose of the movements was unclear.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Strives to Protect Rich Wildlife Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Himalayan kingdom of
Nepal has been striving to protect its rich wildlife species and
its efforts in over two decades have produced tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Though a small country with an area of 147,181 square
kilometers, Nepal is endowed with a high-level species diversity
by its considerable geographic and biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
Tirtha Man Maskey, director-general of the Department of
National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, said that his country
has 176 mammal species which account for about 4.2 percent of the
global mammals.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three species of amphibians (1.1 percent of global
species) and 100 reptile species (1.5 percent) have been recorded
for Nepal, he told Xinhua Friday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nepal is home of 844 bird species, or 8.5 percent
of the world's total, and 180 fish species, which represent about
2.2 percent of the globally known fresh-water fish species.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the country shares 4.2 percent of the globally known
butterflies of 635 species, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the conservation work started in 1972, eight national
parks, four wildlife reserves, four conservation areas and one
hunting reserve have been established across the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal's first national park
established in 1973, stands as a successful testimony of nature
conservation in South Asia. It was designated as a world heritage
site in 1984.
</P>
<P>
"Royal Chitwan National Park is not only an example for Nepal
or the region but for the globe. It is the global treasure,"
Catherine P., president of the World Wildlife Fund, told a recent
regional gathering in Nepal on the conservation of the royal
Bengal tiger.
</P>
<P>
With a pristine area of 932 square kilometers, the park
shelters, among others, some 500 rhinos, over 43 species of
mammal, 450 bird species and over 45 species of amphibians and
reptiles.
</P>
<P>
The park, about 150 kilometers southwest of Kathmandu, is
especially renowned for the endangered one-horned rhino, tiger and
gharial crocodile.
</P>
<P>
There are also other endangered species such as gaur, wild
elephant, four-horned antelope, striped hyena, pangolin, gangetic
dolphin, monitor lizard and python as well as the endangered bird
species like the Bengal florican, lesser florican, black stork and
white stork.
</P>
<P>
"The threats to the wildlife are growing population of humanity
and reduction of habitat," Maskey said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of rhinos was estimated at 800 in 1950
but when the country started the protected area system in 1972, it
stood at less than 100.
</P>
<P>
He noted that between 1972 and 1980, many places were open for
settlement and more than 60 percent of land was cleared for
agricultural purpose.
</P>
<P>
Poaching is another threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that one rhino horn sells at about 800,000 rupees
(11,760 U.S. dollars) in the local market.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted 32 acts and regulations related to
wildlife conservation, including those punishing the poachers of
endangered species, the director-general said, adding that it is
punishable with 15 years' imprisonment or a fine of 100,000 rupees
(1,470 dollars) or both.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this, the poaching activities are almost
controlled," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have anti-poaching units in which local people are
employed to work together with the park staff to collect
information on poaching activities," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we have 14 units in different protected areas," he
added. "They're working very effectively to stop the poaching
activities."
</P>
<P>
"Not only that, actually we're using regular army for
protection purpose," ecologist Narayan Poudel chimed in.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 4,000 armymen are employed in the
protected areas.
</P>
<P>
"And in the conservation areas, we're getting people's
involvement," he said. "We are giving 50 percent of the park
revenue to the local people for community development work."
</P>
<P>
He explained that out of the revenue of each park, 50 percent
or 20 million rupees (294,110 dollars) are given for the benefit
of the local people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the attitude of the local people has changed for
the protection of the wildlife. "This is very important for the
long-term protection," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a number of international agencies like the
United Nations Development Program and the World Wildlife Fund
support Nepal's wildlife conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
On December 12-15, representatives from Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, Myanmar, Nepal and observers from some organizations met in
Chitwan of Nepal on trans-border cooperation in conservation of
the royal Bengal tiger, whose maximum number is estimated at
4,735, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came up with 11 recommendations, calling for
strengthened regional cooperation among the tiger-range countries
and trans-boundary collaborative actions and specific
joint/complementary projects across borders, the declaration
adopted at the meeting noted.

</P>
<P>

Tang that the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties with China has extremely
important symbolic meaning to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
He said that 40 years ago, China took the lead in acknowledging
Algeria's sovereignty, which was a significant event in the course
of Albania's struggle for national liberation.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the Algerian
foreign minister said, the Chinese and Algerian peoples have built
solid friendship and the Algeria-China relationship has been
productive.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is willing to deepen its comprehensive cooperation with
China and strengthen their bilateral consultations on
international issues so as to benefit the peoples of both
countries and safeguard world peace.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Revise Military Contacts With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia will revise its 1999
plan of military contacts with the United States as a result of
the U.S. missile strikes against Iraq, a Russian military official
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The revision, Chief of the International Cooperation Department
of the Russian Foreign Ministry Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov said,
"will depend on the further developments around Baghdad," the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the attacks on Iraq would also prompt Russia to
alter its approach to international security and Moscow's
"military-political line."
</P>
<P>
"We shall be thinking of alternative security structures in the
world, not just Europe. The policy of pressure by individual
countries should be abandoned," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov stressed that most countries in the world favor a
political settlement of critical situations.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes against Iraq "were delivered not only without
the knowledge of Russia, but also contrary to its firmly expressed
stance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia was convinced that the use of armed force by the United
States was groundless and premature, let alone political and
diplomatic ways of settling the Iraqi crisis had not yet been
exhausted, Ivashov noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China vowed to clean sweep the
rowing gold medals at the Asian Games after Friday's competitions,
said Chinese head coach Gao Hongyin at Pattaya.
</P>
<P>
Chinese rowers took all the five gold medals at stake on Friday
and that greatly boosted Gao's confidence.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation set us a target of winning 9 out of 11
golds at the Asiad and after today's competitions, we can say we
are set to win all the 11 golds," said Gao.
</P>
<P>
Gao said in Saturday's six events, Chinese rowers would enjoy
greater advantage:"Now we are on the right track to clean sweep
the Asiad rowing gold medals for the third time."
</P>
<P>
China won all the four rowing golds at 1982 New Delhi Asiad and
repeated that feat at 1990 in Beijing as they won all the 12
titles.

Four years ago at Hiroshima, China narrowly missed that target,
winning 11 out of 12 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"We suffered a severe defeat in the World Championship in
Germany earlier this year," said Gao Hongyin, "after that we held
a training camp in Guangdong and that proved very helpful."
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ma Junren who came to
Guangdong to give us lecture about his experiences of training.
That was very beneficial to us." Gao said.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese rowers proved their depth in the first-day
competitions, the host country's boxers celebrated their victory
after pocketing five of the 12 golds in the sport.
</P>
<P>
Somluck Kamsing, the only Olympic champion of Thailand, had to
fight a very closely contested five-round bout to beat his
Uzbekistan rival Tulkunbav Turgunov in the 57kg class final, the
last event of the Asiad boxing tournament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the 51kg class competitions, Pramuansak Phosuwan
gave Thailand the fourth boxing title with a victory over
Hermensen Ballo of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Friday's athletics competitions saw two different stories in
Asia's fastest man and fastest woman.
</P>
<P>
Koji Ito, the Japanese sprinter who broke the Asian record of
men's 100m, added one gold to his haul after beating the field in
the 200m final.
</P>
<P>
It was his third straight gold at the current Asiad. He also
anchored the Japanese quartet to the 4X100m relay victory.
</P>
<P>
But Li Xuemei, the Asian records holder for both the 100m and
200m, failed to struck a golden double as she was overtaken in the
last meters by Damayanthi Darsha of Sri Lanka in the 200 meters
final.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also had their share of gold medals on Friday as
their men's sabre team beat their Chinese counterparts 45-44 for
the title.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans proved they had made great progress in
fencing as they levelled with China in the medal table, each with
five golds.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago at Hiroshima, China was in dominant position
with five golds to South Korea's two. Kazakhstan got the
remaining one.
</P>
<P>
After Friday's competitions, China tops the overall medal table
with 113 golds, followed by South Korea in the second place with
62.
</P>
<P>
Japan will probably settle for the third place by the end of
the Asian Games as they got only 51 golds so far with two days
left before the conclusion of the games on December 20.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes Claims of British Foreign Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi spokesman on Friday
refuted claims made by British foreign secretary Thursday that his
government respected the holy month of Ramadhan and it was
sensitive toward it.
</P>
<P>
"The government of this criminal and his masters in Washington
are in the forefront of enemies of God and Humanity," the Iraqi
News Agency quoted an Information Ministry spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman added "their aggression on the people of
Iraq on the eve of this (holy) month is an evidence on their
ignorance of the ethical values and international norms and
charters."
</P>
<P>
He also accused the British government of "trying to revenge
the colonialist banner of Britain torn up by the Iraqis in 1941,
1958 and 1972" through attacking Iraq along withe the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The fasting month of Ramadhan in the Arab world will start on
Saturday or Sunday, depending on when the new crescent appears.
</P>
<P>
"While receiving this holy month, the Iraqi people stand firm
under banner of 'God is the greatest' raised by President Saddam
Hussein," the spokesman said, stressing that "the enemies'
aggression will be doomed to failure."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain forces in the Gulf launched air strikes
against Iraq in an operation code-named "Desert Fox" for two
consecutive days on Wednesday and Thursday to punish Baghdad for
its failure to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Starts Impeachment Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives began debate Friday on four articles of
impeachment against President Bill Clinton about his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The four articles, approved by the Republican-dominated House
Judiciary Committee last week, include two counts of perjury, one
of obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The debate was scheduled to start on Thursday, but delayed in
the wake of the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders decided on Thursday to debate the
impeachment articles despite the objection by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly object to this matter coming up tomorrow or the
next day or any day in which our young men and women in the
military are in harm's way," said Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to know when the troops will have completed
their mission," said House Speaker-designate Robert Livingston.
"We cannot refrain from advancing the people's business on this
critical issue."
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding a 228-206 majority, with one
independent who votes with Democrats, that would leave at least 15
Republicans needing to switch votes for Clinton to void
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
A House vote for impeachment would send the case to the Senate
for a trial, where 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, would be
needed to remove Clinton from office.

SHANGHAI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange, a
stronghold for China's market economic reforms, held celebrations
to mark the eighth anniversary of its establishment today.
</P>
<P>
Tu Guangshao, general manager of the stock exchange, said that
SSE has made great contributions to China's reform and opening-up
drive over the past years.

Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits and former mayor of Shanghai, beat the gong
to open trading today.

the guests invited to the celebration ceremony today. He is one of
the earliest professional stock traders on the stock exchange.

markets," Yang said. He is said to have made a fortune
through stock trading.

WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Friday that she regretted the recall of
Russia's ambassador in Washington over U.S. air strikes against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. will not recall its ambassador in Moscow, Albright
said on the "Today" show of the National Broadcasting Company

Noting that she would talk to Russian Foreign Minister Igor

"I think it's unfortunate that they're recalling their
ambassador. We're not planning to recall ours," she said.

<HEADLINE> Bank Extends Loan to Shanghai Company to Encourage Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The China Import and Export
Bank signed a contract with the Shanghai Machinery Import and
Export (Group) Corp., Ltd. today to provide the company 1.5 billion
yuan (about 180 million US dollars) of loan in buyer's credit.
</P>
<P>
The three-year loan is intended to encourage the Shanghai
company to participate in economic cooperation projects abroad
and export its machinery and electronics products, such as power
station and environmental protection equipment,
telecommunications products, automobiles, ships, and electric
appliances.
</P>
<P>
The export of machinery and electronics products from China
reached 59.32 billion dollars in 1997, with that from Shanghai
estimated at 4.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city's export volume of the products is expected to rise by
16 percent this year, even though local foreign trade companies
have been affected adversely by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Lihong, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Commission, said that the loan will
help optimize the industrial structure of Shanghai, and help major
local machinery and electronics enterprises play a major role in
local foreign trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Machinery Import and Export company was the 46th
largest foreign trade business in China last year, with a total
export and import volume of 463 million dollars. The bank has
loaned 606 million yuan to the company over the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Continued Cooperation Depends on NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia warned on Friday that
continued NATO-Russia cooperation depends on how the Western
military alliance acts.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Kislyak, Russian ambassador who replaced Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev in Friday's NATO-Russia Permanent Joint
Council, told the press that continued cooperation, though
important, hinges on the alliance's behavior.
</P>
<P>
Russia blamed the United States and Britain, which are NATO
members, for their joint air raids against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As a protest to the unnotified raids, Sergeyev stayed away from
the year-end ministerial council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Though NATO Secretary General Javier Solana made it clear on
Thursday that the raids were not the responsibility of the
alliance, Russia still argued that the United States and Britain
are main members of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Russia fears that the United States will make a precedent for
NATO to carry out operations outside its traditional geographical
area without mandates from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters that Iraq is the kind of matter for a global institution
such as the United Nations, not a regional institution like NATO,
to handle.
</P>
<P>
The official quoted the Russian defense chief as saying he is
"committed to developing the NATO-Russia cooperation" that started
after the former Cold War foes signed a founding act last May in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
It was feared here, however, that the NATO-Russia military
cooperation might have already been undermined by repeated
alliance or member state operations outside the NATO defense area
without the mandate from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, NATO ordered an air strike against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia without the mandate of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which has called back its ambassador from the United
States, also suspected that the establishment of a permanent NATO
liaison office in Moscow might have to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NATO official would not speculate on the liaison
issue. "Wait and see," he said, adding that NATO-Russia
cooperation is in the basic common interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia have been, through the consultation platform of
the permanent joint council, exchanging information in an effort
to build mutual confidence, especially in defense-related areas.

KIEV, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament Friday
strongly protested against strikes on Iraq launched by the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine pointed out in a statement that
the strikes made it clear that the U.S. government is still
implementing a policy of intimidation and military pressure
towards Iraq, violating international norms.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet called on all parliaments of the United
Nations member states to condemn the strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council (UNSC) must take actions to stop the
conflicts in the region and settle existing problems through
peaceful means, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also criticized Iraq for not implementing the
UNSC's relevant resolution.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Alexandr Tkachenko, who was in
Russia on a visit, also condemned the missile strike against Iraq
and urged the U.S. authority to stop the military action, the

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Not Affected by Bombing Raids in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht and stock market
did not show much turbulence despite the U.S. attacks on Iraq in
the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The attacks did not have any significant impact on Thailand's
economy, economists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said the economic
foundation built up by the Chuan Leekpai government in the past
year would withstand any crisis.
</P>
<P>
Commodity prices and production costs would not be affected as
sharp oil price increases were unlikely, according to the Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Chatumongol Sonakul said the baht would
remain stable despite U.S. air strikes against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Although the Thai currency tumbled, nearly breaching the
37-baht resistance once the market opened on Thursday, it
gradually recovered and stood firm at 36.60-36.70 baht to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said the U.S. attack on Iraq was not the only
factor depressing the baht and the stock market in the early
morning session.
</P>
<P>
They cited the recent disappointing asset auctions as another
factor in the baht fall and the stock market decline.
</P>
<P>
They said there was no need at the moment for the central bank
to use any special measures to cope with the Gulf situation.

<HEADLINE> Britain Rejects Responsibility for Stray Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A British Defense Ministry
spokesman on Friday rejected responsibility for a stray missile
attack on Iranian southwestern city of Khorramshahr on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman told the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) in London that Iran should "really speak to the Americans"
about the errant cruise missile strike that damaged houses in
Khorramshahr in Khuzestan province.
</P>
<P>
It is "not for us to comment" on what was reportedly a
U.S. missile, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the joint U.S. and British strike against Iraq
Thursday morning, a stray missile hit downtown Khorramshahr, a
port city close to the Iraqi border, causing no injury but some
damages.
</P>
<P>
Iran has lodged a strong protest to both London and Washington
on Thursday by summoning British charge d'affaires in Tehran
Nic Browne and the Swiss ambassador who represents the
U.S. interest in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran considered the stray missile attack as a "violation of
Iranian territorial integrity" and warned the U.S. and Britain
not to repeat such a mistake.

<P>
HANOI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Lao government views the
U.S. air strikes against Iraq is not a good solution and does not
conform with the current general tendency of international
relations, said Lao Deputy Foreign Minister Phongsavath Boupha.
</P>
<P>
The Lao deputy foreign minister said this during his meeting

<P>
"All international disputes, either small or big, should be

Phongsavath Boupha said that the U.S. government's decision on

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Calls for Better Sino-Portuguese Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Wang Qiren, director of Xinhua
News Agency Macao Branch, said here Friday that China and Portugal
should strengthen cooperation and quicken the resolution of issues
concerning the transfer of power in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The general conditions are good and the situation is
developing along the way of steady transition," Wang told
reporters from China's inland areas, Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, China and Portugal have been cooperating well on
the Macao issue, and marked headway has been achieved with regard
to a series of questions, the director said.
</P>
<P>
"In the final year before the handover, three major aspects of
work have to be done," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
First, China and Portugal should strengthen cooperation
with constructive stance to resolve the questions which have to be
handled well, such as the localization of civil servants and laws,
the official status of Chinese, the transfer of archives and
assets, pension fund for retired civil servants, and preparations
for the handover ceremony and stationing of troops in the future Macao
SAR.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Portuguese Macao government should take full
responsibility for Macao's economic expansion and public security
in the transitional period. The Chinese side will give consistent
and active cooperation to ensure local economic growth and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR will
organize a 200-member election committee which only consists of
Macao residents and takes charge of electing the first chief
executive of the future Macao SAR. The Preparatory Committee will
also work out a regulation on establishing the first legislative
council and judicial organ of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the localization of civil servants, Wang Qiren said
that this work has scored remarkable progress in recent years,
particularly this year thanks to the concerted efforts of the
Chinese and Portuguese sides.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that local residents, especially local Chinese,
still make up a fairly low percentage of directors and
vice-directors of government departments, the highest rank of
civil service.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that smooth transition and handover can be
achieved in Macao, but we must also see that the progress in which
 China and Portugal conduct consultations to resolve questions
during the transitional period lags behind the requirement of the
transfer of political power in Macao," Wang Qiren said.

<P>
BAGHDAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Premises of Iraq's Natural
History Museum and the Pharmacy College were damaged in U.S.-
British air strikes Thursday night, the Iraqi News Agency INA
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted sources of the Baghdad University, in which
the Pharmacy College is located, as saying that activities of the
college and the museum will be disrupted for several days because
of the damage.
</P>
<P>
But no casualties were reported in the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, one person was injured in southern
Iraq's Muthana province Thursday night when the raids entered its
second straight night, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
At around 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, seconds after
sirens sounded, big explosions could be heard and the sky over
Baghdad was lit up by streaking U.S. missiles and tracer shells
fired by Iraqi anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
The strike Thursday night appeared to be much more intense and
powerful than the previous night.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched the air strikes, codenamed
Operation Desert Fox, against Iraq with a declared aim of
destroying Iraq's military capability and to avenge it for what
they called Iraq's non-cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors,
who were authorized by the U.N. Security Council to monitor the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows High Scores for HK New Airport Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The majority of people
responding to an opinion survey commissioned by the Airport
Consultative Committee of Hong Kong have given high scores for the
level of services provided at the new Hong Kong International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by the Social Sciences Research Center
of the University of Hong Kong, found that those who had
first-hand experience with the airport generally gave higher
ratings than those who had not been to the airport themselves.
</P>
<P>
A total of 97 air cargo agencies and airlines responded to a
mail survey of their views on the performance of the air cargo
terminals.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Airport Consultative Committee Hu Fa-kuang said
Friday the results showed that the majority of respondents were
satisfied with the operations of the airport.
</P>
<P>
"We are greatly encouraged and hope that the operators will
make further efforts to maintain and improve services at the
airport," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Of the respondents, 67 percent thought that the facilities of
the airport had reached international standards.
</P>
<P>
In terms of rating, the overall design of the airport ranked
highest, with a mean score of 75.9, the facilities ranked second
with a mean score of 73.6, and the convenience of travel followed
closely with a mean score of 72.9.
</P>
<P>
The management of the airport was given an average score of
63.4, but only 29 percent of respondents considered that the
management had reached international standards.
</P>
<P>
Some 54 percent of the respondents said that they were proud of
the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the results could serve as reference by the Airport
Authority and the air cargo terminals when considering measures to
improve their services.
</P>
<P>
In another development, an official with the Airport Authority
said the survey result was an example of the high standards now
being achieved at the new airport.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Authority said it welcomes the comprehensive survey
and will study it carefully in order to improve services to users
still further.

<HEADLINE> HK Banking Sector Consultancy Study Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) Friday released the findings and recommendations
of a consultancy study on the strategic outlook of the Hong Kong
banking sector over the next years.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the study is to assist the HKMA in formulating
an appropriate strategy to develop the regulatory and supervisory
framework in response to market developments over the next five
years, said David Carse, deputy chief executive of the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
The study was carried out by two consultancy agencies in March
1998. Its assessment of the local banking sector highlights a
number of positive features which have contributed to the
development of Hong Kong as one of the world's major banking
centers.
</P>
<P>
These include a well developed financial infrastructure, a
conducive regulatory environment and sound supervisory process,
free and open markets, a modern and effective legal system and a
high degree of transparency.
</P>
<P>
Within this setting the Hong Kong banking sector has been able
to maintain high safety and soundness standards and impressive
financial performance which compares favorably to international
standards, particularly in terms of efficiency and asset quality.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the consultants have produced a package of
recommendations aimed at enhancing the level of competitiveness of
the Hong Kong banking market as well as strengthening the safety
and soundness of the banking sector as a whole so that the
benefits of increased competition and greater efficiency can be
fully realized.
</P>
<P>
Phase one of the package of proposals is to enhance the HKMA's
supervisory approach, to better position the HKMA to address the
risks and increased competition within the market place, prior to
substantive changes to the regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
The consultants have recommended that the HKMA initiate the
process towards a more competitive sector by relaxing the one
branch policy to allow foreign banks to operate up to a maximum of
three branches.
</P>
<P>
During phase two, the emphasis would shift from the supervisory
approach towards implementing a revised market structure.
</P>
<P>
The consultants recommend that the HKMA raise the minimum level
of capital required for local institutions and begin a study to
enhance depositor protection. Both are intended to enhance the
safety and stability of the sector.
</P>
<P>
Phase three deals with the recommendations concerning the
remaining barriers to a free and open market. These should be
implemented once the improved supervisory approach is in place and
the market structure is revised.
</P>
<P>
Carse noted that changes to enhance competition and efficiency
in the banking system must be balanced by the need to maintain a
stable environment.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, measures aimed at liberalizing the market and
promoting competition should be considered in parallel with
measures to enhance the safety and soundness of the system.
</P>
<P>
Full consultation on the proposals of the consultants will take
place with all relevant parties before any of the proposed changes
are implemented, Carse said.

Statistics, the agency said firms with foreign equity in the
country increased by 23.3 percent last year, adding 126,000 people
to their work force.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's data also showed that manufacturing workers
accounted for 56 percent, the biggest share, of the firms' work
force in 1997, despite sliding from 65 percent in 1996.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The attack by U.S. and British forces against Iraq broadened
and intensified on Thursday, as salvos of missiles pounded scores
of targets throughout the country and the skies over the Iraqi
capital filled with the flash of huge explosions, the smoke of
distant conflagrations and the brilliant red tracings of
antiaircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
-- House Republicans decided on Thursday to open debate on the
impeachment of President Bill Clinton on Friday morning even as
U.S. forces continued to attack Iraq and the new Grand Old Party
(GOP) leader, Speaker-designate Bob Livingston acknowledged his
own past sexual "indiscretions."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- House Republicans raise the ghosts of Watergate and Vietnam
to justify their decision to move ahead with the impeachment
debate on Friday in the face of Democratic protests and continuing
American military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
-- Acting on early word from the chief weapons inspector in
Iraq, President Bill Clinton set in motion Wednesday's military
strikes before the inspector formally declared to the Security
Council that Saddam Hussein was once again in defiance of the the
United Nations inspection program, U.S. officials disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Oil prices dropped and stocks rose as investors concluded
the attack on Iraq won't disturb the world economy.
January-delivery crude slid $1.35 to $11.03, showing how bearish
oil markets have become amid a global glut. Meanwhile, the Dow
Jones industrials rose 85.22 to 8875.82.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attack Against Iraq Is a Dangerous Move, says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The attack against Iraq by the
U.S. has set a dangerous precedent for the use of force to violate
the sovereignty of an independent country which is a member of the
United Nations, said The Vietnamese Communist Party's daily Nhan
Dan (the people daily) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nhan Dan said in a commentary that the attack by the U.S. and
Britain on Iraq on December 16 was a dangerous move, violating
Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity and running counter
to the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the attack has aggravated tensions in the
Gulf area.
</P>
<P>
The attack also shows that when necessary, the U.S. is prepared
to ignore the role of the U.N. security council as well as the
efforts made by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to find a
peaceful solution to the conflict, Nhan Dan adds.
</P>
<P>
"For whatever reason, a military attack launched with modern
war means by the U.S. against Iraq is unacceptable," the
commentary of Nhan Dan stresses, saying that the move has trampled
upon international laws and the sacred rights of nations and
caused grave consequences.

cultural agreements with 140 countries and signed over 400
programs for carrying out the agreements.
</P>
<P>
Cultural contacts have been maintained with over 160 countries
and several thousands of international cultural organizations.
</P>
<P>
Li Gang, director of the ministry's External Cultural Relations
Bureau, pointed out the past 20 years have witnessed an
unprecedented expansion in cultural exchanges, both in terms of
width and depth.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to present Chinese opera, acrobatics, folk
music and antiques to the outside world have demonstrated the
nation's brilliant culture and ancient tradition to the world.
</P>
<P>
China has also introduced the cream of foreign culture, filling
its stages with colorful ballet, folk dances, music in recent
years. Famous world artists such as Von Karajan, Zubin Mehta,
Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras are no longer strange names to

<HEADLINE> Personnel Exchange Center to Promote Medical Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A national personnel exchange
center is expected to help remove imbalanced medical care services
in different parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The Health Professional Exchange Center under the Ministry of
Health, which opened today, will develop information databases and
a nationwide network to provide timely services to job hunters and
units facing personnel shortages.
</P>
<P>
The center also plans to serve as an information
source for Chinese medical personnel who are currently studying or
working abroad and are planning to return to China, according to
Director Wang Huanzeng.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that regional differences in terms of medical
care services can at least partially be attributed to the
irrational distribution of medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
Only seven percent of China's 5.5 million medical professionals
are involved in health promotion activities and disease prevention
which are both becoming increasingly important to the health
sector.
</P>
<P>
Because of lacking medical workers, rural residents have much
less access to medical services than urbanites in major cities
such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"The government has added medical reform to the agenda in order
to ensure health care for all Chinese citizens, with improving the
distribution of medical personnel considered to be an important
aspect of related efforts," according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The center plans to provide services to graduates from 670
medical colleges and secondary schools. Related institutions
graduated 180,000 students during 1997 and have emerged as major
sources of human resources for China's massive health care
market.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Koji Ito, the fastest man in
Asia, became the sole triple champion in the athletics when he
stormed to victory in the men's 200 meters here on Friday at the
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese was full of spirits, yet, his woman counterpart Li
Xuemei of China failed to attain the feat after being overtaken in
the last meters by K. Damayanthi Darsha of Sri Lanka in the 200
meters.
</P>
<P>
Both Koji and Li won their respective 100m sprints and anchored
the 4x100 relay victories early this week, with a new Asian record
to Koji's credit when he clocked a fabulous time of 10.00 in the
semifinals of the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
Koji, Asian record holder of 20.16 seconds in the 200m, clocked
20.25 to take the gold on Friday, chased by China's 20.70 and Sri
Lanka's R. Tillekeratne in 20.93.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to win the gold medals," the
28-year-old Koji said. "I have not thought of breaking another
record."
</P>
<P>
"Any record can be broken by somebody, but the gold medal can
never be broken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li, Asian woman record holder of 22.01 in the 200m, surrendered
the gold to Darsha in the closing meters with a clocking of 22.53
seconds against Darsha's 22.48, a repeat of the semifinals on
Thursday when Darsha, winner of the women's 400 meters, finished
first.
</P>
<P>
"I've recovered from the fever and stomach complaints sustained
early this week, but I still felt very weak in my legs," said Li.
</P>
<P>
The victory for Darsha is of singnificance as it was her first
time to compete in the event since 1995, and was only realized
after the sudden withdrawal of compatriot S. Jayasinghe.
</P>
<P>
To her understanding, Darsha has awarded Sri Lanka its
first-ever athletics gold, saying "I thought nobody has won a gold
medal in the 200m event at Asian Games, and perhaps in the future
I will compete more in the 200m."
</P>
<P>
In the men's 50km walking early in the morning, Wang Yinhang
beat Kazakhstan's Sergey Korepanov to take the title, enabling
China to overtake Japan 12-11 in the athletics gold tally for the
first time at the Bangkok meet.
</P>
<P>
Wang clocked three hours 59 minutes 26 seconds, just one second
ahead of second-placed Korepanov, who was overtaken by the Chinese
with 300 meters to go.
</P>
<P>
Sanutkkao Sakchai of Thailand, who led the first 20 kilometers
with an unbelievable pace, retired at the 34km mark.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai walked so fast in the first half of the race. I knew
he would fade out later, but I kept following him in an unwise way
which brought me two warnings," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, I never lost confidence in my strength and stamina.
Without these two warnings, I would have won the title more
easily," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the later five finals from the track and field, China and
Japan reapt one apiece with Ren Ruiping winning the second for
China from the women's triple jump and Koji Ito for Japan in the
men's 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Ren registered 14.27 meters in her sixth attempt for the win
after her teammate Wu Lingmei landed to a distance of 14.25 in her
last effort.
</P>
<P>
The decathlon title went to Uzbekistan's Oleg Veretelnikov with
a total of 8,278 points. Compatriot Ramil Ganiev finished second
at 7,857 points.
</P>
<P>
South Korean veteran Lee Jin-Taek won the men's high jump title
by clearing 2.27 meters, repeating his glory moments from 1991 to
1995 when he won three Asian championships in a row.
</P>
<P>
The other gold medal of the day was taken by Supriati Sutono,
who clocked 15 minutes 54.47 seconds in the women's 5,000 meters,
awarding Indonesia its first gold medal from the athletics.

<HEADLINE> WHO Official Disavows Century Baby Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Dr. W.K. Gee, an official from
the World Health Organization (WHO), has denied a rumor that the
organization will award prizes for "century babies".
</P>
<P>
Gee, the organization's chief representative in China, said the
rumor has not only misled young couples, but also directly
contradicts WHO principles.
</P>
<P>
A number of young Beijing couples have believed the rumor and
sought to the best time for impregnation.
</P>
<P>
Gee explained that the goal of WHO's cooperation with
government departments aimed to provide health services for all
Chinese citizens. He said all children should have access to equal
opportunities for health care, with absolutely no distinction
for those born on a particular date.
</P>
<P>
"Every mother has the right to decide when to have a
baby. However, the possibility of having a so-called 'century
baby' is slim and couples should avoid seeking artificial means to
induce pregnancy," according to a doctor in Gynecology and
Obstetrics Department at Beijing Hospital.
</P>
<P>
He said that many couples are planning their child's birth in
the year 2000, the Year of Dragon according to the Chinese Lunar
Calendar.
</P>
<P>
China is regarded as the land of the lofty dragon which
symbolizes the spirit of the Chinese nation. Chinese people refer
a child born in the Year of Dragon as "longzi", or child of the
dragon.
</P>
<P>
China's population department downplays the possibility of
possible baby boom due to the desire for "longzi".
</P>
<P>
"Annual births have remained at around 21 million since
implementation of the family planning policy," according to Zhang
Shikun, an official with the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China's population is expected to remain below 1.3
billion in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> UAE Press Urges End to Air Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Press of the United Arab
Emirates called upon Friday the U.N. Security Council and the
international community to intervene to end the U.S.-British air
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The official Al Itihad newspaper said in its editorial Friday
that the permanent members of the Security Council should exert
pressure on Washington and London to halt the operation Desert Fox
and to start dialog with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The air raids entered its second straight night Thursday with a
declared aim of destroying Iraq's military capabilities and avenge
Baghdad for what the U.S. called Iraq's non-cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which monitors Iraq's
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, the Al Khalij described the air strike as a
shame to the leadership of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the U.S.-British aggression was in fact an
aggression against international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper warned Washington and London that rancor was
being sowed in the hearts of millions of Arabs and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
It called upon the Arab states not to restrict their reactions
to mere expression of regret, but adopt a clear and candid
attitude condemning the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Al Bayan newspaper Friday appealed to Iraq to
deal with the situation with the utmost possible degree of wisdom
and senses.

<P>
ANKARA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Following the U.S. air strikes
against Iraq, 11 officials of Turkish Embassy in Iraq returned to
Turkey via Jordan Friday.
</P>
<P>
Councillor Melih Ulueren, who just arrived at the Istanbul
Ataturk Airport from Baghdad, said that "the work of the Turkish
Embassy in Baghdad is still continuing," the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem has said that Turkish
Ambassador to Baghdad Selim Karasmanoglu and several embassy
officials will stay behind "upon their own will."
</P>
<P>
Ulueren said most of the embassy officials were withdrawn for
security reasons because the capital was under air strikes over
past two successive nights and will face more raids Friday night.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the air raids came in
retaliation for Iraq's non-cooperation with weapons inspectors,
who were authorized by the U.N. to monitor Iraq's disarming of
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Trying to Capture Angolan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The rebel UNITA was trying to
capture the capital city, Luanda, in its later December offensive
against the government forces, Jornal de Angola, a government-run
Portuguese daily said in a commentary Friday.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), after long secret preparations, had planned to launched
its large-scale offensive code-named "dark action", the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the action was to take Huambo and Kuito
cities in central Angola, capture coastal Benguela Province, and
then lead its forces to Luanda, dreaming to take power by force,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
UNITA's Chairman Jonas Savimbi, who was planning to announce
victory on December 25, the founding day of his party, had to
start his action on December 1, after the government became aware
of UNITA's conspiracy and made response to it.
</P>
<P>
The government and UNITA troops are engaging in fierce
fightings in central part of the country, where UNITA men have
taken control of a big part of Huambo and Bie provinces, while
the government forces have withdrawn to Huambo and Kuito, capital
cities of the two provinces after suffering heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
The daily paper quoted U.N. military observers as saying that
UNITA, which is newly equipped with long-range artillery and tens
of tanks purchased from Ukraine, has about 20,000 military men in
central Angola.
</P>
<P>
The surface-to-air missiles UNITA recently purchased, have
ended the advantage the government used to have in the air.
</P>
<P>
"Cow-Boy", spokesman of the Headquarters of General Staff of
the government forces, said that the current conflicts have
proven that the Lusaka Peace Protocol has failed to help
materialize peace in the country, as UNITA failed to meet the
peace deal which demands the tatal disarmament of the rebel
forces.
</P>
<P>
Though the situation in central Angola is still "dangerous",
the government is still capable of controlling the situation and
perform its obligation of safeguarding its people and the
democratic system in the country,the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
"continues to oppose Israeli settlement activity in the Occupied
Territories as illegal and an obstacle to peace," according to an
EU Settlement Watch Report on Middle East available here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU said the activity contravenes Article 49 of the Fourth
Geneva Convention, which states that "the Occupying Power shall
not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into
the territory it occupies."
</P>
<P>
The report said the EU Council of Ministers has reaffirmed the
importance of avoiding counter-productive unilateral actions in
order to restore confidence in the Middle East peace process and
establish a firm basis for further progress in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Settlement Watch Report is produced by the EU Consuls
General in Jerusalem, the heads of the Representative Offices in
the Palestinian Territories, and the EU heads of Mission in Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The EU missions "have aimed for the highest degree of accuracy
possible, although statistics on settlement expansion are often
subject to controversy," the watch report said.

<HEADLINE> Reforms Turning China's State Farms Into Money-Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- In the early years of the
People's Republic, the Chinese government sent millions of young
people, high school grads, ex-servicemen, and others to set up
state farms in border areas.
</P>
<P>
Most assisted border troops, and were in fact semi-military
rather than separate farming outfits, and they were part of a
succession of money-losing years from 1967 to 1978, amassing 3.7
billion yuan in losses overall.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, when China began its reforms and opening-up,
governments at different levels and state farms themselves began
series of reform measures, setting up family farms with former
state farm staff members, adopting new management methods like
leasing and issuing stocks, and using the now well-known contract
responsibility system.
</P>
<P>
The reform efforts have paid off. From 1979 to 1997, state
farms in China were showing a profit generally and produced nearly 20
billion yuan worth of goods. Per-capita income of farm employees
went from 483 yuan to 4,496 yuan during the period.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, China now has 2,157
state-owned farms, which have 3,447 industrial and commercial
enterprises and 654 research organizations. They have formed over
180 enterprise groups, over 730 cooperative companies, and 557
joint stock companies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, 1,872 enterprises run by state farms have gone
bankrupt or have been merged or auctioned off. Meanwhile, state
farms have allowed former staff members to open private businesses
and they have set up 1,843 private companies, employing 51,800
people and generating 568 million yuan worth of products a year.
</P>
<P>
They also bring in annual foreign exchange earnings worth more
than 8 billion U.S. dollars. For the past two decades, state farms
have set up over 1,500 joint ventures, with overseas capital worth
more than 3 billion U.S. dollars, and have set up 57 firms abroad.
</P>
<P>
Chinese state farms have 4.56 million ha. of cultivated land,
accounting for only 4.6 percent of the country's total. However, they
turn out 10 percent of the country's grain, cotton, wool and
sugar, 80 percent of its raw rubber and 33 percent of its dairy
products. And 33 percent of the country's soybean exports are also
produced by state farms.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Commemorates 20 Years of Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Economic power-house
Guangdong Province has conducted a series of activities recently
to mark the country's 20 years of reform and open-up, of which
itself is a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
On December 18, 1979, the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China held its third plenum and decided to
launch the reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
To promote the reform and opening-up drive, the central
government decided to give Guangdong, which borders on Hong Kong
and Macao, special flexible policies to conduct economic and
trade activities on the international market.
</P>
<P>
With these policies, the province set up three special economic
zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou and tried out a series of
market-oriented practices.
</P>
<P>
The 20 years of efforts have helped turn Guangdong from a
fairly backward province into one of the richest regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The province's gross domestic products (GDP) grew from 18.5
billion yuan (2.23 billion US dollars at the present exchange
rate) to 731.5 billion yuan in 1997, growing at an annual rate of
14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Now the province ranks first in the country in many economic
indicators including GDP, local revenue, utilization of overseas
investment, exports, fixed asset investment, the added value of
the service sector, and retail turnover.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the achievements of the past, the people from all
walks of life are vowing to redouble their efforts and aim even
higher in the future.

<HEADLINE> "Desert Fox" Will Not Achieve Its Purpose, Chinese Experts Declare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The continuing joint
U.S.-British attack on Iraq, code-named "Desert Fox", is against
the principles of international law and will not achieve its
purpose, a group of senior Chinese military experts commented
today.
</P>
<P>
"The surprise attack is against the principles of international
law, the will of the United Nations and many other countries,"
said Zhang Yuliang, a professor with China's National Defense
University.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. has long premeditated such raids on Iraq
in order to demonstrate the power of its military forces and
expand its plans for world hegemony.
</P>
<P>
However, he went on, unlike the Gulf War in 1991, this time
world opinion is very much against the U.S. and British
governments, and their support is scant indeed. Even those
countries which in the past stood shoulder to shoulder with them
now oppose this particular strike.
</P>
<P>
Chinese military analysts noted that in the 1991 Gulf War, the
combined allied forces fielded more than 700,000 soldiers, and had
plunged 1,740 operational fighter planes, 3,700 tanks, 5,600
armoured cars, 247 war ships and nine aircraft carriers into the
war. But this time they have deployed only 24,000 soldiers, 200
fighter planes, 22 war ships and two aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.'s Secretary of Defense, William Cohen has declared
that there will be no time limits and the attacks will last as
long as necessary.
</P>
<P>
But according to the assessments of Chinese military experts,
the assaults will be short-lived, based on the strength of the
armed forces being used.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that in the current situation, the U.S. and British
governments will have to take world opinion into consideration.
</P>
<P>
The raids can only take the form of surprise air attacks, since
other NATO countries did not participate, Zhang said. In the 1991
Gulf War 39 countries provided troops for the multinational forces.
</P>
<P>
And the use of hi-tech weaponry cannot solve all the problems
of hitting the right targets, commented Zhang, adding that before
dawn on Thursday a missile accidentally fell on a southwestern
city of Iran, and another missile struck a central business street
of Baghdad by mistake.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bojiang, a research fellow with the Strategy Institute of
the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, said that the military
strike by the U.S. and Britain has thoroughly exposed their
attempt to embark on world hegemony and further what they see as
their status as the world's leaders.
</P>
<P>
After keeping a close watch on the situation, Chen said that
another apparent purpose for the attack is to overthrow the
current Iraqi government, but that it was unlikely to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He also linked the timing of the attack with U.S. President
Bill Clinton's imminent danger of being impeached by the
U.S. Congress, adding that Clinton may just be trying to divert
public attention from his personal woes.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Trade Balance Back into the Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's trade
balance bounced back into the black in November with a surplus of
548 million Rand (91.3 million U.S. Dollars) from a deficit of
512 million Rand (85.3 million Dollars) in October.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus came as a relief to economists who are
worried that South Africa's balance of payments problems will
prevent the central bank from moving to ease monetary policy
early next year, South African state television, SABC, reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Customs and excise figures showed exports and imports were
both lower last month, with the decline in imports outpacing the
fall in exports.
</P>
<P>
Exports were 12.8 billion Rand (2.13 billion Dollars) in
November from 13 billion Rand (2.16 billion Dollars) in October,
while imports fell to 12.2 billion (2.03 billion Dollars) from
13.6 billion Rand (2.27 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the year the trade balance remained in a small deficit of
75 million Rand (12.5 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decline in exports between October and November was
broadly based, with chemicals, precious metals and stones being
best export performers.
</P>
<P>
Imports of machinery recorded the biggest fall in Rand terms
followed by motor vehicle parts. Total monthly imports were at
their lowest level since June.
</P>
<P>
However, economists warned that South Africa was not out of
the woods yet, as international demand for the country's exports
was likely to remain slack. An improvement in trade performance
would hinge on a fall in imports rather than a rise in exports.

<HEADLINE> SDB Signs Foreign Exchange Loan Agreement with Domestic Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The China State Development
Bank (SDB), one of China's policy-oriented banks, today signed a
200 million U.S. dollar foreign exchange loan agreement with a
domestic banking syndicate.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the SDB said that in accordance with the
agreement, the borrower is the SDB and the creditors are the Bank
of China and six other domestic commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the interest rate for the three-year loan is LIBOR
plus 80bp, and the principal will be repaid in full at maturity.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the SDB to raise foreign exchange
capital for key construction projects through domestic financial
institutions, and it is also the first time for domestic banks to
carry out major cooperation in foreign exchange loan business.
</P>
<P>
President of the SDB Chen Yuan said that the international
financial market is experiencing serious fluctuation as a
consequence of the Asian financial crisis, and the costs for
Chinese financial institutions to raise capital from the
international financial market have risen considerably. As a
result, it is very important for domestic banks to cooperate more
closely.
</P>
<P>
"The success of this domestically syndicated foreign exchange
loan will be beneficial for reinforcing cooperation among
domestic banks, beneficial for overcoming unfavorable factors in
international market and lowering fund-raising costs, so as to
meet the foreign exchange demand of the state's key construction
projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SDB will use the syndicated loan to support a
number of key construction projects including the Daya Bay Nuclear
Power Plant, the third-stage of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant
and the Ertan Hydropower Station.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
offered a total of 25 million U.S. Dollars as a reward for any
information leading to capture of five suspects involved in the
fatal U.S. Embassy bombing in Dar es Salaam this August.
</P>
<P>
Dudley Sims, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said in a
telephone interview Friday that the reward has been raised from
two million Dollars for each suspect to five million Dollars each
in a way to boost four-month-old inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tanzania's Director of Criminal Investigations has
revealed the identities of the five wanted men allegedly involved
in the August 7 bombing attack which claimed 11 lives and wounded
more than 80 others.
</P>
<P>
Showing their pictures, Adadi Rajabu told local press Thursday
that the suspects are Khalfan Khamis Mohammed and Ahmed Khalfan
Ghailani of Tanzania, Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan, Fahad Mohamed
Ally Msalam of both Kenya and Yemen, and Mustafa Fadhil Alias
Hussein of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"They are all in their early 20s," he said. "They are
currently at large, armed and extremely dangerous."
</P>
<P>
So far, Tanzanian police, in collaboration with agents of the
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), have identified that
the vehicle which carried the bomb was a 1987 Nissan Atlas
refrigeration truck.
</P>
<P>
They have also detained and put two suspects, Mustafa Mahmoud
Saidi Ahmed, 42, of Egypt and Rashid Saleh Hemed, 28, of
Tanzania, on trial in a local court charged with 11 counts of
murder.

<P>
Police believe all the five suspects are members of a
terrorist group, al Qaeda, which is operated by Saudi Arabian
tycoon, Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, was also
attacked by a powerful bomb on the same day, leaving 253 people

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Claims for Independence Refuted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Historically, the Cairo
Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation both completely refute
the allegation by Taiwan authorities that they are a separate and
independent state.
</P>
<P>
To the contrary they serve to confirm as undeniable proof that
the rest of the world accepts that Taiwan is a part of the
People's Republic of China (PRC), according to Lu Yue, a Chinese
scholar specializing in Taiwan studies.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Taiwan authorities of attempting to use the
documents to suit their own purpose because they have called
themselves the 'Republic of China' (ROC).
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Declaration, signed by China, the United States and
Britain in November 1943, and approved by the former Soviet Union,
prescribed that the Chinese territory seized or occupied by Japan,
which included Manchuria, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, should be
returned to the "Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
The Potsdam Proclamation also confirmed that particular status
quo, Lu said in a recent article, pointing out that the two
documents both denied the independence claims made by the
Manchurian and Nanking 'puppet' regimes during the War of Resistance
Against Japan (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
The Manchurian and Nanking puppet regimes had never been
recognized by any of the countries fighting fascism, Lu said, and
the two regimes were finally dismantled in 1945 when China
defeated Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
Lu also detailed the four necessary components that constitute
a state recognized by international law: residents, territory, a
government and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The 'Republic of China' in the Cairo Declaration refers to the
Chungking Nationalist government as the sole legitimate government
representing China at that time, the article noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China edged Japan 6-5 in a
Group D match in the Asian Games waterpolo competition here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
China, runners-up in the Horishima Asiad, was ushered out of
the gold contention when they lost 3-12 to defending champions
Kazakhstan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If we beat Singapore tomorrow, the bronze will be ours," said
China's head coach Peng Zhaorong.
</P>
<P>
Peng said referees ruined their chance to win a gold, referring
to their 7-10 loss to Uzbekistan on last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China accused referees of that match of favorism and lodged
complaints, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
"The referee's decision is final, and we can do nothing about
it," Peng said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Independence Claim Refuted (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his article Lu explained that changes of political power
have repeatedly taken place in China's long history, but its legal
representative rights in the international community has never
been suspended.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan seized Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from the
Qing Dynasty government, the Cairo Declaration ordered Japan to
return the two areas to the "Republic of China" government that
replaced the Qing authorities. This complied with the decision set
out in international law, the article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China's representative right changed in 1949, when the Chinese
people overthrew the Kuomintang regime and formed the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
According to the sovereignty inheritance principle prescribed
in international law, Lu emphasized, the PRC therefore inherited
the qualifications of the "Republic of China" as the ruling
establishment of China including all Chinese territories such as
Taiwan and the Penghu Islands.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 countries now recognize there is only one China
in the world and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the
People's Republic of China. Indeed, in 1971 the United Nations
abolished Taiwan's illegal position as representative of China,
which had been wrongly seized by the Taiwan authorities, and
resumed the PRC's legitimate seat.
</P>
<P>
The signatories of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam
Proclamation did not deny the right of the Chungking Nationalist
government to exercise sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu
Islands that they had never ruled, nor did they deny the fact
that Northeast China was an integral part of Chinese territory
simply because of the 14 year rule by the Manchurian 'puppet'
regime.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, Lu stressed, the Cairo Declaration and the
Potsdam Proclamation can by no means be seen to endorse "splitting
the country and ruling under separate regimes" as is alleged by the
Taiwanese authorities' mistaken interpretation.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they demonstrate without any shadow of doubt that
there is only one China in the world, that Taiwan is a part of the
PRC, that China's sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be
separated, and that the government of the People's Republic of
China is the sole legitimate government representing all of China,
Lu concluded in his article.

<HEADLINE> Japan Beats China for Women's Basketball Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan outbeat China in the
second half to score a 93-69 victory for the women's basketball
gold medal at the Asian Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nagata Mutsuko hit the game-high 23 points while teammates
Shimada Chisako added 20 and Oyama Taeko 18 for Japan, for whom
the Bangkok gold is just their second title as the women's
basketball was introduced to the Asian Games in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Japan led the first half by 40-36, outrun their taller Chinese
rivals with fast breaks in the second half for the 24-point
sounding victory.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese players are taller, so the key factor for us is
how long we can run," said Japanese head coach Nakagawa Fumikazu.
</P>
<P>
"We have faster legs since our players are not as tall as the
Chinese players. We have to run," added Nakagawa.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese cagers outshot their Chinese rivals with quick
offences by 46%-36% in the field goals.
</P>
<P>
Japan jumped to a 11-5 lead five minutes into the final before
China overtook the advantage with its strong under-basket goals
from centers Ma Zongqing and Lui Yuexiu for 24-16 with eight
minutes to go before the interval.
</P>
<P>
Shimada Chisako's 3-pointer at 13:24 turned the tide for Japan
at 26-25 and the Japanese women never looked back en route to
their 40-36 half time lead.
</P>
<P>
China had its chance to back into the game when Jiang Xin's
layup in 4:41 put China ahead again in the second half. But Japan
burst away with 14-0 run with less than four minutes to go on the
clock.
</P>
<P>
No time left for the unexperinced Chinese players who missed a
string of 3-pointer attempts and dropped more than 20 points
behind in the rest time of the final.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, South Korea beat Chinese Taipei 92-76 to win
the bronze medal of the seven-team women's basketball competition.
</P>
<P>
The South Korea, two-time consecutive champion in the last two
Asian Games, turned out too strong for the Chinese Taipei as they
used better team-works and sharper to lead the first half 52-33 at
the interval.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Taipei women hit eight 3-pointers in the second
half but still could not hold the South Koreans from surging to a
20-point lead. Chien Wei-Chuan hit her fifth 3-pointer on the
buzzer to narrow the gap at 16 points.
</P>
<P>
Jung Sun-min lead South Korea with 34 points and 11 rebounds.
Kim Ji-Yoon and Yoo Young-Joo also added 16 and 14 apiece to the
winners.
</P>
<P>
Chien Wei-Chuan led Chinese Taipei with 21, including five
3-pointers in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The final of the men's basketball will be played later
Saturday.

<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine immigration
bureau warned its officers Friday that extremist groups
sympathetic to Iraq might sneak into the Philippines and take
retaliatory actions against American facilities here.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Commissioner Rufus Rodriguez issued the alert order
and directed immigration officials at the Manila international
airport to strictly screen arriving passengers and ensure that
their names are not in the bureau's blacklist of suspected foreign
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken following U.S.-British air strikes against
Iraq which entered the second day Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said passengers whose names are in the blacklist
should be immediately denied entry and booked on the first
available flight to their port of origin.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine immigration bureau has blacklisted nearly 4,500
suspected terrorists since July on the request of the Interpol and
the National Commission on Anti-Hijacking and Terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine police have beefed up security around
the U.S. embassy and other American facilities in Manila against
possible terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> China's Anti-Poverty Drive Becoming "People's War" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Huang Yufeng is a native of
Beijing, but he has often travelled to poverty-stricken Gongshan
county in Yunnan Province in recent years, and not as a tourist.
</P>
<P>
Huang goes there to have a look at the large herds of Mongolian
sheep he helped local poor farmers raise, while working there
as an assistant to the magistrate of Gongshan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The herd has grown from 7,000 to 20,000, according to the
36-year-old Huang, who has "retired" from the post of the
magistrate assistant, but has continued to tend his sheep
"business" as the director of his company's poverty-eradication
office.
</P>
<P>
Average per-capita annual income of Gongshan farmers is a mere
500 yuan and Huang wants to open up more businesses for them by
raising fowl and cattle, or by growing herbs and developing
tourism, he says.
</P>
<P>
And Huang is not alone. Tens of thousands of urban Chinese are
helping poor areas find ways to deal with their poverty, as part
of the government's anti-poverty efforts that have turned into a
"People's War".
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, some 50 million Chinese are
still living in absolute poverty. Last year, the central
government announced that it will get all poor people out of
poverty by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, it has had a program of getting developed
provinces and cities, mostly in the coastal areas, to assist
underdeveloped areas, and in the 1990s, all central government
departments, large state-owned companies and non-Communist parties
have been ordered to give a hand to poor prefectures or counties.
</P>
<P>
Non-government organizations and the private sector have joined
and financial assistance has come from foreign governments or
groups overseas.
</P>
<P>
The program to eliminate poverty by 2000 has found a common
ground in China, with almost all government offices, companies or
institutions setting up a special office to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, many local people insist that the poor should rely on
themselves to find an end to the enduring poverty. "If Gongshan
farmers eat up all the sheep they have raised and don't bring them
to market for sale, it means my scheme has been a failure," says
Huang.
</P>
<P>
And, a member of the State Council Leading Group on
Poverty-Eradication says that China now faces even greater
hardships in its anti-poverty programs, because all the remaining
poor farmers live in areas with the harshest natural
conditions.

<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The China Investment Bank
(CIB) will cease its commercial banking activities after merging
with the China State Development Bank (SDB), President of the SDB
Chen Yuan announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"After restructuring, the CIB will become a vehicle providing
services for policy-oriented finance and will end its commercial
banking," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the approval from the People's Bank of China, the CIB was
merged with the CIB on December 11, with all of its creditor's
rights and liabilities being assumed by the CIB.
</P>
<P>
Chen went on to say that the merger is being carried out in an
orderly way, and the restructuring of the CIB is expected to be
accomplished in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the assets and liabilities of the CIB
constitute only one ninth of that of the SDB and, as a result, the
merger will only have little impact on the SDB's asset quality.

<HEADLINE> India Loses Friends on Nuclear Issue: Sonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Sonia Gandhi, president of
the Congress, the biggest Opposition party in India, said Friday
that India had lost its tried and tested friends and the bridges
of friendship developed over the decades had been needlessly
damaged on the nuclear issue.
</P>
<P>
She said that India had paid a heavy price as the government
had dismantled the national consensus on foreign policy. India's
prestige in the world fora was nowhere in evidence and "our
diplomacy is in shambles."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the one-day All India Congress Committee (AICC)
session here, Sonia said that people were tired of the fractious
BJP-led coalition government and the Congress party would like to
provide a stable government on its own if and when circumstances
demand.
</P>
<P>
She said that rising inflation and a dismal economic
performance had led to growing unemployment and economic distress
resulting in a ominous situation. This had had a deteriorating
impact on the law and order situation.
</P>
<P>
Sonia was also critical of the government's failure in checking
growing atrocities on minorities in the country.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Press Denounced Washington for Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian ruling party organ
Al-Baath newspaper has accused the U.S.-British air strikes
against Iraq as an indication of Washington's double-standard
policy toward the Mideast region.
</P>
<P>
In a editorial published Friday, the paper pointed out that at
a time when Israel is violating international legitimacy,
insisting on pursuing aggression and expansion, "we see the
U.S. administration extending every form of support to the Zionist
entity rather than taking the appropriate measures against it."
</P>
<P>
"Should the U.S. be truly keen on peace and stability of the
region as it alleged?" the paper asked.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also noted that the U.S. aggression on Iraq
constituted a serious precedent for flagrant violation of the
U.N. Charter and other principles of international law.
</P>
<P>
The air raids will further complicate matters in the region, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched two rounds of air strikes
Wednesday and Thursday with a declared aim of destroying Iraq's
military capabilities and retaliate for what they called Iraq's
non-cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which monitors
Iraq's disarmament of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The editorial went on to say that the U.S.-British aggression
is actually directed not only against Iraq, but also all Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The aggression undoubtedly indicates that international
terrorism is actually a U.S.-Israeli stuff and the world should
condemn the behavior, which is threatening international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syrian official daily Tishrin said that should
U.S. President Bill Clinton be keen on defending U.N. resolutions,
Israel is the target he ought to direct his missiles and aircraft
at, rather than Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper called for concerted efforts of the world to
stand firm against the single U.S. unfair policy, which had
surpassed all limits and was posing a flagrant violation of the
international laws.

<HEADLINE> OAU Mini-summit on Conflicts Closes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) mini-summit on conflicts in Africa closed
here abruptly early Friday morning, apparently attaining no
breakthrough on any issues on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by 18 African leaders and 30 delegations,
was expected to last two days, but closed after only one day's
meeting that lasted from Thursday till early Friday morning,
without issuing a communique.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, OAU Chairman and
President of Burkina Faso Blaise Compaore said the leaders
adopted the report of the OAU high-level delegation which visited
Ethiopia and Eritrea in June to mediate in the border dispute
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has in its peace proposals, among other things,
asked Eritrea to withdraw its troops to position before the
conflicts on May 12, 1998, but that was rejected by Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Instead, in a speech at the Thursday meeting, Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki accused the OAU of being partisan in
dealing with the border issue.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Ethiopia of blocking Eritrea's access to the
OAU and practising the trick of "a thief crying thief".
</P>
<P>
On the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Compaore
said the summit listened to a report by Zambian President
Fredrick Chiluba on the latest peace initiative of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim added that he is
expecting finalization of a cease-fire agreement during the SADC
summit scheduled for late December in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The summit also discussed the situation in Angola, Burundi,
Guinea Bissau and the Comoros, but no decision was taken.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Assembly of
Youth (WAY), Malaysian Youth Council (MYC) and 4B Movement of
Malaysia Friday handed over a protest memorandum to the U.S.
embassy here, condemning the airstrikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, carbon-copied to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, called for an immediate stop to the "aggression" and for an
emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, signed by WAY and 4B Movement President Wira
Mohamed Ali Rustam and MYC President Saifuddin Abdullah, was
presented to Deputy Chief of Mission Anna Borg and Counselor for
Political Affairs Jeffrey Lunstead at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Malaysia national news agency
Bernama, about 200 people gathered outside a mosque near
University of Malaya in Petaling Jaya near here for 15 minutes
after Friday prayers to condemn the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, mostly university students and Parti Islam
Se-Malaysia (PAS) supporters, carried placards saying " Down with
U.S.", "Say No to International Police" and "We Support Iraq".
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has officially condemned the airstrikes by the U.S.
and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Dragged Down by Weaker Commodity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
backpedalled more than a third of a U.S. cent Friday, dragged down
by weaker commodities prices and a large sell-off by a domestic
and international bank.
</P>
<P>
Dale Felton, foreign exchange manager of HSBC Markets, said the
local dollar spent most of the day squeezed in a tight range in
lacklustre trading.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished here at 62.00 U.S. cents from
62.37 late Thursday after spending the day between 61.86 and 62.14
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Felton said the Australian currency was weaker as a result of a
fall in commodities prices Thursday night, with the Commodity
Research Bureau (CRB) Index closing down 3.83 points 191.17.
</P>
<P>
The CRB is an index of 21 U.S. futures markets and although it
is not weighted to Australia's exports, traders follow it as an
indicator for the commodity price-sensitive Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The CRB index is still not looking very healthy at all,"
Felton said.
</P>
<P>
"I think overall it continues to have an impact, people are
watching it quite closely now and so the pressure's definitely on
the down side."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar reached its intra-day low of 61.86 U.S.
cents after a domestic and an international bank moved in with a
large sell order after lunch, Felton said.
</P>
<P>
"They sold about $100 million Aussie," he said.
</P>
<P>
Felton said the situation in Iraq - where U.S. and British
forces continued their attack - had very little impact on the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Trading was expected to continue subdued during the Christmas
week and the bias for the Australian dollar would be on the down
side.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was buying 71.97 Japanese
yen from 72.38 and 1.0310 German marks from 1.0398.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea beat China 45-44
in a see-saw thriller to win the men's team sabre gold here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the last gold of fencing in the Asian Games, South Korea
split all the ten golds at stake 5-5 with China.
</P>
<P>
Leading 40-37 into the final round, China's ace fencer Guo
Rong, who won men's individual sabre gold, could not stave off his
rival Kim Doo-Hong's attack, only to see the score tied at 44-all.
</P>
<P>
After a breath-taking tussle, Kim landed the last deciding
attack on Guo, bringing South Korea its fifth gold.
</P>
<P>
"South Korea is stronger than us in the team sabre, and Guo was
also a bit nervous," said Chinese fencing official Wang Wei.
</P>
<P>
China, who won five of eight on offer in Horishima Asiad
fencing competition, bagged golds in the men's and women's
individual foils, men's foil team, men's sabre and women's team
epee, while South Korea triumphed in the men's team epee, women's
team foil, men's and women's individual epees and men's sabre
team.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Closes Firmer in Strong Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed firmer Friday in strong trade with diversified miner BHP
among several major stocks driving the market higher, brokers
said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index rose 9.3 points to 2749.3,
coming off an intra-day peak of 2756.8.
</P>
<P>
"BHP spurred the market on with Beswick," said Morgan
Stockbroking client adviser Kim Ferrier.
</P>
<P>
"It took off early and was very strong."
</P>
<P>
BHP stacked on 33 cents, to 12.00 Australian dollars, a 2.83
percent gain, after announcing that pending shareholder approval
it would wind up the controversial Beswick Pty Ltd by 2001 as part
of an overhaul of its corporate structure.
</P>
<P>
"This was a big plus for the stock today," said Henderson
Charlton Jones dealer Michael Baker.
</P>
<P>
Ferrier said major stocks like News Corp and National Australia
Bank, which were up 2.98 percent and 2.78 percent respectively,
also fueled the market.
</P>
<P>
"Plus the telcos were up and the overseas markets were also
strong," Ferrier said.
</P>
<P>
On Australian equities markets, the all industrials index added
16 points to 4931.9, while strong gains by BHP and fellow
diversified miner Rio Tinto helped boost the all resource index
3.8 points to 965.6, despite generally weaker commodity prices
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Among the other diversified miners, Rio stacked on 21.7, WMC
shed 0.2 of a cent and MIM eased one cent.
</P>
<P>
The bombing raids on Iraq failed to bolster oil and gold
prices, with stocks in both sectors down.
</P>
<P>
Woodside Petroleum dropped 23, Santos dipped 10 and Novus eased
nine.
</P>
<P>
The gold index tumbled 15.5 to 1119.2 points, with Newcrest
shedding eight, Normandy sliding four and Lihir remaining steady
at 1.87 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The spot price of gold bullion in Sydney was 292.00 U.S.
dollars an ounce, down from Thursday's close of 294.80.
</P>
<P>
The bank index rallied 35.6 points to 6306.6, largely on the
strength of NAB which rocketed 67 cents higher.
</P>
<P>
Westpac surged 14.5 on Thursday's improved profit outlook and
shareholder approval for a share buyback, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Bank slipped 12.6, while ANZ slumped 28.3.
</P>
<P>
In the telecommunications sector, Telstra eased 13.8, while
AAPT gained 14 and Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus lifted four.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 460.44 million shares traded for 1.82
billion Australian dollars (1.128 billion U.S. dollars), with
falling stocks outnumbering rising stocks 579 to 538 and 361
stocks remaining steady.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Oil tank trucks between capitals
of Jordan and Iraq shuttled as usual late Thursday night, some 18
hours after the first U.S.- British air raids on Iraq, especially
its capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The high way linking Amman and Baghdad is busy with shuttling
oil tank trucks and drivers from both countries talked and laughed
when they took a rest on the Jordanian-Iraqi high way with their
trucks parked by the roadside, as if no air raids had taken place.
</P>
<P>
But when asked to comment on the air strikes on Iraq, Iraqi
drivers extended their fingers in V signs, signaling a final
victory for the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
The drivers told Xinhua that they did not see Iraqis flocking
toward Jordan on the highway, the only land exit for Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched two rounds of air raids on Iraq
Wednesday and Thursday in retaliation for what they called Iraq's
non-cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The weapons inspections began in 1991 as required in
U.N. resolutions on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990
to ensure Baghdad eradicates all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Imports of crude and oil products from Iraq through the highway
became crucial for Jordan after Saudi Arabia cut off its oil
supplies to Jordan in the 1990 Gulf crises.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian authorities had mapped out an emergency plan in
case oil supplies from Iraq came to a halt due to air attacks.
</P>
<P>
Some Jordanians also began to stockpile petrol, diesel and
cooking gas. Jordanians depend heavily on diesel for heating in
cold winter.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that Jordan`s crude oil stock can be
used for 20 days, petrol for 66 days, cooking gas for 16 days and
fuels for power plants for 90 days.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The stalled peace process in
Northern Ireland won fresh impetus Friday after the feuding
parties struck a deal on key structures for the new Northern
Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Unionists and nationalists agreed there should be 10 government
departments in the shadow government, which will be given full
powers next year.
</P>
<P>
The parties also agreed that six cross-border bodies,
comprising for the first time ministers from both Belfast and
Dublin, will be set up to co-operate on mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck after 18-hour talks at Stormont Palace in
Belfast, during which British Prime Minister Tony Blair broke away
from the Gulf crisis to negotiate with the party leaders by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
The deal was welcomed by Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam
as "an important breakthrough" adding considerable momentum to the
process of implementing the Belfast agreement.
</P>
<P>
Calling the deal a "major step forward," the assembly's First
Minister David Trimble said "this clears the way for the transfer
of power from London to the assembly."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams gave a qualified welcome to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein tried at all times in this negotiation to ensure
that the all-Ireland structures are substantive and meaningful, in
keeping with the letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement,"
Adams said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russia Lashes Out at Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- As missile attacks on Iraq
entered the second day Friday, Russia continued its fierce
reaction to what it called the "outrageous violation of the
U.N. Charter."
</P>
<P>
Moscow recalled its ambassadors to the United States and
Britain for urgent consultations after President Boris Yeltsin and
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed for an immediate end to
the military attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry for Civil Defense and Emergencies said
it is ready to evacuate Russian women and children from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The raids, which the Iraqi Health Ministry said have already
killed 25 Iraqis and injured 75 others, united Russians across the
political spectrum in a chorus of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, Yeltsin called for "an
immediate end to military action, to show common sense and
restraint and not to allow further escalation of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
He said the strikes "could result in the most dramatic
consequences, not only for the Iraqi settlement, but for the
stability of the entire region."
</P>
<P>
Moscow has long opposed the use of force against Baghdad and
said that any military action must be coordinated by the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Russian displeasure over the strikes will prompt the State
Duma, or lower house of parliament, to further delay its
ratification of START II, a Russian-U.S. treaty on cutting the
number of the two countries' nuclear warheads to 3,000-3,500 each.
</P>
<P>
It also threw into question Russia's cooperation with
NATO. Yeltsin on Thursday instructed Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev to cancel a trip to Brussels where he was scheduled to
participate in a session of the Russia-NATO Joint Permanent
Council.
</P>
<P>
"How can one talk about cooperation and partnership with NATO
when Russia's opinion is openly neglected?" Sergeyev said. "The
U.N. Security Council's efforts to solve the problem peacefully
have been reduced to nothing."
</P>
<P>
Russia also called for the dismissal of Richard Butler, head of
the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq, whose report on Baghdad's
non-cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors triggered the
airstrikes by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said the current crisis was created
artificially, through "irresponsible, willful actions by Butler,
who has practically violated his mandate," Itar-Tass reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the State Duma, deputies cleared its scheduled agenda
Thursday for an unusual show of unity as lawmakers condemned the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely intolerable," said deputy Vladimir Lukin, a
former ambassador to the United States and a member of the liberal
Yabloko faction.
</P>
<P>
"A debate on whether Iraq has fulfilled this or that
U.N. resolution is no grounds for the bombing of a country;
moreover, it is no grounds for the unilateral bombing of a
country," Lukin said.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov described the strikes
as an "act of state terror against the sovereign state of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
In addition to verbal condemnations, a small number of Russians
protested in front of the local U.S. and British embassies, where
security was beefed up.
</P>
<P>
Like some of their U.S. counterparts, Russian lawmakers also
said that the strikes were a cynical attempt by U.S. President
Bill Clinton to distract attention from his domestic political
troubles.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Women's Doubles Tennis in Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Fang and Chen Li of China
won the tiebreaker 7-2 to take the women's doubles tennis title in
straight sets at the Asian Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pair, who eliminated top seed Nana Miyagi and Rika
Hiraki of Japan in the semi-finals, went on to beat third seed
Park Sung-Hee and Cho Yoon-Jeong of South Korea 6-2, 7-6 (7/2).
</P>
<P>
"When we lost the doubles in the team final, we were just
waiting for a chance to hit a winner," said China's top player Li.
</P>
<P>
"But today, we played very well, thinking we can move, we can
go for it, we can win the game and we don't need to wait for a
chance to hit a winner," she added.
</P>
<P>
It was the first tennis gold medal for China after Li and Chen
lost to Chinese Taipei's Wang Shi-ting and Janet Lee in the team
final.
</P>
<P>
Li also took the bronze medals in the singles and mixed
doubles.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very long tournment and I was a bit tired after playing
a lot of matches, but we had thought we would have a good chance
to win the doubles because Chen Li is a very tough player."
</P>
<P>
"We have played together since we were kids. And now, we are
the champions and we are happy," said Li, who also got a gold for
the mixed doubles at the 1994 Hiroshima Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Li insisted the victory was just as important as one on the
women's tour.
</P>
<P>
"When we play on the WTA tour, we want to make our rankings
higher, but it's also for our country. And when we play in the
Asian Games, it's also for ourselves. So it doesn't matter whether
the victory is the WTA tour or the Asian Games," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Ends the Year on an Uncertain Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Wool sales have ended the
year on an uncertain note after a final day fall in prices partly
offset a rally in prices earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Market Indicator ended the week up seven cents to
515 cents (321.8 U.S. cents) a kilogram clean, while the Western
Indicator rose one cent to 446 cents (278.7 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
A total of 89,238 bales were offered for sale, with 13 percent
passed in.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters said: "while there is
a general recognition that most of the Asian economies are on the
road to recovery, it is expected to be still quite some time
before this translates into any sustained improvement in consumer
demand for wool products."
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that 1999 will continue to be a difficult time
for all involved in the industry."
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
this week forecast a fall in wool prices because of the downturn
in Asia, with prices tipped to fall 26 percent to around 520 cents
(325 U.S. cents) for the financial year.
</P>
<P>
However Wesfarmers Dalgety said the rally in prices last week
and the solid demand for Chinese buyers augured well for sales in
January when the market reopens.
</P>
<P>
"All three selling centers attracted good bidding competition
with solid Chinese demand driving this. While the market eased as
sales drew to a close, overall it was a positive week."
</P>
<P>
"The good performance of the market over recent weeks and its
ability to hold at current levels is encouraging for the opening
of sales in January."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Strikes on Iraq Bring Mixed Reactions in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The air strikes on Iraq by
U.S. and British forces Thursday have brought mixed reactions
in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
While most said the situation could have been handled through
negotiations with a good chance that the crisis could be resolved
peacefully, a few others said the attack was the only alternative
following the failure of diplomatic overtures in the past several
months.
</P>
<P>
Farida Haider Ali, who runs the Al Khansa Institute, reacted
strongly to the strike on Iraq. "There is barely 24 hours left
for the Holy Month of Ramadan to begin. This is not the time for
the poor Iraqi people to suffer pain."
</P>
<P>
Farida was particularly upset about the timing of the
air strikes. "This month, people should be in harmony and in peace
with their neighbors." Instead, the Iraqi civilians have to face
bloodshed and live in fear, she said.
</P>
<P>
Habiba Al Marashi, Chairman of the Emirates Environmental
Group in Dubai, said that "this is extremely humiliating to the Arab
nation and the whole Islamic world because it is obvious that the
Americans are deliberately targeting us."
</P>
<P>
Suresh Mathur, Principal of Our Own English High School in
Dubai, was furious, calling the U.S.-British strike "an act of
bullying."
</P>
<P>
He asked, "Where is the United Nations? I thought the
sanctions were imposed by the U.N., not the U.S.A., and the decision
to make an air strike, if at all, should have come from the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
However, Sherif el Gamrawy, a marketing executive, said Iraq
deserved it for not complying with the U.N. norms.

LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Baghdad came under sustained and heavy cruise missile attack
early Friday morning after British Tornados had joined the bombing
raids twice on the second day of an allied attack that has caused
devastating damage to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's prime
military facilities.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House of Representatives will press ahead Friday or

</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>

Representatives' new speaker, Bob Livingston, who is at the head

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Tries to Distance Itself From Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah has said that "Kuwait is not part
of the latest standoff between Iraq and the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"We are not part of it (crisis)... . And we're linked to it
neither from near or far," Al-Sabah said in a statement carried by
the Al-Rai Al-Aam newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched two rounds of air strikes on Iraq
Wednesday and Thursday. Some 300 hundred of cruise missiles
have been fired on Iraqi targets, killing at least two people and
wounding 30 others.
</P>
<P>
The operation has drawn strong condemnation and criticism from
a host of countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the air strikes were
retaliation for Iraq's non-cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM), which oversees Iraq's disarming of weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council authorized UNSCOM after the 1991 Gulf
War, triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, to monitor
Iraq's disarmament. It has repeatedly run into standoffs with
Iraq, setting off several crises.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that Kuwait
"monitors the political and military developments in the area,"
noting that the situation in Kuwait "is proceeding calmly."
</P>
<P>
Responding to media reports that Kuwait was happy over the
military developments, Sabah said "what joy are you talking
about? We feel sorry for the suffering of any people, especially a
brotherly people."
</P>
<P>
"But the Iraqi regime bears full responsibility for what's
happening," he added.

Al-Ajmi was tested at random December 14 after finishing 10th

</P>
<P>
Earlier, Jordanian weightlifter Ayed Khawaldeh tested positive
for the banned substance triamterene.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Controversy Over Nude Statues Calms Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Controversy over two nude
sculptures of a man and woman, which dominate the Culture Square
of Changchun, the capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, has
finally calmed down.
</P>
<P>
When the six-meter tall statues were first erected, several
city leaders were worried that many local residents would object
simply because of the traditional Chinese coyness about sex, and
it was suggested that the sexual organ of the man be covered up.
</P>
<P>
However, to their surprise they discovered that most of the
city's two million urban dwellers did not mind at all and now the
statues have become an attraction for thousands of Changchun
residents and tourists to the city.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll discovered that lots of people were in favor,
mostly young and middle aged, and some against although they were
in a minority, according to Tang Shiguang, director of the Culture
Square administration office.
</P>
<P>
In recent times Changchun has become known as the center of
China's auto and movie-making industries and city leaders have
built an international-style metropolis boasting rolling, green
lawns and installed scores of statues to help brighten up its
image and make it enjoyable for residents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sociologist Bing Zheng explained the acceptance of
the statues as a change in attitude of Chinese people. "Behavior
patterns and old ideas have moved on and there is a greater
appreciation of artistic beauty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The way the people of Changchun have reacted to the nude
statues epitomizes how much the Chinese people have altered their
views of sex nowadays." added Bing.
</P>
<P>
Now the statues are often used as a backdrop by travelers for
taking photographs and one recent visitor calmly dismissed the
controversy saying that the statues were a work of art and it
wasn't necessary to cover them up.
</P>
<P>
In recent times, the city of Changchun has hosted two big
international sculpture exhibitions and now boasts more than 70
life-size and larger statues located in its major public places.

Thabo Mbeki to solve problems hampering free trade between the
two sides, Business Day reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following failure to resolve the dispute over South Africa's
continued use of the names "port" and "sherry" for fortified
wines last week, the European Commission indicated at the weekend
that its President Jacques Santer would meet Mbeki to try to
resolve the last sticking point.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, EU's executive, has been negotiating,
on behalf of the bloc's 15 states, with South Africa over free
trade for years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, EU leaders promised South African President
Nelson Mandela that the talks would be complete by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified EU officials have confirmed the report that
Santer was seeking talks with Mbeki, Business Day said.
</P>
<P>
However, confirming the deadlock still existed, Bahle Sibisi,
chief director for foreign trade relations at the South African
Trade and Industry Department, said Thursday he was unaware of
the bid to elevate the talks to Mbeki's level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no comment was received from Mbeki's office this
week.
</P>
<P>
The EU demands that South Africa phase out the use of "port"
and "sherry" in its domestic market, which has been rejected by
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria, which has indicated its willingness to phase out the
use of the names in third markets, wants to retain their use in
member states of the Southern African Development Community.

dialog should take precedence on that matter."
</P>

He noted that diplomacy is not being given a chance by the
parties involved in solving the problem in the Gulf region, The

<P>
A combined force of the United States and Britain launched air
strikes against Iraq on Wednesday and continued their military
action Thursday on Iraqi capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Following the air strikes, the United States closed all but
three of its African embassies Thursday and the United States

<P>
JAKARTA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- the Indonesian government has
called on the United States and Britain to end the strikes against
Iraq and resume peaceful negotiations and dialogues to settle the
problem, said Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia deplores the use of force against Iraq with respect
to the implementation of the U.N. resolution on weapons of mass
destruction," Alatas told reporters after the signing of an
agreement between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and Japan here Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Alatas said, the government has also
reiterated its call to Iraq to comply with all the provisions
contained in the relevant U.N. resolutions and agreements it had
reached with the U.N. secretary general.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there is still no plan to evacuate Indonesian
citizens in Baghdad following U.S.-led missile strike on the city.
</P>
<P>
"We will let Indonesian Ambassador to Iraq Moebramsjah take the
necessary action," he said, adding that his ministry has not
received any report about Indonesian citizens in Iraq who have
fallen victim to the air strike.
</P>
<P>
There are 123 Indonesians living in Baghdad, including 36
students and members of the diplomatic staff and their families.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources told reporters that communication between
Indonesia and Iraq has been difficult and has to be coursed
through the Indonesian embassy in Amman, Jordan.

The move came after Moscow recalled its ambassador to

ANKARA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
news items in leading Turkish newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aksam (Evening):
</P>
<P>
-- Due to the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq, Turkey
closed its border with Iraq Thursday and increased precautions in
order to prevent the possible influx of Iraqi Kurds refugees.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey after the
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Thursday that his
country is concerned about the latest developments in its
neighboring Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the developments which started by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and which caused a chronic crisis
between the U.N. and Iraq, led to serious sufferings in the
region and Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Thursday that nobody
can shelter Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained by the Italian police upon his arrival in
Rome by a Russian Airlines passenger plane on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Italy rejected a Turkish warrant for the extradition of Ocalan
under the Italian law, which bars extradition to countries where
suspects may face death penalty.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Xuemei, gold medalist in
the women's 100 and 4x100m relay, was beaten by Sri Lanka's K.
Damayanthi Darsha in the 200m on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Li, who holds the Asian 200m record of 22.01, surrendered the
gold to Darsha in the closing meters with a clocking of 22.53
seconds against Darsha's 22.48.
</P>
<P>
The third place went to Yan Jiankui of China in 23.15.
</P>
<P>
The double Asian gold medalist Li also finished second in the
semifinals on Thursday after Darsha, winner of the women's 400
meters, who beat 100m champion Li Xuemei in the 200m semifinals on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I have recovered from the fever and stomach complaints
sustained early this week, but I felt very weak in my legs," said
Li, who overcame the illness to win the two gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Darsha said this was her first time to run 200m since 1995 just
because of compatriot S. Jayasinghe's sudden withdrawal from the
event.
</P>
<P>
"I have never prepared for the event, but once I stepped onto
the track, I was confident to win," she said.
</P>
<P>
Darsha said her win might be the first in Sri Lanka's history
and she will be a tough contender from now on with Jayasinghe.
</P>
<P>
"I thought nobody (in Sri Lanka) has won a gold medal in the
200m event at Asian Games," she said. "And in the future perhaps I
will compete more in the 200m."

<HEADLINE> Direct Shipping Across Taiwan Straits Being Tried Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 25,000 trips have
been made across the Taiwan Straits and over 400,000 standard
containers from China shipped since the mainland and Taiwan
started experimenting with direct shipping in April of 1997.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, 1996, the Ministry of Communications announced
that Xiamen and Fuzhou in east China's Fujian Province would be
used as trial ports, and on April 19, 1997, a ship of the Xiamen
Shipping Co. made its maiden voyage to Taiwan's Kaoxiung. Ten
other companies later got involved in the business.
</P>
<P>
Li Jian, secretary-general of the Association of Cross-Strait
Shipping Exchanges, said that these 10 companies began to make a
profit shortly after they started the business and there have been
two significant things this year: one is that major foreign trade
ports on the mainland have opened container lines to Taiwanese
ports without the use of a third port; and the other is that
container ships on international lines from Taiwan or the mainland
can register in ports on either side of the straits.
</P>
<P>
Li does acknowledge that shipping across the straits is
indirect basically and that there are still a number of obstacles
to real direct shipping and that this is not in the common
interest of the shipping circles, and he also expressed the hope
that Taiwan authorities will take effective and feasible steps to
remove man-made obstacles to direct shipping at an early date.

BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Asia's fastest man Koji Ito
claimed his third gold medal at the Asian Games as he stormed to
victory in the men's 200 meters here on Friday.

<P>
Koji, who holds the 200m Asian record of 20.16 seconds, clocked

<P>
The 28-year-old Japanese had won the 100m and 4x100m early this
week. He also broke the men's 100m Asian record with a fabulous
time of 10.00 in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to win the gold medals," he said.
"I have not thought of breaking the record," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the winning time of 20.25 was good enough for him
since it is off season back home.
</P>
<P>
"Any record can be broken by somebody, but the gold medal can
never be broken," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposes Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's Foreign Ministry
said Thursday the U.S.-British military attacks on Iraq
represented "an aggression" that wantonly violates the
U.N. Charter and severely harms an independent nation's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The United States by placing itself above the United Nations
and willingly resorting to force has undermined the basis of
international law and order, a ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
The airstrikes that have caused casualties and material losses
have drawn strong condemnation from the world and Yugoslav public
opinions, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that international issues can only be solved through
political means persistently in line with the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Sergeyev who was in Belgrade Thursday
said that as a result of the U.S.-British strikes conducted
without U.N. authorization all efforts made by the international
community to maintain peace in the Gulf have come to naught.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev made the remark at a signing ceremony for a summary of
minutes to boost cooperation in defense science and technology
between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu
Jintao, who flew to Ho Chi Minh City Friday afternoon at the end
of his stay here, said his visit to the Vietnamese capital has
achieved important results and his entire Vietnam trip will be a
success.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who started his three-day official visit to Vietnam
Thursday, said before his departure for the South Vietnamese city,
he had felt the profound friendship of the Vietnamese people while
he was here and he had also learned about the achievements made by
the Vietnamese people in their cause of renovation under the
leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
He told Vietnamese leaders, who bade him farewell at the
government guest house, that the two sides exchanged views
extensively and reached consensus on a wide range of questions in
their talks.
</P>
<P>
Both sides pledged to work hard to build the framework for a
21st century-oriented friendship, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the need to settle the issue of land border
before the year 2000 and conclude the demarcation of the Beibu
Gulf no later than the year 2000 in accordance with the important
consensus reached by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the then
General Secretary Do Muoi in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Saying good-bye to Hu, Pham The Duyet, permanent member of the
Political Bureau of the Vietnamese Communist Party, expressed
satisfaction with Hu's visit, which he said has realized its
objectives.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam and China share many similarities in pursuing
economic development although they differ in their conditions.
</P>
<P>
He described some suggestions made by Vice President Hu
concerning socialist construction in his talks with Vietnamese
leaders as "profound" and "beneficial," but he did not disclose
their content.
</P>
<P>
Duyet expressed his country's determination to further bolster
the traditional relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Vice President Hu met with Vietnamese
leaders including Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, President Tram Duc

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Calls for Lasting Sino-Vietnamese Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu
Jintao, who is here on a three-day official visit to Vietnam,
Friday called for a "lasting and stable relationship of
neighborliness and all-round cooperation" between China and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"To further consolidate and develop relations between our two
parties and two countries is not only in the fundamental interests
of the two peoples but also conducive to the peace and stability
in the region and the world as a whole," Hu said in a written
interview with Nhan Dan, the organ of the Vietnamese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two countries enjoy broad prospects for
cooperation and the Chinese people are ready to work together with
the Vietnamese people in increasing exchange and promote
cooperation to seek joint development and take into the 21st
century a lasting and stable relationship of neighborliness and
all-round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hu spoke highly of what he called "effective measures" Vietnam
has taken to counter the adverse effects of the East Asian
financial crisis and maintain the momentum of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that the brotherly Vietnamese people will overcome
all difficulties under the leadership of the Vietnamese Communist
Party and realize the objectives set by the party's Eighth
Congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that both China and Vietnam have maintained social
stability and economic growth despite the impact of the East Asian
financial crisis. "This fully demonstrates the superiority of
socialism and the development potentials of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Answering questions concerning China's experiences in carrying
out the reform and open policy, Vice President Hu said the Chinese
economy has registered "sustained, rapid and healthy development"
in the past 20 years of reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
In the 20 years, he said, China has come to see that it is
necessary to integrate Marxism with its own practice and build a
socialism with Chinese characteristics, make economic growth and
development of production forces the focus of its work and persist
in carrying out the reform and open policy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that practice has shown that the road of socialism
with Chinese characteristics is the only correct road that
conforms to China's reality and will enable the country to realize
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that "poverty is not socialism," the Chinese vice
president said that only by developing the economy, boosting the
country's overall power and improving the people's living
standard, can the socialist system fully show its superiority and
the country enjoy stability and security and stand the test of all
kinds of adversity.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the correct handling of the relations
between reform, development and stability, saying reform and
opening-up and modernization require a stable political situation
and an international environment of peace.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to strengthen socialist democracy and
Communist party leadership in pushing ahead with economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Cattle Rustling on Lesotho Border Could Become </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Police and community
leaders along Lesotho's southern border with South Africa have
warned that a full scale war could break out unless security is
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
Stock theft-related clashes between South African farmers and
Basotho nationals in the Maluti and Mount Fletcher areas have
resulted in more than 70 deaths so far this year, the Star
newspaper Friday quoted commander of the stock theft unit of
South African police Nicholson Mlatha as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mlatha described the situation as volatile and explosive.
</P>
<P>
At least three South Africans were killed during a
cross-border attack to retrieve stolen cattle last week.
</P>
<P>
Mlatha warned that more South Africans could become victims of
this kind of skirmishes because the Lesotho Defense Force often
violate international laws by shooting people on South African
soil.
</P>
<P>
"In May this year, four South Africans who went to retrieve
their livestock were shot dead on South African soil by members
of the Lesotho Defense Force," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mlatha, Lesotho security forces were deployed
within communities, making easy prey South Africans who crossed
the border illegally.
</P>
<P>
Although two-way theft of livestock on the border was common,
the phenomenon had taken a violent turn since 1994, Mlatha said.
</P>
<P>
"Problems worsened in 1994 when more and more Basotho
livestock crossed the border and grazed on South African soil.
</P>
<P>
"South Africans captured the animals, but later handed them
over to their lawful owners."
</P>
<P>
Mlatha said when more livestock regularly strayed into South
Africa, the farmers decided to charge the Basotho for the illegal
grazing.
</P>
<P>
The situation deteriorated when the Basotho farmers allegedly
crossed the border to retrieve their livestock, but refused to
pay the fines imposed by the South Africans.
</P>
<P>
"To make matters worse, they even took livestock which
belonged to the South Africans," he said.
</P>
<P>
South African and Basotho farmers decided to make their
cross-border raids without police assistance, which resulted in
the deaths of several members of the groups.
</P>
<P>
Mlatha recounted a string of killings of both South Africans
and Basotho, and blamed organized crime syndicates for the
ongoing theft and killings.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the South African government for inadequate
resources and bad conditions for those who do border patrols.
</P>
<P>
"If the government does not intervene, the situation could
soon turn into a full scale war, especially if one considers that
more than 70 South African and Basotho nationals have already
died this year."

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>

rescue the government, but the move may be too late, as the
coalition partner, the Third Way, decided to cast its four

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBC) opened its Nanjing branch today, the last of nine regional
branches the central bank has set up across the country.
</P>
<P>
The new branch will serve Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, which
accounted for 12.5 percent of China's gross domestic product and
10.87 percent of consumer sales last year.
</P>
<P>
From next year, the PBC's Nanjing Branch will replace the
original provincial branches in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and
undertake financial supervision and management in the two
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The two provinces have a total of more than 30,000 financial
institutions, with 280,000 employees, and their total deposits and
loans are about 8.93 percent and 8.38 percent respectively of the
national total.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities earlier this year decided to phase out the
PBC's original 31 branches set up in accordance with
administrative divisions and replace them with nine trans-regional
branch banks to strengthen management and enhance financial
supervision.
</P>
<P>
This reform will help to improve the central bank ability's to
independently ensure financial supervision, said Xiao Gang, deputy
governor of the PBC.

<HEADLINE> No Iraqi Movement Near Border: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 18 (Xinhua) -- No Iraqi troops or
civilian movement were observed near the borders between Iraq
and Kuwait after U.S.-British military strikes against Iraq, a
local newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation at the border was normal," Abdullah Ryal,
spokesman for U.N. Iraq Kuwait Observer Mission (UNIKOM), was
quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
UNIKOM, established after the 1991 Gulf War, has a mandate to
monitor, observe and report on the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
between Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"For us there is no change. The situation in the DMZ is
still calm and quiet," Ryal said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to comment on whether UNIKOM had gone on
a higher state of alert, but did say the observers have no plans
to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
No Iraqi troops movement has been observed at the border
and no Iraqi refugees have been seen trying to cross the
border into Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
During the last crisis in mid-November, local and international
humanitarian organizations said they made contingency plans with
the Kuwaiti government to deal with a possible influx of Iraqi
refugees as a result of the possible U.S. military
strikes.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Follows a Flat Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus stock market's
course this week can be portrayed by a straight horizontal line, a
weekly market review said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said the marginal daily deviations
observed at the beginning of the week, evaporated during the last
two trading days, leaving the market with completely no change.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share index closed at 453.3 points Thursday with
virtually no change for the week.
</P>
<P>
Investment activity remained at satifactory levels this week
in the secondary market, as indicated by the volume of
transactions which averaged 1.8 million Cyprus pounds (about 3.6
million U.S. dollars) per session.
</P>
<P>
Shares, except banking and insurance stocks, were actively
traded through the week.
</P>
<P>
The review said the market's flat course was not the result of
stagnant prices, but because the price increases mainly achieved
by banking stocks were counterbalanced by the drops of most other
listed stocks due to profit taking pressures.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover this week was 8.9 million pounds (about
17.8 million dollars), lower than 11.9 million pounds (about
23.8 million dollars) the previous week.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti weightlifter has
been tested positive for banned drugs in the Asian Games, a top
Olympic Council of Asia official said here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jaber Alajmi, who finished 10th in the men's over 105kg class
on Monday, has been tested positive for steroids in a drug check,
said an OCA official who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
"Both A and B samples have been confirmed positive," said the
official who didn't name the banned drug or the date of testing.
</P>
<P>
"His results and ranking in the competition have been
annulled," the official added.
</P>
<P>
Alajmi was the second athlete caught taking banned drugs in the
current Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Ayed Khawaideh, also weightlifter, flunked the doping
test earlier in the Games. Traces of triamterene, a diuretic which
helps lose weight or mask other banned drugs, were found in both
his A and B urine samples.
</P>
<P>
Ayed admitted in the hearings that he took the drug prior to
the Games, in a purpose to lose weight for his competition in the
56kg class as the International Weightlifting Federation
reshuffled the categories early this year.

<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China today voiced its deep
regret over the second air strike against Iraq by combined
U.S. and British forces.
</P>
<P>
China urges the U.S. and Britain to immediately cease these

their military action against Iraq and to seek a settlement of the
situation through dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Coffee Output Drops by Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee production has
dropped by half in the last 10 years, causing a loss of 65
billion Shillings (around 60 Shillings equal to one U.S.
Dollars), said a newsletter released by the Kenya Planters
Cooperative Union.
</P>
<P>
The December issue available here Friday quoted Coffee
Research Foundation chairman Abraham Mwangi as saying production
of coffee, a major foreign exchange earner for Kenya, dropped
from 130,000 tons in 1988 to 65,000 tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mwangi blamed the fall in coffee production on the collapse of
the price support mechanism in 1989 when the International Coffee
Agreement removed quotas at a time glut.
</P>
<P>
He said since coffee prices recovered in 1993, the industry in
the country had experienced a time lag in its rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop in production, Mwangi said, coffee farming
remained viable and accounted for one-third of the jobs in the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the liberalization of the sector started
in 1992, major steps had been taken to sustain growth including
the introduction of coffee sales in U.S. Dollars and electronic
trading at the central auction, as well as direct payment system.
</P>
<P>
Coffee, tea and horticulture are Kenya's leading foreign
exchange earners following the collapse of tourism due to bad
publicity and insecurity.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, U.S. Sign Agreement on Container Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Inland Water
Transport Authority (BIWTA) Thursday signed an agreement here with
the Stevedoring Services of America (SSA) on a container terminal
at Dhaka, The Financial Express daily newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 200 million U.S. dollar-terminal
project on 35.2 hectares of land will start in march 1999, and the
terminal will go into operation in March 2001, according to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The SSA Bangladesh Ltd., a joint venture company between the
BIWTA and the SSA, is expected to sign another agreement with
BIWTA for another container terminal at Patenga, in Bangladesh's
second largest city of Chittagong, next month.
</P>
<P>
"We will start the construction work of the terminals at the
same time in March 1999 and expected to put these into operation
by March 1999," the report quoted a deputy managing director of
the joint venture as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides these terminals, he said that the project includes
development of the integrated barge service system. "There will be
12 or 13 barges which will shuttle between these two terminals for
smooth handling of containers," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The total cost for construction of these two container
terminals and barge service system will be 438 million dollar.
</P>
<P>
The project will relieve the Chittagong Port of capacity
pressure and provide importers and exporters with the benefits of
true inter-modal system, he said.
</P>
<P>
On completion of the project, the SSA will be able to handle
300,000 TEU (tonnage equivalent unit) containers annually and will
create jobs for 3,000 people, according to the officials
concerned.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: S. Africa's Diplomacy Faces Grave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- 1998, the fourth year
since the African National Congress (ANC) began ruling in South
Africa after abolishing apartheid in 1994, has witnessed the
biggest black political party launching unpreced
diplomatic campaign.
</P>
<P>
In the brighter aspect, the ANC government has beefed up
relations with both developed and developing countries,
especially with the big powers, namely the United States, Russia,
Britain, France and China, all permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
At the very beginning of the year, the South African
government forged diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of
China, paving the way for expanding bilateral exchanges in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela, who in the year met dozens of heads
of state and government leaders at home and abroad, apparently
has been taking the lead in blueprinting and implementing South
Africa's foreign policy to exert the country's influence beyond
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its chairmanship of both the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, South
Africa has been in a favorable position to play an important role
in the world's political arena.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat made two visits to South
Africa in August this year, seeking support and help from
Pretoria and other SADC members to advance the Middle East peace
process. This demonstrates Pretoria's renowned prestige.
</P>
<P>
As a regional power, South Africa has been active in African
and world affairs, and withstanding pressure from Western powers,
it maintains good relations with countries like Cuba, Libya and
Iran, which are black-listed by major Western countries,
especially the U.S.
</P>
<P>
It also spares no effort to mediate regional conflicts. Ever
since the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
broke out in early August, Mandela and his top aides have been
doing their utmost to organize peace talks between the warring
sides, which now include Rwanda and Uganda as against SADC
countries -- Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
However, despite its repeated mediation efforts on the DRC
issue, South Africa is by far hardly making any substantial
progress to rid the war-torn DRC of further blood shedding.
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons for the unsuccessful mediation. But one
thing cannot be ignored, that is: South Africa, in some sense,
has failed from the very beginning to take careful consideration
of the fact that the DRC government headed by President Laurent
Kabila is recognized both by the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Over-emphasis on peace talks without showing necessary support
to the internationally recognized Kabila government has
undoubtedly put Pretoria in an awkward position when it is trying
to preside over talks between Kabila and rebel leaders, some
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Although South African leaders have always pledged to be
neutral in dealing with the Congo conflict, it is hard to believe
that Mandela met rebel leader Ernst Wamba dia Wamba in late
October, while leaving Congolese Foreign Minister Jean-Charles
Okoto Lolakombe unattended during the latter's visit in Pretoria
on November 16.
</P>
<P>
The unbalanced diplomacy has apparently created a gap between
Pretoria and Kinshasa, thus weakening South Africa's mediation
position.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in New Zealand at 4-Year Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand is at a four-year peak and up across all sectors of the
economy, New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) said Friday while
quoting a National Bank's December confidence survey.
</P>
<P>
"This sets 1999 up for a better year than 1998," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53 percent of those who replied were optimists and
nine percent pessimists. This netted off at positive 44 percent,
up sharply from last month's 27 percent and taking the measure of
confidence to its highest level for four years, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Confidence was up across all sectors and most regions. Also,
for the first time in a year expectations about job prospects were
positive.
</P>
<P>
A net 46.1 percent were positive about conditions in retailing,
46.4 percent in manufacturing, 50 percent in construction and 51.9
percent in services. But only a net 13.8 percent were positive in
agriculture, though last month a net 3.4 percent were negative
about agriculture prospects.
</P>
<P>
The year-ahead inflation expectation of 1.96 percent was at
record lows.
</P>
<P>
A net 17.4 percent of respondents planned new investment in the
 coming year, the highest level since March 1994.
</P>
<P>
A net 20.6 percent expected profits to rise and a net 39.9
percent expected to increase exports. A net 7.7 percent expected
increased employment, the survey showed.

<HEADLINE> Nike Earnings Fall 51 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Nike Inc., the world's
largest athletic shoe maker, Thursday said its fiscal
second-quarter earnings dropped 51 percent on sagging domistic and
Asian sales.
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal second quarter ended November 30, the company
said earnings fell to 68.9 million U.S. dollars from 141.1 million
dollars for the year-ago period. Revenue was down 15 percent, to
1.91 billion dollars from 2.26 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company blamed the sharp drop on the lockout of National
Basketball Association (NBA) which had removed one of its biggest
promotional tools.
</P>
<P>
Nike relies heavily on its stable of NBA athletes to promote
the swoosh. But with NBA labor woes cancelling the season so far,
interest in those stars and their shoes has waned.
</P>
<P>
The company said futures orders fell 7 percent in its
U.S. region, rose 5 percent in Europe and fell 37 percent in
Asia-Pacific, where a soft retail market has been the company's
headache for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Nike said worldwide so-called futures orders for athletic
footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery between December 1998
and April 1999, fell 10 percent from the year-ago period to 3.8
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In September, the company disclosed plans to cut an additional
300 jobs in its Asia-Pacific operations on top of the 1,600 job
reductions throughout the company announced earlier in the
year. Nike said the moves were expected to result in savings of
about 100 million dollars annually.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Debate Competition for Women Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18, (Xinhua) -- A national competition is to
be held in China for women prosecutors to display their forensic
skills, the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) said today.
</P>
<P>
Of China's 160,000 public prosecutors, 30,000 are women. The
competition is designed to demonstrate the talents of women
prosecutors as part of SPP's efforts to improve the general
proficiency level of prosecutors during this time of legal reform,
according to Hu Kehui, a woman deputy procurator-general.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary competition will begin December 21 in the
cities of Shanghai, Chengdu, Jinan and Xi'an, and the final will
be held in Beijing next February.
</P>
<P>
Many women prosecutors have displayed their qualities of
earnestness and preparedness and have contributed a great deal to
the unified and fair implementation of the law, just as their male
colleagues have done, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
She cited the example of the corruption case against Chen
Xitong, former Party chief of Beijing, pointing out that the chief
prosecutor in that case was a woman.
</P>
<P>
"Some of our gifted women prosecutors have been nicknamed 'pretty
killers' by criminals," a woman prosecutor from the SPP said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Air Raids on Iraq Condemned in New Zealand Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Evening Post, a major
Wellington-based newspaper, Friday frontpaged an interview with an
Iraqi immigrant, condemning ongoing U.S. and British air raids on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I contacted my family in Baghdad yesterday. They feel
helpless. they are just waiting for the bombs to fall and they
don't have anything to say or do. They are expecting death," said
Dr. Wael Aldelaimy, who is a Ph.D. student at the Wellington
School of Medicine and was immigrated to New Zealand three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Aldelaimy's brother and sister, aunts, uncles and cousins
are all in Baghdad. His parents, now in Jordan, may go back to
Iraq to be with the family.
</P>
<P>
"They (Americans) themselves don't know where the targets or
alleged chemical weapons are. There are already heaps of people
suffering ... people are also dying because of the sanctions," he
told the Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Aldelaimy criticized the New Zealand government for
supporting the air strikes. "New Zealand's anti-nuclear stance
means it has been viewed as a very independent, peaceful country.
But this latest blind following of the U.S. policy has very much
changed that picture and image," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq Sanctions Medical Alert Group, a group of
Wellington-based doctors, health policy advisers and
epidemiologists, of which Dr. Aldelaimy is a member, also
condemns the strikes, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marten Hutt, spokesman of the organization, was quoted as
saying that while Saddam Hussein's non-cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspections is regrettable and hopeless, the strikes will
inflict more hunger and disease on Iraq's people.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: S. Africa's Diplomacy Faces Grave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In contrast with the DRC conflict, South Africa did a better
job in neighboring Lesotho when the landlocked kingdom was
plunged into nationwide turmoil in September as a result of sharp
disputes between the ruling Lesotho Congress of Democracy over
the May 23 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Different from its previous mediation approach, South Africa,
together with Botswana, resorted to military force this time at
the invitation of Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the ANC government has ever resorted to
military intervention since it took power in 1994. Militarily
speaking, it was not quite efficient as the operation lasted
about one week before the rebels were put down and social crimes,
including arson and looting, were stopped.
</P>
<P>
However, the South Africa-sponsored military intervention plus
diplomatic mediation have helped Lesotho return to law and
stability after all.
</P>
<P>
What's more important is that the unprecedented military
operation represented a change in South Africa's diplomacy --
from sole mediation to the combination of military forces and
talks in dealing with regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In some sense, South African leaders' resolve to intervene
militarily in Lesotho affairs was not an isolated incident. Weeks
prior to the intervention, Mandela had nodded to the military
action taken by Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola to support Kabila's
government while he was attending the 12th Non-Aligned Movement
summit on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Although Mandela described the SADC countries' military
involvement in Congo (K) as "reasonable", it was by no means a
signal that South Africa would follow suit in solving the Congo
problem.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Foreign Affairs Department announced on
November 8 that it would not consider sending peace-keeping
troops to Congo, noting that it would remain neutral and continue
to promote political settlement of the Congo conflict.
</P>
<P>
In terms of national strength and international standing,
South Africa can be regarded as "a superpower in Africa". In this
regard, its future foreign policy should continue to focus on
helping resolve regional disputes and conflicts, because this is
a must to uphold South Afrca's image of a big power in the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
The bloody war in Congo (K) is raging on till now, and hence
it has become the most rigorous test to South Africa's foreign
policy. It was generally believed that the success of Pretoria's
diplomacy depends primarily on its sustained peace een
providing Kabila with military support, so as to be able to work
together on a peaceful settlement of the Congo problem and other
regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, supported by Zimbabwe and other SADC countries,
insists that he will only have talks with Rwanda and Uganda and
refuses to meet with the Congolese rebels, while South Africa
says it will not attend summit meetings which shut the door to
the Congolese rebels. So mediation on the Congo crisis has hit
snags.
</P>
<P>
It can be said that the war in Congo is indeed a headache to
South Africa's diplomacy. Observers here say that only when the
glaring disagreement in the region is bridged, can South Africa
play an efficient role in regional affairs in general and in the
Congo crisis in particular.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia's Economy, A Long Shot From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia, described as one of
the "tiger economies" before 1997, has plunged into serious
recession in 1998 following a prolonged monetary crisis. It still
has a long way to go to recovery because of the added
complications of the political turmoil sweeping the archipelago,
said economists.
</P>
<P>
With an average economic growth of 6 percent per annum for more
than 20 years, Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP) is
expected to contract about 14 percent this year. Some experts
predicted the country's economy would contract further in the
first half of 1999 before a recovery in the second half if the
general election promised for next June proceeded smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic performance over the past few decades has
ranked among the best in the developing world. However, the strong
overall performance masked a number of underlying structural
weaknesses which made the country vulnerable to adverse external
developments.
</P>
<P>
The impact of Indonesia's monetary crisis can be illustrated by
some distressing statistics:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia's per-capita GDP now stands at around 400 U.S.
dollars, down from a pre-crisis level of over 1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- More than 70 million people out of a population of 202
million have fallen below the poverty line. Some 30 million of
them will experience absolute poverty by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
-- Unemployment has risen substantially. Current estimates put
the number at 13 million. Underemployment is estimated at some 37
percent of the 90 million people in the labor force.
</P>
<P>
-- The market capitalization of the Jakarta Stock Exchange has
fallen from about 100 billion U.S. dollars in June 1997 to about
11 billion U.S. dollars now.
</P>
<P>
-- The local banking sector, with the exception of a few banks,
is in deep trouble. It was reported that at least 60 percent of
loans are classified as non-performing in local banks.
Restructuring costs may reach 25 billion to 30 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- Inflation is running at some 80 percent in 1998, more than
ten times over the level of 1996.
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly all companies find it extremely difficult to obtain
any source of funds, either local or foreign.
</P>
<P>
The deepening of the economic crisis has led to political
instability in the world's fourth most populous country. Severe
unemployment in the urban areas puts the country in social
distress.
</P>
<P>
To maintain stability and confidence in the national currency
(the rupiah), which started to drop sharply against the U.S.
dollar in the middle of July 1997, the country's central bank Bank
Indonesia from November sold between 1 million and 5 million U.S.
dollars daily to prop up the rupiah's stance against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the rupiah, which fell to 16,800 to the U.S.
dollars in May this year, is now hovering at around 7,500 to 8,000
rupiah. The rupiah traded at 2,400 to the U.S. dollar before the
monetary crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The disbursement of loans from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and some other
countries have helped to strengthen the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to arrest the country's economic crisis, the
Indonesian government has taken some important measures, such as
shifting the development priority from heavy industry to small and
medium-sized enterprises as well as cooperatives which could
absorb a huge labor force.
</P>
<P>
In a move to speed up the national economic recovery program,
Bank Indonesia has decided to extend liquidity credits totaling
10.8 trillion rupiah (1.46 billion U.S. dollars) to small-scale
businesses and cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
To revitalize the ailing banking sector by increasing banks'
capital adequacy ratios to 4 percent, the Indonesian government
has begun recapitalizing 70 out of the 166 national commercial
banks at a cost of 257.5 trillion rupiah (34.3 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Realizing the relative strength of the agricultural sector in
the economic crisis, the government has decided to give priority
to the development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the agricultural
sector is the only economic section which showed positive growth,
0.26 percent, in the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bambang Subianto said the government expected
the economy to grow by one percent or shrink by one percent in the
1999/2000 fiscal year starting April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The economic forecast is far more optimistic than expectations
of a three-percent economic shrinkage made by economists.
</P>
<P>
"Don't get too optimistic. It is a long road... Our recovery
will be slower than Thailand or South Korea, because we have to
balance social concerns as well as economic concerns," said Mari
Pangestu, director of the Jakarta-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
</P>
<P>
She believed that Indonesia's macro-economic health was
improving, with falling interest rates and inflation and a steady
rupiah. But the real economy remains a mess, especially the
shattered banking sector.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that most foreign investors would wait to see
what happened during the general election before contemplating a
return to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
An optimistic view on Indonesia for next year could only be
realized if the violent political landscape was brought under
control, said Sri Muluyani Indrawati, director of the Institute of
Economic and Social Research at the University of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Some economists predicted that the country need at least five
years to return to what the real GDP had attained in 1997.

<HEADLINE> DHAKA to Set Up 3 Readymade Garments Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
planned to set up three readymade garments (RMG) villages in
suburbs of Dhaka to shift hundreds of flourished factories within
the capital and Narayanganji city, The Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the establishment of the villages is to
relieve these two cities of the burden of 2,211 factories, which
were set up in an unplanned way in the congested residential
areas, the report quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are as many as 1,855 factories under the
Dhaka City Corporation demarcated area and 356 in Narayanganj,
more than 60 percent of them located in the residential areas.
About 1.4 million workers engaged in these factories are also
living in the cities in most unhygenic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The government took the initiative to set up these garments
villages in response to the demand of the garments factory owners
and to address the environmental concerns, they said.
</P>
<P>
"All types of logistics will be made available to the factories
at the villages so that the RMG industry can get further impetus,"
Minister of Commerce and Industries Tofael Ahmend stated.
</P>
<P>
He further said that his ministry would prepare a project
concept paper on the proposed garments villages, and it would be
sent to the Planning Commission for approval.
</P>
<P>
The construction work of the villages will start right after
getting the approval, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government formed a committee headed by a
high-ranking official of the Export Promotion Bureau for selecting
at least three sites outside Dhaka for the proposed villages.
</P>
<P>
After several field visits, the committee recommended Savar,
Ashulia and Sonargaon in the suburbs of Dhaka as the suitable
places of the villages, and the recommendations were submitted to
the Commerce and Industries Ministry last month.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Household Size Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Latest census figures show
the average household size in New Zealand fell marginally from 2.9
people per dwelling in 1986 to 2.8 people in 1996, Statistics New
Zealand said Friday in its media release.
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of one-person households, declining family
size, and fewer couple-with-children households, have all
contributed to the decline in household size. The trend in falling
household size has been evident in New Zealand for over 100 years,
declining from a recorded peak of 5.2 people per dwelling in 1886.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's total housing stock was over 1.4 million
dwellings at the time of the 1996 Census. This figure included
both private and non-private dwellings, unoccupied dwellings and
dwellings under construction.
</P>
<P>
The number of occupied private dwellings reached 1,276,332, up
almost 18 percent over the period from 1986 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-three percent of New Zealand dwellings are separate
houses as opposed to flats or houses joined together. The trend
over the decade to 1996 was an increasing proportion of separate
houses, and a corresponding decline in the proportion of flats.
</P>
<P>
The three-bedroom home remained the most common size, making up
almost half of all private dwellings.
</P>
<P>
However, the proportion of larger homes with four or more
bedrooms increased during the 1987 to 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the older population has led to more one-person
households, but younger people are also increasingly living alone.
By 1996, over six percent of people aged 30 to 54 years were
living alone, although the proportions remained higher for older
people, 22 percent of those aged 55 to 84 years, and 54 percent
of those aged 85 years or more.

<HEADLINE> Demonstrators Protest Against Bombing of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Anti-war demonstrators
across the United States on Thursday continued their protests
against President Bill Clinton's order to strike Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Anti-war activists held a rally outside the White House,
chanting "Hands off Iraqi Children" and "Stop the Bombing Now."
</P>
<P>
It was the second day of demonstrations. The protesters linked
the bombing with the impeachment of Clinton, with signs reading
"make love, not war," "impeach for bombing, not for sex," and "too
bad they don't impeach for mass murder."
</P>
<P>
In New York's Time's Square on Thursday, about 150 people
staged a rally, waving placards and chanting to protest the Iraq
bombing.
</P>
<P>
In Oakland, California, protesters held separate rallies to
oppose the bombing and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
About 75 anti-war demonstrators gathered in the plaza before
the Oakland Federal Building.
</P>
<P>
"We are outraged at what the U.S. military is doing in our name
to our brothers and sisters in Iraq," Cindy Pyle, a spokeswoman
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
After a vigil, the demonstrators entered the Federal Building,
carrying a coffin symbolizing dead Iraqi children and sang the
civil rights anthem "We Shall Overcome."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Concerned About Air Strike Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has been gravely
concerned about the air strike against Iraq by the United States
and Britain, the official radio said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has consistently opposed the use of force in the
resolution of international disputes, said the radio citing a news
release issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The release said any action towards a settlement of Iraqi
issues should be in accordance with the relevant U.N. resolutions
and on the basis of the principles of the U.N. Charter and not
through unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
The government of Sri Lanka urges the greatest restraint in the
situation and a return to diplomacy and negotiations, through
which Iraq could fulfill its obligations and the international
community could move decisively towards the review and removal of
sanctions placed on that country, the release concluded.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. to Build Economic, Trade Ties for New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
said on Thursday that the two countries should enhance cooperation
and take concrete measures to build a cooperative economic and
trade relationship in the 21st century,
</P>
<P>
The statements were made by Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Shi
Guangsheng and U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley when opening
the 12th session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and
Trade (JCCT) here.
</P>
<P>
Both officials indicated that improving the economic and trade
ties between China and the United States are not only in the
interests of both countries and peoples, but also conducive to
promoting economic prosperity and stability in Asia, and the whole
world.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that Sino-U.S. cooperation in trade and economic
affairs will be further improved so long as the two sides can deal
with some problems properly.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the normal trade relations, Shi told the meeting
that China welcomes the U.S. decision to change the term
"Most-favored Nation" (MFN) status into "normal trade relations"
because it can reflect the substance of giving each other an equal
treatment in trade.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Congress still conducted the annual review of
the status, said Shi. He stressed that this is not helpful to
Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations and the process should be
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's application for the membership of the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Shi rebuffed the accusations that
China is inactive, has not made enough offers in market access and
therefore is not qualified for the membership.
</P>
<P>
China, determined to join WTO, has not changed its attitude
and position, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
China's WTO membership is delayed all the time is because some
WTO members asked too much and the Chinese government cannot meet
their demands, he noted. "The responsibility is not on the Chinese
side."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official also rejected the proposal that Taiwan
join the WTO first, stressing, the idea is dangerous and
unacceptable to the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
In response, Daley said that China's membership in the WTO is
not only important to both China and the U.S., but also the world,
according to Chinese trade officials.
</P>
<P>
The secretary expressed his agreement with Shi on abandoning
the congressional annual review of a normal trade relations status
with China. He said that the U.S. administration is willing to
make more efforts to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
After the opening of the JCCT meeting, Shi also met Secretary
of Treasury Robert Rubin on a series of bilateral trade issues.

<HEADLINE> Latin America's Trade Deficit Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American trade
deficit will rise by more than four percent to 83.9 billion
U.S. dollars in 1998, a report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, which will be over four percent of the regional
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998, has risen from two percent
in 1996 and more than three percent in 1997, according to the
report "Preliminary Balance of the Latin American and the
Caribbean Economies in 1998", by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Cepal).
</P>
<P>
The effect of the world financial crisis and successive climate
disasters that ravaged several countries were reflected in a
deterioration of the external sector in most of the region, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The total value of the regional sales diminished on average by
more than eight percent, which reflected the drop in the prices of
basic products in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
The crisis started in Asia in the second semester of 1997 had a
decisive influence on this drop, which mainly affected raw
materials, mineral as well as agricultural.

<HEADLINE> India Forms Textile Market Intelligence Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- India's Textile Ministry has
set up an economic research and market intelligence unit (ERMIU)
for providing information relating to overseas textile markets and
competitors, Textile Ministry sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ERMIU will help the textile industry gear up in terms of
information to face the challenges of growing international
competition in the post-Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA).
</P>
<P>
The research unit is designed to work as a nodal center for
collection and dissemination of information on production, designs
and fashion and other market and trade developments in the area of
textiles.
</P>
<P>
With the operationalization of this unit based in the national
capital, the government, the trade and industry will have a single
source of data bank, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ERMIU would also conduct spot studies, surveys and analyses
and forecast market trends.
</P>
<P>
Such a move is significant since textile exports comprise
nearly one-third of the country's total exports basket and is one
of the few sectors showing positive export growth trends despite
the overall sluggish export situation, the sources stressed.

<HEADLINE> India's Trade Deficit Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit
widened by a whopping 94 percent in the first half of the current
financial year owing to sluggish exports and burgeoning imports,
The Observer of Business and Politics said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1998 exports suffered a steep fall of 6.89
percent while imports increased by 4.57 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports of merchandise amounted to 2,757 million U.S. dollars
in September this year, down from 2,961 million registered in the
same month 1997.
</P>
<P>
Imports, however, increased from 3,241 million dollars to 3,681
million.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in September was 924 million dollars as
against 281 million in the same month of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the first half of the current financial year (April
1, 1998 - March 31, 1999) totaled 16,261 million dollars, down by
4.91 percent from the level of 17,101 million recorded in the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the April-September period reached 21,282 million
dollars, rising 8.1 percent from the level of 19,686 million in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Dismal performance of exports and rising imports pushed the
trade deficit in the first half of the current year to 5,021
million dollars, a whopping 94.16 percent above the deficit of
2,586 million for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the total foreign investment in the country in
April-September was 718 million dollars, less than one-fourth of
the 3,032 million dollars received in the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that over the past two decades, the people of
the whole country have scored tremendous achievements in building
socialism with Chinese characteristics through emancipating their
minds and seeking truth from facts, hence attracting the worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
The achievements include the establishment of a basic economic
system with public ownership as the main one and the development
of the economy of various ownership systems at the primary stage
of socialism, Jiang explained.
</P>
<P>
As to the distribution system, Jiang added that China has
followed the system of distribution according to work as the major
form in addition to other forms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the socialist market-driven economy is being
introduced. The market has been playing an increasing role in
allocation of resources, while a new macro-control framework has,
by and large, taken shape. Important headway has been made in
rural and urban reforms. The economic growth mode is being shifted
from being extensive to intensive.
</P>
<P>
As to the opening-up to the outside world, Jiang said that the
result can be defined as "an all-round, multi-level, and
wide-ranging areas", with a big increase in foreign trade volume
and foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of the using of foreign capital
in supporting China's construction, added that the country's
economy is marching onto the world economic arena.

Jiang Zemin said that China has maintained a steady, fast and
healthy development of its national economy, and the productive
force, comprehensive national strength and people's living
standard have all been raised to a new high.
</P>
<P>
"China ranks in the forefront in the world in its output of
major industrial and agricultural products and has thus laid down
a more solid material and technological foundation for further
development of its economy and for its capability to resist
various risks," the Chinese leader said, adding that China has
basically solved the question of providing its 1.2 billion people
with adequate food and clothing, and it is entering and building a
well-off society.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that over the past 20 years, the Party has
properly handled various major internal and external issues, and has
stood the test of various difficulties and risks.
</P>
<P>
"Our practice has shown that the theory, line, program and the
series of principles and policies formulated since the 3rd Plenum of
the 11th CPC Central Committee are entirely correct," the Chinese
leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang summed up the experience over the past 20 years in 11
aspects, including adhering to the Party's Marxist line, firmly
pushing forward reform and opening up, safeguarding social and
political stability and unity, and strengthening and improving the
leadership of the Party.
</P>
<P>
Despite changes in the world situation and setbacks in the
world cause of socialism, socialism in China is still full of
vitality, and the Chinese nation stands towering like a giant
among other nations in the world, Jiang said.

Jiang asked the nation not to be self-satisfied with what
they have already achieved, because they still have long-term
objectives to realize.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country is still underdeveloped in economy,
culture, and its comprehensive national strength and
competitiveness are weak. In addition, there are mistakes and
shortcomings in the work of the Party and the government, which
the people are not satisfied with, and there will be difficulties
and risks in the road ahead.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the nation should work conscientiously and
never let the people down.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the Chinese leader called on the whole Party and
the people of the entire country to hold high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory under the strong leadership of the Party
Central Committee, implement the guidelines of the 15th National
Party Congress in an all-round way, and firmly advance along the
correct road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
pioneered since the 3rd Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee,
according to the president.
</P>
<P>
He called on them to continue their hard work to promote the
reform, opening up and the modernization drive, realize the
reunification of the motherland, promote world peace and
development and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation.

<HEADLINE> China's Sugar Market To Remain Sluggish Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Experts predict that China's
sugar market will remain sluggish next year due to continuing
weak domestic demand and low sugar exports.
</P>
<P>
The country's sugar prices have remained stable, but slackened
demand is expected to keep prices low next year.
</P>
<P>
China's sugar output was 8.1 million tons this year, up 1.3
million tons from last year. But annual domestic demand has
remained at a level of some 7.5 million tons over the past several
years, causing over-supply and a sudden drop of sugar prices this
year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the wholesale price of sugar had
dropped to 3,400 to 3,500 yuan a ton, but by late May and early
June this year, it fell still further to 3,000 yuan a ton in south
China.
</P>
<P>
To address this problem, the State Administration of Internal
Trade issued a directive calling on local authorities to
promote sugar sales and improve their storage systems.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, imports of sugar were further limited, sugar
imports from Cuba were forbidden, and the processing of sugar in
stock was encouraged by the state.
</P>
<P>
As a result, sugar prices rose somewhat, but no significant
change was registered.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the output of sugar-based material is
expected to hit 94 million tons next year, and the sugar output
will reach 8.2 million tons, 600,000 tons more than the domestic
demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A notorious Sri Lankan
underworld leader A.D.U. Ranjith, alias Sothi Upali, was killed
Thursday in the suburbs of Colombo, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police said a group of unidentified people had shot the victim
at least four times when he alighted from a bus at Bokundara
junction.
</P>
<P>
Quoting eyewitnesses, police said Upali was dragged into a van
to Mawithara and shot again.
</P>
<P>
Upali was accused of assassinating in April 1993 Lalith
Athulathmudali, former minister and leader of the Democratic
United National Front (DUNF). The DUNF is a breakaway from the
previous ruling United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
Sothi Upali had been identified as a supporter of the UNP and
recently the ruling People's Alliance has alleged that the UNP was
using him and others to create violence in the North Western
Province where Provincial Council elections are due next month.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Take All the Golds at Asiad Rowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to win all
the 11 gold medals at the Asiad rowing tournament, said Chinese
head coach Gao Hongyin after Friday's competitions at Pattaya.
</P>
<P>
Chinese rowers took all the five gold medals at stake on Friday
and that greatly boosted Gao's confidence.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation set us a target of winning 9 out of 11
golds at the Asiad and after today's competitions, we can say we
are set to win all the 11 golds," said Gao.
</P>
<P>
Before the competitions, Gao worried about the three events of
women's single sculls, men's lightweight double sculls and men's
lightweight coxswainless four-oars. But the results turned out to
be satisfying.
</P>
<P>
"It's great. My rowers put up a great performance today," said
Gao Hongyin, "Now we are on the right track to clean sweep the
Asiad rowing gold medals for the third time."
</P>
<P>
China won all the four rowing golds at 1982 New Delhi Asiad and
repeated that feat at 1990 in Beijing as they won all the 12
titles.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago at Hiroshima, China narrowly missed that target,
winning 11 out of 12 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"We suffered a severe defeat in the World Championship in
Germany earlier this year," said Gao Hongyin, "after that we held
a training camp in Guangdong and that proved very helpful."
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ma Junren who came to
Guangdong to give us lecture about his experiences of training.
That was very beneficial to us." Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren, the head coach of Chinese women's long-distance Ma's
Army, had led his runners to a string of stunning performances in
the past years. But none of his runners took part in the current
Asian Games and China failed to win a single long-distance gold
here.

Sanutkkao Sakchai of Thailand, who led the first 20 kilometers
with an unbelievable pace, retired at the 34km mark.
</P>
<P>
"I felt in top form when I came into the race," said Wang.
"The Thai walked so fast in the first half of the race. Although
I knew he would fade out later, I kept following him in an
unwise way which brought me two warnings."
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, I never lost confidence in my strength and stamina.
Without these two warnings, I would have won the title more
easily," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang's coach Song Shaoli said the victory had special meaning
to both the walker and him.
</P>
<P>
"This is Wang's first major competition, so is mine. We both went
through serious tests today although we need international
experience," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
Shao adviced Wang to pull away with 300 meteres to go but his
student did it with 700 meters.
</P>
<P>
"If I quickened the pace with 300 meteres before the finish
line, that would be too late," Wang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The French move to crack down
on global terrorist funding networks is getting massive
international support, according to reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
France claims it has the support of the entire Europe, the
Group of Eight, the Organization of American States and several
Asian and African nations, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
France made a unique proposal to the United Nations last month
to suppress global terrorist funding networks through an
international convention.
e
expected to commence by the end of February next year, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said it is believed that about 60 percent of global
terrorism activities were blocked by the U.N. convention on
bombing in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, since existing multi-lateral legal instruments do not
specifically address the issue of international financing of
terrorist activities, France through its proposal has emphasized
the urgency to enhance international cooperation on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The proposed convention calls on all nations to take steps to
prevent and counteract, through domestic measures, direct or
indirect financing of terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is fully supportive of the French initiative which
will become a legal instrument once ratified by 22 nations, said
the reports.
</P>
<P>
All signatory states are forced to cooperate with each other in
cracking down terrorism and refusing asylum to suspected persons,
the reports added.

the last way to solve the arms inspection crisis there.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq are the result of
the "Iraqi leader's unacceptable policy of refusing to fulfill the
obligations designed in the security council resolutions," said
the Foreign Ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia anticipates an early cessation of armed intervention
and hopes the intervention will lead to the realization of two
peace goals contained in security council resolutions: the
disarming of Iraq; and a guarantee that it will not produce or
acquire weapons of mass destruction in the future, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia hopes the U.S. and Britain will do its best to limit
civilian casualties while launching military action and at all
costs try to avoid causing a further deterioration of the
disastrous humanitarian situation in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China Receives 40 Boeing Aircraft in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China has taken delivery of 40
Boeing airliners this year, and these planes now account for more
than 70 percent of those bought by China, according to Boeing
China Company officials.
</P>
<P>
All major air carriers such as Air China and China Eastern Air
Group have received aircraft from the Boeing series this year. Not
long ago, Hainan Airlines, Xiamen Airlines and Shandong Airlines
created a record when they each received a Boeing aircraft within
the same 24 hour period, authorities said, adding that one of
every ten Boeing jetliners has been sold to China over the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
Boeing expected that China will need more than 1,000 airliners
over the next two decades, making it an aviation market with the
greatest potential in the world.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's largest civil aircraft manufacturer,
Boeing has been cooperating with China for the past 27 years. "We
hope this sound relationship will be further expanded," one
official said.
</P>
<P>
At the Zhuhai Airshow in November, the Boeing company
introduced a new type of jetliner -- the Boeing 717-200 with 106
seats -- to its Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
Boeing and China have also joined hands to manufacture airplane
components. At present, more than 3,100 Boeing aircraft now flying
are equipped with components made in China.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Appeal to Aid Bosman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A Belgian fund appealed some
5,000 first division players across the European Union to pay
their next win bonus into an account to benefit Jean-Marc Bosman,
according to fund officials here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The "Thank you, Jean-Marc Bosman" fund was established by the
Belgian charitable association "Sports and Liberties" on December
2.
</P>
<P>
Bosman's career was cut short after his former side Liege
refused to allow him to move to Dunkirk in France at the end of
his contract without a fee, leaving him effectively without a
club.
</P>
<P>
Although he won his case at the European Court of Appeal in
1995, it was too late to revive his career, and he is still
caught up in ongoing appeals in the Belgian courts.
</P>
<P>
However, his case benefited players across the European Union,
who can now move freely around EU member states,
</P>
<P>
According to "Sport and Liberties," the wages of professional
players have risen 40 percent since the Bosman case, but players
didn't spare a cent for Bosman now.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China's External Work Primarily Aimed to Strive for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, president and
general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, said here today that the primary task of China's
external work is for peace and to serve socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
It's a must to adhere to the independent foreign policy for
peace, and attach the prime importance to state sovereignty and
security, said Jiang, while addressing at the conference marking
the 20th anniversary of the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, persistent efforts should be made to build and
develop friendly, cooperative relations with all countries on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, persist in
policy of good neighborliness and friendship to promote relations
with neighboring countries and develop a sound environment with
its neighboring nations, Jiang noted. And it should always be
taken as a foothold of China's foreign affairs work to develop
friendly relations with the Third World or developing countries.
</P>
<P>
China would further improve and develop relations with big
powers, respect each other, seek common ground while reserving
differences, treat each other equally and work for mutual benefit
and cooperation, Jiang noted. Differences and disputes between
countries should be resolved through dialogues and
consultations.
</P>
<P>
With regard to all international affairs, the fundamental
interests of the people of China and the rest of the world should
be taken as the starting point in consideration, and China will
never yield to pressure from outside, and never form any military
alliance with any big power or power groups, or go in for military
blocs.
</P>
<P>
The world is varies and colorful, he said, the co-existence and
mutual-supplementing of the diversified culture forms important
conditions for promoting the world's growth and progress. And the
difference in history, culture, economy and socialist system
should not be the reason of confrontation and drifting apart
between countries, but a motive force for mutual cooperation and
common development.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to adhere to the fight against hegemonism,
safeguard the world peace, and strive to promote the establishment
of a just and reasonable international political, economic order,

further improved to provide a basic guarantee for the victory of
China's socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to stress the importance of theory of Deng Xiaoping,
the late Chinese leader who initiated the country's reform and
opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
"Historical experience of the past two decades tells us that
Deng Xiaoping Theory is a great theory that will guide the Chinese
people to the final success of the socialist modernization drive,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
In modern China, no theory but Deng's can provide a solution
for the issue of the future and destiny of socialism, he added.
</P>
<P>
He honored Deng Xiaoping Theory as "Marxism in modern China",
"inheritance and development of Mao Zedong Thought" and a "new
stage of development for Marxism in China".
</P>
<P>
"All Party comrades must unswervingly hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, take it as a powerful ideological
weapon in observing the world and seeking self-development, and
try to enrich and further develop this theory," said Jiang. "This
will be the most reliable guarantee for us to overcome any
difficulties on our path of advancement."

<P>
TIRANA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Albanian police seized 500
kilograms of hemp Wednesday, but failed to arrest the smuggler.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest amount of hemp the Albanian police have
ever confiscated at one time.
</P>
<P>
At around 4 a.m. local time (GMT0300), police stopped a van
doing a routine road check, the driver leaped from the truck
suddenly and ran away. The police then found 500 kilograms of
compressed hemp in the van. According to a license found in the
vehicle, police were able to identify the driver and were
initiating a search.
</P>
<P>
The hemp was estimated to have come from the Fierit region,
Albania's main hemp producing area. But the destination was
unknown, said police.
</P>
<P>
Hemp production has expanded recently in some coastline regions
in South-west Albania. The drug situation has further deteriorated

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader On Upholding Party's Basic Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- President and Communist Party
General Secretary Jiang Zemin today pledged to uphold the Party's
basic line and said the four cardinal principles should be
observed throughout China's modernization process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a grand gathering marking the 20th anniversary of
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee held
in Beijing, Jiang said the fundamental reason behind the
achievements of past 20 years is China's unswerving adherence to
the Party's basic line.
</P>
<P>
Practice has shown that in upholding the Party's basic line,
the most important thing is to acquire a comprehensive
understanding and correct handling of the relations between
economic development and adherence to the four cardinal principles
and reform and opening-up, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's economic development, four cardinal
principles, reform and opening up are mutually interdependent and
an inseparable whole, Jiang said economic construction is guided
by the four cardinal principles and in turn takes reform and
opening up as the powerful motive force.
</P>
<P>
China's reform and opening to the outside world takes as its
objective to further emancipate and develop productive forces,
strengthen and develop socialist system, said the president.
</P>
<P>
The four cardinal principles guide reform, opening-up and
economic development to advance along the correct direction, and
they will be enriched and developed with new fresh experience to
be drawn from new practice, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Deviating from the central task of economic construction, all
development and progress will lose their material basis and,
without the four cardinal principles and reform and opening-up,
economic development will lose its bearing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang reiterated that the Party's basic line,
including the "one central task, two basic points", must be upheld
unswervingly for one hundred years. Only the entire modernization
process is permeated with these principles, can China move from
victory to victory, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Social Productive Forces Be Given Top Priority: Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, General Secretary
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
stressed today that productive forces constitute the ultimate
dynamics in social development and their development is the
fundamental task of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also Chinese President, made the remarks while
delivering a speech at a conference marking the 20th anniversary
of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee
held at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
"The principal contradiction of our socialist society has
always been the one between the ever growing material and cultural
demands of the people and the backward state of social
production," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"That requires us to pay all the more attention to and
consistently stick to developing productive forces," he said, "if
productive forces ceased further progress, the consolidation of
socialist system and stability of the state would be confronted
with great difficulties, and the advantages of socialism would
then lose the most fundamental economic source."
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the nation to seize all possible opportunities and
make full use of favorable conditions to develop productive
forces. He stressed that the development in discussion should be a
sustainable one that coordinates speed with efficiency, and takes
into account such elements as resources, environment and
population.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also emphasized the role of science and education in the
development of a socialist economy. He said economic construction
should rely on progress of science and technology, and on
improving the quality of labor force.
</P>
<P>
"Human beings are the most vital elements among the productive
forces," he said, "importance should be attached to both the
upgrading of material production and the improvement of the
quality of human beings."
</P>
<P>
"We shall make judgement of our work on the basis of the
following criteria, that is, whether it is conducive to advancing
socialist productive forces, whether it is conducive to
strengthening comprehensive power of our socialist state, and
whether it is conducive to improving people's life standards"
Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: China to Open Wider to Outside Unswervingly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China will continue to open wider to the
outside world unswervingly and further perfect related policies
to promote the open-up.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks at a grand meeting here
today to mark the 20th anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of
the 11th CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that history has proved that China can not
develop without contact with the world, thus opening up is the
natural choice for China's modernization and the fundamental
national policy that China must observe for a considerably long
period of time.
</P>
<P>
However, China is a developing socialist country with the
world's largest population, Jiang noted. He said "We must never
rely on others to promote economic construction. In stead, we must
maintain independence, keep the initiative and develop the country
through our own efforts."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized, China must open its door to the
outside world to absorb and make full use of foreign capital, and
advanced technology and operational and management models.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China should combine its outstanding
cultural traditions with the fruits of foreign civilizations, make
full use of both domestic and foreign markets and resources, and
link up economic construction with opening up.
</P>
<P>
All this will surely become powerful motive force for the
country's socialist modernization drive, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that in the process of opening up, China must
always safeguard its state sovereignty and economic and social
security, ward off and minimize the potential impact of
international risks and the influence of decadent thoughts and
life styles.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Urges End to Military Action Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria on Thursday urged a
quick end to the U.S. and British military strike against Iraq and
called for a peaceful solution to the weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mikhailova said Bulgaria regretted
that the efforts made by the international community had failed to
resolve the dispute and was very concerned over the situation.
</P>
<P>
She said that despite the appeals by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, Iraq still refused to fulfill the resolutions adopted
by the U.N. Security Council and supported by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British forces in the Gulf launched the first wave of
air strikes against Iraq early Thursday after Richard Butler,
chairman of the U.N. Special Commission on disarming Iraq,
reported that Baghdad had not cooperated fully with weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, U.S. B-52s, American Navy jets and British
Tornado bombers struck for the second time the targets in Iraq
aiming to smash the country's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova also said that Bulgaria would keep a close eye on
the Gulf and, if necessary, the state's security council will meet
to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the left parliamentary group led by the Socialist
Party on Thursday released a statement, saying the U.S.-British
air strikes against Iraq violated the U.N. Charter, the Bulgarian
Telegraph Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Science Choses Top Ten Discoveries For 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Science, the journal
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has
selected this year's top 10 discoveries or advances in the field
of science and technology, the Associated Press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
the top 10 are as follows:
</P>
<P>
1, A group of international astronomers announced this year
that their measurements of light from a supernova proved that all
the matter in the universe was separating at a faster and faster
rate.
</P>
<P>
2, Scientists identified timekeeping genes in fruit flies, mice
and bacteria. They said that such genes may determine why many
organisms, including humans are alert in the day time and sleepy
at night.
</P>
<P>
3, Discovery of the structure in the nervous system that allows
chemical signals to flow at the rate of 100 ions per second from
one neuron to another. It is conducive to fundamentally understand
how the nervous system works.
</P>
<P>
4, Scientists in Japan proved that the elusive subatomic
particle known as neutrino has weight. This suggests that neutrino
could make up a sizable percentage of the mass in the universe.
</P>
<P>
5, Scientists accomplished the sequencing of the entire genetic
pattern of a complex animal Caenorhabditis eleganz. Genes for
other microbes including syphilis, tuberculosis and typhus were
also mapped.
</P>
<P>
6, Scientists from U.S. and England showed that quantum
information about a particle could be teleported from atom to
atom. This discovery may eventually lead to the development of
ultra-fast quantum computers.
</P>
<P>
7, Advances in Developing biochips and micromachines that can
perform complex biological functions such as test blood for cancer
or separate DNA from a specimen.
</P>
<P>
8, Advances in chemistry now allow the screening and testing of
millions of chemical combinations within a short time. This
technique will speed drug development.
</P>
<P>
9, Discovery of drugs that can prevent cancer or attack the
disease in new ways.
</P>
<P>
10, Scientists found that some forms of auto-immune disease,
such as arthritis, can be caused by the body's battle against
infections by bacteria and viruses.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: China to Advance Reform, Opening-Up Unswervingly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China will continue to advance its reform and
opening up unswervingly.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks here at a grand meeting to mark the 20th
anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
pointed out that the history of the past 20 years proved that "the
implementation of the reform and open-up policy was a historic
policy decision which determined China's fate."
</P>
<P>
He said: "The reform and opening up is the most striking
character of China in the new era. Without the reform and open-up
policy, China would not start the process of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that the reform is a process of
self-improvement and development of the socialist system, which
encourages the development of productive forces and all-around
development of various undertakings.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform is aimed at better serving the interests of
the people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang explained that the reform is a unprecedented event
without any experience to follow. Bringing forth new ideas must be
encouraged in the implementation of reform so as to accumulate
experience in practice.
</P>
<P>
The president said China should stick to those policies proved
to be correct and give up those proved to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
He suggested to solve minor problems before dealing with major
problems in an effort to avoid social instability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that urban reform should be combined with rural
reform, economic restructuring be combined with political
structural reform and domestic reform combined with opening up, in
a bid to let them benefit from each other.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Public Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin fully
affirmed here today the ownership structure China adopts which
stresses the leading role of the socialist public ownership and
the co-ordinated development of economies under diversified
ownership.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a grand gathering marking the 20th anniversary of
the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), Jiang, also General Secretary of the CPC
Central Committee, noted that China is a socialist country and
must stick to the ownership system with the public ownership as
its main body.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang said, it is important to adhere to the
co-ordinated development of diversified economies and to
encourage and guide the healthy development of non-public
ownership economies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, the public ownership is the basis of China's
socialist economic system, and the non-public ownership
economies are important component parts of China's socialist
market economy. China's economy can not be called a socialist
economy if the public ownership is not made the main component.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also stressed the importance of the principle of
distribution -- to each according to his work, noting that
equalitarianism is not socialism, and the polarization between the
rich and the poor is also not socialism.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, it will be China's long-term policy to let some
people in some regions first become wealthy through honest and
hard work, to help achieve common prosperity of the whole country
and common wealth of the whole Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Breakthrough in Generating Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China expects to generate
1.335 trillion kilowatt-hour (kwh) of electricity and develop an
installed generating capacity of 250 million kilowatts (kw) this
year, which would rank the country second in the world in both
categories.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the China State Power Corporation told
Xinhua today that China has made historic breakthroughs this year
in electricity generation, investment practices, operating
mechanisms and management systems.
</P>
<P>
He said it is remarkable that the country's power generation
has maintained an annual average growth rate of 6.2 percent for
five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
It took the country only a few years to increase its installed
generating capacity from 100 million kw to 200 million kw, he
added.
</P>
<P>
And, for 10 years running, large and medium-sized generating
units with capacities ranging from 10 million kw to 15 million kw
have been put into operation annually.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 16 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities directly under the central government have met
their targets of making electricity available to every village
under their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 95 percent of the country's rural population
should have access to electricity by the turn of the century.

PANAMA CITY, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-american

<P>
The IDB loan has a 20 year maturity term, with a six year grace

However, the province also has the poorest population of
Panama, multiple ethnic groups, fragile ecosystems, inadequate
infrastructure and weak community organizations.

<HEADLINE> China's Clock, Watch Industry Facing Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China's clock and watch
industry, which accounts for 60 percent of the world's clock and
watch business, now faces difficulties on both the domestic and
international markets.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country produced 210 million clocks and 370
watches, but customs statistics show watch exports increasing
seven percent with earnings down two percent from the previous
year. Clock exports grew 30 percent, but earnings were up only 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestic sales of clocks and watches in the first half also
declined one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, the downturn is the result of the
relatively poor quality of domestic products due to lack of
advanced technology and equipment, and the growing competition
from overseas manufacturers as almost all major foreign clock and
watch manufacturers have subsidiaries in China.
</P>
<P>
But, local analysts are still not pessimistic about prospects
of China's clock and watch industry. They base their optimism on
the huge potential of the domestic market and the large number of
professionally trained personnel. They are also looking at
industrial improvements worldwide as an opportunity.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia Reaffirm Oil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi
Arabia here Thursday reaffirmed their commitment to reduce their
respective crude production starting with the volumes agreed on in
Vienna last June.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Ali I. Naimi, Venezuelan Energy and
Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta and Mexican Energy Minister Luis
Tellez also called upon the other oil producing countries to
comply in full with their commitments.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to adopt "immediate actions" to discuss
with the other producers additional measures "that will translate
into a bigger reduction of the inventories and the improvement of
the prices of crude," which are at their lowest level of their
history.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed during their meeting that "the rigorous
compliance of the commitments implies a reduction that will start
at the volumes agreed on in March of 1998" in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The three countries reaffirmed their individual commitment with
the reductions accorded in June in Vienna: 725,000 barrels a day
for Saudi Arabia, 525,000 for Venezuela, and 200,000 for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that Venezuela, "taking into account that
Saudi Arabia and Mexico have announced their decision to extend
the reduction agreements until the end of 1999, and sharing the
same spirit and resolution, will assume immediately the necessary
decisions to extend its production restrictions until December of
1999."
</P>
<P>
The Brent crude barrel for delivery in January closed at the
same price as Wednesday, 10.93 dollars, after having reached a
quotation of 11.36 dollars in the first hour of the morning as the
first reaction to the United States and United Kingdom joint
attack to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But oil prices plunged again on Thursday, as Iraqi crude
exports remained unhurt by U.S. missile attacks and there are no
new measures of the trio for supply cuts, oil sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A grand meeting marking the
20th anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is being held in
Beijing this morning.
</P>
<P>
The third plenary session was held in the Chinese capital
between December 18-22, 1978.
</P>
<P>
Plenums of the CPC Central Committee are usually held
annually. The third plenum introduced a series of important
decisions which represented a turning point in the history of the
CPC and New China since its founding in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The plenum not only marked the beginning of China's socialist
reform and opening-up drive, but also adopted the following Party
principles:
</P>
<P>
-- Emancipating minds, seeking truth from facts, and uniting as
one on the road forward. Deng Xiaoping introduced the principles
during a work conference held in advance of the Plenum;
</P>
<P>
-- Resolutely criticizing the erroneous policy of
"two-whatever's" and praising the nationwide debate over the
criterion for truth.
</P>
<P>
Hua Guofeng, former chairman of the CPC Central Committee,
introduced the policy of "firmly upholding whatever policy
decisions Chairman Mao made and unswervingly adhering to whatever
instructions Chairman Mao gave" following the downfall of the Gang
of Four in October 1976.
</P>
<P>
The "two whatever's" prevented correction of mistakes Mao
Zedong made in later years, and sheltered theories, slogans,
principles and policies which prevailed during the "cultural
revolution" (1966-76), as well as the wrongful judgment against
Deng Xiaoping.

<P>
-- Decisively eliminating the concept of "taking class struggle
as the key link" which is inapplicable to socialist society and
rejecting the erroneous theory of "continued revolution under the
dictatorship of the proletariat." The focus of the Party's work
and the attention of people throughout the nation was shifted to
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The event also marked the first time since 1957 that the Party
issued the clear decision to shift its focus of work.
</P>
<P>
-- Investigating major cases in which people were falsely
charged or wrongly sentenced in the Party's history and solving
issues related to the merits and faults of prominent national
leaders.
</P>
<P>
New members were added to the central leading group, and the
100-member CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was
elected. The second generation of central leadership with Deng
Xiaoping at the core came into existence. The plenum also
introduced:
</P>
<P>
-- Reform of the centralized economic management system and
readjustments to the seriously imbalanced national economy, as
well as the introduction of advanced technology and equipment from
other countries to promote development of the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
-- Placing priority on developing agriculture and taking full
advantage of the initiative of millions of farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese and foreign
specialists at a recent international seminar in Beijing said that
more environmentally-friendly cars need to be used in China as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
They said that cars powered by natural gas need to replace the
existing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The exhaust of automobiles has been one of the main killers of
urban Chinese, as the number of automobiles in cities grows 10
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
China should learn from developed countries where more
environment-friendly vehicles have been developed in recent
years. Natural gas can help reduce the amount of harmful exhaust a
great deal while fuel expenditures are cut by 40 percent, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the China Science and
Technological Development Fund, the Gao Shiqi Fund, and an Italian
company.

MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen Filipinos were
evacuated from Baghdad Thursday in the wake of U.S. air strikes
against Iraq, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Most Mexican newspapers
Thursday criticized the U.S.-British attack on Iraq in their front
pages.
</P>
<P>
The La Jornada newspaper said in its editorial that
U.S. President Clinton ordered the attack on Iraq "without the
sanction of the United Nations and without any other argument but
a self-assumed and false representation of the international
community."
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper, El Sol de Mexico, said Clinton's decision to
attack Iraq had a political motive: to prevent an impeachment
hearing demanded by the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
"The cost to maintain the presidency by Clinton will be too
much this time. To launch an attack against the country that has
been in the last eight years the lifesaver of his mandate,
corresponds to limited vision," added El Sol de Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The El Dia newspaper said in its editorial that the
demonstration of force against an unarmed population by the United
States with the collaboration of the British government is an
attempt to divert public attention from the "Sexgate" scandal.
</P>
<P>
The ghost of Monica Lewinsky that threatens to take Clinton to
an impeachment trial made him choose a unilateral military answer,
said El Dia.

LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- US based communications group
NTL has emerged as the mystery bidder stalking Premier League
football club Newcastle United.
</P>
<P>
The media and telecommunications group, which is the UK's
third largest cable company, has bought a 6.3% stake in the club
in what may be the first step towards a 160 million pounds
takeover.
</P>
<P>
The deal could end the involvement of the Hall family in the
club. Former club chairman Sir John Hall has ploughed millions of
pounds into Newcastle United in recent years to help restore its
fortunes. However his son Douglas was shamed earlier this year
after insulting fans and Newcastle's leading players.

NTL has come to an agreement with Cameron Hall Developments
(CHD), the Hall family's business, which could see it buy a
majority stake in the club.
</P>
<P>
American Barclay Knapp, president and chief executive of NTL,
said he was confident the takeover would go ahead.
</P>
<P>
However on the stock market Newcastle shares were down 2p to
100p, well below the potential offer price of 111.7p, reflecting
investors scepticism that the deal will be concluded.
</P>
<P>
The cable group said that no decision on whether to mount a
takeover bid would be made until the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, the UK's competition watchdog, rules on BSkyB's
attempt to buy Newcastle's rival Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Once the ruling has been made public, NTL will have 12 weeks
time to ponder its move into the world of football, according to
its contract with CHD. If the deal goes ahead, Cameron will get
81 million for its 50.8% share, a price some analysts believe to
be on the high side.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between CHD and NTL is binding on both companies
until March, but could be extended if the takeover deal is also
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to welcome NTL as a shareholder. Recent events
at Newcastle United have created uncertainty for the company and
the club," said the club's chief executive, Freddie Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
"The board believes today's announcement is an important step
towards securing the long-term success of Newcastle United," he
said.

CARACAS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela opposes the use of
force to solve problems that occur between the governments of
various peoples, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli
Rivas said here on Thursday, referring to U.S. attacks against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Burelli Rivas made this statement at the National Cemetery in a
ceremony marking the 168th anniversary of the Liberator Simon
Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to the use of force and violence to solve the
problems that emerge among people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore what is happening, and we want this conflict to be
solved soon, because it is already a repetition that threatens to
extend to other countries and other regions," said Burelli Rivas.
</P>
<P>
He said Venezuela is hopeful the conflict could be solved in a
friendly way without the need to use weapons or any other kind of
violence.
</P>
<P>
Burelli Rivas said the consequences of this conflict on
Venezuela were of concern because with the globalization of all
societies, what happens in any one place in the world, has
repercussions everywhere.

<HEADLINE> Incoming U.S. House Speaker Admits Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Incoming speaker of the
U.S. House of Representatives Bob Livingston told House
Republicans Thursday night that he has on occasion strayed from
my marriage.
</P>
<P>
However, Livingston spokesman Mark Corallo said Livingston has
no plans to resign.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Livingston said, "These indiscretions were not
with employees on my staff, and I have never been asked to testify
under oath about them."
</P>
<P>
Members of the Republican rank-and-file emerged grim-faced from
a closed-door caucus. Corallo said, "There has been no talk of
resignation. The Republican Conference is solidly behind" the
speaker nominee.
</P>
<P>
Livingston's statement alleged there were "individuals working
together with the media" investigating his personal background to
exploit during the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"When I did an early interview with the media after announcing
my candidacy for speaker, I told a reporter that I was running for
speaker, not sainthood. There was a reason for those words," his
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the tremendous trust and responsibility my
colleagues have placed in me and because of forces outside of this
institution seeking to influence the upcoming events and/or media
coverage of these events, I have decided to inform my colleagues
and my constituents that during my 33-year marriage to my wife,
Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed from my marriage and doing so
nearly cost me my marriage and family."
</P>
<P>
Livingston, 55, was nominated without opposition to succeed
Newt Gingrich as speaker in November.
</P>
<P>
Livingston has refused to preside over the impeachment debate
about President Bill Clinton's role in the Monica Lewinsky affair,
but he was on the speaker's dais Thursday for House consideration
of a resolution supporting U.S. troops carrying out air strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Livingston is scheduled to be elected speaker when the 106th
Congress convenes on January 6.
</P>
<P>
Livingston's marital infidelities were first disclosed by a
Capitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call, which also predicted that
Livingston would offer a resign.

BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 persons were
killed and 75 others injured in Baghdad alone in the U.S.-British
military actions against Iraq, Iraqi Health Minister Umeed
Madhat Mubarak said on Thursday.
</P>

After two rounds of U.S.-led strikes, Mubarak told reporters

<P>
ROME, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Italian Football
Federation (FIGC) Luciano Nizzola was officially investigated as
a part of an ongoing probe into soccer doping here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officers from Italy's finance police arrived at the FIGC's
Rome headquarters early at 9:00 a.m. to notify him the
investigation by two magistrates.
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely calm and serene for two reasons: firstly,
because as I've shown over many years I am a serious person and
secondly because I have full faith in the judiciary," Nizzola
said.
</P>
<P>
Nizzola's predecessor, the current UEFA and FIFA
vice-president Antonio Matarrese, and the head of the FIGC's
anti-doping commission Carlo Tranquilli were similarly notified.
</P>
<P>
The probe is looking into alleged irregularities which were
discovered by a raid at the Roman laboratory of the Italian
Olympic Committee (CONI).
</P>
<P>
Magistrates ordered the closure of the lab which is used to
test soccer players for banned substances after matches in
October this year.

Five lab staff were fired and the head of CONI, Mario

<P>
GENEVA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Swiss soccer giant
Grasshoppers sacked coach Rolf Fringer in Zurich on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the dismissal but the club officials
have been openly disappointed in the team's performance this
season.
</P>
<P>
The title defender ranked second behind Servette in this
year's standings.
</P>
<P>
Fringer began coaching Grasshoppers last year when Christian
Gross moved to Tottenhan Hotspur.
</P>
<P>
Despite he guided the Zurich club to last season's league
title, he was unpopular due to its failure to advance through the
qualifying round into the Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
Before joining the Zurich club, Fringer had an unsuccessful
experience as coach of the Swiss national team when he failed to
qualify for the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Roger Hegi, who resigned as coach of relegation-threatened St
Gallen last week after the Swiss league shut down for the winter
break, is expected to be named Fringer's successor within a few
days.

<P>
HANGZHOU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The health department in east
China's Zhejiang Province has recently published the first
official reports on AIDs, saying that efforts will continue to be
focused on preventing the fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
The province reported in 1985 its first person with HIV who had
got the virus from imported blood used to treat his hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, altogether 95 people with HIV have so
far been found in the province, 10 of whom have died of AIDs.
Eighty percent of the infected people are below the age of 30, the
transmission of blood and sexual activities are said to be
responsible for 45 percent and 19.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is one of the first places in China to start
preventive measures, and local governments have got involved in a
public awareness and monitoring campaign.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have stepped up measures to control
prostitution and drug-related activities, but local experts fear
that the actual number of HIV carriers may be much larger than is
reported, because 90 percent of the victims who were discovered
had never heard of the illness until they were found to be
carrying the deadly virus.

UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security

<P>
Emerging from the closed-door meeting, the president of the

</P>
<P>
The Council is scheduled to resume discussion on the Iraqi
crisis at 1030 a.m. (EST) on Friday, the president of the
15-member Council, Buallay said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the
United Nations, told reporters that a draft resolution is being
circulated among the Council members.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held the Thursday session at the request
of the Russian U.N. Mission, which, together with China, is
strongly against the U.K.-U.S. military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have said that the military strikes on Iraq
are nothing but a violation of the U.N. Charter and the norms of
international law.
</P>
<P>
China and Russian both held chief U.N. arms inspector Richard
Butler responsible for the turn of the situation in Iraq as
Butler's report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Baghdad
failed to fully cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors, which London
and Washington saw as an excuse to launch the military action.
</P>
<P>
Butler, shortly after the Council began the closed-door
consultations on the latest development on Iraq on Thursday
afternoon, defended his report as "objective and factual."
</P>
<P>
Butler also argued that the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM in charge of disarming Iraq, did not serve the U.S.
interests. "It danced to nobody's tune," he said.

Madeleine Albright has been informed that Russia has recalled its
ambassador in response to the U.S.-British air strikes against
Iraq, State Department spokesman James Rubin said on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Moceanu Eager to Compete Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Although her legal
struggles are far from over, U.S. Olympic gold medalist Dominique
Moceanu is moving forward with her life.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic gymnast plans to get back to the gym after
spending the past two months in court.
</P>
<P>
"I'm psyched," said Dominuque, 17. "I've been doing a lot of
thinking. I want to give it a shot. See if I can get former coach
Luminita Miscenco and work things out."
</P>
<P>
The girl, who was a member of the U.S. team for the all-around
title in the Atlanta Games in 1996, has quit practice since
October. She involoved into a loud, head-to-head argument between
her father Dumitru and Miscenco.
</P>
<P>
The fight led Dominique to win legal independence from her
parents on October 28 and get a protective order against her
father on December 9.
</P>
<P>
Now, Dominuque wants to concentrate on gymnastics. She has no
coach or place to train, although she would like to rehire
Miscenco.
</P>
<P>
USA Gymnastics President Bob Colarossi and Dominique talked in
phone today.
</P>
<P>
"We're excited to have her back," Colarossi said. "We'll do
anything we can do to help her within the realm of what we can
do."
</P>
<P>
USA Gymnastics gives Dominique $1,000 a month for training
expenses.
</P>
<P>
Dominique is the only female gymnast still competing from the
team that won the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
She plans to compete in the World Championships in 1999 and
the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to let anything bother me anymore. I've been
hurt too much," she said.

<HEADLINE> Fast Growth Rate Expected for Shanghai's Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area of
Shanghai is expected to have a 17-percent growth rate this year,
Hu Wei, the deputy head of its managing committee, said recently.
</P>
<P>
This is based on the economic development of the first 10
months. Its GDP was 54.8 billion yuan by the end of October, up
16.3 percent from last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
Its industrial output value grew 15.6 percent to 114.2 billion
yuan and investment in fixed assets jumped 35.9 percent to 37.6
billion yuan in the first 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Pudong had an 18.1-percent rise in exports to 3.6 billion
U.S. dollars worth, and overseas investment contracts totaled 2.75
billion U.S. dollars, up 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hu attributed Pudong's sustained rapid economic growth in spite
of the Asian financial crisis mainly to the fast development of
its pillar industries, various markets, foreign-funded firms, and
foreign trade companies.

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Thursday spoke to Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on phone
and rebuffed Primakov's demand that the U.S.-British attack on
Iraq be called off.
</P>
<P>
Gore spoke to Primakov at President Bill Clinton's request to
explain the U.S. rationale for sending cruise missiles at Iraqi
targets after U.N. weapons inspectors concluded Baghdad had ceased
cooperating with them, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed Iraq in depth and acknowledged that there
were "deeply held" views on the matter, said a U.S. official, but
added: "It was not a testy exchange."
</P>
<P>
"The vice president repeated the U.S. position, which is that
U.S. military action will continue until the objectives have been
achieved," said the official, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Moscow said Primakov demanded the United States
halt the air strikes, which he condemned as a "crude violation" of
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain started the "Desert Fox" operation on
Wednesday. Other two permanent members, China and Russia, of the
U.N. Security Council opposed and condemned the military action
while France regreted for the attack.

BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here today that it has promised to help Georgia collect taxes and
fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
Urgent measures are needed to achieve tangible results in

the disbursement of funds earmarked for Georgia by the EU, as well
as loan finance from the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The EU also expressed its support for the fight against
corruption in Georgia which is "an additional element in releasing
funds of international donors". The enforcement of concrete
measures to fight corruption is also a condition for the
disbursement of an EU food security grant.
</P>
<P>
Georgia is an important recipient of aid and assistance from
the EU, the European commission, EU's executive body, said.

BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here today that it has made a decision on the failure by some
European Union (EU) member states to communicate implementing
legislation for a EU regulation dealing with polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs).
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the commission will notify reasoned
opinions to Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal and
the United Kingdom in a bid to streamline the legislation of the
member states on "the decontamination or disposal of equipment
containing PCBs and/or used PCBs in order to eliminate them
completely on the basis of the provisions of the directive
concerned.
</P>
<P>
EU member states were required to adopt the necessary
legislation by a deadline of March 16, 1998, said the commission,
the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The commission is looking for a way to ensure that EU member
states put into place the necessary legislation to give effect to
the directive of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
PCBs covers several hazardous chemicals which represent a
particular threat to the environment because of their toxicity,
persistence and tendency to bio-accumulate.

<HEADLINE> EU to Help Azerbaijan Improve Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Thursday that it has granted exceptional aid of 11 million
European Currency Units to Azerbaijan for improvement of
investment.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes Azerbaijan is not just a recipient of aid but
an important regional partner, a potentially major energy producer
and a transit country for trade and communications between Europe
and Central Asia via the "Caucasion corridor".
</P>
<P>
The EU and Azerbaijan held their Fourth Joint Committee meeting
on Wednesday to discuss means of improving the business climate in
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the central Asian nation urgently
needs the resources and know-how that European investors can
bring, not just in the energy sector but throughout the economy,
according to the European Commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The commission sources said important measures now need to be
taken to help companies to operate in Azerbaijan under competitive
and transparent conditions in all sectors of the economy,
comparable to those in other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
The Joint committee has agreed to set up a special working
group which will monitor these matters. The EU commission said it
has offered assistance to Azerbaijan on this issue and also for
its application to join the World Trade organization.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, the EU said it will consider whether further
resources can be made available to help Azerbaijan mitigate the
effects of the Russian crisis.

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Disregarding Democrats'
objection, U.S. House Republican leaders Thursday insisted on
starting debate on articles of impeachment against President Bill
Clinton on Friday despite the continuing U.S. airstrikes against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly object to this matter coming up tomorrow or the
next day or any day in which our young men and women in the
military are in harm's way," said Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to know when the troops will have completed
their mission," said Representative Bob Livingston, the incoming
House speaker. "We cannot refrain from advancing the people's
business on this critical issue."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day the Senate majority leader ruled out a deal
to spare the president a Senate trial. "We will go to a trial and
there won't be any deal making," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said on an interview with CNN.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Dick Armey announced that talks with
Democrats would continue in hopes of finding agreement on a longer
debate time.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Clinton told reporters he didn't think
proceedings on the floor would undercut his ability to carry out
the military mission.
</P>
<P>
The House was originally scheduled to debate four articles of
impeachment against the president on Thursday, including perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power, but postponed the
debate in the wake of the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says Success Achieved in Desert Fox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Thursday U.S.-Britain air strikes had
severely damaged Iraqi targets while there was no casualties on
the American and British side.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing at the Pentagon, Cohen said that damage
assessment from an earlier first round of ship-fired cruise
missiles showed good results.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, told reporters that among targets hit were barracks of
President Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guards, anti-aircraft
facilities, airfields and military command-and- control centers.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no American casualties and we are achieving
good coverage of our targets," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"Our targets include Iraq's air defense system, its
command-and- control system, airfields and other military
infrastructure and facilities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shelton, announcing that more than 50 targets were attacked by
well over 200 Navy Tomahawks in the initial round of raids,
produced enlarged photographs of Iraq's military intelligence
headquarters and a headquarters and Republican Guard barracks in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, Cohen said that he was satisfied with the
"Desert Fox" action because preliminary reports showed his forces
had achieved a "good measure of success" in hitting Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told a U.S. TV show that Iraqi air defense and command
targets were damaged in the first wave of strikes on Iraq.
However, the United States was not ready to declare total success.
</P>
<P>
The first spy satellite and spy plane photographs examined by
Pentagon officials this morning were sketchy, Cohen said, but he
was "impressed with the accuracy" of the strikes.
</P>
<P>
About the civilian casualties in Iraq, Cohen responded curtly
to Iraqi claims that civilian targets were struck by stray cruise
missiles: "We've got the right targets."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the targets, hit by guided cruise missiles launched
from ships and anti-radar missiles launched from Navy EA-6B
fighters, were all military in nature and that the Pentagon sought
to avoid civilian casualties. The United States was not trying to
kill Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein as part of the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Army troops and 35 aircraft were en route to the
Persian Gulf region Thursday, Cohen said. The troops are bound for
Kuwait where they will join 3,000 U.S. soldiers already on hand in
the unlikely event Iraq strikes out in response to the air
assault.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes are expected to be over by this weekend, when
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins. But Cohen said the U.S.
military presence in the Persian Gulf will remain as long as Iraq
remains a threat.

<HEADLINE> Riyadh Holds Iraq Responsible for Air Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia expressed
deep concern Thursday over the policy adopted by the Iraq regime
in dealing with the United Nations, which has led to the ongoing
U.S.-British military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Press Agency (SPA) quoted an official as saying that
Riyadh "was following up with greater concern and regret
developments in Iraq and flare-up of bombardment operations
because of Iraq's failure to cooperate with the U.N. weapons
inspectors."
</P>
<P>
The official said that the kingdom has previously expressed in
several occasions its concern towards the Iraqi policy and
creation of crises by the Iraqi regime which would result in the
extension of the Iraqi people's sufferings and putting the
stability and security of the region at stake.
</P>
<P>
He said that Saudi Arabia has no way but to show its full
sympathy with the Iraqi people and hope the current military
operations would not result in losses among innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Riyadh also hopes that Baghdad rescinds its policies and
resumes cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors in order to
halt the military strike as soon as possible," the official added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Islamic world was about to observe the holy month
of Ramadan, which Riyadh hopes would give diplomatic efforts a
chance.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Plunge as Iraqi Exports Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- World oil prices plunged on
Thursday, as Iraqi crude exports remained unhurt by U.S. missile
attacks and three key producers meeting in Madrid produced no new
measures for supply cuts.
</P>
<P>
International benchmark Brent slumped to close $1.27 a barrel
lower in London at $10.09 a barrel, wiping out an 80 cent gain
made on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prices fell back as the United Nations confirmed on Thursday
that Iraqi oil exports had escaped the military onslaught. Some
1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of Iraqi crude exports under a
U.N. humanitarian program continued loading normally.
</P>
<P>
Selling pressure swelled as oil ministers from key producers
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico failed to agree on new
output cuts in their latest meeting to tackle the oil price
depression.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid meeting produced agreement only to abide rigorously
by existing output cuts, with Venezuela also extending its cuts
commitment to the end of 1999, matching Saudi Arabia and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Caracas had warned before the meeting that it could not
consider pledging extra cuts as its new government prepares to
take office in February.
</P>
<P>
But the lack of new action will disappoint analysts and other
OPEC producers who have called for extra cuts of 1.5 million bpd
to rebalance the glutted market.
</P>
<P>
Oil traders did not discount the possibility that Iraq supplies
could still be disrupted as military action resumed on Thursday
with U.S. and British air strikes.
</P>
<P>
However, the lack of immediate impact to oil supplies refocused
the attention of oil traders to the huge oil stock glut that only
last week pushed Brent prices down to a 12-year low of $9.60,
spurring the producer trio meeting.

<HEADLINE> EU's Real Agricultural Income Falls in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The real agricultural income
of the European Union (EU) dropped 3.9 percent in 1998, compared to
2.7 percent decline in 1997, this was revealed today by the
Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.
</P>
<P>
The report said the income decline of the EU-15 can be
attributed in most part to the combination of six aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- fall in the average price of final agricultural output in
real terms of 4.7 percent. This stems mainly from a marked fall in
real prices for animals, averaging -12.3 percent with pig prices
tumbling -26.1 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- only a small rise in output volumes with a increase of 1.0
percent of final agricultural output. Underlying this were
moderate hikes in volumes of crop output (+0.8 percent) and animal
output (+1.3 percent);
</P>
<P>
-- a notable fall in the real value of intermediate
consumption, down 4.0 percent in 1997. This reflects a fall of 4.9
percent in real prices and sightly increased volume (+0.9
percent);
</P>
<P>
-- a sharp fall of 6.2 percent in the real value of subsidies;
</P>
<P>
-- depreciation nearly unchanged in real terms over 1998;
</P>
<P>
-- and a slowdown in the rate of decline in the volume of total
agricultural labor (-1.6 percent compared to -3.8 percent in the
average of 1990 to 1996).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the euro-zone's real agricultural income decreased
2.5 percent in 1998. However, the Eurostat says, across the
15-nation EU, the level of real agricultural income still remains
about 12 percent above the average of 1990 and 1991.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Extends Mandate of U.N. Mission in W. Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution, giving a green
light to the extension of the 410-member U.N. Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until January 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council made the decision after considering a
report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said that the
extension is crucial to facilitate more dialogue on the ground
to pave the way for the referendum, an important part in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Council's decision came after Annan paid a visit to Western
Sahara region, and countries in the region in a bid to iron out
difficulties in the long-stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
With its current mandate due to expire on Thursday, the U.N.
Mission has been helping carry out a U.N. plan for a referendum to
decide whether the former Spanish colony should be incorporated
into Morocco, which controls most of the territory, or become
independent, as sought by the Polisario Front.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, originally set for January 1992, has been
repeatedly delayed, mainly due to disagreements between the two
sides over who should be eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
The latest difficulty has been over some 65,000 members of
three disputed tribal groupings that Morocco says should be
allowed to participate in the referendum, for which the latest
tentative target date is December 1999.

<HEADLINE> Butler Defends His Report on Iraq as Objective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler on Thursday defended his report on Iraq's
level of cooperation with the United Nations as objective.
</P>
<P>
Butler, Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, reported on Tuesday that Iraq failed to cooperate
fully with the U.N. inspectors in the past month, which led
directly to the U.S. military strikes against Iraq on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Butler said his report on Iraq's level
of cooperation was based on the fact and the report was clear,
honest and objective.
</P>
<P>
The chief U.N. weapons inspector said he consulted with other
inspectors in the field before drawing the report and the
conclusion was supported by them.
</P>
<P>
He said at this time, his mandate was to say whether Iraq had
cooperated fully or not, and the answer is Iraq did not.
</P>
<P>
Butler has been under diplomatic attacks after the U.S.
military strikes against Iraq. During the open debate on U.S.
military strikes against Iraq held Wednesday night, some members
of the Security Council of the Untied Nations suggested that
Butler resign or be fired.

<HEADLINE> Butler Says He Has No Plan to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms
inspector Richard Butler on Thursday said that he "absolutely" has
no plan to quit despite he came under fire from such Security
Council members as China and Russia at the Council's late-night
session on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In answering a question of whether he has planned to quit, he
said, "absolutely not."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks just as the Security Council is about to
begin consultations on Iraq at the request of the Russian U.N.
Mission.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arms inspector was criticized at the Security
Council for his failure to consult with the Council before making
a decision to pull his staff out of Iraq. Under the relevant rule,
UNSCOM, subordinated to the Security Council, should seek approval
from the 15-member Council before making any crucial decision.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of disarming Iraq, still insisted that his report,
presented to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, has made "a
correct conclusion" that Iraq failed to fully cooperate with U.N.
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia held Butler responsible for the turn of the
situation in Iraq as his report was not factual by saying that
Iraq offered no full cooperation with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, said late on Wednesday that the current Iraqi crisis is
artificially made. Later, the Russian Government in Moscow openly
demanded Butler should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he argued that UNSCOM did not serve the U.S.
purposes and interests, saying "It dances to nobody's tune."
</P>
<P>
As long as Iraq can offer full cooperation, UNSCOM can resume
work on the ground, he said, adding that "but it is in the hands
of the Security Council," which he was accused of pushing aside
when he reached a unilateral decision to withdrawal his staff out
of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Respects Freedom of Worship: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni reiterated that Uganda is a secular state which
respects freedom of worship by all the religions in the country
as long as they do not break the law.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks while opening the ninth Uganda
Muslim Youth Congress here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He told the delegates that the government does not interfere
in religious affairs nor does it allow the various religions to
interfere in the affairs of the state.
</P>
<P>
Wherever there are conflicts in religious groups, the
government only comes in to ensure maintenance of law and order
or simply to give advice.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the Ugandans not to stigmatize the Moslem
community and said that those who commit bad acts do so as
individuals and belong to various religions.
</P>
<P>
The Moslems were called on to unit together and keep faith and
nationhood separate.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said Moslem youths should acquire skills that will
enable them to get employment and advised Moslem authorities to
set up technical schools to facilitate the acquisition of skills
by Moslem youths.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese President Luong Meets Chinese Vice President Hu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice President
Hu Jintao on Thursday called for a 21st century-oriented
relationship of long-term stability, good-neighborliness and
friendliness and comprehensive cooperation between China and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who made the call during a meeting with Vietnamese
President Tran Duc Luong, said the profound sentiments of
friendship cultivated personally by the leaders of the older
generation of the two countries, have taken root in the heart of
the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of the new generation of the two countries should
carry on the traditional friendship and strive for the
establishment of a 21st century-oriented relationship of long-term
stability, good-neighborliness and friendliness, and comprehensive
cooperation," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Vice President, who arrived here on Wednesday
morning and attended an informal summit meeting between ASEAN and
China, Japan and the Republic of Korea and that between China and
ASEAN later in the day, also spoke highly of the achievements made
by Vietnam in carrying out the renovation and opening-up policy
and briefed Luong on China's reform and opening-up over the past
20 years.
</P>
<P>
Hu congratulated Vietnam on its successful holding of the sixth
ASEAN summit and the above-mentioned informal summit meeting,
saying the meetings had demonstrated the East Asian countries'
strong determination to overcome the lingering financial crisis
and restore economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Luong agreed to Hu's view over the relations between China and
Vietnam. He said Vietnam and China are friendly neighbors and that
the friendly relations between the two countries should not only
be maintained but also be consolidated and boosted.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, Vietnam and China should make joint
efforts to implement the consensus reached by the leaders of the
two countries. The leaders of the two countries reached consensus
on signing the land border treaty before the year 2000, and
conclude the demarcation of the Beibu gulf by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Luong praised the great achievements China has made since the
country carried out the reform and opening-up policy, and its
contributions to stabilizing the economic and financial situation
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese president expressed his country's wish to draw
on China's useful experience so as to promote Vietnamese socialist
cause.

<HEADLINE> Blair: Iraqi Raids not Linked with U.S. Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair told
the British parliament Thursday afternoon that overnight strikes
on Iraq were successful and had nothing to do with U.S. domestic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
At the time when he spoke, Blair said that British tornado
warplanes were in action over Iraq and overnight strikes by U.S.
cruise missiles had hit their intended targets.
</P>
<P>
"The operation is now continuing and, as I speak, British
Tornado aircraft are engaged in action," Blair said in a statement
to the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the goals of the American-British strikes were
achievable and proportional to the threat posed by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
First reports on Thursday night's strikes by U.S. sea-launched
cruise missiles suggested they were successful and inflicted the
kind of military damage sought, he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair received a murmur of support from MPs when he denied
suggestions that the strikes were somehow linked to the internal
affairs of the United States. "I refute this entirely," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, he said, "has shown the courage to do the
right thing and he has my full support."
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt at all that action is fully justified now.
That is my own strong personal view. I know that President Clinton
reached the same conclusion for the same reasons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, Blair explained that the imminent Ramadan, the month of
fast in the Muslim world, was taken into consideration in deciding
the timing of the raids.
</P>
<P>
"We were immensely sensitive to the imminence of Ramadan and
very reluctant to have to start a military campaign during Ramadan
out of our respect for Muslim sentiments," he said. "On the other
hand, waiting until after Ramadan would give Saddam a month to
prepare. It would be highly risky in military terms and likely to
reduce significantly the effect of our attacks."

HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- African Regional Labor
Administration Center (ARLAC) has urged African countries
governments to use labor administration as a tool for development
and make it more responsive to the needs of its member states.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon held Thursday for the donor community in Harare,
ARLAC Chairperson, Florence Chitauro said her organization, whith
a membership from 18 English-speaking African countries, is
reponsible for undertaking studies and research in all aspects of
labor administration.
</P>
<P>
"These activities address both policy issues and practical
problems in the area of labor standards, employment and
industrial relations," said Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
On ARLAC's 25th anniversary in 1999, she said, the
organization will explore today's topical issues of child
labor, women empowerment and gender equality at work, poverty
alleviation and civil service reforms.
</P>
<P>
"In executing these programs, ARLAC needs additional resources
and technical and financial support of other countries and
organizations that are equally interested in these areas," she
said.
</P>
<P>
ARLAC was established in 1974 as a project of the
International Labor Organization and the United Nations
Development Program for the development of labor.

KUWAIT CITY, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic World
Association (IWA) Thursday expressed deep concern Thursday over
the U.S.-British military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabia-based organization called for respect of the
memorandum of understanding reached between Iraq and the United
Nations last February, in which Iraq pledged full cooperation with
U.N. arm inspectors.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the IWA Secretary General Abdullah Al-Obeid
urged Iraq to implement all the U.N. Security Council resolutions
related to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the repercussions of the U.S.-British
military strike would not only affect Iraq but the Islamic world
as well.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the Iraqi leadership to spare the Iraqi
people of the hardships of wars and warned it against "favoring
personal interest and exposing the Iraqi people to danger."
</P>
<P>
It appealed to the United States for respecting the feelings of
Muslims ahead the holy fasting month of Ramadan, which begins this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain began cruise missile strikes against Iraq
about midnight Wednesday to punish what was alleged as its failure
to fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent) Republicans Reported Considering to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Republicans are considering
a plan to start impeachment proceedings on the House floor
beginning Friday, with action on four articles of impeachment to
be finished Saturday, media reports quoted congressional sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
These sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Republicans were discussing a plan to allow 16 hours of debate for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The historic debate had been set for Thursday, but Republicans
agreed to a postponement Wednesday after President Bill Clinton
ordered airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
House Democrats have asked for a halt to impeachment
proceedings until the air campaign is over in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in history to face impeachment
proceedings on the floor of the House, and the first since Andrew
Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
A formal announcement on a new schedule for the impeachment
proceedings is expected later in the day, perhaps after a
closed-door meeting of the Republican leadership.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet Again on Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council is expected to meet again at 3:30 p.m. (EST) Thursday on
the Iraqi crisis at Russia's request, Russian Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Sergei Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
The council first debated the latest developments around the
Iraqi crisis late Wednesday after the world was shocked by the
U.K.-U.S. military action against the Mideast country. But no
resolution was submitted when the council closed its Wednesday
meeting on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov, whose Wednesday request led to the late-night session
of the 15-member Security Council, condemned the use of force
against Iraq, saying that the "unprovoked act of force" by the
United States and the United Kingdom violated the principles of
international law and the principle of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
"There was now a threat to the international order, and the
council had to decide what steps had to be taken to restore
international law," the Russian ambassador said late Wednesday at
the end of the council's open debate.
</P>
<P>
Russia, together with China, lashed out at the military action
against Iraq and called for an end to such an action.

<HEADLINE> 1998 Global Surface Temperature Highest in Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The earth's global temperature
in 1998 will be the highest since 1860, according to the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO).
</P>
<P>
The global mean surface temperature is estimated to be 0.58
degrees centigrade above the recent long-term average based on the
period 1961-1990, said the WMO in its "Annual Statement on the
Global Climate" made public here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the 20th consecutive year with an above normal
global surface temperature," it said. "The previous warmest year,
1997, was 0.43 degrees above average."
</P>
<P>
It noted that the 10 warmest years have all occurred since
1983, with seven of them since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The regional temperature patterns (January through November)
show all of the continents with above average temperatures, except
the northern sections of Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, higher in the atmosphere, where regular measurements
are made by instruments on weather balloons and satellites, record
high temperatures also occurred.
</P>
<P>
From the surface to seven kilometers altitude, record
temperatures in 1998 were 0.47 degrees higher than the average of
the last 20 years, making 1998 by far the warmest year, said the
WMO. In the lower stratosphere, 1998 was colder than usual, though
not quite as cold as in the 1995-1997 period.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Continues to Influence Climate in 1998: WMO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The slowly fading El Nino event
continued to influence the climate in 1998, causing drought and
flooding around the world, said the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The current El Nino, starting in 1997, resulted in extremely
dry conditions and fires in Indonesia, drought in Guyana and Papua
New Guinea, and extensive flooding in Ecuador, Peru, and Kenya
early in 1998, said the WMO in its "Annual Statement on the Global
Climate."
</P>
<P>
It said that devastating floods in China were linked to the
final stages of the EL Nino. Preliminary estimates show that 22
provinces of China suffered from severe flood disasters. An area
covering 8.5 million hectares was affected with a record number of
rivers and lakes flooded.
</P>
<P>
The central equatorial Pacific warm El Nino waters gave way to
colder than normal sea surface temperatures (La Nina condition) by
mid-year, it said. The switch to La Nina conditions was associated
with extremely heavy rains in the West Pacific triggering
landslides and floods in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
El Nino contributed to the late start of the 1998 Atlantic
Hurricane season which, under the influence of La Nina, ended as
one of the deadliest in history with 14 named storms.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Mitch triggered massive flooding and landslides in
late October that killed over 9,000 people, displaced another 2.4
million, and damaged or destroyed over 130,000 homes in Central
America.

<HEADLINE> Israel on Alert Following U.S. Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel decided Thursday to
deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles as a precaution following the
U.S. air strike against Iraq overnight, saying it was not part
of the conflict but Israel reserved the right to retaliate if Iraq
attacked it.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military intelligence said the possibility that Iraq
targets Israel with Scud missiles to retaliate for U.S. strikes
was remote, but the army was kept on alert and Patriot missiles
and radar tracing systems detecting any incoming missiles were
ready.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who had held a
series of consultations with his senior aides since the
U.S. launched the air strike at around midnight Wednesday,
canceled a visit to Greece scheduled for this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Mordechai had hoped to visit Greece as
scheduled since it would be his first official visit to the
country, which is concerned over Israel's increasingly close ties
with Turkey, with whom it has territorial dispute over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the radio, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel has no intention of
being involved in the showdown between the U.S. and Iraq, but
insisted that it retained the right to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
"We are not part of this conflict," he said. "We have no
intention of becoming part of this conflict but we are prepared
for every possibility... we retain the right of self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles armed with conventional warheads
at Israel during the Gulf War in 1991 and Israel fired Patriot
missiles and intercepted most of them.
</P>
<P>
Civilians were suggested Thursday that they keep their
business as usual but make preparations by updating their gas mask
kits. About 65 gas mask distribution centers were opened in the
day and an additional 65 would open at night.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the panic during the Gulf crisis in February
when people waited on long line outside the mask distribution
centers, life on the streets is normal and people are calm.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, thousands of Palestinians protesting the air
strike clashed with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank, leaving one
Palestinian dead and several others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah and other West Bank towns,
clashes broke out as Palestinian protesters, who burnt Israeli,
U.S. and British flags, set fire to cars and threw stones at
Israeli soldiers, who fired rubber bullets in return.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Ismail, a 20-year-old Palestinian, died in hospital after
being injured in the clashes in Ramallah, Jerusalem Media and
Communications Center, a Palestinian news service, reported. Five
others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The death and the ongoing U.S. air strike are likely to
trigger new violence in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hopes Peace, Stability to Prevail in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is awaiting further
reaction from the United Nations on the recent developments in
Iraq and hoping that peace and stability will prevail in the
region to the benefit of Iraqi people, Cyprus government said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the air strikes by the United States and Britain
against Iraq, Cyprus' government spokesman Christos Stylianides in
a written statement called on Iraq to comply with all resolutions
of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political parties in Cyprus have issued statements
criticizing the combined U.S.-British attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched the first round of punishing
missile attacks midnight Wednesday allegedly to contain President
Saddam Hussein and his ability to use weapons of mass destruction
to threat his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides expressed the hope the Iraqi crisis would not
affect developments at the Security Council, which is expected to
approve a resolution on the Cyprus issue later this month.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has submitted to the
Security Council his report on the situation in Cyprus as well as
a letter on his good offices mission.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides also reiterated the Cyprus government's pledge to
abide by international laws and the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led efforts to reunite Cyprus have so far yielded no
results.

<HEADLINE> German Growth to Slow to 1.7 Pct in 1999: Ifo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- German economic growth will
likely slow to 1.7 percent next year compared with an annual
average growth of 2.8 percent in 1998, a leading German institute
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a massive downward correction of an earlier economic growth
forecast, the Ifo economic research institute said the economy was
expected to grow by only 1.7 percent next year, compared with a
forecast of 2.3 percent in late October by Germany's leading
economic institutes.
</P>
<P>
Ifo cited economic difficulties in Asia, Russia and Latin
America as having a detrimental effect on German exports.
</P>
<P>
Ifo said the number of unemployed in Germany was expected to
fall by nearly 250,000 to around 3.9 million -- or 10.3 percent --
by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
On an annual basis, 4.275 million people were jobless in
Germany this year, representing a quota of 11.2 percent, compared
with 11.4 percent in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Oil Exports Continue in Iraq, U.N. Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is going ahead
with the oil for food program despite London and Washington
launched military strikes on the country Wednesday, a U.N.
spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Hans von Sponeck, told the executive
director of the Iraq Program, Benon Sevan, from Baghdad Thursday
morning, "Oil exports are continuing normally. A ship berthed at
the Mina Al Bakr platform in the south of Iraq this morning and is
loading oil, and operations are continuing at the port of Ceyham
on Turkey's Mediterranean coast."
</P>
<P>
Sevan, who is also the U.N. security coordinator, has been
contacting with the humanitarian coordinator, Sponeck, through
Wednesday night and Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"With the withdrawal of the independent inspection agents it's
likely there are humanitarian supplies being held up," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The inspection agents authenticate and certify arrival -- they
left the port of Umm Qasr and the border crossing with Syria and
Jordan," he said. "There are seven still on duty at Zakho at the
border with Turkey."
</P>
<P>
"However, there are stocks of food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies in Iraq," he said. "In the 15 governorates
in the Center and South of Iraq, the distribution of supplies is
carried out by the Iraqi government with the United Nations
carrying out a detailed observation process."
</P>
<P>
When the bombing started Wednesday night in Iraq (local time),
U.N. staff moved into the corridor on the ground floor of the
building where it was judged they would be safest, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For the first few hours, the explosions were in other parts of
town but about three o'clock there were three very loud explosions
apparently close to the U.N. building," he said.
</P>
<P>
After a cold and obvious restless night, U.N. staff woke
Thursday morning to find that their local colleagues, including
the people who run the cafeteria in the building, had come to work
despite their own problems.
</P>
<P>
The 134 U.N. international staff in Baghdad spent Wednesday
night and Thursday in the main U.N. building, a converted hotel,
in a suburb of Baghdad, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led military action against Iraq, launched without the
authorization of the United Nations, was seen as a violation of
the principles of the U.N. Charter and the norms of international
law.

<HEADLINE> German Research Organs See No End to Russian Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Leading German economic research
institutions said Thursday that no end to Russia's economic and
financial crisis is in sight due to a lack of effective
counter-measures.
</P>
<P>
The lack of trust in Russia's economic planning both at home
and on markets abroad had reached "disastrous proportions," said a
joint report released Thursday by the DIW German Institute for
Economic Research (Berlin), the Institute for Global Economy
(Kiel) and the Institute for Economic Research (Halle).
</P>
<P>
It was wrong to seek a solution to the problems by printing
more money, the institutes said. What was needed was confidence in
the rouble and a clearly defined economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast that Russia's economic output would fall by
about 5 percent next year, while the annual inflation would exceed
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the unemployment quota had risen to 11.5 percent
last September, while poverty was on the rise due to households
having less money available. It said one-third of the population
was now living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Russian economic policy had at no time satisfactorily dealt
with the necessary change from a planned economy to a
market-oriented one, the three institutes said. Necessary reforms
had been instituted either not at all or only half-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
Existing political pressures made it unlikely that unpopular
measures to overcome the crisis could be carried out.
</P>
<P>
One of the central factors in the crisis was that public
budgets had not been reformed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
If taxes had been effectively collected, the consolidated state
budget in recent years would have shown surpluses, while in fact
tax arrears as of August 1 this year amounted to 235 billion
roubles, or 6.6 billion dollars, the institutes said.

</P>
<P>
The UAE is worried about the losses of life and property that
may be caused by the strikes on Iraq, WAM quoted a Foreign

The UAE urged the Iraqi government to resume cooperation with

</P>
<P>
He reiterated the UAE's consistent position of respecting
Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes early Thursday morning
shortly after the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Starts Second Wave Air Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Britain started their second wave of air strikes shortly after 11
a.m. EST (early evening in Baghdad) by sending cruise missiles
deep into Iraq, a senior defense official here said.
</P>
<P>
Navy strike aircraft with laser-guided bombs targeted Iraqi air
defenses along the border, the official added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the sea-launched cruise missiles and
laser-guided bombs dropped by F-18s flying off the USS Enterprise,
Air Force B-52s were en route to cruise missile launch points in
the Persian Gulf, the defense official said.
</P>
<P>
The laser-guided bombs being dropped by the Navy F-18s and Air
Force F-16s are among the most accurate weapons in the U.S.
inventory and are being used against targets such as command
bunkers, buildings and weapons storage sites where accuracy is at
a premium.
</P>
<P>
The first wave, launched Wednesday night, only began the
degradation of Iraq's air defenses needed to reduce the risk for
U.S. and British combat aircraft flying over Iraq, according to
two senior defense officials.
</P>
<P>
Sketchy spy satellite and U-2 spy plane photographs indicated
that the first wave of strikes hit home, but defense officials say
that even if the strikes are successful, the U.S. military will
have to remain on patrol in the Persian Gulf indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"We've laid out very carefully the targets," Defense Secretary
William Cohen said Thursday in a round of broadcast interviews.
"We've looked at the so-called integrated air defenses. We've
looked at his (Saddam Hussein's) surface-to-air missile sites. We
have looked at his military intelligence headquarters and other
types of facilities, and those will be on the target list and it
will be a very strong and sustained attack against those types of
targets."
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Army troops and 35 aircraft were en route to the
Persian Gulf region Thursday, Cohen said. "The troops are bound
for Kuwait where they will join 3,000 U.S. soldiers already
stationed there."
</P>
<P>
The air strikes, dubbed "Operation Desert Fox," are expected to
be over by this weekend, when the Muslim holy month of Ramadan
begins. But Cohen said the U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf will remain as long as Iraq remains a threat.
</P>
<P>
"This is a long-term effort," he said. "It's not going to
happen overnight."
</P>
<P>
The targets, either struck so far or on the list for what is
billed as a sustained air campaign, include Iraqi surface-to-air
missile batteries and control centers, military headquarters,
military intelligence headquarters and missile production
facilities, Cohen said.
</P>

said other targets will include "the things... (Saddam) uses to
guard his facilities," implying the elite Republican Guard forces
would also be hit.
</P>
<P>
The "serious and sustained" strikes described by Cohen,
however, are not expected to eliminate Saddam's arsenal or end the
need for a massive U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Once the dust settles, the situation will remain much as in has
been since the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to degrade (Saddam's) capacity to threaten his
neighbors with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and the
means to deliver them," Cohen said at a Pentagon news conference.
"We're not seeking to eliminate it."
</P>
<P>
So, after the strikes, the U.S. forces will remain ready for an
indefinite period of time "to maintain our presence," Cohen said.

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
closed 40 of its embassies in Africa for the next two days as a
precautionary measure because of military action in Iraq, U.S.
officials said Thursday.
</P>

At around 10 p.m. local time (1900 GMT), big explosions could

The U.S., together with Britain, started airstrikes against
Iraq Wednesday afternoon (Washington time).
</P>
<P>
Republicans continued to question Clinton's decision to launch
airstrikes against Iraq on the eve of the planned impeachment
processings against Clinton in connection with the Monica Lewinsky
affair, which was postponed for a day. But, although some
expressed bitterness toward Clinton, they joined with Democrats in
approving the resolution praising U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt called the resolution
"the right thing to do on this important day."
</P>
<P>
"Any suggestion that this action (the airstrikes) has been
affected by the impeachment debate one way or the other is
blatantly false," Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution before the House did not address the issue of
timing. Instead, it notes that thousands of U.S. military
personnel are in the region, along with British troops and the
support of allies.
</P>
<P>
"Congress and the American people have the greatest pride in
the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and strongly
support them in their efforts, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
"The Congress unequivocally supports the men and the women of
our armed forces who are carrying out their missions with
professionalism, dedication, patriotism and courage," it said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also claimed that it should be U.S. policy "to
support efforts to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to
promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger Thursday described its air strikes against
Iraq starting Wednesday night as the strongest military action
since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"It is the strongest military strike against Saddam Hussein
since the Gulf War and I believe it will send a very powerful
message to him," Berger told an interview with CNN.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes, dubbed "the Operation Desert Fox," was a very
different operation to the 1991 Gulf War when Saddam invaded
Kuwait, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's air strikes has killed at least five Iraqis and
injured 30 in Baghdad, many suffering from burns and shrapnel
wounds, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Berger argued it was inevitable there would be civilian
casualties in such an operation.
</P>
<P>
Berger refused to speculate on the length of the operation,
just saying, "We have a very clear mission here -- to degrade
Saddam Hussein's capacity to produce and to deliver weapons of
mass destruction and his capacity to threaten his neighbors."
</P>
<P>
"We know what our targets are that we seek to destroy, and we
will systematically attack those targets," he added.

BUCHAREST, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The members of Romania's
diplomatic mission in Baghdad will be temporarily evacuated to
Amman, capital of Jordan, said a release issued by the Romanian
government Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If need be, they will be brought back to Bucharest, the release

Initially, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Carmen Podgoreanu said

Presenting the official stand on the issue at a press briefing,

"We hope the military actions will bring about small pains, as
we also hope Iraq will honour its international pledges so that

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Backs Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder Thursday backed U.S. and British air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The use of military force is the result of Saddam Hussein's
stubborn refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapon inspectors," said
Schroeder in a statement during a visit to German intelligence
headquarters in Pullach near Munich.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Saddam had known the international community
would not accept his actions. "He thus carries responsibility for
the actions of the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no question regarding our solidarity with... our
alliance partners, the United States and Great Britain," declared
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Bonn, Schroeder's spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said
Iraq had been warned over the implications of failure to comply
with U.N. inspections.
</P>
<P>
Heye said Bonn regretted military measures had become necessary
and he expressed the hope the strikes would soon end.
</P>
<P>
Cautious backing also came from Schroeder's Green coalition
partner.
</P>
<P>
Green Party defense expert, Angelika Beer, termed the strikes
as "risky but understandable." In a Deutschlandfunk radio
interview she regretted the strikes had not been carried out under
a U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
Beer expressed doubt over whether air strikes would do anything
to stop Baghdad's programs for developing biological and chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of the spread of weapons of mass destruction can
only be dealt with through controls and verification measures --
not through air strikes," she said.
</P>
<P>
Beer also complained the U.S. and Britain had not given Bonn
any advance warning before the strikes began.
</P>
<P>
The Greens have strong pacifist roots and have called for
dissolving the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
Germany's conservative opposition also backed the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) foreign policy spokesman Karl
Lamers called the strikes "justified."
</P>
<P>
CDU deputy parliamentary leader and ex-Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe said, "The Christian Democratic alliance in parliament backs
the military action of the U.S. and Britain against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Opposition came only from the Party of Democratic Socialism
(PDS), which termed the strikes as a "terrorist" assault on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, police boosted security at the city's numerous
American and British installations including the Rhine-Main U.S.
airbase, the U.S. and British consulates and American banks.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Condemns U.S.-British Airstrikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Belarus fully coincided with
Russia's position on opposing U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq,
said Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who is on a working visit in Moscow, told a new
conference after meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin that
the reason for which such a strike has become possible is a
"monopolar character of the world."
</P>
<P>
"There is neither balance, nor counterbalance, nor deterring
factors," said Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he noted, the U.S. side behaves as a master, and
a bad master at that. There has been no pretext now for dealing a
strike at Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said that various measures may be taken to resolve
the situation, ranging from military maneuver to tough diplomatic
pressure that was exerted also by Russia. However, the show of
strength is highly undesirable, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian president also criticized the U.S. and other
Western countries for their attempt to exert pressure on Belarus
to change its determination to unite with Russia and other former
Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's meeting Lukashenko and Yeltsin discussed a wide
range of economic and political matters.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be satisfied all-round in the Russian-Belarussian
relations. There is a certain stalling in the implementation of
several accords and agreements," said the Russian president's
deputy chief of staff Sergei Prikhokdo.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to hold another meeting with a broader
attendance in Belarus by the end of December.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese New Government Wins Parliament's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese newly formed
government Thursday won the vote of confidence in parliament,
showing that the new cabinet was formally of 116 parliament members who
were present at the parliament session voted for the statement
while 31 against it.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member cabinet was formed by Prime Minister Designate
Salim Hoss early this month following the resignation of former
prime minister Rafik Hariri. Hariri served over the past six years
under former president Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, a veteran economist and politician, was well respected by
the country's various factions and had been premier for three
times during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
In his 18-page statement, Hoss outlined steps to be taken to
tame the ballooning public debt and huge budget deficit, the two
most difficult economic problems he inherited from the former
government.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Lebanon's public debt will reach 18
billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1998, surpassing the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The average budget deficit in the first 11 months of this year
stood at 41.6 percent of expenditure.
</P>
<P>
However, the budget deficit last year witnessed a record high
of 59 percent of expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also put stable monetary policy as a priority of his
government agenda.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) - U.S. B-52s, American Navy jets
and British Tornado bombers struck targets in Iraq on Thursday in
a second wave of strikes aimed to smash the country's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
A senior British air force officer told a news conference in
London all the British planes had returned safely to their base in
Kuwait and he was not aware they had come under Iraqi fire.
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense officials in Washington said B-52 bombers, each
capable of firing 20 long-range cruise missiles took off from the
British Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia while U.S. Navy planes
conducted raids from the aircraft carrier Enterprise in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Sirens reportedly sounded twice in Baghdad over the space of
three hours on Thursday evening but there was no immediate
anti-aircraft fire or indications of bombing in the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen was quoted by Reuters as
saying in Washington that U.S. missiles and bombs severely damaged
Iraqi targets in the initial raids on sites including military
intelligence headquarters and anti-aircraft weapons.
</P>
<P>
"I've seen some of the (reconnaissance) photos this morning and
some of the targets that we have looked at appear to be severely
damaged," Cohen said on television earlier on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf was quoted as
saying that the overnight cruise missile attacks had caused "heavy
casualties and collateral damage."
</P>
<P>
Missiles had hit the security police and military intelligence
headquarters buildings in Baghdad, he said, without giving details
of damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad radio reported that the home of one of Saddam's
daughters, Hala, was hit in the missile attacks but she was not
there at the time.
</P>
<P>
British officials said the initial attack, dubbed operation
"Desert Fox," was aimed at destroying Iraq's anti-aircraft systems
in order to facilitate later bombing runs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the first objective was "to
make sure we do everything possible" to hit Iraq's air defense
systems.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said more than 200 aircraft and 20 warships,
including 15 B-52 bombers, were deployed in the Gulf region
carrying more than 400 cruise missiles and other bombs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, anti-aircraft batteries were reportedly fired into
the sky and explosions from incoming missiles and bombs rocked
Baghdad on Thursday night after the United States and Britain said
they had launched a second wave of attacks.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in the city saw anti-aircraft guns firing into the
sky. At least three very big explosions lit up the night sky at
about 10 p.m. (1900 GMT). Large plumes of smoke rose into the sky,
according to earlier reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Thursday that France will "do all to facilitate the ending
of the crisis" between the United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Making a comment for the first time since the United States and
Britain started bombing Iraq Wednesday, Chirac said that bombing
would not solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
While expressing deep concern over the suffering of the Iraqi
people, Chirac also said that the responsibility for the current
situation fell on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"What is essential is to solve the problems, which will not be
solved by strikes, of course," he said in a statement made outside
the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
The French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonnna said
that Chirac had a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill
Clinton on the situation in Iraq on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents tried to discuss "ways for going out of the
crisis," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"This was a good conversation during which the president and
Mr. Clinton wished to look toward the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed his wish that U.N. arms inspectors could
return to Iraq during his talks with Clinton, she added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the enlargement and improvement
of the methods for implementing the U.N. resolution 986 on "oil
for food" program with Iraq, and a future system of "continuous
control" of disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Chirac has also contacted the heads of state of Egypt, Tunisia,
Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and the
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Iraq, according to the Elysee
palace.

</P>
<P>
The statement said that Algeria was following up the
developments in Iraq after the Wednesday night air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Algeria called for immediate halt of the military operations,

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Chief Condemns Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Thursday lambasted Washington and London for the
airstrikes against Iraq as "a gross violation of international law
and an instance of open disregard for the world community's
efforts to settle the situation in the region."
</P>
<P>
"From a military point of view, missile strikes on Iraq which
caused civilian casualties are not justified by anything.
Moreover, the results of the strikes, instead of stabilizing the
situation will only escalate tensions over Iraq," Sergeyev said in
a statement circulated here.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev returned to Moscow earlier Thursday on President Boris
Yeltsin's instruction, putting off his participation in a session
of the Russia-NATO Joint Permanent Council, in an apparent protest
over the U.S.-British strikes.
</P>
<P>
"How can one talk about cooperation and partnership with NATO
when Russia's opinion is openly neglected?" the minister asked.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Security Council's efforts to solve the problem
peacefully have been reduced to nothing," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
"In this situation the only correct step would be to stop
bombings and to get back to the negotiating table."
</P>
<P>
"The situation is demanding a thorough analysis and adjustment
of approaches to the problems of international security," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian General Chiefs of Staff
has confirmed that some Navy and Air Force units have been put
under the alert and standing by for missions assigned by the
commander-in-chief in response to heightened tensions in the Gulf,
Itar-Tass reported.

KHARTOUM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government
condemned the U.S.-British military operation against Iraq and
deemed it a "flagrant defiance to the will of the international
community and a total disregard of the international legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday that the
military strike on midnight Wednesday reflects the premeditated
hostile intentions of the United States and Britain at a time when
the U.N. Security Council is considering the extent of Iraq's
cooperation with U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government denounced "the unjustifiable aggression
that violates the sovereignty and safety of an Arab country and a
member of the international system."
</P>
<P>
It called for an immediate halt of the aggression to give
diplomatic efforts a new opportunity to establish justice through
the proposed comprehensive review of the Iraqi compliance with the
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the U.S. of blocking the way to a
diplomatic solution and provoking the Arabs and Muslims when they
are preparing for the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
A group of people held a demonstration before the Iraqi embassy
to Khartoum Thursday afternoon to protest the U.S.-British strikes
and express solidarity with the Iraqi people.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has accepted the resignation of State Minister in charge
of privatization Matthew Rukikaire.
</P>
<P>
The president's decision was announced to Parliament Thursday
by Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe while she was submitting
government position on the report of the parliamentary select
committee on privatization, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said Museveni accepted Rukikaire's
resignation because of his failure to supervise the sale of some
key parastatals, not for the alleged corruption as mentioned in
the report.
</P>
<P>
She told Parliament that the president is also committed to
investigating all ministers mentioned in the report by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Rukikaire reportedly tendered his resignation last week. He
announced his resignation to Parliament during his defense there
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He has been accused by parliamentarians of being responsible
for the reported irregularities in the country's privatization
exercise and of being corrupt.
</P>
<P>
During his defense in Parliament, the minister said he is not
corrupt as reported, but he was politically responsible for the
wrongdoing of some officials involved in the sale of public
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Three other ministers including two cabinet ministers are also
mentioned in the report of the committee.

UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
53rd session of the General Assembly (GA), Didier Opertti of
Uruguay, on Thursday voiced his confidence in U.N. ability to
solve the Iraqi crisis under the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Opertti said in a one-sentence statement, issued here on

resumed consultations on the current Iraqi crisis.
</P>

"In view of the regrettable developments taken place in Iraq,
the president of the General Assembly would like to express his

lead to a solution to the conflict based on the strict observance
of the provision of the Charter and the fulfillment of the

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A study by U.S.
researchers shows that male patient whose AIDS appears to be in

still be able to transmit the AIDS virus through sexual contact,
the Washington Post said Thursday.

Researchers from Philadelphia's Jefferson Medical College,

levels in their blood. But in four of the seven, the researchers
detected HIV in semen cells. That suggests they may be possible

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Butler's Replacement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia will insist on the
replacement of Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission
in Charge of Iraq, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Thursday in the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Ivanov, who put off his
visit to the NATO headquarters in Brussels and just returned to
Moscow from Belgrade, said that "a direct reason for the bombing
of Iraq was a report by Richard Butler submitted on December 15.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that the current crisis
was created artificially, including through irresponsible, willful
actions by Butler, who has practically violated his mandate,
stressed Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
He said Butler's report "gives a distorted picture of the
situation and makes an absolutely ungrounded conclusion on the
lack of full cooperation on the part of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The main task at present is "to immediately put an end to air
strikes against Iraq and continue a search for the political
settlement of the situation."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with ORT TV station on Thursday evening Ivanov
stated that the United States must stop bombing Iraq and
commensurate its actions with the interests of further relations
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that Washington and London continue to make
bellicose statements. "We hope that common sense will triumph
there," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister warned that no urgent measures are taken,
that action (against Iraq) may also have far-reaching consequences
for the entire system of international relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese newly formed
government Thursday won the vote of confidence in parliament,
showing that the new cabinet was formally approved to take
office.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-day debate on the policy statement submitted
by the government three days ago, 85 of 116 parliament members who
were present at the parliament session voted for the statement
while 31 against it.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member cabinet was formed by Prime Minister Designate
Salim Hoss early this month following the resignation of former
prime minister Rafik Hariri. Hariri served over the past six years
under former president Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, a veteran economist and politician, was well respected by
the country's various factions and had been premier for three
times during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
In his 18-page statement, Hoss outlined steps to be taken to
tame the ballooning public debt and huge budget deficit, the two
most difficult economic problems he inherited from the former
government.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Lebanon's public debt will reach 18
billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1998, surpassing the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The average budget deficit in the first 11 months of this year
stood at 41.6 percent of expenditure.
</P>
<P>
However, the budget deficit last year witnessed a record high
of 59 percent of expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also put stable monetary policy as a priority of his
government agenda.

ANKARA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey had decided to close a
border gate linking northern Iraq in a bid to prevent possible
influx of Iraqi Kurdish refugees, said Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Cem said "the Habur border gate
was unilaterally closed by Ankara. Our security concerns made us
take this step."
</P>
<P>
Cem also expressed fears over a possible flight of people from
northern Iraq towards the Turkish border following the U.S. and
Britain air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted Mustafa Demirel, governor
in the border area, as saying that "We shut down the Habur border
gate for security reasons."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds had fled to Turkey after
the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>

A senior Turkish Foreign Ministry official said that Turkey
was ready to deal with an eventual refugee wave if the
U.S. assault leads to chaos in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Reported Military Cooperation With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Space Agency on
Thursday denied as groundless U.S. allegations that it had handed
Iran missile technologies.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it "has nothing to do with the transfer of
missile technologies to Iran," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The denial came in response to a statement by U.S. State
Department Spokesman James Rubin accusing the Russian agency of
military collaboration with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Rubin warned that unless Moscow cut short what he called the
illegal deliveries by some Russian companies of missile
technologies to Iran, Washington would have to reduce the number
of U.S. commercial satellite launches with Russian boosters.
</P>
<P>
The press service of the Russian agency said Washington's
refusal to make commercial launches with Russian boosters would
hurt the U.S. side, which is unlikely to find any more favorable
conditions for putting its space vehicles into orbit.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Bespalko, spokesman for the Russian Nuclear Energy
Minister Sergei Adamov, said Washington's threatened sanctions
"will be counterproductive not only for Russia by also for America
itself."
</P>
<P>
"Russian-Iranian contacts are of exceptionally peace
character," Bespalko said, noting that his ministry had called on
the U.S. to take part in Russian-Iranian peace programs, a call
Washington turned down.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times reported that U.S. President Bill Clinton
had decided to impose sanctions on two Russian research centers
for cooperating with Iran and violating international
non-proliferation agreements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the U.S. introduced a ban on cooperation
with seven Russian organizations accused of transferring
dual-purpose technologies to Iran.

<HEADLINE> French Newspapers Mark 70th Anniversary of Tintin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The French newspaper France Soir
and L'Humanite weekly Thursday marked the 70th anniversary of the
the Belgian comic strip ``Tintin'' by focusing on a controversial
volume of the series, ``Tintin in the Country of the Soviets.''
</P>
<P>
The publisher of the ``Tintin'' series, Casterman, is going to
re-publish for the first time ``Tintin in the Country of the
Soviets'' in January 1999 to mark the anniversary of the comic
strip series drawn by Belgian Georges Remi, called Herge.
</P>
<P>
Because of its severe criticism of the Soviet Union in the
1930s, ``Tintin in the Country of the Soviets'' remained over the
past 60 years the outcast of the whole series telling the
adventure stories of a young Belgian journalist.
</P>
<P>
France Soir published two boards of the album on Thursday and
will continue to publish the rest of the volume in the coming 35
days.
</P>
<P>
The L'Humanite weekly consecrated eight pages in its newest
edition to ``Tintin in the Country of the Soviets,'' questioning
whether Tintin's view of the Soviet Union in 1930s was correct.
</P>
<P>
When the fac-simile copy of the volume was first published in
France in 1981, L'Humanite deplored it as ``a gross anti-soviet
attack''.
</P>
<P>
``If now the black sheep is allowed return to the herd, it is
evidently because the political context is different,'' said
L'Humanite.
</P>
<P>
The ``Tintin'' series, including ``Tintin in Congo,'' ``Tintin
in America'' and many others set in exotic backgrounds, were first
published by the Belgian Catholic review ``Petit Vingtieme'' in
January 1929, and continued to come out until March 1983 when
Herge died.
</P>
<P>
The series have been translated into 59 languages from French
and have sold 200 million copies around the world, with 3 million
volumes sold each year.
</P>
<P>
Former French President Charles de Gaulle once called Tintin
his ``only international rival.''

strikes against Iraq by the United States and Britain.
</P>

He exchanged views with Annan and Laraki on ways to find a
peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis.

Security (SCNS) held a special session on Thursday to discuss the
issue and its possible impacts on the regional security.
</P>
<P>
The SCNS made some "necessary decisions" and the foreign
ministry has set up a special committee to follow up the
developments, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
A missile hit the downtown of Khorramshahr Thursday morning
during the U.S.-British military strike against Iraq, causing no
casualty but damaging some residential units.
</P>
<P>
So far it is not clear whether the missile was fired by the
U.S. forces or the British forces. Iranian security forces have
moved the remains of the missile for investigation.

Iran has condemned the U.S.-British strike against Iraq and
the incident.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican House
leaders decided Thursday to open the impeachment debate against
President Bill Clinton on Friday, but Democrats objected to
Republican plans to voting on the four impeachment articles while
U.S. attacks in Iraq were ongoing.
</P>
<P>
The Senate majority leader, meanwhile, ruled out a deal to
spare the president a Senate trial. "We will go to a trial and
there won't be any deal making," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said in an interview with CNN.
</P>
<P>
Incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston set the debate to begin
at 10 a.m. Friday and pleaded with Democrats not to stall
lawmakers from voting on Saturday as Republicans had planned.
</P>
<P>
"Let them cast their votes without pressure, let us debate the
issue, let them cast their votes and live up to exactly the
principle to which our young people in the armed forces are
risking their lives for," said Livingston, a Republican lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
The House was scheduled to debate four articles of impeachment
against the president on Thursday, including perjury, obstruction
of justice and abuse of power, but delayed in the wake of the U.S.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Strong UNSCOM Could Be Back in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Thursday it would support a United Nations Special Committee which
can function in dealing with Iraq only after the U.S. completes
its current military action.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special press conference, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said that the U.S. had reached out for wider
support for the "Desert Fox" assault on Iraq, but failed to sway
Russia, China and France.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the U.S. would stop its attack if Iraq agreed to
give in, Albright said, "we would have to get proof of his
cooperation," but adding, "this military campaign is going to
continue...to its completion."
</P>
<P>
"(Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein can in fact say that he will
let UNSCOM back in, a functioning UNSCOM, and he can cooperate.
And again, the proof will be as to whether he does cooperate with
them," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"But we will not stand for an UNSCOM that is not fully capable
of doing its work," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that one of the things we have to remember that UNSCOM
has not been able to do its work for the last eight months, so we
would have to have an UNSCOM that is able to function under strong
leadership," she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright, after talking to leaders in more than 20
countries, said, "The international community is firm in its
determination the way forward is for Iraq to comply fully" with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
As U.S. and British forces struck again at Iraqi targets,
Clinton telephoned President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein
of Jordan, President Jacques Chirac of France and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
White House national security spokesman David Leavy declined to
characterize what Clinton said to the leaders. "They were all
good, constructive conversations," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said every foreign embassy in Washington was being
briefed by the administration, and that she, alone, had contacted
more than 20 foreign leaders and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
"The response has been gratifying," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Among Arab leaders, Albright said she found "a full
understanding of why we have undertaken military action. Most
expressed the view that Saddam Hussein is entirely responsible for
the military strike now under way..."
</P>
<P>
However, she admitted that the U.S. action was also criticized
internationally.
</P>
<P>
"Among members of the Security Council, we have encountered
some expressions of regret that a peaceful solution couldn't be
found despite all our best efforts," she said.

<HEADLINE> Caspian States Remain Divided over Sea Legal Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The five Caspian Sea states
failed to bridge their differences over the sea's legal status in
a two-day meeting that ended here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the deputy foreign ministers of Russia, Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iran said in a joint communique that
the sides demonstrated "better mutual understanding" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences, they agreed to hold regular sessions
to coordinate positions and speed up the drafting of a convention
on the legal status of the Caspian Sea, which is believed to be
rich in oil and other resources.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan "support the complete division of
the Caspian Sea, which implies the division of the bed, water and
surface of the Caspian Sea," Interfax quoted the document as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran, "giving preference to the condominium regime (implying
the joint utilization of the bed, water and surface) may decide to
support the idea of complete division of the sea."
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan and Russia "advocate the division of the sea bed,
leaving its water and surface for joint utilization.
</P>
<P>
The communique also reaffirmed the countries' adherence to the
principle of consensus in the drafting and adoption of the
convention, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Rally to Protest Impeachment Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people stood
at the foot of the Capitol on Thursday to protest efforts by House
Republicans to impeach U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The rally, organized by the Reverend Jesse Jackson and his
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, featured speakers who criticized
conservative Republicans and offered support to Clinton. Among the
audience were labor groups and members of minority and Democratic
Party organizations.
</P>
<P>
Jackson told the crowd: "We say to out Congress, `Be fair, be
mature, be consistent.'"
</P>
<P>
Many of the listeners carried signs with messages such as ``Two
Wrongs Don't Make a Far Right'' and "No More Lynching in America."
Other speakers included Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., a
Democrat, and Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, the elder Jackson said he favored censure for
Clinton, not impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"He has done wrong. He deserves to be rebuked, reprimanded.
Like all men who have sinned, he's fallen short of the glory of
God," Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> UK Plans "Counter-terrorism" Law across Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government unveiled
plans on Thursday for new nationwide legislation to combat
guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Interior minister Jack Straw said the government hoped the time
was near when special Northern Ireland "counter-terrorism" laws
were no longer needed after the Northern Ireland peace agreement
was reached last April.
</P>
<P>
Straw said that when he brought in the new law, he planned to
repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and Northern Ireland
(Emergency Provisions) Act which apply solely to the province.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the government might have to keep some
special powers for Northern Ireland temporarily when the new law
was enacted if the advance towards permanent peace there had not
gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the new nationwide anti-terrorist law would finally
lay to rest a system by which ministers had been able to exclude
people from specific areas of the United Kingdom -- generally
either Northern Ireland or mainland Britain.
</P>
<P>
Northern Irish police powers to stop, search and enter the
premises of suspected "terrorists" would be extended to the whole
of Britain, and the government was considering whether to extend
its right, which it already possesses in Northern Ireland, to
proscribe guerrilla organizations, Straw added.

<HEADLINE> Urgent:  U.N. Chief Arms Inspector to Speak to Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms
inspector Richard Butler is expected to speak to the press here at
4:00 p.m. (EST) after he came under fire late on Wednesday from
China, Russia and other Security Council members, who held him
responsible for the turn of the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM),
presented a report on Tuesday night to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, saying that Baghdad failed to fully cooperate with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, said late on Wednesday that the current Iraqi crisis was
artificially made, in an apparent reference to the negative role
of Butler's report against the effort by the international
community to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Government, echoed stance by some Security Council
members, has stated openly that Butler should be replaced, reports
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia PM Calls U.S. Vice-President on Iraq </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia condemns the military
action against Iraq taken by the United States and Britain,
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said in a telephone
conversation with U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation Primakov said that the airstrikes
roughly violated the corresponding resolutions of the U.N.
Security Council, the U.N. Charter and Norms of the International
Law.
</P>
<P>
Primakov denounced Gore's reasoning and stressed that by his
instigating moves, Richard Butler, the Head of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSOM) has lost any authority to engage in the
settlement of this problem.
</P>
<P>
The Premier urged the United States to immediately cease the
use of force against Iraq and reiterated Russia's determination to
do everything possible in order to achieve a political settlement
to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Bug Is Already Causing Problems in The UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- About one in three of Britain's
largest companies has already been hit by the computer millennium
bug, according to Action 2000, the British government watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Many big businesses have found that their computer networks are
incapable of planning beyond next year, the advisory group said in
its annual report.
</P>
<P>
In one recent case, the Halifax financial group sent out
letters to customers offering a new service which would last from
1999 to 1900 because the computer could not recognize the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Other companies in the finance, manufacturing and utilities
sectors have encountered problems in managing contracts,
inventories and financial controls for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Action 2000 warned that more instances are likely to take place
in January 1999, when information technology systems will be
trying to plan a year ahead.
</P>
<P>
With just over a year to go, Action 2000 have found that half
of the 800,000 small and medium-sized businesses in the UK have
not addressed the problem.

<HEADLINE> Simple Treatment Makes PVC Safer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
discovered a simple way to make safer plastics by preventing the
harmful chemicals in poly-vinyl chloride (PVC) from migrating out
into the environment.
</P>
<P>
PVC is one of the most widely used polymeric materials in
medical applications. But phthalates, the chemicals incorporated
into PVC to make it softer and more pliable, can migrate into the
bloodstream of patients undergoing dialysis or blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
Phthalate is a fat-removing carcinogen in the liver, and it is
also suspected of attacking the human reproductive system.
</P>
<P>
Researchers of the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical
Sciences, Trivandrum, India, reported Thursday in a letter to the
scientific journal Nature that by modifying PVC, this migration
can be prevented.
</P>
<P>
They reacted the PVC with sodium sulphide in water with a
catalyst and found that this replaced the chloride ions on the
surface of the PVC with sulphide ions, causing the polymer chains
to cross-link that stops the phthalates migrating out of the PVC.
</P>
<P>
When exposed to petroleum ether, the unmodified PVC lost almost
all its phthalates in a day but the surface-treated PVC lost
virtually none in six months.
