<HEADLINE> Initial Success Obtained in Fishing Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved initial
success in its fishing ban this year, according to the Ministry
of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The second stage of the fishing ban will be from September to
October. Boats can only fish in areas 30 nautical miles east of
the fisheries-restriction line, and a strict check system of young
fish proportions will be applied during the period.
</P>
<P>
China imposed an overall ban in China's Yellow Sea and East
China Sea from July 1 to August 31. During the period, only 21
fishing boats, or two percent of the total, in the East China Sea
area failed to observe the order.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate the success obtained during the July-August
period, the ministry called for more attention to fisheries
management in the second stage.
</P>
<P>
Calling the "fishing ban" an effective way to protect China's
fish resources, especially the hairtail, the ministry said that
last year's fishing ban was a great success.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country, for the first time, banned fishing in
July and August in its offshore fishing waters.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the autumn high water season in 1995,
the hairtail output increased by 14 percent over 1994 to 740,000
tons, hitting a record high.

<HEADLINE> Polish President Urges France to Back NATO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleskander
Kwasniewski has appealed to France to help his country join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Poland could begin negotiations with the western military
alliance in 1997, after its ministerial conference in December to
discuss NATO enlargement, Kwasniewski was quoted as saying in an
interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro published today.
</P>
<P>
"If the negotiations go well, I think the 50th anniversary of
NATO in 1999 will be a good date to carry out its enlargement,"
said Kwasniewski, who was elected president in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said France should play a major role in NATO's decision to
admit Poland.
</P>
<P>
The president dismissed fears that Poland's entry into NATO
would pose a threat to Russia or any other former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy that France speaks clearly about the need to
enlarge NATO. The enlargement of the organization should also
bring about better relations with ... Russia and Ukraine," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski rejected calls by Russia, Belarus and Ukraine to
establish a nuclear free zone in Poland.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that to become a member of NATO means sharing all
the values and the risks of the alliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who started his first
three-day official visit to Poland Wednesday, said in Warsaw that
France would "warmly support" Poland's membership of the European
Union and NATO.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC to Strengthen Ties With Austrian Federal Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), Li Ruihuan, said here today the CPPCC will
strengthen its ties with the Federal Council of Austria.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement during a meeting with Josef Pfeifer,
President of Austria's Federal Council, the second chamber of the
bicameral Federal Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Li said ties between the CPPCC and the Federal Council of
Austria were established a decade ago as a result of the efforts
of Deng Yingchao, the late chairman of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
There have been more and more exchanges ever since and the
frequent visits of their leaders have played an important role in
promoting the understanding between the two peoples and pushing
forward the development of overall bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We should constantly open new channels and explore new ways
for further cooperation so as to make such cooperation more
fruitful", Li said.
</P>
<P>
Such exchanges and cooperation are not only a major part of
overall relations between the two countries, but serve as an
important basis for their further development.
</P>
<P>
Pfeifer agreed with Li's comments on bilateral relations and
said Li's visit to Austria will help achieve those goals.
</P>
<P>
Austria and China enjoy a long history of friendship and this
year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the two countries. The forthcoming visit to
China by Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky will bring the two
countries closer, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Allows Citizens to Travel Freely to Kurdish Autonomous Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government has
allowed citizens from across the country to travel freely to and
from the three Kurdish autonomous provinces of Sulaimaniyeh, Irbil
and Dahuk in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Interior Minister Mohammed Zeman Abdul Razak made the
remarks today in an interview with the Iraq News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
"The Interior Ministry has taken procedures necessary for
citizens to travel freely to and from the three Kurdish autonomous
provinces in implementing a presidential decree on lifting the
precautionary measures taken in connection with northern Iraq
since 1991," Abdul Razak said.
</P>
<P>
"Procedures have also been taken to remove any restrictions on
trade exchange between other provinces and the three autonomous
provinces in the north," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kirkuk transport authority provided Wednesday 350 big and
small buses to move citizens from Kirkuk to Sulaimaniyeh, Irbil
and Dahuk.
</P>
<P>
These procedures were taken after the President Saddam backed
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Massoud Barzani controlled
all the major cities in the north on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish "safe Haven" in northern Iraq, set up by the
U.S. and its allies shortly after the 1991 Gulf war, effectively
collapsed.

<P>
TOKYO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. Marines are being held
on suspicion of beating and robbing a female bar owner in a town
in Japan's Okinawa prefecture, which last week voted to cut the
U.S. military presence on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Kyodo News Service today quoted U.S. military officials as

Bergen, both stationed at Camp Hansen in the northeastern Okinawa
town of Kin.

They allegedly entered a bar named "Yuuga" in neighboring

from the bar after assaulting its 56-year-old owner, Toshiko
Gakiya, according to a police and U.S. military investigation.
</P>
<P>
The incident came only days after a prefecture-wide referendum
showed a majority of those who voted wanted a reduction in U.S.
military bases on the island and the review of the Japan-U.S.

<HEADLINE> US Plane in Trial Flying Test on World's Roof </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A three-engined MD-11 plane
from the US-owned MD Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation made a
successful landing and take-off at an airfield on the "roof the
ther world" today.
</P>
<P>
The trial flight and landing test also included a test with one
engine deliberately stopped. It took place in Lhasa's Konggar
Airport, which has the world's highest elevation for an airport.
</P>
<P>
The test was made by the U.S. MD Aircraft Manufacturing
Corporation to show the plane's quality characteristics in the
high plateau, in an effort to market the MD-11 to airlines
operating flights to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Dundrub, vice-chairman of Tibet Autonomous Region, who watched
the test, congratulated the success of the trial flight.
</P>
<P>
He held that the test indicated that air routes to Tibet may
add another type of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the MD company will play a positive role in
promoting Tibet's aviation services.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President of MD company, Margaret S. Billson, said her
company has a long history in cooperation with China, and is ready
to provide MD passenger planes of high quality to China at any
time.
</P>
<P>
Konggar Airport is located 3,538 meters above sea level where
air is thin. The high plateau environment, and air flow mean there
are special requirements for Tibet-bound planes.
</P>
<P>
China has been cautious on choosing passenger planes for air
routes to Tibet. Trial flights by aircraft from major foreign
companies are made in Tibet each time China considers introducing
planes.

BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to introduce
overseas funds for "Spark Program" projects, Han Deqian, Deputy
Minister of State Commission for Science and Technology said here

</P>
<P>
The Spark Program, approved by the Chinese government in 1986,
is China's first plan to encourage economic development in rural
areas with help of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Han said at today's news conference in Beijing that in the next
five years, China will also learn advanced agricultural technology
and purchase equipment that is appropriate for China's rural

<P>
The implementation of the program has aroused the attention of
many foreign organizations, such as the United Nations Development
Program, World Bank European Union and a number of foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
The official said that a World Bank loan in 1991 produced
outstanding achievements in aiding Spark Program projects.

He added that in the next five years, China is to aid the
development of planting, domestic animal breeding, agricultural
chemical industry, refined processing of farm produce,
agricultural equipment, light industry and textiles, rural
building materials, mining and other industries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had launched 66,736 Spark Program
projects with a total investment of 94 billion yuan (some 11
billion U.S. dollars) and realized 47 billion yuan (5.85 billion
dollars) in profits and taxes.

regarding regional developments following the recent attacks by
the U.S. against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime

<P>
BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi government has allowed citizens from
across the country to travel freely to and from the three Kurdish
autonomous provinces of Sulaimaniyeh, Irbil and Dahuk in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Interior Minister Mohammed Zeman Abdul Razak made the
remarks today in an interview with the Iraq News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
The Kirkuk transport authority provided Wednesday 350 big and
small buses to move citizens from Kirkuk to Sulaimaniyeh, Irbil
and Dahuk.
</P>
<P>
The development came after Iraqi-backed Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) led by Massoud Barzani controlled all major cities in
the north on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish "safe Haven" in northern Iraq, set up by the
U.S. and its allies shortly after the 1991 Gulf war, effectively
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Information Minister Abdul-Ghani Abdul-Ghafoor
has announced that his country is ready to respond to any new
U.S. aggression.
</P>
<P>
During a surprise visit to the Press Center of the Iraqi
Foreign Ministry today, Abdul-Ghafoor said, "Iraq brought to an
end the imaginary no-fly zones that the U.S. wants to maintain in
northern and southern Iraq. Our air defenses will deal with any
enemy object that violates the security and sovereignty of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Northern Iraq is an indivisible part of Iraq. It is a fact
that has been well-known for 6,000 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "no-fly" zones north of parallel 36 and south of parallel
32 are restrictions imposed by the United States and have no
international legitimacy, Abdul-Ghafoor said, adding that nations
all over the world condemn the U.S. aggression on Iraq.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Russia are expected
to hold a joint military exercise in Russia's far east next week,
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first exercise for military units from the
U.S., Canada and Russia to cooperate in search and rescue
activities and humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Arctic-Sarex'96 exercise, sponsored by NATO's
Civil Emergency Planning Directorate, is aimed at improving
emergency responses within the framework of NATO's Partnership for
Peace program.
</P>
<P>
The primary objective of the exercise near Khabarovsk is to
test procedures for notification of emergencies, response to an
an airplane crash and practical cooperation of the air search and
rescue forces of Russia, Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
It will also give medical teams from the three countries the
chance to share experiences in the field of rescue activities in
remote and difficult to reach places.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense and Ministry, the Ministry of the Russian
Federation for Civil Defense, Emergencies and Elimination of the
Consequences of Natural Disasters, Canada's Air Search and Rescue
and the U.S. Defense Department will participate in the exercise.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, U.S. Talks on Troops Accord Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United
States have failed to reach agreement on revising a 20-year-old
accord governing the status of some 37,000 U.S. servicemen
stationed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides ended their seventh round of talks on the Status
of Forces Agreement (SOFA) without resolving their differences
over the extent to which South Korean law enforcement authorities
have jurisdiction over American soldiers accused of criminal
offenses.
</P>
<P>
But they agreed to hold a further round of talks after both
sides have finished reviewing the other's offers.
</P>
<P>
During two days of discussion, the two sides agreed that U.S.
soldiers accused of serious crimes such as murder and rape would
be handed over to the Korean authorities before indictment.
However, they failed to agree on the extent to which the accused
soldiers can cross-examine witnesses.
</P>
<P>
South Korean law guarantees that the accused have the right to
cross-examination, but differs with U.S. law on the extent of that
right.
</P>
<P>
Washington demanded that soldiers handed over to the Seoul
authorities before indictment would retain the right to
cross-examine witnesses while being interrogated by the South
Korean prosecution or police.
</P>
<P>
The validity of statements made by witnesses is another demand
from the U.S. side to guarantee the legal protection of U.S.
servicemen in case they are transferred into the custody of the
South Korean authorities before indictment.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Washington failed to narrow their differences on the
extent to which the statements will be valid.
</P>
<P>
However, they reached a broad understanding that the new SOFA
agreement will contain provisions that fall somewhere between the
symbolic and the concrete regarding the environmental protection
of U.S. bases in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the original agreement in 1966, more than
30,000 crimes have been committed by U.S. servicemen in South
Korea and some 40 murders have been linked to the U.S. military
presence in the country.

<HEADLINE> 28th ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The 28th ASEAN Economic
Ministers Meeting (AEM) concluded here this evening by calling for
greater economic integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
A joint press statement issued at the meeting said it is now
time for ASEAN to look for an enhanced model of cooperation with
the aim to bringing ASEAN towards a more closely integrated,
dynamic and prosperous enlarged family.
</P>
<P>
The ministers asked the senior economic officials to work out
an appropriate model that will help bring about a more enhanced
ASEAN cooperation beyond the year 2003 based on common interest
and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated that the implementation of the Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme for ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)
has made great stride, noting that AFTA is well on the way to
realization by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The work activities for AFTA have been directed towards trade
facilitation exercises, such as elimination of non-tariff barriers
(NTBs) and the harmonization of tariff nomenclature, customs
procedures and valuation.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN members are ready to sign an agreement on customs,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers approved the CEPT rules of
origin for textiles and textile products which allow the use of
substantial transformation criterion as an alternative to the
existing percentage criterion.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Indonesia agreed to begin phasing in rice and
sugar into the CEPT scheme by January 1, 2003 and to end by
January 1, 2010 with flexibility on the ending rates. Meanwhile,
the Philippines will complete the phasing of rice by January 1,
2010.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indonesia and the Philippines demanded that a 2010
deadline be pushed back 10 years.
</P>
<P>
To further facilitate the movement of goods in the region, the
ministers agreed in principle to a proposal to expedite the
clearance of goods in transit. In this regard, the ministers
recommended the formation of a joint senior economic officials
meeting and the senior transport officials meeting to formulate a
framework agreement among ASEAN member countries for goods in
transit.
</P>
<P>
The AEM also approved the draft dispute settlement mechanism
(DSM) which covers all economic agreements in ASEAN. The DSM will
be signed in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers have decided to sign a protocol to amend
the ASEAN agreement for the promotion and protection of
investment, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they requested the ASEAN Secretariat to submit
recommendations on the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) to the informal
ASEAN economic ministers meeting to be held in Manila on November
21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ministers held that the cooperation in services, food,
agriculture, forestry, minerals, energy, transportation and
tourism sector should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
They were pleased with the ASEAN Mekong Basin Development
Cooperation and noted the increasing receptiveness of the East
Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC) among the Asia-Pacific countries and
agreed to continue the efforts toward its realization.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also had an extensive discussion on matters
pertaining to the preparations of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meeting in the Philippines and the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial conference in Singapore in 1996,
according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> UN Special Rapporteur: Child Prostitution Must Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. special rapporteur on
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography
said here today that she is looking for clear and swift action
from governments to make illegal all forms of child prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Special Rapporteur Ofelia Calcetas-Santos told a press
conference that child prostitution should be unequivocally
outlawed regardless of any attendant circumstances and that
children should always be considered as the victims of the
offense, never as the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
She also called for the protection of the abused children
during the whole response process in order not to further
victimize the children. Law enforcement officials, judges and
others should be sensitized and trained in this regard, she said.
</P>
<P>
Calcetas-Santos recently addressed the World Congress Against
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children held in Stockholm,
Sweden, and is now preparing her report to the U.N. General
Assembly on what she described as an "invisible, mobile, global,
escalating, and highly profitable business."
</P>
<P>
She also stressed that the media can and should play a decisive
role in the process of combating commercial child sexual
exploitation.

<HEADLINE> Le Pen Fuels Racism in France with Murder of 14-Year-Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The far-right National Front
(FN) led by Jean-Marie Le Pen has fueled a racist row by claiming
the murder of a 14-year-old boy allegedly by a North African
teenager was "an anti-French, racist attack."
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified as Little Nicolas, was stabbed to death
while eating a sandwich in downtown Marseille on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The FN claimed Wednesday that the media and politicians were
trying to hide the fact that the suspected killer, still at large,
was from North Africa.
</P>
<P>
The party has also called a demonstration in Marseille on
Saturday when the funeral for little Nicolas is scheduled to be
held.
</P>
<P>
The strong FN respond to the murder coincided with the launch
of a lawsuit by the Socialist Party against controversial FN
president Le Pen for his repeated public declaration that he
believes in "racial inequality."
</P>
<P>
The party's national executive voted overwhelmingly for the
lawsuit, which demands Minister of Justice Jacques Toubon to take
the necessary legal proceedings to punish the "racist talk" of Le
Pen.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight-year-old Le Pen declared earlier this week, "Our
model of civilization is vastly superior to that of those tribes
which today are trying to colonize us," referring to Arab or black
African immigrants living in France.
</P>
<P>
However, the French government has refused to bring proceedings
for alleged racist comments against Le Pen, though it has decided
to present a bill before parliament to seek more effective control
over the expression of racist and xenophobic ideas, the justice
ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that legal proceedings might not stick and it
would not launch any action "which would not be legally founded."
</P>
<P>
Former First Secretary of the Socialist Party Henri Emmanuelli
called on Tuesday for the FN to be banned, a call which got a cool
response from parties on both the left and right.
</P>
<P>
But Emmanuelli's demand triggered a nationwide debate over
whether France should resort to such means as banning a political
group to silence its leaders.

<P>
Under French law, the authors of racist remarks face fines and
up to a year in jail as well as disqualification from holding
public office.
</P>
<P>
But most political leaders and analysts said that it would be
useless to ban the FN legally. Moreover, the French Constitution
protects the right of free expression, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Le Pen could be pursued by the law for inciting racial hatred,
but the program of FN... cannot be maintained except by the
people. The lesson of banning the (fascist) Leagues in 1936 has
proved that a democracy defends itself better by persuasion than
by the law," said political analyst Alain-Gerard Slama.
</P>
<P>
Historian Francois Bedarida said today's French society and
politics are totally different from the 1930s', so the French
needn't fear that the far-right FN could rise as the Nazis did in
Germany in early 1930s.

<P>
DAMASCUS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad met here today with visiting Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz and the meeting was attended by Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital said the two sides
discussed the latest developments in the region and the ways for
the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In an arrival statement in Damascus earlier today, the
Lebanese foreign minister criticized Israel's retreat from the
peace process, noting that such retreat had created an atmosphere
of tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that his visit to Syria was aimed at consulting
with Syrian officials on the latest developments in the region on
the eve of a Arab League Council meeting, which is scheduled to
be held in Cairo on September 14.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz is scheduled to return home tonight and leave for Cairo

<HEADLINE> EU Publishes Survey Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Europe can be very
competitive on world markets without changing the level of social
benefit system, a majority of the citizens of European Union (EU)
countries said in a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the European Commission's survey results for
April, May, June and July 1996, six Europeans out of 10 feel "very
attached or quite attached" to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The attachment to Europe is particularly strong in Luxembourg
with a high 78 percent, in Denmark 72 percent, in both Germany and
Italy 70 percent, and in Austria 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
When thinking about the Union, optimism prevails in all EU
member states, with the exception of Sweden with 38 percent
feeling "optimistic," the United Kingdom 46 percent and Denmark 48
percent.
</P>
<P>
Another 35 percent polled by the continuous tracking surveys
feel only "satisfied" about the Union. The most "satisfied" are to
be found in Ireland with 66 percent and Luxembourg with 52
percent.
</P>
<P>
In general, the positive feeling of "being member" of the EU,
59 percent, and the feeling of having benefited from it, 49
percent, have remained stable over the survey period between March
27 and July 16, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Spain, support for the Union has grown progressively since
November 1995. This support is at its highest level in Ireland and
is on the increase in Austria and Finland in the survey period.
</P>
<P>
This is not the case for Sweden, however, where the trend
points downwards reinforcing the existing low level of support. In
Germany, the perception of having benefited from EU membership has
weakened since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
A relative majority of 43 percent of Europeans think that
removing borders between EU member nations is a "good thing,"
while 40 percent of the respondents said that it is a "bad thing,"
and for another 13 percent it is "neither a good nor bad thing."
</P>
<P>
And it would be a good thing for the EU to be able to make
decisions on policies to reduce the level of unemployment which
would be imposed on all EU member states, almost eight in 10
Europeans declared.

<HEADLINE> Combat Desertification Convention Nears Entry Into Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Convention to
Combat Desertification is likely to be put into force soon, as the
number of countries having ratified the U.N. document has
increased to 45, closer to the 50 needed.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the ninth round of negotiations on the Convention
to Combat Desertification, which is being held from September 3 to
13, made significant progress toward the final ratification of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
The ninth session of the International Negotiating Committee on
Desertification addressed a series of practical issues, according
to officials from the committee.
</P>
<P>
The convention was adopted on June 17, 1994 in Paris. It has
been signed by 114 countries and the European Union, and as of
today, 45 countries have deposited their instrument of
ratification or accession, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Active reports presented earlier this week showed an increased
participation and interest in programs promoted in the framework
of the Convention to Combat Desertification during the interim
period before it enters into force, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Participation is high also on the side of the non-governmental
organizations which organized a panel during the session on the
importance of women's role in drylands management.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. estimates, some 70 percent of the 5.2 billion
hectares of drylands used for agriculture around the world are
already degraded.
</P>
<P>
In all, more than 110 countries have drylands that are
potentially at risk. The United Nations Environment Program
estimates that desertification costs the world 42 billion U.S.
dollars a year. The livelihood of more than a billion people are
now at risk. Over 135 million may be in danger of being driven
from their land.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Austrian Federal Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Li Ruihuan said
here today that China always treats other countries as equals,
will never seek hegemonism and will always contribute positively
to the peace and stability of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made this statement
when meeting with Austrian Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Sino-Austrian relations are sound. China is
pleased with its cooperation with Austria since diplomatic
relations were established 25 years ago, and is confident of a
brighter future for bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic cooperation between China and Austria has
developed dramatically in recent years and the volume of bilateral
trade has been increasing annually. Bilateral cooperation is
continually expanding, but does not match the economic capacities
of the two countries. Therefore, there is vast potential for
further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li noted both China and Austria should treasure their friendly
cooperation and try to explore new channels and ways for further
cooperation on the principles of mutual respect, understanding,
common prosperity and seeking common ground while reserving
differences.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should not only push their economic
cooperation and trade to new heights, but also bring into the 21st
century a stable, friendly and developing Sino-Austrian
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Li went on that despite the great achievements made since
China's reform and opening policy began 18 years ago, China still
has many problems and difficulties to overcome. So it will take
the efforts of several generations to make its economy comparable
to that of a developed country.
</P>
<P>
Li said China's modernization requires two major
preconditions: a stable political situation at home and a
long-term peaceful and stable international environment.
</P>
<P>
Only when such conditions are met can China concentrate on
economic construction and strengthen its exchanges and cooperation
with foreign partners, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has no intention of creating dispute, friction or
contradiction with any other country, Li said. This is decided
not only by its foreign policy of peace and friendship, but also
by its own interests.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China will unite and cooperate with any country,
big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, which treats China
with equality. Any country seeking the trust and friendship from
the Chinese people must treat China with equality and respect.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed the sound relations between China and Austria to
their mutual respect, equality and sincerity and said that China
attaches much importance to this relationship.
</P>
<P>
Li said China is awaiting Vranitzky's forthcoming visit to
China next month and he believed the trip would open a new chapter
in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said the Austrian government and he himself pay much
attention to developing bilateral relations, and he hopes both
countries can cooperate better on economic and cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
He said over 60 Austrian businessmen will be accompanying him
on his trip to China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a series of cultural activities by Austrian artists
will be held in Beijing and some exhibitions featuring Austrian
art treasures will be shown to the Chinese audience. All these
activities, he said, will push bilateral relations further ahead.

<HEADLINE> New Environmental Controls Sought for Toxic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Officials from 100
governments are meeting at the United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP) headquarters here next week to negotiate an international
agreement on hazardous chemicals and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The talks will lead to a legally binding treaty regulating the
import and export of hazardous chemicals through the Prior
Informed Consent (PIC) procedure, said the UNEP in a news release
issued here today.
</P>
<P>
"At our first meeting last March governments emphasized the
need to move quickly and adopt a convention by early 1997," said
Maria Celina de Azevedo Rodriques, a Brazilian diplomat who is
the meeting's chairperson.
</P>
<P>
"Once in place, this new treaty will represent our first line
of global defense against chemical hazards," she noted.
</P>
<P>
The PIC procedure, which is now voluntary, helps importing
countries learn more about the characteristics of hazardous
chemicals that may be shipped to them so that they can decide on
whether or not to permit future imports.
</P>
<P>
Exporting countries are notified which products importing
countries no longer want to receive and can help ensure that
illegal exports do not occur.
</P>
<P>
With a PIC convention in operation, the international
community will have taken its first major step toward
establishing a comprehensive approach to chemicals risks,
according to the release.
</P>
<P>
Until now, these risks have been addressed at the national or
regional levels or through very specific international agreements
dealing with the various media that transport chemicals: water,
air, and land.
</P>
<P>
"Chemicals are now at the top of the global environmental
agenda," said Elizabeth Dowdeswell, UNEP executive director,
quoted by the news release.
</P>
<P>
Many chemicals and pesticides are harmful to human beings,
animals, and ecosystems. They can be highly hazardous, cause
cancer or birth defects, or enter the food chain and then
gradually accumulate in the vital organs of people before
reaching hazardous levels.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the FAO and UNEP to promote chemical safety were
initially based on the 1985 International Code of Conduct on the
Distribution and Use of Pesticides and the 1987 London Guidelines
for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International
Trade.
</P>
<P>
These two voluntary systems promote the sharing of information
among governments and encourage them to shift toward less
hazardous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the future agreement is to help countries
move toward more effective chemicals management and phase out
the use of the most hazardous compounds. Training and
capacity-building will therefore be an important part of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
This first negotiating session was held in Brussels in March.
The third and final PIC negotiating session is expected to adopt
the final convention in early 1997, probably in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urged to Protect Its Neighbors' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's regional
trade partners have urged the South African parliament to protect
their interests in trade talks with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The request is contained in a letter to South African Speaker
of Parliament Frene Ginwala, from parliaments of Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, Southern African Broadcasting
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
These countries said in the letter that the prospect of South
Africa reaching free trade agreement with the European Union is
causing apprehension in the whole Southern African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
They said the accord will have negative implications for their
economies unless their interests are considered in negotiating
the pact.
</P>
<P>
They also said cheaper imports from the highly competitive
European markets will force companies in the sub-region out of
business and result in mass unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The deal will also reduce revenue for member countries of the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU).
</P>
<P>
Under SACU, set up in 1969, goods are traded within the union
free of duty and quotas.
</P>
<P>
SACU groups Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and
Swaziland.

<P>
GENEVA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The first world emergency
relief exhibition, WorldAid 96, will take place in Geneva from
September 30 to October 4, organizers said today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitors will come from a wide range of industries that
are indispensable to humanitarian aid: shelters, transport,
telecommunications, food, sanitary equipment, medical material,
energy and mine detection. The global total spending on
humanitarian aid in 1995 is estimated at about 8 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Along with the exhibition, an international conference will
take place simultaneously at the Palexpo exhibition center of
Geneva to discuss issues relating to relief operations.
</P>
<P>
Odd Grann, secretary general of the non-profit organization
which organized WorldAid 96, told a press conference today that
262 companies and 45 humanitarian organizations will participate
in the events.
</P>
<P>
He said that WorldAid will be a forum for personal contact
between suppliers and purchasers and will offer agents a chance to
obtain information about the most recent products.
</P>
<P>
The main beneficiaries of these meetings will be the victims of
wars and disasters, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Coordination is the key to emergency relief. By working
together, the different sectors can improve the quality of the aid
provided to the 300 million victims of today's wars and other
disasters in the world," said Grann, who is also a former director
general of the Norwegian Red Cross.

<HEADLINE> UK to Review New Mad Cow Disease Evidence With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
decided to review new scientific findings on BSE or the mad cow
disease with the European Union (EU), putting off a widely
expected clash between London and Brussels on a massive slaughter
program.
</P>
<P>
British government ministers were reportedly poised to shelve
the number of 147,000 cattle to be slaughtered and likely to
abandon the slaughter program altogether as new scientific
findings suggest that the mad cow disease would be over by 2001
without the planned slaughter of those cattle.
</P>
<P>
However, the government ministers at today's cabinet meeting
agreed to consult the EU Commission on the issue rather than
unilaterally scale down a massive slaughter plan.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers noted that scientific findings represent new factors
which must be reviewed with the commission," according to a
statement issued this afternoon by Prime Minister John Major's
office.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that new evidence should be evaluated in the
light of the agreement reached at the EU Florence summit in June
that a ban on British beef exports should be gradually lifted "on
the basis of objective scientific criteria."
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a global ban on British beef products exports on
March 27 when the British government admitted that there were
possible links between the mad cow disease and its human
equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed at the Florence Summit to gradually lift the
ban on British beef exports on the condition that Britain should
implement a series of tough measures, including the slaughter of
cattle most at risk from the mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> US Adds Two More B-52s to Persian Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
increased the number of B-52s sent to the island of Diego Garcia
close to the Persian Gulf from two to four, and eight F-117
stealth fighter-bombers have been ready for deployment, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Perry confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
He also said the United States will take all "necessary and
appropriate actions" to protect its forces in the Middle East
from any challenge posed by the Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after Kuwait agreed to accept some of the
U.S. stealth fighter-bombers and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz called the Kuwaiti decision "flagrant aggression
against the people of Iraq and an act of war against the Iraqi
state."
</P>
<P>
A short time later after the Kuwaiti decision to allow U.S.
warplanes' landing, Iraq was reported to have fired the second
round of missiles at U.S. aircraft over a no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Perry called Aziz's accusation of Kuwait "kind of rash
statements," which are "totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"If there is any challenge to those (U.S.) forces, we have
the responsibility to protect them. The United States will take
all necessary and appropriate actions," he told reporters in his
office.
</P>
<P>
It was in contrast to his uncharacteristically harsh language
used on Wednesday when he was discussing the way of retaliation
on Iraq for its failed missiles attack at U.S. F-16 fighters
over northern Iraq. He said that Saddam would face a U.S.
response "disproportionate to the provocations which were made
against us."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has still remained closed-mouthed about specific
plans for the expected retaliations on Iraq. But the additional
warplanes dispatched to the Persian Gulf pointed to a U.S.
objective to significantly damage Iraq's military capability.
</P>
<P>
A Middle East expert said U.S. forces have several options.
They could hit military headquarters, drop laser-guided bombs on
command bunkers, or destroy Iraq's highly capable Mirage fighter
planes and biological weapons.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Opposes Turkey's Plan to Set up Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's special envoy and adviser Hamit Yusuf Hammidi said here
today that Iraq opposes Turkey's plan of establishing a security
zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hammidi made the remarks in Ankara Esenboga Airport before
his departure after a three-day intensive talks with Turkish
officials on the plan.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is considering setting up a safety belt zone 10
kilometers deep into the Iraqi terrority in a bid to prevent the
infiltrations of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) into
the Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
Hammidi told reporters: "We have told the Turkish side that we
are against a security zone inside Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish plan is a "violation of Iraq's
sovereignty," hoping that the two sides "come to an agreement
acceptable to both."
</P>
<P>
However, a high-ranking Turkish Foreign Ministry official
said: "There still exists the intended declaration of the
security belt zone."
</P>
<P>
Hammidi said: "The Turkish side has understood our concerns
and we understood theirs," adding that Baghdad will take all the
measures necessary to secure its sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says No To Rabin's Promise On Full Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu indicated today that the hard-line Likud
government will not follow the former Labor government's promise
on full withdrawal from the Golan Heights for full peace with
Syria, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu confirmed that it is true that late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin had indirectly agreed to withdraw from the Golan to
the border of June 4, 1967 if Syria met certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was briefing the cabinet ministers on his
trip to the United States earlier this week. He returned home
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the Israeli message was in fact relayed to
the U.S.. Rabin repeatedly declared that the depth of withdrawal
depended on the depth of peace.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the American administration's position is
that hypothetical comments made by previous Israeli government in
the midst of negotiations are not binding on the new Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that Israel is now in the midst of an
American attempt to find a bridging formula to renew the talks
with Damascus with the understanding that the current government
does not accept the statements of positions of the previous
government.
</P>
<P>
According to Netanyahu, the next stage is to reach an
American-Syrian understanding on this matter. He added that he is
still not clear if the Syrians will be ready to renew the
talks. "We will know soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy reported to the cabinet on his
trip to Europe and his talks with leaders on the peace process
there. He admitted that the European position differs from Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had told the Europeans that Israel will
insist that the Orient House, PLO's Office in East Jerusalem,
should not be used as, in his words, diplomatic address.
</P>
<P>
But, according to earlier reports, the EU countries are adamant
that their foreign ministers will visit the Orient House when
they come to Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Regional Sanctions on Burundi to Go On: Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR Es SALAAM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania today said
regional sanctions on Burundi should be strictly maintained until
the country's military regime fulfills conditions set by the
Arusha summit on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Cyprian Majengo, an information director in the Foreign
Ministry, reiterated this stand when clarifying to the press the
regional move to allow some humanitarian supplies to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Majengo told a press conference here that this move, which was
decided upon in Arusha during the regional sanctions coordinating
committee meeting last friday, did not mean that the sanctions
had been eased as interprated by some people.
</P>
<P>
He said the sanctions were there to stay until Buyoya's regime
meets the conditions which are the restoration of parliament, the
unbanning of political parties and the immediate and unconditional
negotiation with all groups within and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that the sanctions can be eased as the regime
is yet to meet any of the set conditions," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The information director said the issue of humanitarian
supplies was agreed upon during he regional ministerial meeting
held in Kampala, Uganda last month and recalled again during the
sanctions coordinating committee meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
"The committee addressed genuine humanitarian concerns in a
manner that it didn't undermine the very essence of the
sanctions. It considered and decided to allow subject to strict
verification and control arrangements of the importation by the
U.N. agencies of human medicines and emergency basic food items,"
he explained.
</P>
<P>
Majengo mentioned the items as baby foods and other essential
requirements including personal hygiene provisions for infants
and hospital patients, emergency medical and laboratory supplies
and limited quantities of kerosene for the cold chains for
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the supplies would be made under a closer
supervision to ensure the decision was not abused and warned that
the committee may reverse its stand if there would be any abuse.
</P>
<P>
Majengo said the committee further decided to allow a
restricted number of U.N. flights to and from Bujumbura,
restricted road access to and from Burundi for U.N. and other
humanitarian agencies' personnel and allowed the agencies to
import limited and controlled amounts of diesel and petrol for
their own use.
</P>
<P>
"U.N. agencies have also been allowed to import communication
equipment for their own use," he added.

<HEADLINE> More SADC Citizens Apply for S. African Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of aliens
from neighboring countries applying for permanent residence in
South Africa has doubled over the past two weeks, the department
of home affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, department spokesman Hennie
Meyer said 42,939 applications have so far been received, most of
them in Gauteng province.
</P>
<P>
Meyer ascribed the sharp increase to the department's
publicity campaign on the exemption for citizens from Southern
African Development Community (SADC) member states.
</P>
<P>
In terms of a recent cabinet decision, citizens from Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe could qualify for
permanent residence in South Africa if they met certain
criteria.
</P>
<P>
Among others, they should be able to demonstrate or provide
evidence of continuous residence in South Africa from July 1
1991, be engaged in productive formal or informal economic
activity, have dependent children born or residing lawfully in
the country, and have no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
However, only about 11,600 of an expected one million illegal
immigrants qualifying for permanent residence have submitted
their applications by late August.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the department launched an advertizing campaign to
inform people about their opportunity, which would expire at the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said there has been a rush of applicants in Gauteng in
the past week following the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Applications to this effect should still be made at any office
of the department of home affairs throughout the country before
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The numbers of illegal immigrants currently believed living in
South Africa are two and four million, said Meyer.

the birth, growth and coming of age of a leopard son in Africa's
Serengeti plains.
</P>
<P>
"Beautifully filmed by acclaimed naturalist Hugo van Lawick,
it is the tale of how a child learns the lessons of life at his
mother's side, and at the same time, how he finds his place in
the world," the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the story of "The Leopard Son" is aimed
at promoting world awareness on the conservation of Serengeti
National Park.

CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said today that Egypt is determined to hold a regional
economic conference on schedule, but noted that Israel and the
United States are required to help in making the gathering
successful.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with government ministers, Mubarak said
that Egypt does not reject the convocation of the Middle East and
North Africa Economic Summit in November. The conference is
scheduled for November 12-14 in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Egypt wants Israel to implement all the
agreements signed with the Palestinians in order to resume the
Middle East peace process and avoid the failure of the economic
conference.
</P>
<P>
"What is required from both Israel and the United States is to
help us make the conference a success, otherwise the meeting will
fail," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak noted that the U.S. wants the conference to be held on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has linked the conference with the peace process, saying
that the conference can not be held unless there is tangible
progress in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa indicated Wednesday that
Egypt does not want to cancel the conference but may postpone
it.

<HEADLINE> Papandreou's Wills Opened in Athens Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The two wills of Greece's late
Panhellenic Socialist Movement leader and former Premier Andreas
Papandreou were opened in an Athens probate court today.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou died of heart failure at the age of 77 in June.
</P>
<P>
One will, dated May 28, 1933 (an apparent mistake in the date)
was tabled in court by lawyer Athanassios Liapis.
</P>
<P>
The second one, dated November 24, 1990, tabled by Papandreou's
third wife and widow Dimitra Liani-Papandreou through her lawyer
Dimitrios Bourouris.
</P>
<P>
After examining the first will with respect to the apparent
mistake in the date, the court declared both wills to be valid
since their content was deemed to be consistent.
</P>
<P>
In the first handwritten will, Papandreou appoints his wife
Dimitra as heir, leaving his entire movable and immovable property
to her.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said he had provided for his children -- George,
Sofia, Nikos and Andreas -- during his life "with considerable
benefits," expressing his "avid affection" for them. Papandreou
said he believed that "the name which I leave to my children will
fully offset my inability to give them a greater share of the
inheritance."
</P>
<P>
In the second will, also handwritten, the former premier
denounced his son-in-law, Theodoros Katsanevas, as being a
"disgrace" for the Papandreou family.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said that his three sons had a "moral obligation to
make public the role and character of Theodoros Katsanevas and to
sever all public and private ties which they have with him."
</P>
<P>
The former premier's daughter, Sofia Papandreou-Katsanevas,
later described her father's will as "a dubiously improvised note
and not a regular will, which was apparently made out under
pressure."
</P>
<P>
Sofia maintained that her father and her husband had had a
relationship characterized by deep respect and affection for many
years.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Disarmament Concludes 1996 Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament,
the sole multilateral disarmament negotiating body, closed its
1996 session today in the wake of the adoption of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the final plenary today, Conference President Ludwik
Dembinsky hailed the adoption of the CTBT, saying it would have
been unforgivable not to have presented to the international
community a text which, although not the subject of consensus, had
achieved overwhelming support after two and a half years of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the idea that the conference's credibility had been
undermined by its failure to strike consensus on the CTBT, he
argued that the status of the conference remained intact. The
forum was better prepared today to face the new world situation.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT negotiations occupied most of the conference time this
year. Despite intense efforts, the 61-member forum was unable to
agree on a text, prompting Australia to submit a draft treaty to
the General Assembly in the form of a draft resolution, adopted
Tuesday by a vote of 158 to three, with five abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the General Assembly's endorsement would
discourage any country from defying the rest of the world by
exploding a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 session also saw the conference resolve one of the
thorniest issues of the last few years, namely the expansion of
its membership. It decided on June 17 to admit 23 new members in a
bid to "reflect the political reality in the post-Cold War era,"
as diplomats put it.
</P>
<P>
The 23 new members are Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus, Cameroon,
Chile, Colombia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
Finland, Iraq, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, the Republic of Korea,
Senegal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Syria,
Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 session of the conference is scheduled to start on
January 20 and is divided in three parts as usual: from January 20
to March 27; from May 12 to June 27; and from July 28 to September
10.
</P>
<P>
Although the conference has not been able to agree on the 1997
agenda, it could include such issues as a production ban of
fissile material for nuclear weapons; effective international
arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapons states against the use
or threat of use of nuclear weapons; the prevention of an arms
race in outer space; and transparency in armaments.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Air Defense Forces
fired today three surface-to-air missiles at U.S. planes over the
southern "no-fly" zone, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an Iraqi military spokesman as saying that
the U.S. jets violated Iraqi airspace by carrying out today 62
sorties over the "no-fly" zones in the south and in the north.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reported firing at U.S. and allied aircraft over the
no-fly zones almost every day for the past week.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Iraq fired a missile at two F-16 jet fighters
patrolling northern Iraq, but missed the target.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. responded by sending bombers and stealth fighters to
the region.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has stressed that it would defend itself against any
U.S. military action and would continue to ignore the no-fly
zones established by the U.S. and the allied forces on its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. expanded the no-fly zone in southern Iraq
from the 32nd to the 33rd parallel -- a line that reaches the
southern suburbs of Baghdad. Another "no-fly" zone is above the
36th parallel in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Americans fired last week 44 cruise missiles at Iraqi
targets in the south.

MOGADISHU, September 12 (Xinjua) -- A Somali businessman has
been abducted in South Mogadishu today by unidentified heavily
armed gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The businessman, Abdulkarim Hussein Moallim, has been
operating a radio on his own. About a dozen armed men stormed
into the two-storey building where he was working at one of the
busiest junctions of South Mogadishu this morning.
</P>
<P>
There has been a heavy exchange of fire by the perpetrators
and the guards of the communication facility. The gunmen seized
and took away Moallim, claiming that the businessman owed them
money.
</P>

<P>
LUANDA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U. N. special envoy in Angola
Blondin Beye announced today that two UNITA soldiers assembling
camps in Zaire and Lunda-Norte provinces will be closed on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters here that the number of soldiers from the

have gathered in the two assembling camps reached the planned
target between 4,000 to 5,000.
</P>
<P>
So far, 13 UNITA soldiers assembling camps have been closed

</P>
<P>
Beye said he is satisfied with the fact that the first group
of five UNITA generals arrived in Luanda on Monday and they were
warmly received by the government side.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Report Calls for Higher Teaching Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Teachers and students must
meet higher standards, a report released today said, calling for
an overhaul of the way the nation recruits and trains teachers.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the National Commission on Teaching and
America's Future, said unqualified teachers are routinely
recruited, teachers are not given adequate support and
professional development is lacking.
</P>
<P>
A group of 26 policy-makers and educators conducted the study
of two years.
</P>
<P>
The report said "the profession of teaching needs a lot of
support," said Linda Darling-Hammond, professor at Teachers
College, Columbia University, and director of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The report called on states to set high standards for teacher
education and licensing and stop issuing emergency and substandard
licenses.
</P>
<P>
It said professional development programs need to be expanded,
young teachers should be mentored and school districts should
spend more on teaching and less on administration.
</P>
<P>
"No more hiring unqualified teachers on the sly," the report
said. "No more nods and winks at teacher education programs that
fail to prepare teachers properly. No more tolerance for
incompetence in the classroom."
</P>
<P>
Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, the
nation's largest teachers' union, said he hoped the report would
be a catalyst for serious debate about the future of teaching.
</P>
<P>
The study finds more than 40 states allow districts to hire
teachers who have not met basic requirements, and more than 12
percent of new teachers begin without any training at all; another
14 percent enter without having fully met state standards.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 75 percent of all teachers have studied child
development, learning and teaching methods and have degrees in
their teaching subject areas, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Only 500 of the nation's 1,200 education schools meet
professional standards of accreditation, it said.

</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- "China is our genuine friend.
China's aid is sincere. The ultimate motive of China's aid to
Zambia is to help Zambians to reach self-management," Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks when he received Luo Gan, state
councillor and secretary-general of the State Council of China.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, Chiluba said that it
is China who has helped land-locked Zambia build a communication
route leading to the outside.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his happiness that the relations of friendship
and cooperation between Zambia and China are growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Luo said that the friendship between China and
Zambia has a profound base as it was built in the common struggle
against colonialism and imperialism.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at present the two countries are facing similar
common tasks to develop national economy and maintain social
stability.
</P>
<P>
As for the cooperation between the two countries, Luo noted
that it is based on equality, mutual benefit and non-interference
in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that China attaches importance to Africa because world
stability links with the stability in Africa and prosperity in
the world needs development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Luo and his entourage arrived here on September 11 for an
official visit to Zambia and will leave here for Harare, Zimbabwe
on September 13.

<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
reaffirmed today France's attachment to the territorial integrity
of Iraq, but he did not rule out the possibility of cooperating
with the United States over Iraq in future.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference he gave in Warsaw, Poland, where he is
making a three-day visit, Chirac said that France is closely
following the development of the situation in Iraq, and is in
close contact with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"France is first attached to the respect of territorial
integrity of Iraq. It is also attached to the arrangements
established after the Gulf War by the allied partners to
contribute to the stability in the region, and to the protection
of the populations. We hold on to this line," Agence France
Presse quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that being a member of the Western allies
responsible for two exclusion zones in Iraq, France will "do what
we think we should do if the situation evolves."
</P>
<P>
France expressed deep concern earlier today over the return of
tension in Iraq after two U.S. F-16 combat aircraft were targeted
by Iraqi missiles Wednesday morning in the exclusion zone in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States has sent several F-117 stealth bombers and
B-52 bombers to Kuwait for a possible retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Qualify for Debt Relief From IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has shown a
good economic record for at least three years to qualify for debt
relief from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press here today, a senior official of the fund,
Festus Osunsade said that economic and political atmosphere in
Tanzania is very good, but these will not make the country be
automatically relieved of its debts from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Osunsade, senior IMF representative to Tanzania, said that
among the 181 member countries of the fund, 20 of them mostly
from Africa including Tanzania, were classified as heavily
indebted poor countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the practice to give relief to heavily indebted
members of the IMF is a new rule of the game among the set of
rules governing the international fund which is a financial
cooperative society.
</P>
<P>
The fund is given to the most needy members as a loan to be
repaid later on.
</P>
<P>
"With the good record which Tanzania has in three years, it
may qualify for debt relief from the IMF," said Osunsade.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Asks Italy to Return Obelisk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said today
Italy has expressed its desire to return the Axum Obelisk, which
had been taken to Rome during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in
1930s, within a few months time.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Italian
delegation which is on a three-day working visit here ''wished to
bring the long standing matter (on the return of the Axum
Obelisk) to a final conclusion within a few months.''
</P>
<P>
''The Italian delegation expressed Italy's readiness to
establish a joint committee to examine the technical and
financial issues relating to the return of the obelisk to
Ethiopia,'' the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The minsitry said the visiting Italian delegation led by
deputy Foreign Minister Rino Serri has held extensive discussions
with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin on further strengthening existing Ethio-Italian
relationship.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the two sides discussed development
cooperation and examined the areas in which to concentrate in the
next two years. The two sides also discussed situations in the
Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region of central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Axum Obelisks are most striking relics of ancient Axum Kingdom
established about 2,000 years ago in Axum, an ancient city
located 600 kms north of Addis Ababa. They are made of single
blocks of granite carved in the representation of multi-storey
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The tallest, now fallen, stood over 33 meters high and
represented a building of 13 storeys. The biggest obelisk still
standing is 23 meters high with 10 storeys. The Italians took
away one of the Obelisks to Rome in 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government and people wanted the return of their
property.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today urged parents, educators and communities to work
together on improving the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we should let a thousand flowers bloom... so that
together we can have the kind of village it takes to make sure our
children have excellence in education," The Associated Press
quoted Clinton as saying at a rally outside Morris E. Dailey
elementary school in California.
</P>
<P>
The president used his 27th visit to vote-rich California to
contrast his views on education with those of Republican
challenger Robert Dole.
</P>
<P>
"We ought to find ways to identify and reward good teachers. We
should be lifting our teachers up, not bashing them and finding
ways to be critical," Clinton said. "We have to do our part, each
and every one of us, if we're going to have the best schools in
the world."
</P>
<P>
Clinton passed out 1.3 million dollars for charter schools,
which are independent public schools that do not have to comply
with most regulations imposed on regular public schools.
</P>
<P>
Also today, he directed Education Secretary Richard Riley to
take steps to help states raise their teaching standards, in
response to a study showing one-fourth of the nation's school
teachers need more training.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was scheduled to visit later Rancho Cucamonga and Santa
Monica, then attend a Beverly Hills fund-raiser before returning
to Washington early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president campaigned Wednesday in Arizona, a state that
hasn't been won by a Democratic presidential candidate since Harry
Truman in 1948.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz left here this evening at the end of a one-day brief
visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad had a meeting with Boueiz, in
which they discussed the latest developments and situation in the
region, according to a Syrian official source.
</P>
<P>
They put particular emphasis on seeking appropriate ways for
the resumption of negotiations with Israel along the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad and Boueiz also discussed the ongoing efforts to
implement the resolutions of the Cairo Arab summit, which was
held on June 22-23.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boueiz held talks with his Syrian counterpart
Farouq al-Shara on the peace process and coordination of
positions with regard to the items on the agenda of the Arab
League foreign ministers meeting due to be held in Cairo Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed Middle East peace process and the latest
developments in the Arab, regional and international arenas as
well as the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his arrival statement earlier today, Boueiz criticized
Israel's retreat from the peace process, noting that such an
attitude had created an atmosphere of tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister denied that Lebanon had received
a message from Israel sent through France, which plays an
important role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say that Boueiz's visit aims at seeking a
formula to face Israeli challenges and Israel's demand to resume
peace talks with Syria without preconditions.

KAMPALA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
stated today that African society cannot be fundamentally
transformed if the continent totally depends on donor resources.
</P>
<P>
"Without the money of our own," he said, "we are not going on
to transform our society."
</P>
<P>
He said this when addressing an African conference on the
empowerment of women through functional literacy and the
education of the girl-child. The conference began on September 8
and will be closed tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
It has been attended by delegates from 34 African countries
together with a number of national and international agencies.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that women are angry at their marginalization,
but at the same time he called upon them to always evolve plans
that will be executed to overcome problems facing them.
</P>
<P>
He told the conference participants that the problems which
women in Africa are facing are chiefly the result of
mismanagement of the economy of Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it is possible to cause the economy of
Africa to grow as Uganda's experience since 1986 has shown.
</P>
<P>
He said Uganda's economy has been able to grow because of his
government's policy of liberalization, stabilization of currency
under the deliberate effort of the government to encourage
regional integration.

Buffallos have increased from 10,000 in 1980 to about 80,000

Pakistani President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari today toured the
park which spreads over an area of 1,978 square kilometers in the

tons.

LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Stock markets in London and
Paris surged strongly and finished sharply up today, with British
shares ending at a new peak in the wake of a firm Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index in London finished at a new closing high, up
27.2 points at 3,932.8, 13.9 points above its previous record set
on August 28, as the market gained support from positive company
results.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's own advance to record levels gave the London
market an extra boost and helped reinforce sentiment.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt ended the session marginally higher,
up 3.52 points on the DAX-30 index, with the market supported by
the firm dollar.
</P>
<P>
Volumes were muted, dealers said, ahead of upcoming US economic
figures.
</P>
<P>
The French bourse finished sharply higher, with the CAC-40
share index up 27.31, boosted by Wall Street's strength and a
healthy oil share performance.
</P>
<P>
Gains were strengthened on the back of Eurotunnel's reported
deal with its creditor banks.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 27.2 points higher at 3,932.8. The Frankfurt

<HEADLINE> NAFTA Report on Canada-US Dairy Dispute Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The release of a final report
on a dispute between Canada and the United States over dairy and
poultry products has again been postponed, this time until after
the U.S. presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The report was due to be released next week, after last month's
delay.
</P>
<P>
A five-member panel under the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) has decided to delay releasing its final report
on Canada's restriction on imported dairy products until late
November, the Financial Post newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton just does not want a trade dispute with Canada before
the election," one U.S. dairy industry official was quoted as
saying by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The panel found last July that Canada's import duties on
foreign milk and chicken products were legal under NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contended that the import duties were a violation of
NAFTA, even though they were allowed under the World Trade
Organization rules.

<HEADLINE> New York City Council Approves Bill on Beggars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The New York City Council
approved a bill on Wednesday that would allow police to arrest
squeegee men, beggars at automatic teller machines and other
aggressive panhandlers.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be sent to City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani who will
sign it into law in a few days, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would ban "aggressive" panhandling which
involves physical contact or blocks a person's path. And it would
ban any panhandling with 10 feet of most automatic teller
machines.
</P>
<P>
Breaking the proposed law will be punishable by up to 16 days
in jail or up to a 100 dollars fine, or both.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was modeled after similar measures in other
cities, reflects a growing movement across the country to restrict
the conduct of panhandlers. It will provide police with new
ammunition in fighting against wide-spread panhandling in the
city.

<HEADLINE> Latin American, Caribbean Economies to Accelerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American and
Caribbean economies in 1996 will be about 3 percent, bottoming out
the low growth of last year, according to a report presented here
today.
</P>
<P>
The 3 percent growth was figured out based on the data for the
first six months of the year, said the report of the Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).
</P>
<P>
It signifies a return to a moderate expansion rate after the
meager performance of 1995. That year, the ECLAC report said, low
average growth of 0.3 percent was determined mainly by falls in
economic activity in Mexico and Argentina, although the rest of
the countries registered rates of over 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, signs of recovery in Mexico and Argentina contrast
with those of slow-down in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru
due to policies aimed at reducing inflation or limiting external
imbalances.
</P>
<P>
Chile shows most dynamism, the report said, with an increase of
GDP approaching 7 percent, while Venezuela will face a fall as a
result of the application of a severe adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
The value of exports from the nine largest economies increased
by about 12 percent during the first six months, the report said.
And the trade surplus of the region will probably grow slightly in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The large increase of private capital entering the region,
after a reduction in the previous year, has been unexpected. The
total inflow of capital will exceed 50 billion U.S. dollars, twice
that of 1995 and close to the largest figures registered at the
beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
Falling inflation remains a positive element in the economic
performance of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.
At mid-year, the average inflation rate for the 12 preceding
months stood at 22 percent, compared with 26 percent in 1995. "It
is very likely that in 1996 the regional average will reach its
lowest level since 1972," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the situation of the labor market is
the most negative feature of the regional economic panorama in
1996. Despite the predicted improvement in growth, unemployment
still has not begun to decrease after reaching its highest level
this decade in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Hill Still Out in Cold As McLaren Confirms 1997 Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A move by Damon Hill to
McLaren was ruled out Friday when the team retained drivers David
Coulthard and Mika Hakkinen for the 1997 Formula One season, a
press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
McLaren, which had previously confirmed that Coulthard would
stay with the team, said it decided to keep Hakkinen after talks
with engine suppliers Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish driver returned to Formula One this season after
suffering serious injuries in a crash in the final Grand Prix of
last season in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen and Coulthard are fifth and sixth, respectively, in the
championship standings with 27 and 18 points.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who could clinch the world title in the Portuguese Grand
Prix next week, was left looking for a drive in 1997 after being
dumped by Williams Renault.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari has already announced it will stay with Michael
Schumacher and Eddie Irvine next season, leaving Benetton as
Hill's only hope of finding a seat in a competitive car.

<HEADLINE> South Lebanon Army Chief Denies Threats to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Antoine Lahd, commander of
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, denied today
that he had made any threat of large-scale Israeli military strikes
against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lahd, whose troops are patrolling the Israeli self-proclaimed
buffer zone in south Lebanon, was quoted by Beirut's leftist
radio "Voice of People" as saying that what he stated at a press
conference Wednesday was only a "personal analysis" on the present
situation.
</P>
<P>
The SLA commander claimed it was not a secret for any one that
"the things have developed fast, the region as a whole is living
in an unpleasant condition that should be taken into
consideration."
</P>
<P>
He said that his call on the Lebanese government "to pay
attention to the dangerous situation" was regrettably understood
as a message from Israel, noting that he was not a messenger of
the Jewish state which did not need him to convey what it wanted.
</P>
<P>
Vehemently denying any link between Israel and what he had
stated, Lahd underlined that he had repeatedly warned the
Lebanese government "but I have not found anyone listen to
my warning."
</P>
<P>
At the Wednesday press conference, Lahd urged the Lebanese
government to consider Israel's so-called "Lebanon First" proposal
or risk a large-scale "scorched earth war."
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu after he took office in June, offers an unilateral
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in exchange for a
disarmament of Lebanon's Hezbollah (or Party of God) guerrillas
and security arrangements on the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its main foreign power broker Syria have flatly
rejected the proposal on the grounds that it is aimed at driving
a wedge between Beirut and Damascus, which have been coordinating
closely in their peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lahd argued that the "Lebanon First" plan was "aimed at seeking
security arrangements to ensure peace for citizens on the
two sides of the border and to keep security and honesty of
inhabitants in the border area."
</P>
<P>
He said that there were only two options before the
Lebanese leaders, either "to seriously take the Lebanese First"
idea in return for the Israeli withdrawal, or "to insist on an
unconditional implementation of the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 calls for an Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Lahd asserted that the second choice would lead to an
escalation of tension which would prompt Israel "to carry out
large-scale operations which no one knows where it will stop
this time, and which will destroy what Lebanon has built
in the last few years."
</P>
<P>
He called on Lebanon's top leaders "not to waste this
opportunity to rescue the homeland."
</P>
<P>
Lahd's remarks have caused concern to the Lebanese
government, which interpreted them as a message from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz met with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara to
discuss what they called "Israeli threats."
</P>
<P>
"We have registered these threats which were regrettably made
by a Lebanese even though he is a collaborator of Isael," Boueiz
said after meeting the Syrian leaders.

<HEADLINE> Food Output Highest in 8 years in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique produced more than
1.37 million tons of grain in the 1995/96 agricultural year,
increasing by 22 percent from last year's 1.12 million tons, the
Noticias paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is a new record of food production that Mozambique has
achieved in recent eight years, Minister of Agriculture and
Fishing Carlos do Kosario was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released here by the minister, the
production of maize increased by 29 percent to 947,000 tons in
the 1995/96 agricultural year from last October to this
September.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique also produced 139,000 tons of rice, 249,000 tons of
sorghum and 41,000 tons of chestnut, which were up by 23 percent,
2.5 percent and 17.4 percent respectively.

reach 65,000 tons, while the yield of cotton will top 56,000
tons, an increase of 30 percent over the last agricultural year.
</P>
<P>
Do Kosario attributed the good harvests to expanded planted
areas apart from good rains.

Moreover, over 1.7 million refugees returned after the civil
war and engaged in agricultural production.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great
importance to the 96th conference of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, the IPU, which is to be held in Beijing next week, China's
top legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, said this during a meeting today at the Great
Hall of the People with Ahmaed Fathy Sorour, president of the IPU
Council, Pierre Cornillon, IPU secretary general, and other
members of the IPU Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
Qiao extended welcome to members of the IPU council and all the
participants, who have arrived for the conference which takes
place between September 16 and 21.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first IPU conference to be held in China in IPU's
history of more than 100 years, and we attach great importance to
it," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
He said parliamentary exchanges and cooperation plays an
important role in promoting relations between countries and
consolidating friendship between peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said the NPC of China, since joining IPU in 1984, has been
active in various activities, and has deepened friendship with the
parliamentary delegations of other countries, and enhanced
cooperation with IPU Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Parliamentary Union, set up in 1889, is a global
organization of parliaments of sovereign states, and the largest
international parliamentary organization. It now has 135 members
and four associate members. It holds conferences every spring and
autumn.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the IPU Secretariat, in preparation for the
coming conference, Qiao said, China has input a great deal, both
manually and economically, to ensure everything is prepared in
time.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the members of the IPU Executive Committee are from
different parts of the world, and have rich experience. Noting
that four out of the 12 members are women, Qiao praised IPU for
its attention to the role of female members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He wished the coming meeting of the IPU Executive Committee a
great success.
</P>
<P>
Sorour, who is also Speaker of the Egyptian parliament, thanked
China for the "excellent job" in preparing for the conference. He
said that holding the conference in China has special meaning,
which demonstrates that IPU welcomes China's opening-up and
progress.
</P>
<P>
"China is a country with bright future," he added.

<HEADLINE> No Progress Made On Bougainville Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Peace process on the
Bougainville island of Papua New Guinea (PNG) made no progress at
the two-day ministerial meeting between Australia and PNG held in
Adelaide, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Australian delegation and Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer told a joint press conference after the meeting
today that Australia had established the basis for an ongoing
dialogue about the situation on Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
However, "there hasn't been much of a dialogue on this issue up
until now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA), which seeks
independence through guerrilla war against the PNG government,
vowed to step up its "all out war" against the PNG Defense Force
(PNGDF) on the island.
</P>
<P>
"The only peace talks that can be convened on Bougainville, and
only after the PNGDF are removed from our land, is independence
for the people," BRA commander Sam Kauona said.
</P>
<P>
PNG foreign minister Kilory Genia said at the meeting yesterday
that Australia had "largely created" the situation on
Bougainville. He said that the two-day forum was a "farce."
</P>
<P>
The PNG government lifted a ceasefire on Bougainville and sent
troops onto the island to launch full scale attacks on BRA
strongholds in May this year. But the PNGDF troops were thrown
back by BRA fighters. In the latest clashes, 13 PNGDF soldiers
were believed to have been killed by BRA since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference with PNG Deputy Prime Minister
Chris Haiveta today, Downer failed to give details of possible
future meetings over the issue.
</P>
<P>
In the ministerial meeting, the two sides reached agreements to
maintain Australian aid to PNG at the present level and to review
the 12 million Australian dollar (9.6 million US dollar) Defense
Cooperation Program (DCP).
</P>
<P>
The PNG delegation was headed by Prime Minister Julius Chan.
The Australian group consisted of Treasurer Peter Costello,
Defense Minister Ian McLachlan, Industry Minister John Moore and
Environment Minister Robert Hill.

factor in the efforts to secure the compliance of its member
states to their commitments under the Uruguay Round and to
maintain the momentum of the liberalization process of the
multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed their concern at the

<HEADLINE> Serb Ruling Party Confident of Winning Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Although there is still one day
to go before the long-awaited general elections in Bosnia, Bosnian
Serbs in their capital Pale believe the result is a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Brane Ilic, director of the government-controlled Serb news
agency SRNA, told Xinhua today that about 70 percent of voters in
Republika Sprska, the Serb entity in Bosnia, will vote for the
ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS).
</P>
<P>
Ilic, who has close ties with the Serb leadership, said the SDS
is better positioned than any other opposition party in the Serb
half of Bosnia and will undoubtedly win the elections.
</P>
<P>
"Some Serb opposition parties stand for closer ties with the
Muslim-Croat Federation and live together with Muslims and Croats,
but that would lead to a new war and would not have support of the
majority Serbs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SDS is seen as an extreme Serbe nationalist party whose
goal is to unite all Serbs under one state. It opposes
unification with Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
Ilic's confidence is echoed by many local Serbs in Pale, a
mountainous village only 15 kilometers away from the Bosnian
capital Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I will vote for the SDS, who else would I vote for?"
said Slobodan Skipina, a Serb refugee now living in Pale. "The
elections have actually been decided," he added.
</P>
<P>
About 2.9 million people are eligible to vote Saturday in
elections provided for under the December 1995 Dayton Peace Accord
which ended nearly four years of ethnic war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's two entities, Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
Bosnian Federation, will, after the elections, be bridged by a
national government of limited power.
</P>
<P>
Voters will elect a three-member multi-ethnic presidency -- one
Serb, one Muslim and one Croat. The member with most votes will
become president of the collective presidency.
</P>
<P>
They will also elect the lower house of a national parliament.
The two entities will elect their own regional assemblies.
</P>
<P>
The international community hopes these elections will reunite
the country's three nationalities. But many Serbs don't want
unification.
</P>
<P>
Like many others here, 27-year-old Skipina fled from Sarajevo
to Pale with his family in April 1992 when the bloody civil war
broke out. He has given up hope of returning to his home in
downtown Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
He said he fears that Muslims, who try to see an integrated and
unified country with military support from the United States, will
take over Pale. "I would rather be a refugee in Yugoslavia than
live here as a second class civilian under Muslim control."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, the SDS held a big rally in Pale in
which all major Serb leaders attended to drum up final support
from their people.
</P>
<P>
Calling on people to vote for the SDS, the Serb acting
President Biljana Plavsic, who took over from indicted war
criminal Radovan Karadizc, said the vote on Saturday would be for
the survival of the Republika Srpska as a democratic state.
</P>
<P>
"The vote will be for democracy and for the Republika Srpska
that we created," said Plavsic who is running in the election as
candidate for the presidency of the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
Although election conditions are not ideal, the international
community is still hopeful that this first post-war national
election will bring stability and democracy to this war-torn
country and take the initial step towards reconciliation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The first China-made Gamma
scalpel has been put to clinical use at the Chaoyang Hospital in
Huainan of east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
A brain tumor patient became the first person to receive
treatment with the scalpel. The radiation treatment lasted seven
and an half minutes.
</P>
<P>
The scalpel was developed by the Shenzhen OUR International
Science &AMP; Technology Development Company in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The OUR-XGO Cobalt-60 Rotary Gamma Scalpel uses Gamma rays to
kill tumor cells by focussing with pin-point accuracy on the
trouble spot in the brain. The new method requires no anesthesia,
does not destroy surrounding tissue, and has none of the
after-effects associated with common surgical operations.
</P>
<P>
At present Gamma scalpels can only be made by China and
Sweden.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourists will top
75,000 this year, compared to 41,500 last year, sources close to
the tourism sector said today.
</P>
<P>
Hotels can accommodate 3,110 tourists per day this year while
they just had 1,785 beds last year.
</P>
<P>
This is because the government has approved 48 projects for
investment and a number of Portuguese, South African and British
entrepreneurs have come to build hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Gorongosa, the world famous natural games park will be
reopened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors can now send all their profits abroad, and
business tax has been cut from 20 percent last year to just 10
percent this year, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
In 1973 before independence, Mozambique once received 300,000
tourists because it has over 2,600 kilometers of coastal lines, a
lot of games parks and other scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
After realizing peace in 1992, Mozambique now is trying hard
to restore its past prosperity of tourism in a bid to promote the
country's economy.

BRUSSELS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
(EC), the executive body of the European Union (EU), is calling on
countries outside the EU to open their own markets wider to
European textile exports.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, EU Commissioner for trade policy, made the
appeal in a communique issued in Brussels today.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The Commission will need to reflect on the degree of
access given to our own exporters before deciding how ambitious
our own proposals can afford to be."
</P>
<P>
Brittan then urged textiles exporting nations interested in
further multilateral opening of the EU market to propose
improvements to market access in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
The Commission is finalizing its own plans to open EU textiles
markets under the second phase of liberalization agreed within the

<HEADLINE> Denmark Will Stick to Exemptions From EU Treaty: Rasmussen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Danish Prime Minister Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen stressed that his country would abide by the four
exemptions allowed it in the Maastricht Treaty in its dealings
with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, who is also the President of the country's ruling
Social Democratic Party (SDP), made the remark on Thursday at the
party's congress in Aalborg.
</P>
<P>
Denmark joined the EU in 1993 after its European partners
agreed to exempt the country from certain provisions of the
Maastricht Treaty which were regarded as a threat to national
sovereignty by Danish opponents of membership.
</P>
<P>
The country is exempt from: the final stage of European
Monetary Union, including the adoption of a single currency;
participation in a common defense policy; common European
citizenship; and cooperation in legal and home affairs.
</P>
<P>
But there has been considerable debate among SDP delegates at
the party congress on whether to maintain the four exemptions in
the long term or abolish them.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister though said that the four exemptions are
beyond negotiation and will not be altered either during or after
the EU's inter-governmental conference on revising the Maastricht
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Only a new referendum of the Danish people can change the
policy, he added.

attack on allied aircraft patrolling above "no fly zones" in Iraq
is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt also said that
France has "taken note" of the declaration by Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tarik Aziz that Iraq does not mean to threaten Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We can estimate, and above all hope, that it is a signal of
appeasement," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The United States is rushing eight F-117A stealth bombers to
Kuwait and four B-52 bombers to the Indian Ocean after U.S. combat
aircraft were targeted Wednesday and Thursday by Iraqi missiles
over exclusion zones in Iraq.

<P>
France expresses its deep concern over the "persistent tension"
in the Gulf, and is "attached to the territorial integrity of all
countries in the region," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Nestle Posts Strong Profit Growth in First Half of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Food and confectionery giant
Nestle today announced a 20 percent rise in 1996 first half
profits to 1.07 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The group's sales rose 5.6 percent to 22.6 billion dollars
between January and June 1996 over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But the large profits increase is unlikely to be repeated in
the second half, as the first half figure represents a recovery
over a weak first half in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Nestle, which produces brands such as Nescafe
coffee, expects net profit for the full year to at least match the
growth rate in sales.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Nestle's sales volumes have registered a marked
upturn thanks in part to the spectacular development of markets in
eastern and central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Growth continues to be good in the Far East-Pacific region and
South America, although Brazil has started to slow after its
recent boom.
</P>
<P>
But in North America, Nestle's sales were affected by slump on
the coffee market there.
</P>
<P>
The group said it will continue to focus capital expenditure on
emerging markets such as China and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Traffickers of Panda Pelts Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China has imposed death
sentences on two men caught by border police in possession of
extinction-threatened giant panda and golden-haired monkey pelts.
</P>
<P>
But the two were told that the sentences would be suspended for
two years.
</P>
<P>
Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court in Fujian province,
sentenced Zhang Heping and Liu Xiantan to imprisonment where they
will remain for two years before a final decision is made on their
death sentences. If they have shown remorse they may face life
terms instead of execution.
</P>
<P>
In the same case Zhao Hanxin was given a life sentence for his
part in the pelt trafficking, and five other culprits were
sentenced to between eight and 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
During 1990 and 1992, the culprits purchased two panda pelts
and a golden-haired monkey pelt for 21,500 yuan. They were caught
red-handed by border police in May 1995 when trading the panda
pelts for 250,000 yuan apiece, and the monkey pelt for 100,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The court imposed the sentences in accordance with China's
tough Wildlife Protection Law and its Criminal Law. Both the giant
panda and golden-haired monkey are under the first-class state
protection.
</P>
<P>
It was the second giant panda trafficking case in the
province.

ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Jets of the Afghan Taliban
Islamic student militia today bombed Sarobi, a stronghold of Prime
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's, 75 kilometers east of Kabul, said
reports from the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
An official spokesman was quoted as saying in Kabul, "A pair of
jets maneuvered over Sarobi and dropped bombs. There were no
casualties."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also confirmed that Mehtar Lam, capital of
Kabul's neighboring Laghman province, has fallen to the Taliban
militia, but had no details of how it was lost.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has so far captured two key eastern provinces in
three days. Ningarhar, a neutral province which holds the key
access from Pakistan to Kabul, fell Wednesday afternoon and
Laghman, which also neighbors Ningarhar, collapsed Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the government troops would defend Sarobi
which guards access to the vital pro-Kabul government Bagram

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Soldiers Vote Day Ahead of Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's three armies began
voting today for new Bosnian leaders, one day ahead of Saturday's
national elections.
</P>
<P>
In eight special polling stations throughout the country,
active officers of the mainly Bosnian Muslim army, Bosnian Serb
army and the Bosnian Croat forces, all former enemies, will cast
their ballots.
</P>
<P>
However, Tom Leary, spokesman for the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said only 3,000 of the estimated
200,000 soldiers from all the three factions had registered to
vote today.
</P>
<P>
The polling stations, open to the military from 7 a.m. to 7
p.m. local time (0500-1700 GMT), will be outside the barracks of
the respective forces, said Leary.
</P>
<P>
The early voting of military forces is designed to help reduce
any potential risk of conflicts arising from the crossing of
uniformed refugees into their former residential areas now
controlled by another ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
Some three million Bosnians, about half of them war refugees,
are eligible to vote in the elections monitored by the
international community under the 1995 Dayton peace treaty
brokered by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Voters will choose a multi-ethnic three-man presidency,
parliament and regional assemblies that organizers hope will start
the process of reuniting Serbs, Muslims and Croats into one
country.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton accord envisages a Bosnia consisting of two entities
-- Republika Srpska and the Bosnian Federation -- bridged by a
national government with limited power.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) will ban military
training by any of the ethnic groups over the weekend to prevent
incidents which might disrupt the elections, IFOR spokesman Brett
Boudreau said.

<HEADLINE> Another Afghan Province Falls to Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban Islamic militia
has taken over the eastern Afghan province of Laghman two days
after the capture of Jalalabad, capital of eastern Nangarhar
province.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today from the Afghan
capital of Kabul, the provincial capital Mehtar Laam "was lost
just before midnight Thursday night."
</P>
<P>
No major fighting was reported as the Taliban advanced into
Mehtar Laam. And one report indicated that Laghman fell to the
Taliban without resistance.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest Taliban success could not be immediately
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Mehtar Lam is less than 50 kilometers from Jalalabad, which
fell to the Taliban Wednesday when Kabul government troops were
unable to defend the city.
</P>
<P>
The national highway between Jalalabad and Kabul is closed to
civilian traffic, which has caused a 50 percent hike in the price
of fuel in the capital city during the last few days.
</P>
<P>
After capturing Jalalabad, the Taliban jets are now well within
striking distance of Kabul by using Jalalabad airport.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports the Taliban are now heading toward
Sarobi, a major stronghold of Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Pakistan Promise to Strengthen Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Pakistan today
pledged to expand bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in
all possible fields for mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a joint communique issued here today by
Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Farooq Ahmed Leghari of
Pakistan after the latter's visit to this country.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, President Museveni welcomed the recent
opening of a resident diplomatic mission in Uganda by Pakistan as
well as a proposal to host an exhibition of Pakistani goods in
Kampala before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In furtherance of these objectives, the two presidents agreed
to support cooperation in agricultural research, fruits farming
and food processing.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two presidents witnessed the signing of
an agreement of economic and technical cooperation as well as the
exchange of instruments of ratification for an agreement of
cultural cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It said Pakistan promised to assist and facilitate private
sector initiatives through credit facilities for industrial
projects, especially in the building of cement and sugar plants,
the supply of light engineering equipment and in the setting up
of textile industries.
</P>
<P>
On regional issues, the two presidents stressed that peace and
stability were the corner stone for economic development and
called upon all actors in the African region to support efforts
designed to promote peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the two presidents expressed satisfaction over recent
moves toward regional integration among East African states and
appreciated progress made by the Common Market of Eastern and
Southern Africa in promoting inter-African trade.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed questions relating to peace and
security in the south Asian region. In this context, Leghari
briefed Museveni on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. Museveni
ardently hoped that a peaceful political solution could be found
to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, President Leghari extended an invitation to
President Museveni to pay a return visit to Pakistan. Museveni
gladly accepted. Yet the dates will be determined through
diplomatic channels.

<HEADLINE> Sales of New Cars Surge in Western Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new cars in western
Europe have grown more strongly than expected this year, with 9.08
million units registered in the first eight months, an increase of
6.2 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures, released by the European Automobile Manufacturers'
Association, suggest that the market is being driven more by
special incentives than strong economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
"The economic side provides no underlying direction to the
market. On fundamentals alone, you would expect sales to be down,
not up," said a motor industry analyst in London.
</P>
<P>
Germany has proved the motor for growth, with a rise of 7.4
percent in registrations for the first eight months. However, its
market has been driven by replacement demand and by the
introduction of new models which were attracting buyers.
</P>
<P>
Demand in France, Europe's third biggest car market, has also
been incentive driven. Registrations leapt by 21.6 percent in
July and 28.6 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Big markets without such special features performed much less
strongly. New car sales in Britain last month rose by a
disappointing 2.2 percent, while Italian sales dropped 7.5 percent
in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Though the surge of car sales has encouraged Europe's largest
manufacturing industry, analysts say, the continent's car industry
is still in the doldrums because of chronic overcapacity and
rising competition from lower-cost rivals, principally Asian.
</P>
<P>
Few forecasters expect the industry to come within sight of the
peak again before the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> China's Chemical Industry to Intensify its Opening Move (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical industry
will be full of confidence as it marches towards the world, Gu
Xiulian, chemical industry minister said today.
</P>
<P>
She told a news briefing in Beijing that in the coming five
years the chemical industry will continue to expand its foreign
trade, actively and rationally.
</P>
<P>
The industry will also effectively use foreign capital, while
vigorously developing foreign-oriented chemical enterprise groups,
and expanding foreign economic and technical exchanges and
cooperation, Gu said, adding that the aim is to raise the general
level of the foreign-oriented economy of the chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, in line with the above policy, the
Ministry of Chemical Industry has set three new targets:
</P>
<P>
First, on the premise of improvements in economic results and
increased market shares, the total volume of foreign trade in
chemical industry in the year 2000 will reach over 40 billion US
dollars, including 20 billion US dollars in exports.
</P>
<P>
Second, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, China will
welcome more foreign capital in a more rational way. The
accumulative foreign capital projected to be used by year of 2000
will reach 12 billion US dollars. This figure will account for 17
percent of the total investment of the chemical industry in the
9th Five Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Third, the country will form 100 foreign-oriented chemical
enterprises and enterprises groups by the year 2000. They will be
equipped with highly sophisticated equipment, technology,
management expertise, and reach a certain degree of economic scale
and international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Gu said that to hit the targets, the chemical industry will
actively expand the area of foreign capital infusion and
financing. Not only government loans will be used, but also the
industry will make good use of export credits and commercial
loans. It will set out to attract foreign businesses to join in
the construction of key projects, and the revamping of existing
enterprises. The investors will be encouraged to direct their
investments to the new and high tech industries, and the central
and western parts of China, to accelerate the structural
readjustment of the chemical industry.

The principal task of Pons is to push forward the Sino-European
joint project of building a 100-seat passenger plane in China,
said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit to China by the minister this year,
and it follows a visit to France in March by Chinese Prime

British Aerospace, French Aerospatiale, and the Italian Alenia
companies.
</P>
<P>
The 10 billion franc (2 billion U.S. dollar) project, joined on
the Chinese side by the Aviation Industries of China which is
associated with the Singapore Technologies Pte Ltd., will begin at
the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Airbus consortium is calling on China to
cooperate with Europe to build the giant A3XX transport cargo
plane.
</P>
<P>
Pons will be accompanied by the leaders of 20 French
corporations, including GEC Alsthom electronics corporation,
Aerospatiale space company, the National Company of Aviation
Motors Construction Studies (SNECMA), Sextant Avionique airspace
company, Air France, Spie Batignolles construction group, Bouygues

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Chief on Defense Policy in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese army chief
General Fu Quanyou said here that China's defense policy is
"defensive in nature," asserting that China will never pose a
threat to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Fu, chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army, made these remarks at the Indonesian National
Defense College Wednesday when he delivered a speech to nearly a
hundred high-ranking officers and cadets.
</P>
<P>
He said that, taking economic construction as the central task,
"China does not seek hegemony, foreign aggression or expansion,
nor will it send troops or set military bases abroad or enter into
military alliance with any other country."
</P>
<P>
"We oppose arms race and advocate that effective disarmament
and arms control be exercised in a fair, rational, comprehensive
and balanced spirit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The core and essence of China's defense policy, he noted, "is
to maintain world peace and the stability in China's surrounding
region, to safeguard independence and state sovereignty and to
advance reform, opening-up and the development of the national
economy."
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou pointed out that China has exercised strict control
over defense spending and maintained a low level of the input for
defense construction since 1980.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he said, China's defense expenditure accounted for
4.34 percent of the GDP, but the proportion decreased to 1.11
percent in 1995, the lowest in many years. In contrast, the
proportion of defense expenditure in the GDP of certain big powers
were usually over 2 percent, and some even over 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's defense spending, compared with that of the developed
countries, "remains low in its total amount," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's defense budget in 1996, he said, is about 8.4 billion
US dollars, and that of the United States is 265 billion dollars,
Japan 48.45 billion, France 38 billion, United Kingdom 32.58
billion and Russia 16.58 billion.

Fu said that since the end of the 1970s, China has started a
planned and comprehensive transfer of defense technologies to
civilian use. Some two-thirds of the industry departments formerly
in charge of military production have been changed into general
corporations engaging in the research and production of civilian
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that China has made unremitting efforts towards
complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. China has solemnly
undertaken not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time
and in any circumstances and unconditionally not to use or
threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states
or nuclear-weapon-free zones.
</P>
<P>
China has all along advocated the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and the realization of
comprehensive nuclear test ban towards this end, he added.
Recently the Chinese government declared that China would suspend
its nuclear tests from July 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou further said that China "is greatly concerned with
the security environment of this region. It always commits itself
to dialogue and cooperation with all other countries."
</P>
<P>
The general also mentioned in his speech the preaching by
certain people that "China, once developed, will pose a threat to
other countries".
</P>
<P>
He said, "This is utterly groundless and ulteriously motivated.
It aims at containing the development of China, sowing discord
between China and its neighboring countries and facilitating their
arms sales. China's policies and actions lay bare their lies and
ill intentions."
</P>
<P>
General Fu arrived in Jakarta Tuesday on a six-day visit as the
guest of Indonesian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Feisal
Tanjung.

<P>
She also emphasized that the chemical industry will continue to
strengthen cooperation activities in coastal areas, give good play
to special economic zones, economic development zones, new and
high-tech development zones, bonded zones and chemical parks. The
industry will expand cooperation, and raise the opening level and
efficiency of the sector, and gradually push forward towards
central and western China.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the volume of chemical foreign trade reached 29.7
billion US dollars, including 11.6 billion US dollars of
exports. By the end of 1995 the accumulative foreign capital
utilized in the chemical system amounted to six billion US
dollars. The country now has nearly 80 chemical enterprises, each
capable of generating over 10 million US dollars per year through
exports of chemicals, the minister said, quoting statistics.
</P>
<P>
She said that new features have cropped up in cooperation
between Chinese and foreign chemical circles. The cooperation has
been extended from simple imports of technology to all round
cooperation, involving research, production, product development,
personnel training and environmental protection, from mere
investment in individual projects, to participation in regional
development, from small projects to projects with large financial
input and high technical content, from the involvement of a few
large chemical companies to the inclusion of many medium- and
small-sized companies.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Keen to Establish Closer Links with ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is keen to
establish closer links and full dialogue partnership with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by Pakistan's Commerce Minister Ahmed
Mukhtar in Karachi Thursday while addressing an Indonesian
businessmen's delegation after inaugurating the first single
country trade exhibition in the southern port city.
</P>
<P>
Mukhtar said that Indonesia was a leading member country of
ASEAN and Pakistan could use the Indonesian good offices in
developing trade and economic relations with the other ASEAN
nations.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that ASEAN was now moving towards
establishing an Asian Free Trade Area and it would be quite proper
for Pakistan to be within that group to accelerate its own
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the Indonesian exhibition, Mukhtar said that the
exhibition, the first single one by any country in Pakistan, was
an event signifying the enhancing cooperation between the two
countries in the field of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan's policy of deregulation, liberal trade
and encouragement of private sector enterprises, adopted in the
late 1980s, achieved full momentum in 1993-94 when the government
finalized and introduced a liberal, snag-free, versatile and
multi-dimensional foreign investment code.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Economic
Affairs, Shahid Hasan Khan, said that Pakistan aimed to double the
existing volume of trade with Indonesia within the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Thursday at a seminar on Indonesia-Pakistan Economic
Collaboration in Karachi, Hasan Khan said that the economic and
trade ties between Pakistan and Indonesia was not comparable to
the socio-political relations being enjoyed by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The value of Indonesian exports to Pakistan in the last fiscal
year was 118.8 million US dollars while Pakistan's exports to
Indonesia amounted to 102 million dollars, according to Hasan
Khan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Indonesia, both ranking within the top 10 most
populous nations in the world, have more similarities than
differences, he said, adding the two countries should further
enhance their bilateral economic and trade relationship.

PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Five people who ran a skiing

imprudence in a January skiing accident, the regional "Le Dauphine
Libere" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed after being buried when a snow storm hit the
skiing ground in Alpe d'Huez, a mountain in Grenoble, southeast
France.
</P>
<P>
The court in Grenoble said that the five did not clear the
ground of the snow which fell during a previous storm, thus made
things worse when snow storm hit again, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the attorney general of Grenoble did not confirm the
report.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt, Rebel Group to Discuss Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) has not outrightly rejected the peace agreement
signed between the government and the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) early this month, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The peace pact will be the crux of the initial round of
negotiations between the government and the MILF later this month,
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
Torres met Tuesday with MILF Vice Chairman Ghazali Jaafar and
the two sides agreed to sign a new ceasefire agreement on
September 19.
</P>
<P>
The new ceasefire agreement will expand the coverage of an
existing one from areas with government projects to the whole on
Mindanao for the period of peace talks between the two sides. The
talks are expected to take place within ten days after the signing
of the new ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The MILF had earlier announced that they cannot support the
peace pact signed by the government and the MNLF as it does not
reflect the spirit of the Tripoli Agreement in 1976.
</P>
<P>
But Torres said that this issue will be threshed out during the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"If they feel that this agreement that has been reached with
the MNLF is already the implementation of the Tripoli Agreement,
they will join. This is what we will be discussing with them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Torres said that as most of the provisions of the Tripoli
Agreement had already been incorporated in the September 2 Peace
Agreement, the government will just see whether the MILF would
like to raise other matters.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, the government and the MNLF signed an agreement in the
Libyan capital of Tripoli on autonomy in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF will form small committees to
discuss issues related to the talks, including the venue of the
talks, the possible involvement of the Organization of Islamic
Conference in the talks and the possibility of a third party in
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
After the government and the MNLF signed the Mindanao peace
accord on September 2, the MILF became the biggest threat to peace
and stability in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Ariane to Send Another Japanese Telecommunication Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

PARIS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Arianespace company has
signed a contract with the private Japanese Satellite System (JSS)
to launch a JCSAT-5 telecommunication satellite by the end of 1997
or early 1998, said the space company today.
</P>
<P>
JCSAT-5, the second JSS satellite to be sent by the Ariane
rocket after the JCSAT-1 was launched in March 1989, will also be
the 12th Japanese satellite to be sent into space by the
Arianespace from the Kourou space center in French Guyana.
</P>
<P>
Built by the California-based Hughes Space and Communications
Company, JCSAT is equipped with 32 transmitters and will be put
into an orbit of 36,000 kilometers high above the equator in the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will provide telecommunications service to Japan,
Hawaii and other Asia-Pacific countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The Arianespace now has 41 contracts in hand, with the
Malaysian Measat-II satellite and Arab-IIB satellite of the Arab
League to be launched on November 7.

<HEADLINE> Arab FMs to Discuss Middle East Situation in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of the
Arab League (AL) member states will hold an emergency session in
Cairo Saturday to discuss the peace process in the Middle East and
the serious situation caused by U.S. strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital said that the topics
of the Arab foreign ministers' meeting will be focused on the
dangers threatening the Middle East peace process and commitment
to the principles defined in the Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Issues related to the implementation of the U.N. Security
Council resolutions, the land-for-peace formula, Israeli attempt
to Judaize Jerusalem as well as the Israeli government's decision
to abolish the freeze on settlement expansion in the occupied Arab
territories will also be discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers will also discuss ways and means to
revive coordination among the Arab parties with the objective of
adopting a unified Arab stance so as to persuade Israel into
resuming negotiations in accordance with the Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to examine the events and deteriorating
situation in northern Iraq, particularly Turkey's intention to
establish a security zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish plan has reportedly drawn strong criticism and
absolute rejection from Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believed the Arab foreign ministers'
meeting is of great importance as it takes place amid grave
political developments with regard to the peace process and
Israel's refusal to respect the principles of the international
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also coinciding with an explosive situation in
the Gulf region where the U.S. is preparing to launch a third
strike against Iraq, a strike which western media believe will be
more extensive and much stronger than the previous two.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the meeting is of great significance in terms of
coordinating Arab stances in confronting the new challenges, the
observers said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu is still
holding fast to its intransigent attitude towards the peace
process. It insists on the resumption of negotiations with Syria
without preconditions, and has not set a date for the long-delayed
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
So, it is incumbent upon the Arab states to adopt a definite
stance to safeguard Arab rights and interests, to confront
the Israeli attitude towards the peace process and to call
on the international community to exercise pressure on the
Turkish government to abandon its decision to establish a
security belt in northern Iraq, observers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund has expressed its appreciation of the achievements of the
Chinese government and society in protecting the rights of
children.
</P>
<P>
Lakshman Wickramasinghe, a senior official of the fund, who
works in China, said the country has been carrying out the
Convention on the Rights of Children and has formulated a series
of laws and regulations protecting children's interests and rights.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks at a recent training class on
children's rights held in the capital city of Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 local officials from 17 Chinese cities, who
oversee children's rights issues, attended the training class.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and overseas jurists and sociologists, and officials
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, State Education Commission
and Supreme People's Court, spoke to the participants.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been paying great attention to
protecting children, and has worked to foster their education and
welfare, according to Chen Peijie, an official with the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Protection of Minors went into effect in 1992, and
other related laws and regulations have also been drafted, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's law-enforcement departments strictly punish those
committing crimes on children. In addition, the Chinese government
is implementing the Outlines on Development Plans for Children in
the 1990s, which details goals and effective measures in the area
of children's rights.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, more than three million retired people have
organized to take care of minors, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
UN documents show that Chinese children enjoy better nutrition,
public health and education than their counterparts in other
developing countries, and the death rate of children in China is
far less than in other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
UN officials also praised the high inoculation rate among
Chinese children.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin's Judicial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The court system in the
largest industrial city in north China, Tianjin, has reformed its
traditional method of handling economic cases.
</P>
<P>
A new court will allow open debate in the courtroom, with the
parties involved able to state their case and cross-examine the
other side.
</P>
<P>
The traditional forms involved five steps: examining evidence
of indictment and defense; interviewing; investigating facts;
mediating; and holding a court session.
</P>
<P>
The reformed procedures involve examining the main points of
the indictment and defense, the relation of the various parties,
relevant evidence obtained in the process of a court session, and
pertinent evidence examined by the court.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the court system in Tianjin
used the new procedures to try about 5,700 cases involving
economic disputes and settled some 4,500.

<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today reimposed a ban on the gathering and sale of shellfish
from the entire Manila Bay following another case of red tide
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The president approved the reimposition of the red tide ban on
the recommendation of Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica only
three days after the ban was lifted in the bay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he ordered that alternative livelihood opportunities
be provided to displace shellfish growers or producers in the bay.
</P>
<P>
The Red Tide Task Force, a special force established by Ramos
to supervise the development of red tide in the country, lifted
the ban in the eastern and northern parts of the bay on September
6 after three consecutive weekly samplings yielded negative
results.
</P>
<P>
However, the Department of Health issued a public warning
against the harvesting, transporting, selling and eating of
shellfish from the Manila Bay.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches "Back to Work" Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore launched today
its "Back to Work" program to attract housewives, older persons
and displaced workers back to workforce, so as to reduce the
country's reliance on foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Dr Lee Boon Yang said that the "Back to Work"
program is part of the country's overall objective to help raise
local labor force participation rates. "The program is focused at
people outside the workforce, including housewives, older persons
and displaced workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that because of Singapore's limited manpower resources,
companies had to recruit foreign workers to supplement their
manpower needs, Dr Lee revealed that there are currently more than
350,000 foreign workers in Singapore, constituting some 20 percent
of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore is becoming increasingly reliant on foreign workers.
While they can help to boost our economic growth, the presence of
a large pool of unskilled foreign workers and over reliance on
them can have serious social, economic and political implications
for Singapore," the Minister warned.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of depending heavily on foreign workers to achieve
economic growth, we should study how to better utilize our own
manpower resources. Apart from developing the potential of our
existing workforce to the fullest, we also need to identify
sources of local labor that have yet to be fully tapped, and work
out measures to attract these potential workers to enter the
workforce," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China strongly opposes the
U.S. threat of new military attacks against Iraq, and urges
parties concerned to exercise restraint to prevent the further
escalation of tension in the Gulf region, a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman said here today.

<P>
"The Chinese government is deeply concerned with, and disturbed

</P>
<P>
When asked to comment the reports that the U.S. is reinforcing
the presence of its air force in the Gulf and threatening to
launch new attacks against Iraq, Shen said the U.S. threats of new
attacks against Iraq would "only further aggravate the tension of
the Gulf situation" and China is expressing its "strong
opposition."
</P>
<P>
"China has always held that the issues left over from the Gulf
crisis should be settled in a fair and just way on the basis of
relevant U.N. resolutions and through political channels, so that
peace and stability can be resumed in the Gulf region as early as
possible," Shen added.

items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In Paris, one in eight children refuses to go to the public
schools designated for him or her by the authorities because of
"bad reputation." Many parents are sending their children to
"good" schools regardless of the principle of equality in public
schools. This could lead to the apparence of school-ghettos in the
French capital.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac said Thursday in Poland that
he wishes Poland to be a member of the European Union by 2000.
This is the first time for a French president to join Germany to
give a specific calendar of EU enlargement to Poland. Former
President Francois Mitterrand said in 1991 that it would take
"tens and tens of years" for Central and Eastern European
countries to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is preparing for new strikes against Iraq
by sending eight F-117A stealth bombers to Kuwait and four B-52
bombers to the British-ruled island of Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean. The USS Eisenhower aircraft carrier is also moving towards
the Middle East from the Adriatic Sea.

<P>
The shipment of uranium, contained in 50 specially sealed

The unloading and transport of the containers to the enrichment
facility will run through September 19, the company said.

<HEADLINE> hke091333 - Ramos Asks ASEAN to Build Regional Legal Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said today that members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) must transcend the differences in their
legal and judicial systems and build a legal framework to resolve
regional disputes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at the third meeting of the ASEAN ministers of
Law, Ramos said ASEAN judicial and legal cooperation is a vital
force for insuring and enhancing more effective regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Although the member nations have different legal systems, we
recognize our mutual interest in developing a legal framework
within which disputes and differences between states can be
resolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more important, the president said, all ASEAN
members realized how deeply the rule of law underpins the rise of
Southeast Asia as a dynamic center of growth in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the challenge now facing ASEAN is "how to transcend
their differences, so that we can make our way in the world
together."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In the same speech, Ramos also dismissed the possibility of the
Philippines' shift from the present presidential system to a
parliamentary form of government.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a parliamentary system before, but it did not
work," he replied to a question from one of the ASEAN ministers.
"It was not effective."
</P>
<P>
President Ramos stressed once again at the meeting that he is
only good up to June 30, 1998 as mandated by the constitution and
will not seek a second term of office.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today
criticized The United States for ignoring the world opinion on its
actions taken on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today the
latest U.S. threat on Iraq shows that it ignores the views of the
international community on the need to solve the crisis in the
Gulf region amicably.
</P>
<P>
He said the reported preparations of a third strike by
Washington on Iraq within a period of slightly more than a week
would only aggravate the situation in the region and increase
tension which would not benefit anyone.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Americans have their supporters, various reports
show that many countries are not happy with past and future
actions taken by the US on this matter," he said after meeting
Vietnam's National Assembly President Nong Duc Manh who arrived
here Tuesday for a six-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia also hoped Iraq would be more careful in
its actions on this matter, adding that efforts at the diplomatic
level were crucial to avert tension.
</P>
<P>
He said he would discuss the matter in detail with the foreign
ministers of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC)
countries during the U.N. general assembly in New York at the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
American fighter jets were reported to be making preparations

BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen conferred with his Bangladesh
counterpart Abdus Samad Azad here today, and praised the
Bangladesh government's support of the development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Azad is accompanying Bangladesh Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, who is currently in Beijing on an official visit to
China.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that a series of agreements signed by the two
countries during Prime Minister Hasina's China trip are not only
significant to the advancement of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, but make a valuable contribution to the growth of the
China-Bangladesh ties.
</P>
<P>
"It is the firm and unswerving policy of the Chinese government
to continue to strengthen and develop Sino-Bangladesh relations
featured by good-neighborly and mutually-beneficial ties," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Azad said that Prime Minister Hasina and the new Bangladesh
government under her leadership give priority to furthering
relations with China in its foreign affairs, adding that he
himself will continue to contribute positively to expanding
Bangladesh-China relations as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh side is very satisfied with the outcome of

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistani Rupee's Devaluation Can </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's economic
prospects are unlikely to be brightened much by a substantial
devaluation of its rupee this week as part of the government's
efforts to improve the country's trade balance and stimulate the
overall economy, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Tuesday readjusted the rupee
down by 3.65 percent against the U.S. dollar, the seventh
devaluation since the beginning of the new fiscal year in July.
The earlier devaluations had made the rupee lose 1.45 percent of
its value cumulatively.
</P>
<P>
"This action is to strengthen, not to weaken the economy of the
country," said SBP Governor Muhammad Yaqub.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the latest devaluation would help boost the
country's export, whose target was set at 10 billion dollars in
the current fiscal year, and curtail the rising import.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that Pakistan's exports had increased following a
seven-percent devaluation of the rupee last October.
</P>
<P>
However, local economists said that the devaluation of the
local currency was not as effective in shoring up exports as the
government had expected.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that since last October, the country's
exports grew by five percent, far below the planned target of 14
percent, while the total export volume in the last fiscal year
stood at a mere 8.6 billion dollars, 600 million dollars short of
the target.
</P>
<P>
Imports of machinery and raw materials are two major factors
that determine the scale of the country's export, said the
economists.
</P>
<P>
With the devaluation of the rupee, the imported items will
definitely become more expensive, thus increasing the cost of
export items.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the real cause behind the decline of
the country's export is the double-digit inflation, lower
productivity and higher cost, and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been running at over 10 percent for the past
three years, forcing wages and cost of materials to go up, while
relatively lower productivity further pushed up the production
cost.
</P>
<P>
The increasing input of electricity, gas and water also added
to the misery of exporters. Mismanagement and lack of quality
control have made export industries less competitive, the
economists said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the textile sector, which accounts for 50 percent of
the country's foreign exchange earnings, is facing an acute
shortage of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's textile industry is crying for cotton after the
country exported a large portion of its cotton in the last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation would only encourage cotton producers to export
more, which would worsen the shortage of raw materials, the
economists warned.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as the SBP governor admitted, the rupee's
devaluation would add one billion U.S. dollars to the country's
swollen foreign debts and debt servicing, which amount to 28
billion U.S. dollars and eat up 37 percent of the country's budget
for the year 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Yaqub said that the devaluation would only raise the consumer
price index by 0.52 percentage points above the original scenario
for the year and would have little impact on the livelihood of the
ordinary people on the street.
</P>
<P>
However, with rupee's devaluation, Pakistan's large imports of
food items and petroleum products are expected to push up the
price index and make it more difficult for the government to keep
the inflation rate within one digit.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the devaluation would also bring good news for
some sectors of the economy, the economists noted.
</P>
<P>
Pickups are expected in direct foreign investments in the
country as well as home remittance, which has dropped sharply from
around three billion U.S. dollars to one billion U.S. dollars in
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The SBP expressed the hope for the one-step devaluation, rather
than creeping readjustments, to end the speculation in the kerb
market and narrow down the official and open market rates.
</P>
<P>
The government is also expecting an increase in revenues in
terms of import duty after the rupee's devaluation.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Parliamentary Conference will Benefit Mutual Understanding: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
today that his greatest wish for an upcoming gathering of world
parliamentarians is that the meeting will "increase understanding,
promote friendship and expand cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's parliament, said that the
upcoming 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference will help increase
foreign parliaments' understanding of China, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Parliamentary Union, set up in 1889, is a global
organization of parliaments of sovereign states, and the largest
international parliamentary organization. It now has 135 members
and four associate members. It holds conferences every spring and
autumn.
</P>
<P>
Tian, who is also chairman of the Chinese Organizing Committee
of the meeting, said at a press conference that the committee,
which was established in 1994, was responsible for extensive and
detailed preparations.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ahmaed Fathy Sorour, president of the Inter-Parliamentary
Council, said that a total of 1,400 representatives from 133
countries, including 75 speakers, and some 600 parliamentarians,
will attend the conference, to be held in Beijing from September
16 to 21.
</P>
<P>
There are 105 female parliamentarians in the group, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sorour, who is the speaker of the Egyptian People's
Assembly, said that Chinese government has worked hard to prepare
for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
China plays a major role in the international community, and
will play an even greater role in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held for the first time in China, is an indication
that the country has opened its door wider to the outside world,
he went on to say, and this is a chance for world parliaments to
understand China and cooperate with it.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century will be China's, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two principal themes that will be debated at the meeting
focus on the promotion of human right, particularly of women
and children, and policies and strategies to ensure the rights to
food in this time of globalization of the economy and trade
liberalization, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
He said that the right to food falls under the category of civil
rights. The Chinese government has been making great efforts to
provide food for its people, and this requires development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Cornillon, secretary general of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, said that a supplementary item for discussion will be
chosen from proposals put forward by different parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Some of the proposals deal with the US's missile strikes
against Iraq, the effect of economic sanctions on peace and
security, the US Helms-Burton Law and D'Amato-Kennedy Law (on
sanctions against those doing business with certain countries),
proposed by Iraq, Cuba and Iran, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also hold a women's parliamentary meeting
to discuss the influence of poverty on women and women's
participation in politics.

<HEADLINE> More Private Chinese Businesses Going Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
private enterprises in the wealthy south China city of Guangzhou
are opening companies overseas.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that some 100 enterprises from the
private sector are selling their products to Japan, the Republic
of Korea, European and American countries, Hong Kong, and Macao,
and about 50 have set up branches overseas.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, Guangzhou had 18,163 private
enterprises, 11,189 of which are corporations.
</P>
<P>
With the scale of business increasing and technology constantly
improving, an increasing number of these enterprises are planning
to look into markets overseas.
</P>
<P>
When the China Jingyi Carving Factory, a manufacturer of
imitation ivory works, found its market overseas promising and
that marketing its products through foreign trade companies was
simply not adequate, so it set up a branch company in the United
States in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, taking advantage of the proximity, private firms
usually make Hong Kong and Macao their first choice or their first
step in getting into overseas operations.

BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today he was satisfied with the smooth development of the
Sino-Bangladesh relations and attributed the progress to long-term
joint efforts by the two governments and their people.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, Jiang welcomed the Prime
Minister to China, and congratulated her on assuming the

</P>
<P>
Jiang said he appreciated the Prime Minister and her father for
their contribution to the development of the Sino-Bangladesh
relations, saying the Amami League led by the Prime Minister has
had long-standing exchanges with China. He also believed that the
bilateral relations would improve, economic links and trade in
particular, through joint efforts, during Hasina's term as Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
China and Bangladesh have supported and closely cooperated with
each other in both bilateral and multi-lateral issues, Jiang
said. "We thank the Bangladesh government for its valuable support
rendered to China in the issues of human rights, Taiwan and
Tibet," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked the Prime Minister to convey his regards to
President Abdur Rahman Biswas.
</P>
<P>

development, and hopes that China will attain its ultimate goal as
soon as possible. She said her government would continue to
advance the relations between Bangladesh and China.

URUMQI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The large Altun Nature Reserve
in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China's northwest is in
the forefront of the country's drive to protect its ecology and
encourage wildlife to multiply.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is set to invest 17 million yuan in
developing a gene bank for animal and plant species and a center
to domesticate animals for scientific research in the reserve, by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The 45,000-sq.km. nature reserve is 4,500 meters above sea
level and is the largest of its kind in the world. It is home to
more than 60 wild animals that are on the verge of extinction and
300 important rare plant species.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of wild yaks, donkeys, antelope, Tibetan
Gazelles, argali sheep, and Pseudois Nayaur roam freely, grazing
on the grass, while flocks of black-necked cranes, brown-headed
gulls, bare-headed geese, and other birds take their time looking
for food in the vast grassy marshland near the region's lakes and
snowy mountains.
</P>
<P>
Even an approaching automobile fails to arouse much interest in

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Strike at Guerrilla Bases in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Following an armed clash
with Lebanese Moslem guerrillas, Israel this morning launched an
air raid at suspected guerrilla bases of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in south Lebanon said that around 10:00
a.m. (07:00 GMT), at least two Israeli helicopters carried out
the air strike at Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a
ridge often used by Hezbollah militants as a spring board
for attacks against Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli planes fired several air-to-surface missiles at
the targets at Wadi Akhdar and Jebal Al-Rafih in the area,
the police sources said, but without giving a word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
The air raid was accompanied by Israeli bombardments at the
Litani River basin and the Gabrikha heights, according to the
police sources.
</P>
<P>
A fierce clash erupted earlier this morning between Hezbollah
guerrillas and a joint patrol of Israeli forces and Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army militia inside the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone" in south Lebanon, and one guerrilla was killed.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the occupied border strip reported that
the Hezbollah fighters used machine guns and rocket-propelled
grenades in the fighting, which took place at 7:00 a.m.
(04:00 GMT) at Wadi Slouki.
</P>
<P>
Whether there was any casualty among the Israeli forces and
their client militia were still unknown.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, announced in a statement that one group of its
fighters carried out an ambush against the Israeli-SLA foot
patrol at Wadi Slouki deeply inside the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the enemy fell in the ambush, the resistant
fighters attacked with machine guns and rockets, killing and
wounding several elements in the patrol," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Until the morning clashes, a relative calm had prevailed in
south Lebanon, the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli
conflict, since a five-phase general election started in Lebanon
in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The forth round of election was held in the south last
Sunday, in which Hezbollah candidates won four seats through
an Syrian-brokered electional coalition with another major Shiite
group, the pro-Syrian moderate Amal movement headed by House
Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
All conflicting sides in the area were complying with the
a tacit truce, apparently out of a fear that an escalation
of tension could have hampered the parliamentary election
in Lebanon, local observers noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the 850-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in late 1970s and claimed it a "security
zone" in 1985 in a bid to prevent cross-border attacks by
guerrilla in northern Israel.

<P>
The nature reserve was founded in 1983, and has gotten about a
million yuan in support from the Chinese government
annually. Because of a barrage of publicity about animal
protection for several years, most of the hunters living in the
reserve have changed their old ways and have turned to herding
sheep and cattle, having achieved a truce with the wild animals
and birds.
</P>
<P>
Yasin Osman, a young Uygur, is looking after an abandoned baby
antelope. "To prevent it from being injured by sheep dogs, I've
kept it with me, and fed it powdered milk that I got from a shop
about a thousand kilometers away," the 25-year-old man says.
</P>
<P>
Yasin explains that he tried to get two of his goats to nurse
the pet antelope, but they rejected their "adopted son", kicking
it or butting it with their horns. "To feed the baby, I have to
push the goats to help the antelope to feed," he says.
</P>
<P>
One woman, Pademu, seems to find nothing unusual about caring
for a two-month-old black-necked crane, feeding it 400 grams of
chopped mutton. "I'll let her return to the wild when she is
full-grown and able to fly," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Some biologists who have visited the reserve say that it is one
of the world's rare bio-geographical regions. In addition to its
variety of plant species, it contains the world's highest desert,
a karst formation, an interesting glacier, snowy peaks, and dozens
of high-altitude lakes. It is also abundant in gold and other
minerals.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhiqiang, deputy director of the Xinjiang Regional Bureau
of Environmental Protection and the highest administrative
official in charge of the reserve, is convinced of the viability
of developing the reserve into a model of wildlife protection with
the support of the Chinese people and international
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Takes Israel's War Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's recent threat of
launching a "scorched earth war" in case its so-called "Lebanon
First" proposal was rejected has arosed concern of Beirut, and
the threat has ever since been the focus of contacts between
Syrian and Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Only several hours after Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
wound up a brief visit to the Syrian capital of Damascus for talks
with Syrian President Hafez Assad and Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri also paid a visit
to the Syrian capital Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Hariri held a meeting with Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam before returning to Beirut earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking official at the Foreign Ministry said
today that his government "looked seriously at the Israeli
threats which was voiced Wednesday by General Antoine Lahd,
commander of Israel's client South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his surprise at the "dangerous threats in light of
the relatively calm situation in south Lebanon in the past
days."
</P>
<P>
What more concerned the Lebanese government was the way by
which the threats were issued, and it meant that the Israeli
suggestion had obtained an agreement from at least a Lebanese
side through a collaborator of the Jewish state, the source said
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the threats that came following Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Betanyahu's visit to Washington and his
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton also worried the
Lebanese leaders, the source added.
</P>
<P>
He attached a profound significance to the visit of Boueiz to
the Syrian capital in view of the deadlocked peace process and
the Israeli threats against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At his news conference, Lahd noted that "Israel is insisting on
the Lebanese First proposal," warning of Israeli military strikes
more destructive and frightful than that launched by Israel in
south Lebanon in April which killed some 200 Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
"A substitute (of the Lebanon First) will be large-scale
opperations which no one knows where they will stop this time,"
the commander of Israel's surrogate militia claimed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the military strikes would "destroy all that
has been built by Lebanon in the last few years."
</P>
<P>
The "Lebanon First" offers a unilateral Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon provided that the Moslem guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, are disarmed and
arrangements are agreed for security on the Lebanese-Israeli
border.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was put forward by Netanyahu shortly after he
took office in June.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which have been coordinating closely, have
flatly rejected the proposal, arguing that it is aimed at driving
a wedge between Beirut and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a three-hour meeting with the Syrian president
in Damascus Thursday, the Lebanese foreign minister confirmed
that the talks dealt with the Israeli threats.
</P>
<P>
"However, we never accept this blackmail as long as the
threat is aimed at drawing Lebanon to (accept) unknown
suggestions," the foreign minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from the Syrian capital, the foreign
minister went to the Presidential Palace and briefed President
Elias Hrawi on the outcomes of his talks in Damascus, which also
dealt with the regioal developments.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the Israeli threats would be discussed by
Boueiz and Arab foreign ministers in Cairo Saturday, where they
will hold a regular conference of the Arab League Council.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Troops Withdraw from Positions in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Syria has pulled some troops
out of a number of important positions in Beirut and its suburbs
over the past few days, several sources confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 35,000 Syrian soldiers are deployed over two
thirds of the Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that it was not possible to affirm right away
whether the withdrawal was taking place as part of a redeployment
operation or that it was a mere thinning of the permanent Syrian
military presence in the Lebanese capital.
</P>
<P>
The sources quote an eye witness as saying that units of the
Syrian armed forces were pulling out from a number of positions in
and around the Lebanese capital over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
At the small hours Thursday morning, scores of Syrian
military trucks were seen carrying Syrian soldiers together with
their belongings and moving northwards along the coastal line.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Syrian troops have vacated a huge camp located
several hundred meters from the lighthouse, which overlooks the sea
in Beirut. This camp has been the most visible symbol of Syrian presence
in Beirut since 1987.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that apart from pulling out from a number
of positions, the Syrians have cut down their presence in other
positions by 50 per cent.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, Syrian troops have also withdrawn from
several positions in the Mount Lebanon area, an action described by
Lebanese security sources as defensive redeployment operation, in
the wake of Israeli threats to attack Syrian forces in
Lebanon.

to focus on human resource development in their joint activities.
</P>
<P>
The participants reaffirmed their commitment to the
multilateral trading system and the need for both regional trading
arrangements to reinforce the process of liberalization within the
WTO (World Trade Organization) framework.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and the CER reached 15.8 billion U.S. dollars in
1995, up by 49.8 percent compared with 7.9 billion U.S. dollars in
1990. The ASEAN market accounts for 14 percent of the CER's
exports.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed concern at the extra-territorial
application of a recent U.S. legislation (the D'Amato and the
Helms-Borton Acts) which imposes sanctions on countries or
enterprises doing business with Cuba and several other countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers decided to hold their next round of consultations
in September 1997. The first round of informal consultations was
held in Brunei Darussalam in September 1995.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Calls for Reconciliation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman called on the nation to exercise tolerance, seek
reconciliation and respect the opinions of others.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made the remarks on the eve of the Hebrew New Year, Rosh
Hashana 5757, which begins tonight and continues through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president warned the nation against extremist behavior. "In
this past year, there was one horrendous and shocking event which
cast its shadow over all others -- the assassination of premier
Yitzhak Rabin, of blessed memory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was gunned down after a peace rally in Tel Aviv on the
night of November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that "on the threshold of the new year, at this
time of soul-searching and repentance, the nation has to learn
the lessons of this painful experience so that it should not be
repeated."
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that there are again worrisome
manifestations, saying that following the first period of shock
when verbal violence was toned down and the public debate
became more tolerant, relations between the different sectors of
the nation -- religious and secular, left and right -- have once
again worsened, and violence in the political system as well as
mutual hatred have again come to the fore.
</P>
<P>
"No less worrisome are the manifestations of understanding
and sympathy for the assassination and the assassin that have
come to light here and there, even if they are not widespread,"
he said, apparently referring to the so-called "Amir Fan Club"
formed by three high school students.
</P>
<P>
Yigal Amir, Rabin's assassin, was a student of the Bar-Ilan
University when he committed the assassination.
</P>
<P>
"Let us all take upon ourselves for the future," Weizman
said.

BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of Peony credit
cards issued by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICB),
the country's largest state bank, has surpassed seven million.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for more than half of the country's total
number of credit cards, sources from the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Credit cards are becoming increasingly popular in China, as

<HEADLINE> New Timber Export Policy to Increase Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The newly introduced timber
export policy in Zambia will regulate the exploitation of forests
and increase foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Environment Minister William
Harrington at a function to launch the timber export policy in
Lusaka on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to rules and regulations contained in the timber
export policy, charcoal will not be allowed for export. The
policy also restricts exports of swan timber to a maximum of 75
percent of production of indigenous timber in the first year.
</P>
<P>
Harrington said the policy has also provided for the
establishment of a fund to which timber and wood exporters will
have to contribute.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be for exclusive purpose of reforestation and
management of both indigenous and exotic forests by the Forestry
Department.
</P>
<P>
He noted that uncontrolled exports lead to losing revenue by
the government and destruction of forests.
</P>
<P>
Currently timber merchants export unprocessed wood to markets
in the south at a cheaper price and import finished goods from
the same source at a much higher price, he said, adding, "Such
unequal terms of trade cannot be allowed to continue."

<HEADLINE> China Wants To Improve Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China's highest governing
body, the State Council, recently told local governments to remove
various local restrictions on automobiles in order to improve the
country's auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say that the move may help the automobile
business pick up after a sluggish period of more than half a year.
</P>
<P>
Some cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan have
come up with local policies, either restricting the use of cheaper
cars or allowing taxi companies to use cars manufactured in other
cities, causing a slump in the automotive industry with the number
of cars in stock on the rise.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the State Council stated that economy cars
will remain the focus of the automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China has decided to provide automobile loans for up to 70 percent
of the purchase price, and the Communications Bank of China is set
to provide similar loans.
</P>
<P>
China produced 757,900 motor vehicles in the first half of this
year, but sold only 700,000 units. It may need three million motor
vehicles by the year 2000, with cars accounting for 1.5 million,
and six million vehicles by 2010, of them, 4 million cars.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged local governments to pay more attention to
building roads rather than merely paying attention to economy or
midget cars.

<HEADLINE> Building Materials Chain Stores Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The deputy director of
China's State Bureau of Building Materials Industry said that
ideas borrowed from developed countries, such as the super chain
store, suit the healthy development of China's building materials
market.
</P>
<P>
So, China is developing its fast-growing building materials
market by establishing more super chain stores as super bazaars,
making it a priority of the administration, according to the
deputy director, Yang Zhiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Yang said, however, domestic building materials market is
scattered and in a state of chaos, mainly because of substandard
operations. Most building materials are sold in hundreds of
thousands of small shops. In Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai alone,
there are more than 17,000 of these shops. The result is small
scale, prices that keep going up, and no guarantee of quality or
service.
</P>
<P>
China's building materials industry has been growing at an
annual rate of 38 percent. The industry last year had six billion
U.S. dollars in total output value, making it a major force in
China's consumer society, but one lacking good commercial methods.
</P>
<P>
But, China's first building materials super store, "The Home
Way", has just been completed in the suburbs of Tianjin. The
building covers 40,000 sq.m. and cost 200 million yuan. It will
open next month and will use computers and a group of workers who
have been sent to the US for training.
</P>
<P>
According to executives with North China Building Materials
Company, one of the backers of the new bazaar, some 20,000 to
40,000 products will be available in the store, half of them
imports. The super bazaar will even have a model American room set
up as a display.
</P>
<P>
Yang said he believes that the super chain stores will help
change things, with consumers having greater choice, paying lower
prices, and getting the best quality products.
</P>
<P>
The officials from the North China Building Materials Company
said that the company will invest in 21 more of these super
building materials stores in a chain across the country over the
next five years. There will be five of them built in Beijing
alone, one of which is now under construction.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Accommodate 2,000 Refugees from Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Around 2,000 refugees will be
evacuated from northern Iraq and be settled in Turkish refugee
camps for 90 days upon an agreement between the U.S. and Turkish
governments, according to a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Kurdish, Turkmen and Iraqi
dissidents will be settled for a period of three months in
Silopi, southeastern Turkey, and then be granted political asylum
in the United States, Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member, gave a green light for the operation to
continue after the Clinton administration guaranteed that none of
the refugees would belong to the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) that regularly attacks Turkish targets in an effort to
exact territorial concessions from the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had first asked
Turkey to accommodate the refugees in a phone call to Turkish
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller
Sunday. Ciller had asked for time to assess the situation and
U.S. Ambassador Marc Grossman had carried on further negotiations
in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces based in southeastern Turkey to police a
"no-fly zone" in northern Iraq began ferrying some of the
refugees into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey agreed to allow the operation to continue provided that
the refugees would only stay 90 days.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: Israelis, Iranians Meet Secretly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from
Israel, Iran, most of the Arab countries and the European Union
states recently held a secret meeting in the German town
of Kronberg to discuss future cooperation between Europe and the
Middle East, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the second of its kind, was organized by
the German Bertelsmann Foundation, which aims to promote EU-Middle
East relations and advance the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
It is not common for Israelis and Iranians to sit in
the same room to discuss issues of mutual concern. Israel
regards Iran as a country that hosts Islamic fundamentalism the
world over, thereby posing the most dangerous threat to the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that Israel's Zionism implies ambitions of
expansion and aggression and therefore calls for confrontation
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
A strategy presented by the Research Group on European
Affairs at the University of Munich served as a basis for
the discussions. It said that by 2010, the EU, Israel, Turkey
and the Arab countries will become one economic and cultural
region.

BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A study has shown that per
capita living space for the people of Beijing was up to 13.73
sq.m. by the end of 1995, slightly less than the 15 sq.m. goal of
the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Statistics Bureau surveyed over 100,000
Beijing residents and came to the conclusion that per capita floor
space in Beijing had increased 2.56 sq m in five years and each
family had an average 2.54 rooms.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has placed greater importance on residential housing in
recent years. During the 1990-1995 period, more than five million
sq.m. of housing was built each year.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that suburbanites live in larger houses than
those living in the downtown area, 59.73 percent of whom live in
highrises, while 40.27 percent live in single-story dwellings.
</P>
<P>
For those living in highrises, more than 90 percent have their
own kitchens, some 90 percent have their own toilets, and 98.44
percent use gas for cooking. The figures for families living in
single-story houses are 82.36 percent with kitchens, 30 percent
with toilets, and 56.3 percent using gas.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that only 6.68 percent of urbanites live in
houses built before 1949, and 57.74 percent live in houses built
during and after the 1980s.

XI'AN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A stack of high-quality paper
has been unearthed from a tomb dating back to the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the paper is similar in
appearance to the famous Xuan paper, which is produced in east
China's Anhui Province and is used for traditional Chinese
painting and calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
"Very few Tang papers have been found previously," the experts
said. The major Tang paper products found before were Buddhist
classics from the world-renowned Mogao Grottos in Dunhuang in
northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Also buried with the paper was a Tang painting scroll, which
suggests that the tomb's occupant might have been an amateur
artist, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was found among some 20 Tang brick tombs at the foot
of the Jinfeng Mountain in Shangzhou, from which pottery, silver,
iron tools, bone ornaments, shells, bronze mirrors and coins have
been unearthed.

Experts paid special attention to some tombs which they said
were shaped like an "upside down boat."

</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti made the remarks during a ceremony here at the

<HEADLINE> India Considering Labor Bank for Retrenched Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
considering the option of setting up a national labor bank by
imparting special training to the retrenched workers of sick
companies, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor is already in the process of working out
the details of funding and other related matters for setting up
such a labor bank.
</P>
<P>
The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR),
which is responsible for retrenched workers of sick companies,
has, too, submitted a proposal in this regard to the Labor
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The move has been taken because most of the revival packages
for the BIFR companies have proposed a drastic reduction in
manpower. But there has been stiff opposition from all central
trade unions to this prescription which will render a large number
of workers jobless.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Ministry said that by the year 2000, the country
would need a huge number of skilled workers in view of
industrialization. There would be no place for the unskilled
workers in the country in the 21st century, which would see a
technological revolution worldwide, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament Postpones Voting on Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali parliament has
postponed the voting on an important water development treaty with
India as the main opposition party needs more time to decide
whether or not to support it.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary voting on the treaty's ratification,
previously scheduled for Thursday, was put off at the request of
the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML),
which holds the key to the fate of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Discussions over the Nepal-India Treaty on the Integrated
Development of the Mahakali River, Nepal's western boundary with
India, began at a joint session of the two houses Wednesday after
the CPN-UML Party announced its conditional support to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary discussion is going on today amid a
nationwide general strike launched by a leftist movement in
protest of the Mahakali treaty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the CPN-UML, which is the main opposition
and holds a total of 101 seats in the upper and lower houses, said
it would ratify the treaty only after the governments of Nepal
and India give assurances to the solution of several bilateral
issues raised by the party.
</P>
<P>
The issues raised by the CPN-UML for commitments from the two
governments include necessary revision of the treaty, removal of
the alleged Indian military presence in far-western Nepal, Nepal's
long-term transit facility via India, and India's mediation in
solving the Bhutanese refugee problem in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
However, the response to the CPN-UML demands from the Indian
government was "not positive" as it said the resolution to most of
these issues are under consideration through bilateral talks
between the two governments, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said in a letter to
the opposition party his government would seek to revise the
treaty after its ratification.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML's support to the Mahakali treaty is crucial to its
ratification because any treaty on water resources in Nepal needs
a two-thirds majority support in the parliament for ratification.
The Nepali parliament has 265 MPs in the two houses.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the powerful lower house Ram Chandra Poudel Thursday
 decided to prolong the parliamentary discussion on the treaty but
 did not say when the voting will be held.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police Thursday arrested 84 protesters who were
staging a demonstration against the Mahakali treaty in front of
the government office compound, where the parliament is also
located.
</P>
<P>
The arrested, including a former prime minister and some
leftist political activists, all famous for their opposition to
the treaty, were released in the evening, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Resistance groups here have been arguing that the Mahakali
treaty should not be ratified by the parliament as it is against
Nepal's national interest.
</P>
<P>
A leftist movement, the National Democratic Front, has called
for a general strike today to protest the treaty with India,
which was signed last February at the prime ministerial level in
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Water resources officials have hailed the treaty as a watershed
of Nepal-India cooperation in water resources development because
it lays down the principles of benefit sharing on future hydro
projects on the border river.

<HEADLINE> US Computer Firm Plans Direct Entry into India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELLHI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The US Cray Supercomputers
is reported to have decided to enter India directly for defense
and other high-end applications through a merger with US Silicon
Graphics, which has already set up its office here.
</P>
<P>
The synergy will directly take on the indigenous Param
supercomputer, which had been developed ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Previously the United States had severely limited defense
application uses for Cray, which was planned to be imported by
India. It was feared by the US that the Cray could be utilized for
developing India's nuclear option.
</P>
<P>
"The restriction on use of Cray in Indian defense has come down
by a factor of three times the previous levels," said Ashok Desai,
managing director of Silicon Graphics in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Cray Supercomputers has been taken over by Silicon Graphics
worldwide and its merger in India has also followed consequently.
As Silicon Graphics is already established in India, Cray is
coming into the country by making a separate application through
the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.
</P>
<P>
While the US earlier did not allow utilization of more than two
processors for the Cray, it had become more liberal of late and
allowed use of up to 12 processors without any problem. "This
suffices for most of the high-end applications needed for our
customers in India," Desai said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Cray supercomputer was used to calculate the
value of the highest prime number, using up to 120 processors.
With the merger of Cray with Silicon Graphics, the supercomputers'
applications can be processed visually for uses such as in weather
forecast, defense, entertainment and industrial operations
research.

<HEADLINE> Three Percent Growth Forecast For Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) today forecast a 3 percent
average economic growth for the region in 1996. This
significantly surpasses the 0.6 percent of last year.
</P>
<P>
As a specialized organ of the United Nations, CEPAL analyzes
the region's economy as a whole and the particular economic
performances of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador,
Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. These represent almost 90
percent of the population and of the domestic gross product (DGP)
of the region.
</P>
<P>
Among these countries, Chile was expected to reach the highest
growth of 7 percent this year. Mexico, Argentina, and Uruguay
were expected to accelerate growth to above the average 3 percent,
while Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Peru eased down. The only
country facing a drop in DGP in the region would be Venezuela,
said CEPAL.
</P>
<P>
CEPAL said the region's exports in 1996 could surpass 245
billion dollars, a 12 percent increase over last year. Imports
could be 242 billion dollars, a 10 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The region's total net income of capital for this year would
surpass 50 billion dollars, more than double 1995, and half of
them long-term direct investments.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that at the end of 1996 the region's total
foreign debt would surpass 620 billion dollars, a six percent
increase compared to 1995. But export growth would still surpass
the debt increase.
</P>
<P>
The average rate of inflation in the region was also dropping
while unemployment had not started to diminish after reaching its
90's highest level in 1995.
</P>
<P>
CEPAL said the region's economic growth in the first six months
of 1996 resulted from a dynamic expansion of exports promoted by
inter-regional commerce, a growing access to external financing,
and progressive prices stabilization.

not only for to the elections, but also for Bosnia's
re-construction.
</P>

Both parties expressed the intention of "most trustful
cooperation" in various fields despite differences on the issue
of Bosnia's future re-construction, for which the two countries
would jointly make economic and social plans.

<HEADLINE> Police Chief at U.S. City Quits for Cops' Drunken Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. police chief in
Indianapolis, Indiana, resigned and 16 officers were reassigned to
desk jobs today after community leaders protested for the police
officers' drunken, brawling, spree late last month.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is the best interest of the department as well as
the city of Indianapolis for me to step down as chief, effective
immediately," said Police Chief Donald Christ.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Stephen Goldsmith told reporters this afternoon he
reluctantly accepted the resignation at Christ's insistence.
</P>
<P>
The all-white officers, emerged from a downtown bar August 27,
made lewd remarks to women and then beat up and arrested a black
man and a white man who tried to intervene, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
The officers pummeled a black motorist who stopped and
exchanged words with them, and then badly beat a white man who
came to his aid. At least one officer pulled his gun on the
civilians during the fray. One of them also shouted a racial
slur, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the incident, the officers were still on the
job and the police department's investigation had been suspended.
The police chief had refused to suspend any of the accused
officers and no charges have been filed. The desk job
reassignments had been made at the officers' own requests.
</P>
<P>
Local black community made a series of protests against the
chief's delay in punishing the officers and the decision to put
off the internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
Some black ministers picketed the City-County Building
demanding that the officers be taken off street duty.
</P>
<P>
It was the second such major incident in a year in the
country. In 1995, a group of New York police officers practiced
drunken escapades in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The police officers, who were attending a memorial service for
slain officers, stripped in the lobby of a hotel they were
staying, sprayed fire extinguishers in the halls and set off fire
alarms, forcing a pre-dawn evacuation of guests.
</P>
<P>
As a result, two officers were fired, another quit and three
were docked pay and put on probation.

<HEADLINE> India to Conduct Two More Missile Tests This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- India will conduct two more
tests of the longer-range variant of the indigenously developed
surface-to-surface missile, Prithvi, before the end of this year,
said Abdul Kalam, scientific adviser to the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with The Times of India here
Thursday, which was made public today, the adviser, however,
declined to reveal any concrete date for the tests.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO)
carried out a solitary test of this missile variant on January 27.
This variant, meant for the air force, has a range of 250
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The DRDO has so far successfully conducted 14 tests, including
two flight trials of the 150-km-range variant of the missile. This
variant is under production for the army which has placed an order
for 75 Prithvi missiles.
</P>
<P>
The recently published Defense Ministry annual report has made
it clear that "India will continue with its indigenous missile
development programs and also keep its options open on their
deployment as warranted by our national security interests."
</P>
<P>
In its report, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defense
has been urging the government to review the 2,500-km-range
ballistic missile, Agni, project and take an expeditious decision
to go in for serial production of this strategic missile.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges to Protect Kuwait, Other Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that it will commit itself to protecting Kuwait and other
Gulf states from Iraqi military forces.
</P>
<P>
"The United States expresses its commitment to the security of
our friends in the Gulf and... repeats that commitment
specifically with reference to Kuwait," State Department spokesman
Glyn Davies said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. statement came after Iraq denounced Kuwait for its
permission of U.S. Air Force using its territory as a base to
attack Iraq. Eight F-117 stealth fighter-bombers are on their way
from New Mexico to an air base in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz called Kuwait's
decisions "flagrant aggression against the people of Iraq and an
act of war against the Iraqi state".
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry called Aziz's statement "rash"
and "totally unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
Davies said that Secretary of State Warren Christopher had
discussed at a meeting with envoys from the Gulf Cooperation
Council -- including Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain
and United Arab Emirates -- on Iraq's warning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pentagon said it found no evidence that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein was moving military forces toward Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see signs that he is moving forces toward Kuwait
since the threats earlier today by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz," Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"If we saw signs that he were moving troops, we would be very
concerned and we would respond. I am not aware of troop movements
taking place now," he told a briefing.

<HEADLINE> Court Settles Pravda Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The forced suspension of the
Pravda newspaper, the former mouthpiece of the Soviet Communist
Party, has harmed the rights of its readers and editorial staff, a
court for the settlement of press disputes ruled today.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the 84-year old pro-communist daily was
suspended on July 25 by its Greek publishers -- Pravda
International holding company.
</P>
<P>
The court proposed that the Office of the Prosecutor-General
investigate whether the company's act had obstructed the legal
acts of journalists.
</P>
<P>
At the same time it suggested that the editorial board sign a
contract with the publishers according to Russia's existing laws.
</P>
<P>
Pravda International, which had been publishing Pravda since
1992, when Pravda was in financial difficulty, prevented the paper
from appearing by shutting down its computer center.
</P>
<P>
Then, Pravda International started to publish a new daily
called Pravda 5 -- formerly the Friday edition of Pravda.
</P>
<P>
The masthead of Pravda 5 looks almost the same as Pravda but
the sentence "founded by Lenin on May 5, 1912" was removed and a
"5" was added.
</P>
<P>
The volume number was changed to No. 50 from the original
No. 27,000, and the former editor-in-chief, Alexander Ilyin, was
replaced by Vladimir Ryashin.
</P>
<P>
Ilyin said that Pravda 5 was another paper, not Pravda. Some
readers threw away the new paper and demanded the genuine Pravda.
</P>
<P>
The publishers and the editorial board led by editor-in-chief
Alexander Ilyin had been at odds since Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov was defeated by Boris Yeltsin in the presidential
election in July.
</P>
<P>
Pravda supported Zyuganov during his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Greek brothers, Theodoros and Christos Giannikos, who
control Pravda International, have called for measures to make the
paper more economically viable, including changes in editorial
content.
</P>
<P>
Ilyin said the publishers demand was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The 84-year old Pravda had long been the organ of the Communist
Party of the former Soviet Union and its circulation had been
maintained at six to seven million copies until the 1980s when the
volume rose to 12 million copies.
</P>
<P>
The last print-run before the suspension was 205,000.
</P>
<P>
Pravda was founded by Lenin in St. Petersburg in 1912, five
years before he led the Bolshevik revolution.
</P>
<P>
It fell on hard times in 1991, when the Soviet Union broke up
and the Communist Party was in disarray.
</P>
<P>
It was almost closed when Russian President Boris Yeltsin
cracked down on opposition newspapers after a 1993 rebellion by
hardliners in parliament.

BANGKOK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 primary schools in
Thailand have to seek the government's permission to close down
due to lack of students, a local daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The National Primary Education Commission said that there were
not enough students in about 10 percent of all 5,321 schools under
its administration, which offer primary and secondary level
courses for rural students, according to the Bangkok Post.
</P>

Some 3,400 primary schools in the country have fewer than 60
students on their rolls and the commission has to allow them to
close down voluntarily, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The commission is planning more assistance for schools and
students, including transportation allowance for students who are
transferred to new schools far away from home.

<HEADLINE> Russian President's Operation Still Weeks Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The exact date for Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's heart operation will be set by the end
of September, according to Russian National Television here today.
</P>
<P>
The television said that the Russian doctors as well as some
foreign specialists, such as well-known U.S. heart doctor Michael
DeBakey, would meet between September 27 and 29 for consultation
and determine the date for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said last week he had agreed to have a heart operation,
which was expected to increase the flow of blood to his heart.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Russian president announced to transfer his
power to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, asking the key
ministries, including the defense and interior ministers, to
report directly to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
As to the "red button", which was final authorization for
firing Russian nuclear weapons, Yeltsin will hand it over to a
deputy only for a short period of time around his operation,
President's Press Secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had two heart attacks last year and had been absent
since he won the presidential re-election on July 3. This has
fueled speculations of his health conditions.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Speed Up Food Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka plans to speed up
its food drive as President Chandrika Kumaratunga has asked the
Ministry of Agriculture to give it the highest priority, sources
of the ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the president has appointed a high-level
committee to prepare plans and proposals to convert uneconomic
paddy fields in the wet zone into other productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
Paddy cultivation in the wet zone has been found to be at a
loss as the yield per acre was only 45 bushels while cultivation
in other zones yielded 120 bushels per acre.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Sri Lanka's annual rice
demand stands at 300,000 metric tons.
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed food plan, the country can reach
self-sufficiency with less acreage.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive agricultural plan has also been proposed to
help farmers increase their income, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide $700 Million of Aid to Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
expected to provide Ukraine with about 700 million U.S. dollars in
aid between 1996-1999, under a deal signed by the two sides here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Hans van den Broek, the EU
Commissioner in charge of relations with the former Soviet Union,
and Roman Shpek, the head of Ukraine's Agency for Reconstruction
and Development .
</P>
<P>
The aid passage, which is a part of the EU's so-called Tacis
plan which seeks to bring together the economies of Eastern and
Western Europe, will help Ukraine with its institutional reform
and economic development, said van den Broek, who arrived in Kiev
on September 11 for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The EU would also give Ukraine another 37.5 million ECU (about
46.5 million dollars) before the end of 1996 for the development
of its energy sector, van den Broek added.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine wanted the EU members to pass the accord on partnership
and cooperation as soon as possible, as it had been considering
joining the EU, an important aim in its foreign policy, since it
announced independence in August 1991.
</P>
<P>
But so far, only Spain, Britain, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg
and Greece, and the European Council had ratified the accord.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sticks to Lifting Sanctions on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia sticks to the article
carried in the Dayton Agreement signed last year -- the
international economic sanctions against Yugoslavia must be lifted
10 day after the general elections in Bosnia, said Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov here today.
</P>
<P>
Primakov and his Yugoslav counterpart Milan Milutinovic
discussed a series of issues here today including lifting of
international economic sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed that it is necessary to coordinate
their positions on the eve of forthcoming Bosnia's general
elections, Primakov told a joint press conference after meeting
Milutinovic, who hailed Russia's promise to grant the most favored
trade status to his country.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Primakov said, expects that the conflicting factions in
the war-torn region should work together to find a just and
peaceful solution to their issues.
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted that Russia has no plan to withdraw its troops
from the U.N. peacekeeping forces stationed in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi issue, he said it is unacceptable that a state or
a state group unilaterally decides to use military force against
another.
</P>
<P>
Russia is talking with Iraq in a bid to prevent a worsened
situation in the Gulf area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is trying its utmost to turn the Russian-U.S.
relationship into a highly effective and equal one, said Primakov,
who is seen as a trouble shooter in handling the Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
Russia realizes U.S. role and position on the international
arena, the minister said, but it does not mean that Russia should
be its "wingman", blindly following suit.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Agrees on 2010 Deadline for Liberalizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and other ASEAN
members have succeeded in talking Indonesia and the Philippines
into accepting a deadline by 2010 for liberalizing trade of
agricultural products, including rice and sugar, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was confirmed in a joint press statement
issued at the end of the economic ministers' meeting of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Thursday in
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
This means that most goods will be charged import duties up to
five percent by 2003 within the ASEAN, with some sensitive
non-processed agricultural goods allowed to remain above that rate
until 2010.
</P>
<P>
However, the final duty rates for rice and sugar could be above
five percent as Indonesia was granted flexibility on the rates and
other measures to safeguard its farmers' interests.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Indonesia would begin to phase rice and
sugar into the ASEAN Free Trade Area program by 2003 and complete
the process by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has also agreed to cut tariffs on rice and
sugar by 2010, but it would revise the beginning date and the
ending rates later.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had earlier insisted that the reduction of
tariffs on rice and sugar should start in 2010 and end in 2020.

<P>
KIEV, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A plan to close Ukraine's
Chernobyl nuclear plant by the year 2000 was a major topic when
Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma met visiting European
Commissioner Hans van de Broek today.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told the commissioner that the Ukraine was keen to
develop an all-round relationship with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Mr van de Broek is the European Commissioner in charge of
relations with the former Soviet Union. Kuchma told him that
Ukraine's foreign and domestic policies were always based on
standards recognized by western democracies.
</P>
<P>
Van de Broek, who arrived here Wednesday on a three-day working
visit, said Europe had noticed the crucial role Ukraine played in
eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
He urged individual EU member parliaments to ratify as soon as
possible the partnership and co-operation agreement signed between
the EU and Ukraine in 1994.
</P>
<P>
So far, only six out of the 15 EU member states have ratified
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the plan to close the Chernobyl plant, Kuchma noted
that instead of empty promises, Ukraine needed Europe's concrete
help to achieve this.
</P>
<P>
According to another report of the Ukrainian National
Information Agency, van de Broek also held a meeting with
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko later today.
</P>
<P>
He told Udovenko that the EU respected Ukraine's independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity and always supported its
reform process.
</P>
<P>
He said he agreed with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's remark
during his recent visit to Kiev that Ukraine needed Europe and
Europe needed Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investors Eye Sichuan Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has approved 100 Taiwan-invested enterprises this year,
bringing the total number in Sichuan to 1,211, a local trade
official has announced.
</P>
<P>
The firms have brought in 1.4 billion US dollars of investment
to Sichuan, the highest amount for China's inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 percent of the projects involved an investment of more
than 1 million US dollars each. The largest project cost 100
million US dollars to build.
</P>
<P>
President Enterprises Food Co. Ltd., the earliest Taiwanese
investor to come to Sichuan, has increased investment for capital
re-investment after having an output value of 200 million yuan
last year.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-backed projects have gone from the big cities of Chengdu
and Chongqing out to 23 prefectures and remote towns and
mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The trade official attributed the increased interest of
Taiwanese investors partly to the ongoing construction work on the
Three Gorges Dam Project on the Yangtze River, the largest
hydro-electric power project in the world.

<HEADLINE> Rise In Exports In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of export in
Shanghai, China's largest city, exceeded that of imports for the
first time, this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Customs, the city's exports rose by
24.3 percent to 2.7 billion US dollars' worth in August, while
imports were up 2.1 percent to 2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A customs official gave three reasons for the sharp increase in
exports: a rebound in exports of state-owned trading companies,
increased exports from foreign-funded enterprises and making
better use of the export structure.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's foreign trade volume was 30.9 billion US dollars in
the first eight months, 15.5 billion of that in exports and 15.4
billion in imports.

<HEADLINE> First-Aid Care Secured in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Patients in critical
conditions will have greater legal protection under under a new
medical regulation in this capital of south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation, to be effective as of September 25, is said
to be the first such local regulation in the country.
</P>
<P>
It states that hospitals must under no circumstances refuse to
treat patients who are in a serious condition. Medical personnel
must take the initiative to practise sound medical ethics at all
times, according to the "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Government departments, work units and individuals should all
take humanitarian measures and be ready to assist people in
medical danger.
</P>
<P>
Though the new rule will serve to protect patients and raise
social consciousness, it has aroused questions concerning the
accumulation of unsettled medical bills in many local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In emergency cases, most hospitals in the city would take
first-aid measures to save patients before asking for a deposit,
but some did refuse to carry out emergency operations if evidence
of the ability to pay was not produced.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou General Hospital, a downtown hospital sponsored by
the Guangzhou military command, has unpaid bills amounting to
about one million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
An increasing population influx from nearby provinces has added
more pressure on medical organizations in the city. Many of the
incoming workers find jobs on construction sites and cannot afford
their medical bills if they are seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the local public health care bureau indicate
that first-aid treatment for people outside Guangzhou at the
city's top 14 hospitals cost them more than 1.7 million yuan
(204,000 dollars) during 1992-94.
</P>
<P>
Local hospitals have called for the establishment of a
charitable foundation to fund emergency treatment.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Prices Rise Again in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Filipinos saw the second hike
of gasoline prices in a month with prices of premium and unleaded
gasoline up 25 centavos (0.95 U.S. cents) per liter starting
today.
</P>
<P>
Under an order of the country's Energy Regulatory Board, the
price of kerosene, fuel of lower-income people, also rose by 50
centavos (1.9 U.S. cents) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The price of fuel oil, used to run most of the country's power
plants, went up three centavos (0.1 U.S. cents) per liter, raising
the prospect of higher electric rates.
</P>
<P>
This is the second monthly adjustment after the Philippines
began to partially deregulate its oil industry last month. The new
automatic pricing system provided that oil prices in the country
would be adjusted every month according to changes in
international markets.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is projected to fully deregulate its oil
industry in March 1997 after more than 20 years of government
control over the country's oil prices.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Search for New Talents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China should modify its
employment recruiting policies and improve working environments so
as to attract more foreign professionals and overseas Chinese
students, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the annual meeting of the China International
Talent Exchange and Development Society believe that an intense
international competition for talent exists, and that China should
more astutely utilize the foreign experts it invites and also
attempt to curb the braindrain on its own talent.
</P>
<P>
They said that China's "head-hunting" should match
international practices.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most of the foreign experts in China were retirees
or inter-governmental exchange program experts.
</P>
<P>
China should improve the mechanism for hiring foreign
professionals through intermediary domestic and overseas
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The government should shun the hiring and firing, and focus on
supervising the market, said Bi Lianggan, director of the China
International Talent Exchange Information Research Center.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the salaries and agent's pay must also catch
up with international standards.
</P>
<P>
"This will pressure Chinese employers, forcing them to be more
selective in hiring and help the expert fill his or her role," Bi
said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is difficult for most Chinese employers to pay the
international price. That does not mean that China should quit the
talent competition.
</P>
<P>
Bi suggested that the country should give awards to outstanding
scientists and engineers and provide a relaxed working environment
for returning overseas students so that more will come back to
work for the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Bi predicted that at the end of this century, China will
witness a tide of students returning as the Western economy
remains sluggish and the Chinese economy maintains its vitality.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, China's importation of foreign
brainpower will focus on improving its agricultural productivity,
said sources from the State Bureau of Foreign Experts.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial sector, stress will be placed on basic and
pillar industries. In the service sector, more financial, real
estate and information experts will be hired.
</P>
<P>
The State bureau will also make efforts to channel sources to
the West.
</P>
<P>
"This is to serve China's great shift from central planning to
a planned economy, and from a scale-oriented development model to
an intensive development one," said the sources.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin B May Save 80,000 Infant Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to save as many
as 80,000 Chinese babies from being born with fatal birth defects
each year, a unique research project into Vitamin B will be
expanded by a joint team of Chinese and US health experts, "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ministry of Public Health expects to spread the
research results throughout the country as soon as possible to
keep more infants free from congenital neural tube defects.
</P>
<P>
Neural tube defects account for one-their of all birth defects
in China. Babies with the disorder are born with no brain or with
an exposed spine. Most are born dead or die within a year. The few
survivors usually are disabled.
</P>
<P>
David Satcher, director of the US Center for Disease Control and
Prevention, expressed the hope that the Joint effort, the "only
one of its kind globally and the biggest Sino-Us collaboration in
health field", would set an example for the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Satcher and several other US experts are in Beijing reviewing
previous Sino-US field studies and are drawing up new research
projects to be carried out in collaboration with their Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Each year, throughout the world, 300,000 to 400,000 babies are
born with neural tube defects. China has the highest incidence
with 80,000 to 100,000 cases a year, one-third of the world's
total.
</P>
<P>
A study of diets of pregnant women conducted by China Medical
University found that an average of 30 percent of Chinese women of
reproductive age suffer from folic acid deficiency. The proportion
is higher in the northern and rural areas than in the southern and
urban regions.
</P>
<P>
The university's researchers also found that if a woman took
0.4 milligrams of folic acid supplements daily until the third
month of pregnancy, the incidence of neural tube defects was
reduced by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The joint research into neural tube defects control was started
in 1990 by the US Center for Disease Control, the Chinese Ministry
of Public Health and Beijing Medical University.
</P>
<P>
Controlling neural tube defects with moderate dosages of folic
acid, also known as Vitamin B, was designated one of the 10 best
medical techniques to be introduced in China's vast rural areas by
the Ministry of Public Health in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Panama Needs $2 Billion Investment: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian economist
Ruben Lachamn foresees that Panama will need investments of two
billion U.S. dollars in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The investment projects lie in tourism, mining, industrial,
transportation and public services sectors, said Lachamn during a
working session at the Strategic Investigations Center.
</P>
<P>
The Fort Amador tourist project in the U.S. military base of
the same name, which will be reverted to Panamanian dominion next
month, will be developed during the next five years at an
estimated cost of 465 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the most ambitious projects in the tourism sector,
said the economist.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the Cerro Colorado copper mine, to be extracted
in two years, will be 300 million dollars, while the Petaquilla
mine development needs 80 million dollars to be in operation in 36
months.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial field, the projects of development in the
exports processing zone of Fort Davis, in the Atlantic province of
Colon, are to be started at the end of this year, with an
investment of 100 million to 115 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The construction of three five-star hotels in the capital of
the country needs a 150-million-dollar investment in several
phases of development.
</P>
<P>
The private sector will start in 1997 to build a 100 megawatt
hydroelectric power plant in Chiriqui province northeast of Panama
City at a cost of 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the concession to operate a cellular
telephone system and selling 49 percent of the National
Telecommunications Institute shares will get annually 25 million
dollars investment for three years in the telecommunication sector.
</P>
<P>
In the transportation area, the construction of Cristobal and
Balboa ports, a new container terminal in Coca Solo Norte and two
small ports on the western coast will need 150 million dollars to
be invested over three years.

<HEADLINE> Fifa Calls France to Pull down Fence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- France should removed those
fences in stadium to separate fans from the pitch for the 1998
World Cup finals, said Sepp Blatter, general secretary of
International Football Federation (Fifa) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Fans are neither prisoners nor animals and crowds at World Cup
matches aren't the same as the crowds you get at club matches," he
said Thursday when visiting the new Paris stadium being built to
stage the 1998 final.
</P>
<P>
"France would do well to consider dismantling the barriers," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Blatter had been impressed by the good behavior of fans in the
European Championship finals in England where stadium fencing was
removed following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989.
</P>
<P>
A formal request for France to take barriers down would have to
come from Fifa's executive meeting in Barcelona in December.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Situation Pushes Oil Prices Up: Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices at the
international market keep going up because of the effect of the
uncertainty prevailing the events in Gulf, according to
Venezuela's Energy and Mines Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan oil basket closed yesterday at an average of
20.6 dollars per barrel, a 33 cents up over the 20.27 dollars
registered Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With this performance crude oil reached an unprecedented
quotation for the year in Venezuela, where it had been at 15.6
dollars per barrel some weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Mines Ministry figures show that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil basket ended Wednesday at
21.77 dollars per barrel, a 35-cent increase over the 21.42
dollars quoted on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Petroleos de Venezuela (Pdvsa) international market analysts
have stated some reserves about what could happen in the coming
days, "because the analysis indicates that the oil prices are
reaching their ceiling."
</P>
<P>
The Pdvsa studies are based in the fact that the rise in the
prices occurs even if there is no "physical" oil in the game.
</P>
<P>
The price rises were produced by the enormous psychological
pressure of a market that was asking for more oil at a time when
the world inventories were diminishing, added the Pdvsa analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Pdvsa analysts consider that low inventories will push the
prices even higher, but not beyond the quotation of the previous
days.

<HEADLINE> China To Strengthen IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to strengthen the
implementation of an action plan for effective protection and
enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR), according to a
senior official of the State Copyright Bureau (SCB).
</P>
<P>
Yu Youxian, director of the State Copyright Bureau, told of the
plan at an international symposium on enforcement of laws on
copyright and other similar rights, jointly held by the SCB and
the World Intellectual Property Organization, in Chengdu, capital
of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The country will also continue to make efforts on copyright
protection, Yu said, adding that China has established a copyright
protection system and achieved good results in recent years.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out a series of inspections and regulations
to crack down IPR infringements and piracy, he said.
</P>
<P>
A WIPO official highly praised the effective IPR protection in
China.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: NZ Government Paints Rosy Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Expected operation
surpluses in the next few years will enable the future New Zealand
government to spend more on areas of education and health.
</P>
<P>
This is the key message delivered by Finance Minister Bill
Birch Thursday in his Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Update
which the government is required by law to deliver before next
month's general election.
</P>
<P>
Birch gave no assurance that the government will put more money
in education and health, the two most vulnerable areas for the
National Party in the election, but the message is taken as an
enticement to voters that the government is in a position to spend
more if its policies continue.
</P>
<P>
Apart from predicting a string of forecast surpluses over the
next four years, Birch also presented a rosy picture of other
aspects of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The document said net public debt is expected to fall to 13.3
percent of the GDP by the turn of the century from the present
27.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economy will grow 2.5 percent in the current 1996-97 fiscal
year, and will increase by 3.7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
However, interest rates and the NZ dollar will stay higher than
expected, and New Zealand will continue to spend more than it
earns overseas, with the current account deficit expected to rise
to five percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"Now that there is such confidence in economic management and
direction, the public's attention is focused on health and
education," Birch declared.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, New Zealand has seen a series of strikes
by kindergarten and school teachers, and occupation of university
kckkkvvkkkxc
buildings by students. The teachers were demanding wage increases,
while the students protesting hikes in university fees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, discontent is on the rise among New Zealanders over
the health sector as they have to wait longer for surgeries and
receive poorer services.
</P>
<P>
Trying to soothe public anger, Birch said that a lot more work
needs to be done to improve the situation. "But you cannot pick
the fruits off the tree while lopping off its branches, or, in the
Alliance's case, cutting the tree down."
</P>
<P>
However, the economic figures have failed to impress the
opposition parties. Labor Party finance spokesman Michael Cullen
said the document contains few surprises.
</P>
<P>
Alliance leader Jim Anderton said the figures show a precarious
economy with a permanent unemployment rate of six percent, a
chronic balance of payments deficit at five percent of the GDP and
permanently high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First leader Winston Peters criticized the
government for setting on an election-year lolly scramble after
six years of neglect in education, health and social welfare.

<HEADLINE> Supermarkets Booming in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Supermarkets are booming in
Shanghai, China's leading industrial and commercial city. Their
cash tills roared to the tune of 1.46 billion yuan (about 175
million US dollars) in the first half of this year, more than
twice those of the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, when the city's first supermarket opened, this new
retail mode has developed rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city has 750 supermarkets, with a
total floor space of up to 260,000 square meters. There were only
200 supermarkets a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the biggest local supermarket sold no more than 2000
kinds of goods, only half of today's average. However, some large
supermarkets now have more than 10,000 kinds of commodities.
</P>
<P>
Among the goods on the shelves, local products account for
almost 57 percent, imported goods for 8.4 percent, and the rest
are from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the existing supermarkets still cannot meet
the needs of the city's 13 million people.

<HEADLINE> State Extends Export Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Exporters will have to prove
their worth and test their pricing skills if they want to win
commodity export contracts next year, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
In China, 116 categories of exports are licensed, with 95 of
them given quotas, the newspaper quoted officials from the foreign
trade administration department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese exporters face two kinds of quotas: voluntary ones
designed to regulate a select group of exports and compulsory ones
as required by foreign trade partners," said the officials.
</P>
<P>
To ensure fairer and better distribution of export quotas,
China introduced the public bidding scheme, with fees attached, to
cover some of both the voluntarily and the compulsorily controlled
export quotas.
</P>
<P>
Next year, exporters will have to bid and pay for the right to
export 33 commodities, 28 under voluntary and five under
compulsory quota control.
</P>
<P>
Prospective exporters will also have to take part in public
bidding, but without paying, for the right to export
black-and-white television sets, electric fans and bicycles next
year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The move to impose quotas or require licenses has restored
order in the foreign-trade sector and helped exporters increase
their overseas sales prices, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Related departments, including MOFTEC, customs services and
various chambers of commerce, are mobilized to monitor export
prices, especially of licensed exports, the MOFTEC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Six chambers of commerce are involved in the bidding and
scrutiny process to check prices to eliminate what the recipient
countries would consider "dumping".
</P>
<P>
To stop possible collusion, on the other hand, MOFTEC is
devising new methods to prevent organized bidding, said the
officials.
</P>
<P>
The scope of the bidding scheme will be steadily expanded.
Officials said that when selecting new items for bidding, MOFTEC
will assess whether the additions are necessary and feasible.
</P>
<P>
With the fees collected in the bidding process, MOFTEC has
reportedly set up a fund which the ministry intends to use to
promote Chinese exports.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Prosecutor Seeks To Charge Former President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Honduras General
Prosecutor today asked for the suspension of immunity for a former
President charged with embezzlement of 28 million U.S. dollars
during his 1990 to 1994 administration.
</P>
<P>
General Prosecutor Edmundo Rellana alleged that former
President Rafael Leonardo Callejas illegally transferred that sum
from the oil fund to his special account in the Government House.
</P>
<P>
The oil fund is a form of national savings designed to lessen
the affect on Honduras people of continual fuel price rises.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor stated that the most important thing was not the
crime, "but the restitution of the 30 million dollars that
Callejas dissipated, as well as all the millions paid for every
rise in the prices of oil byproducts after the oil fund was
depleted.
</P>
<P>
"That money is needed to develop many communities and to
protect the citizens from the increases in the oil prices," said
Rellana.
</P>
<P>
The top prosecutor declared that proceedings against Callejas
in the Central American Parliament had already started.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's gross
domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.2 percent during the first half
of this year -- 2.5 percent less than the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The growth sectors included communal, social, personal and
financial services fields, the National Administrative Department
of Statistics reported.
</P>
<P>
Construction, commerce, manufacturing industry, restaurants and
hotels showed rises under the GDP average, but the manufacturing
industry had a slight recovery compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
Other economic statistics showed that the 15.7 percent growth
of monetary means was the same as last year's, while the expanded
money supply presented a contraction, going from 38.1 percent to
16.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation rate increased from 6.01 percent to 8.24
percent, but there was a noticeable trend to revaluation.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit reduced 18 percent compared with the same
period of the previous year.

<P>
ROME, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Olympic 100m swimming champion
Alexander Popov, who was stabbed last month in Moscow over a minor
dispute, left hospital on Thursday after recovering better than
expected.
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky -- they allowed me to leave hospital after two
weeks as I quickly recovered." Popov, wounded on August 24 during
an argument over the purchase of a water melon, told Thursday's
Gazetto dello sport in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected to get back in the pool by the end of
October after his doctor told him he needed 45 days convalescence.
</P>
<P>
He will spend a week at his parents in Sverdlovsk before going
to Moscow for two weeks and then joining his coach Gennadi
Turetski in Canberra, Australia in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
The 1.97 meter-tall Popov became the first swimmer to retain
the Olympic 100m title since Johnny "Tarzan" Weismuller in 1928
and who also won two golds in Barcelona in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Dow Attempts New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- New York stock market rose
confidently today, with Dow Jones industrial average getting
nearer to its highest points.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rose 17.02 to 5,771.94, finishing about 6 points shy of
its highest close of 5,778.00, set May 22. The famed barometer of
30 big U.S. companies once gained nearly 40 points in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Investors welcomed the news released today that wholesale
prices fell 0.1 percent last month, excluding the volatile food
and energy sectors. Overall, producer prices rose 0.3 percent in
August.
</P>
<P>
The mild inflation reading reinforced speculation that the
Federal Reserves won't try to check economic growth by raising its
key lending rates aggressively. Instead, analysts now expect Fed
officials to either stand idle or pursue a modest rate increase at
a policy meeting scheduled for September 24.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
fell to 7.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 5-to-3
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 398.82
million shares, the busiest pace since early August.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 1.73 to 359.73, about 4 points
shy of an all-time high; and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
rose 3.85 to 671.13, about 7 points from a record.
</P>
<P>
The Dow has now bounced back by nearly 590 points, or 11.4
percent, from the depths of July's selloff, which came on a stream
of negative earnings news and fears about higher inflation and
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 11.86 to 1,165.81, its best
finish since early July, but still more than 80 points from a new
high. The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.60
to 566.66.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The queuing is finally over
for the only prefecture in China without a regular bus service.
</P>
<P>
But it has meant a specially designed bus for eager passengers
in one of the world's most hostile environments.
</P>
<P>
The people of Ngari Prefecture in Tibet will finally be able to
travel by bus from next month.
</P>
<P>
The first bus especially designed to withstand the harsh
weather and road conditions in Ngari has been produced by
Chongqing Bus Factory in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle is equipped with special engines which can work
normally in bad weather and road conditions in Tibet's plateau
area. Special heating equipment will keep interior spaces of the
bus warm.
</P>
<P>
Ngari Traffic Bureau has bought the bus and plans to put
it into use from October 1. More buses are expected to run in
in Ngari later.
</P>
<P>
At an elevation of 4,500 meters, Ngari is located at the
western part of the Tibet Autonomous Region on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, where traffic is often cut off by foul weather. The lives
and economy of 65,000 people living in the prefecture have been
adversely affected for a long period by poor transportation
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Hails OAS Decision on Helms-Burton Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today hailed a recent
decision by the Organization of American States (OAS) to reject
the so-called Helms-Burton Act of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Marianela Ferriol, acting spokeswoman for Cuba's Foreign
Ministry, said the OAS decision shows the determination of the
countries of the region to maintain their independence.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by the OAS' Permanent Council on Tuesday,
also demonstrates its member countries' firm position in the
rejection of the anti-Cuban law, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The council recommended, by unanimous consensus, with the sole
exception of the United States, the preparation of a report on the
matter to be discussed during the next OAS general assembly.
</P>
<P>
The document will be drafted by the OAS Judicial and Political
Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the development, Ferriol said the U.S. law,
enacted by President Bill Clinton in March to tighten the grip of
economic sanctions against Cuba, was condemned to fail.
</P>
<P>
Not only the OAS Permanent Council, but also the Group of Rio
countries and other countries of the region have announced their
rejection to this "legislative monstrosity," she noted.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act, part of which threatens legal actions
against foreign companies doing business in Cuba, is widely
considered as incompatible with international law.

1997, in Belo Horizonte, capital of the southeastern Brazilian
state of Minas Gerais.
</P>
<P>
The governments of all countries on the American continents,
except Cuba, foresee that the FTAA will be functioning in the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
In June, 1995, 34 commerce ministers from countries in the
continents held a meeting in Denver, the United States, and

year 2005.
</P>
<P>
A FTAA entrepreneurial seminar will be held on September 18,
after the vice ministerial meeting.
</P>

ZHENGZHOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Around 100 species of
insects, which have never been documented in the world, have been
discovered in Funiu Mountains in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
They were discovered by 30 Chinese scholars during a recent
investigation of insect resources in the Baiyun Mountain Resort
Area and Longyuwan Forest Farm.
</P>
<P>
They captured over 60,000 insects within two weeks. The
preliminary cataloguing results show that the insects belong to 26
branches and over 300 orders, but some 100 have never been
previously described.
</P>
<P>
The insect resources were much richer than expected, Yang
Jikun, a renowned entomologist said, adding that it will be
necessary to conduct further investigations.
</P>
<P>
The scholars were from 11 institutions around China, including
the China University of Agriculture, China Academy of Forestry and

<HEADLINE> Clinton Likely to Visit Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- US President Bill Clinton is
likely to visit Australia in November this year if he is
re-elected in the presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Local Age newspaper reported in a front-page story that Clinton
was expected to arrive in Canberra on 21 November.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that President Clinton could visit Australia
around the time of the APEC meeting in Manila," sources from the
Australian Prime Minister's office said.
</P>
<P>
The Age reported that Clinton would spend a day in Canberra,
addressing a joint sitting of both houses of the Australian
federal parliament, and then fly to Sydney the same night. He
would visit the Great Barrier Reef at the northeast coast of
Australia before heading for the Philippines to attend the APEC
(Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) leaders' meeting in Subic.
</P>
<P>
"But we have not received any confirmation about the trip yet,"
a spokeswoman from Prime Minister John Howard's office said.
</P>
<P>
The Age reported that a reconnaissance tour had already been
made by Clinton's staff and security teams.
</P>
<P>
"Planning for the visit has been going on for several weeks,
well before the US offensive against Iraq," the newspaper said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Last Tango in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The last waltz is being
played at many of Beijing's once popular dance halls.
</P>
<P>
Changing trends mean that many young Beijing people have danced
the night away for the last time, the Beijing Youth Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
They have deserted the dance floors in their thousands, leaving
many halls struggling for survival, cutting staff or imposing a
spending freeze.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital currently has 1,100 singing and dance
halls, but 100 have applied to close down so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Local cultural-market management officials attribute the
problems to too many dance halls and less consumers in the
city. Entrance ticket charges of 50 to 80 yuan, are also said to
be much more than what an ordinary Beijing resident can afford on
a frequent basis.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that local dance halls, once a hot spot for
young people, could attract 100,000 people a day, or one in every
150 residents. But less than 30,000 people put on their dancing
shoes each day, indicating that supply largely surpasses demand,
according to the Beijing Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Local dance halls started to flourish in 1986 and in early
1990s the number increased to over 200. By 1994 the number was
more than 800, and within a year, dance halls were developing
faster than a quick-step.
</P>
<P>
The current 1,100 halls have invested more than five billion
yuan (about 602 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
When the business started, investment on each dance hall was
just a few hundred of thousand yuan, but today the figure can soar
to millions or even tens of millions for each hall. And the
shortage of dancers has added to financial difficulties for many
dance halls.
</P>
<P>
Some halls have started to cut budgets or reduce staff, while
others have applied to end their business.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the once booming business is likely to run out of
good luck, due to too much input and few rewards.
</P>
<P>
Maybe many former dancers have hot-footed their way to drinking
bars. Sources say that the number of bars is on rise in Beijing,
so far there are nearly 100, compared to 20 just a year
ago.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, Rebel Group to Sign Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will next week sign a
ceasefire agreement preparatory to the holding of formal peace
talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local press published today, Executive
Secretary Ruben Torres said that the MILF through its spokesman
Gazzali Gaafar agreed to the ceasefire during their meeting last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mindanao-wide ceasefire is "preparatory to the holding of
peace talks which will be set within 10 days after the signing,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the government and the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) signed a peace pact to end a 24-year old civil war in
Mindanao. But the 12,000-strong MILF rejected the peace deal and
vowed to continue its armed struggle for an independent Muslim
state in the south.
</P>
<P>
Government officials admitted that the MILF became the biggest
security threat in the region after the signing of the peace
agreement between the government and the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
Torres said that chief government negotiator Manuel Yan and
Al-Haj Murad, MILF Vice Chairman for Political Affairs will sign
the ceasefire agreement next week.
</P>
<P>
"We will work out the security and immunity guarantees for MILF
leaders who will be negotiating with the government so they will
be free to move around," he said.

<HEADLINE> Perry Denounces Iraqi Warnings against Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry today denounced Iraqi warnings against Kuwait,
saying that such a statement was "totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief spoke after Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz warned Kuwait earlier in the day against permitting
American warplanes to use Kuwait bases for possible military
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that Kuwait's permission meant to declare war on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Those kind of rash statements are totally unacceptable," Perry
told reporters at a photo opportunity with visiting Slovenian
Defense Minister Jelko Kacin. "Our forces are there in the first
place because Iraq invaded Kuwait back in 1991, and have been
there since then to provide deterrence for any future action of
that sort."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has reportedly sent 8 F-117A stealth
fighter-bombers to the Gulf region for a possible third round of
U.S. strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. planes are patrolling no-fly zones over
northern and southern Iraq despite repeated threats by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"They (U.S.) forces have very robust rules of engagement. So
everybody should understand that the United States will take all
necessary and appropriate action to protect our forces and to
protect friends," Perry said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republicans Attack Clinton's Action in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republicans today
sharply criticized President Bill Clinton for not taking "harsher
actions" against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee,
James Baker III, former U.S. secretary of state during the 1991
war against Iraq, bitterly attacked Clinton's action so far in
strikes against selected targets of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baker said that the Clinton administration had allowed U.S.
anti-Iraq coalition to break up and should have hit Saddam harder.
</P>
<P>
He cited "a failure of leadership" of the United States as a
reason behind Saddam's recovery of authority in the Kurdish region
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republican leaders in the U.S. House of
Representatives have insisted that the Clinton administration has
left them uninformed about the situation in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled House continued to block
consideration of a U.S. Senate-backed resolution supporting
American troops in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Republican representative Curt Weldon said that the correct
vote facing the House was not on the Senate resolution but on
"whether we support this president on what he's doing with our
troops right now."
</P>
<P>
The harsh words came as the United States is stepping up its
preparations for possible new strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Eight U.S. radar-evading F-117A stealth fighter-bombers were
being readied today at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico for
deployment to the Gulf region. Four B-52 bombers, most likely
armed with cruise missiles, were headed to a military base in
Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, U.S. military officials said.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Down to 5.5-Year Low in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment total in Britain
fell to the lowest level for five and a half years in August and
on course to dip below two million before the general election,
according to official figures out Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the number
of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by 15,600 last
month to 2.11 million, or 7.5 percent of the workforce, its lowest
level since March 1991.
</P>
<P>
The drop was the six consecutive monthly decline, and the ONS
said that the trend is still downward and expected that
unemployment to continue falling by roughly 15,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
At 7.5 percent, the jobless ratio in Britain now is well below
the rate of 10.5 and 12.5 percent respectively in Germany and
France and alos well below the European Union average of 11.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of vacancies available through Job Centers rose by
6,400 last month, and manufacturing employment rose by 13,000 in
July after a long period of job losses, the ONS reported.
</P>
<P>
The government celebrated the fall, but some economists raised
fears that the decline in the jobless total may simply reflect
fewer people claiming benefit rather than more people finding
jobs.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urges Implementing Oil-for-Food Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Security Council today urged Secretary-General to speed up
implementation of the Iraqi oil-for-food plan.
</P>
<P>
After consultations this morning, Council President Alfredo
Lopes Cabral of Guinea-Bissau said that members of the council
mandated the council president to see the secretary-general and
convey their feelings for implementation of resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
Italian Ambassador Francesco Paolo Fulci told reporters that
the members of the Security Council unanimously requested the
secretary-general to implement the oil-for-food formula as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Because of shortage of food, the ration for Iraqi civilians is
25-30 percent less than the minimum calories required for average
human being to survive. "How long can people resist in this
situation," he asked.
</P>
<P>
Lack of food and medicine resulted in 8-times rise of mortality
of children compared to that before the sanctions was imposed on
Iraq 6 years ago, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food resolution was aimed at saving human life.
"Humanitarian consideration should be absolutely overriding any
other considerations, including political, economic or financial
ones. What really matters is to save people who are dying. Now,
people -- men, women and children -- are dying, and dying at an
unbelievable rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Please hurry up. People are dying. Something must be done
quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for U.N. secretary-general, also
announced that a new development of implementing resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
She said that U.N. Under-Secretary-General Joseph Conner and
Pierre Schneider, head of New York office of the Banque National
de Paris, would sign a contract today. With the contract, the bank
would apply to open the escrow account to receive the funds from
Iraqi oil sale.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. The 6-year long sanctions
have crippled Iraqi economy and resulted in tremendous hardships
of its civilians, especially children.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the humanitarian situation in Iraq, the Security
Council adopted resolution 986 last April, which allows Iraq to
export petroleum worth 2 billion dollars in six months for import
of food, medicine and other civilian goods.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretariat and Iraq reached an accord on
implementation of the oil-for-food formula on May 20. The current
confrontation between the United States and Iraq may hold up the
implementation process.

UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official told
reporters on Thursday the situation in Afghanistan is worrying and
she called upon all factions to resort to peaceful means to solve
their differences.

located," said Sylvana Foa, the spokesman of the U.N.
Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
"This fighting has caused a regrettable loss of life and
increased an already large number of internally displaced persons.
The continued resort to force by different factions to resolve
national problems is most unfortunate," she said.
</P>
<P>
But she stressed that the United Nations remained determined to
persist with its efforts to promote a peacefully negotiated
settlement.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to all factions to renounce the use of force and
