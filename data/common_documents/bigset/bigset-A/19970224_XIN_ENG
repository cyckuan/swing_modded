<HEADLINE> Special Economic Zones' People Mourn for Deng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- People in Shenzhen have been
immersed in deep grief since the news of Deng Xiaoping's death on
February 19 came to this economically-booming town in south China.
</P>
<P>
City officials, entrepreneurs, farmers and ordinary citizens
have mourned for Deng, the architect of China's reform and
opening-up policy and the founder of China's first Special
Economic Zone (SEZ) here.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping visited Shenzhen in 1984 and 1992, and
each time he pushed forward the development of Shenzhen," recalled
Li Youwei, secretary of the Shenzhen City Committee of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has experienced great changes since the time it was
only a small fishing village in the early 1980s to the present
when it is a prosperous city, as Deng determined to establish the
first SEZ here as a showcase with fast growth spurring the
nationwide opening-up.
</P>
<P>
During his first tour of Shenzhen in 1984 Deng noted that
Shenzhen's development and experience had proved the policy of
establishing the SEZs to be correct.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 Deng pointed out that socialism also needed a market
economy. His famous speech later laid a theoretical foundation for
the Party to set the reform targets for a socialist market
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
"Guided by Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, we have made experiments and achieved great
progress in recent years," Li said.
</P>
<P>
On the 42nd floor of the World Trade Tower, which was once the
highest building in the city and a symbol of the city's fast
growth, Vice-President of the Tower Estate Group Zha Shengming
recalled Deng Xiaoping's famous speech made right there on January
20, 1992.
</P>
<P>
"Our tower is no longer the tallest building in Shenzhen.
However, that indicates that the city is developing better thanks
to Deng's guidance," Zha said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Zhibiao, a fisherman-turned-entrepreneur in suburban
Shenzhen's Yumin Village, still remembers the moment when Deng
Xiaoping visited the village in January 1984 and encouraged him
and his fellow villagers to achieve common prosperity and to
improve their living standards.
</P>
<P>
Deng Zhibiao, now the manager of the Yufeng Co. Ltd, said the
village owns more than 40 million yuan-worth of fixed assets,
compared with only some 2 million yuan-worth in 1984.
</P>
<P>
"We feel very sad about losing Deng," said Shenzhen Mayor Li
Zibin. "But we will turn grief into strength, and we are
determined to achieve even greater success in developing Shenzhen
under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin
at the core."

<P>
The news about Deng's death also affected technicians of the
Asia Imitation Company in Zhuhai, where Deng made important
remarks during his inspection tour of southern China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The workers of the company all went to their offices earlier
than usual after hearing the death of the great man Thursday
morning. Ge Bin, deputy general manager of the company, put on
specially the suit he wore when he had a photo taken with Deng at
that time.
</P>
<P>
Ge remembered clearly that Deng had said at that time that he
placed his hope for China's scientific and technological
development on the younger generation, and the younger generation
should love the nation and take the responsibility to construct
China into a rich and prosperous country.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 it was at this company that Deng drew his famous
inference that science and technology is the foremost productive
force and expressed his wish for students studying abroad to come
back and serve their motherland.
</P>
<P>
"I was greatly impressed by Deng's remarks published in the
overseas edition of the People's Daily at that time. I then made
up my mind to come back immediately, and I have never regretted
it," said Dr. Shang Rong, a returned scholar and now the director
of the computer department of the China Construction Bank's Zhuhai
branch.

<HEADLINE> France Chooses to Stay Out of NATO Commands, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The French government will
probably decide this spring to stay out of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) commands, a U.S. newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times quoted French and U.S. officials as saying
that the French government is under increasing pressure not to
return to the alliance because Washington is not willing to yield
the power of NATO's souther command to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"NATO diplomats and French officials said that in talks held
this week with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in Paris
and other European capitals, neither the United States nor France
had changed its positions on the main stumbling block," the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Paris has repeatedly demanded that the U.S. should give up the
right to name the officer in command of Allied Forces Southern
Europe in Naples, Italy, to the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac told Albright earlier this week
that France seeks to reach a compromise on the issue with
Washington by April or May, the U.S. newspaper quoted diplomats as
saying.
</P>
<P>
If no agreement is reached by then, France would not return to
the military structure of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
France left NATO's military commands in 1966 in protest against
the U.S. dominance. It vowed more than a year ago that it would
come back to the structure on condition that it has more rights to
decide in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. holds the top post of Supreme Allied Commander for
Europe in Brussels and that of Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
So, France argues that NATO should provide balance between
American and European posts by giving Europeans the alliance's
Southern Command.
</P>
<P>
However, some diplomats say a compromise is still possible if
both leaders want one, the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Calls for Safety Improvement of Merchant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Minister of
Communications Adamos Adamides today called for a qualitative
improvement of Cyprus' merchant fleet and efforts to improve the
safety record of Cyprus-flagged vessels.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the call at the annual General Meeting of
the Cyprus Shipping Council that took place in the southwestern
coastal town of Limassol.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Adamides pointed out that "there are
indications that if we succeed in our targets concerning the
qualitative improvement of the Cyprus merchant fleet, our
chances to succeed a more favorable stand by the European
Union, on the issue of our taxation system in shipping, will
definitely be increased."
</P>
<P>
He said "we reasonably expect that 1997 will constitute the
main expression of a new era for our merchant shipping, which
was launched in 1993."
</P>
<P>
"Monitoring of international developments in the sector of
merchant shipping will be enhanced and the participation of
Cyprus in the proceedings of international shipping organizations
will be improved," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the constant quest of the government is
the updating of the shipping legislation and the preparation of
regulations which supplement and facilitate its application.
</P>
<P>
On the importance of maintaining safety standards, Adamides
said the systematic inspection of ships calling at Limassol port
has been extended to the port of Larnaca this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cyprus Shipping Council welcomed action by
Minister Adamides to delete substandard vessels from the
register and called on the minister to continue applying strict
measures.
</P>
<P>
"We must do all we can to see that our ships are accepted as
reputable members of the international shipping community," the
council said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the official statistics, by the end of 1995,
2,788 ships were registered in Cyprus with a total tonnage of 26.8
million.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Produce First Sheep Clone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have
successfully produced a lamb by taking a cell from a sheep's
udder. The technique could lead to a breakthrough in researches of
human genetics, aging and medicines.
</P>
<P>
A female sheep gave birth to the first clone animal, named
Dolly, a few weeks ago at the Roslin Institute, local reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The development, seen as a landmark in biological research,
could be used to produce more health care products, said leader of
the research team, Ian Wilmut.
</P>
<P>
"It will enable us to study genetic diseases for which there
is presently no cure and track down the mechanisms that are
involved," He said.
</P>
<P>
Until now scientists have achieved only limited results in
producing animals by non-sexual methods, though much progress has
been made in plant breeding.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that although they could not rule out the
possibility of the technique being used in humans, such an act
would be illegal under the fertilization research laws.
</P>
<P>
Therefore no responsible biologist would start such research,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK People Continue To Mourn Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- People in Hong Kong today
continued to pay tribute to the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
who died Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
From around 7:00 AM, people were queuing up outside the
building of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch where a mourning
hall was set up Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Opening time has been extended from the original 9:30 AM to
5:00 PM to current 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM to receive flocking mourners
 from every corner of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Moving into the hall along with his wife and grandchildren, an
emigrant from the Chinese mainland, Mr Mok, bowed and kneeled down
 before the portrait.
</P>
<P>
"It was after Mr Deng resumed his work (to take charge of state
 affairs in late 1970s) that the situation in the country turned
better and that I could come to Hong Kong to join my family," said
 the tearful 77-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
A grieved student from Pui Kiu Middle School said: "Deng made
great contribution by pushing China's reform and opening up to the
 outside world and by initiating 'one country, two systems.' I'm
very sad over his passing away."
</P>
<P>
A group of middle school students from Ningbo, a city in the
Chinese province of Zhejiang, also joined the mourners. They were
invited here to participate in activities marking the 80th
anniversary of Hong Kong girl scouts.
</P>
<P>
Local people voiced their deep regret that the great man, whose
 wisdom and foresight led to a successful settlement of the Hong
Kong issue, couldn't see for himself the historic moment of Hong
Kong's handover in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
Nellie Fong Wong Kut-man, member of the Executive Council of
the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, vowed, "We
will manage Hong Kong well so as to live up to his expectations."
</P>
<P>
People were also paying their respects to Deng by reading books
 about his life and deeds.
</P>
<P>
"My Father Deng Xiaoping," "The Selected Works of Deng
Xiaoping" and "Deng Xiaoping on Hong Kong" were selling well
these days.
</P>
<P>
A special counter was set up Thursday at the bookstores of
Joint Publishing (Hong Kong) Company Ltd., which was displaying
some 50 kinds of books on "the great son of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
Mr Fung of the bookstore said that the counter would help
people have a better knowledge of Deng's greatness.
</P>
<P>
These books were selected from more than 100 ones published in
the Chinese mainland or in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
A pictorial on Deng published in Beijing was especially
welcomed by local societies and institutions, in spite of its
price as high as 150 HK dollars (some 19 US dollars), he
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers and special issues have been selling well in the
last few days across the territory.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the first day following Deng's death, all the
local newspapers were sold out in the early morning. A female
owner of a stall in Wanchai, Hong Kong Island, had to fetch more
copies from the distribution center.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Business People Mourn Death of Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Business people in central
China's Hubei Province expressed deep sorrow over the death of
Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's reform and opening-up
policy, according to today's "People's Daily."
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhengxia, former director of the No. Two Automobile Plant
in Shiyan city in the western part of the province, choked up and
sobbed while recalling Deng's visit to the factory in 1980.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the construction of the factory was
approved by Deng himself.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Deng was excited upon hearing that the
factory was trying to cooperate with eight automobile factories in
south China and pointed out that "cooperation and large-scale
production is the right way to develop the automobile industry."
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Deng's praise, the factory soon became the
Dongfeng Automobile Corporation, joining more than 100 automobile
companies in over 20 provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
"Dongfeng could not have become China's largest automobile
manufacturer without the help of Deng Xiaoping," Huang said, and
that Deng was very happy to know that Wang Zhaoguo, then
vice-director of the factory, was only 39. He mentioned many times
the importance of finding talented people and said that senior
people had the responsibility of promoting young and talented
people.
</P>
<P>
Liu Benren, general manager of the Wuhan Iron and Steel
Complex, said that the complex received timely help from Deng
during hard times, and that that is perhaps why many workers
spontaneously stood in silent tribute for three minutes after the
sad news was broadcast last Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Deng inspected the complex three times -- right after the
complex began operations in December 1958, at the end of 1973 when
the complex was negotiating with foreign businessmen on importing
a 1.7-m rolling mill, and in July 1980 when the company tried the
imported mill out.
</P>
<P>
During Deng's last visit, a former leader of the complex, Shen
Yinluo, reported on the difficulties such a large state enterprise
faces, and asked for more decision-making power and foreign trade
permits. According to Shen, Deng listened attentively without
giving his views, but before long the complex was granted foreign
trade rights, the first in the country's metallurgy industry.
</P>
<P>
"Although Comrade Xiaoping has left us, his instructions will
always help us to make progress," Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wheat Expert Recalls Anecdotes About Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese wheat expert today
mourned the death of Deng Xiaoping by recalling some anecdotes
reflecting the late Chinese leader's great concern for China's
wheat output.
</P>
<P>
Deng Jingyang, an 81-year-old researcher at the Chinese Academy
of Agricultural Sciences, said that he created a new
wheat-breeding technique in 1979.
</P>
<P>
However he was forced to write to Deng Xiaoping for help in the
early 1980s, as his research was being hampered.
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of the same day Deng Xiaoping told the academy
leadership to resolve the problems through coordination with the
relevant departments, Deng Jingyang recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the care shown by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, my work of
breeding wheat with the new method was able to continue," the
academic said.
</P>
<P>
His research findings were later published at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
On December 30, 1983 Chen Ning Yang, a Chinese-American Nobel
prize winner for physics, wrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping asking
for help in the protection of seed-breeding resources.
</P>
<P>
Deng immediately handed the letter to leading officials of the
concerned departments, ordering them to give the necessary support.
</P>
<P>
In 1985 Deng Jingyang's program was short of researchers, and
again he wrote to Deng Xiaoping asking for an additional ten staff.
</P>
<P>
Ten days later the academic was notified by his institute's
personnel department that his request had been granted.
</P>
<P>
"Though I never met Comrade Deng Xiaoping, I was impressed by
his concern for wheat production, by his resoluteness and by his
high work efficiency," Deng said.
</P>
<P>
To date, this veteran expert has bred 28 fine wheat varieties,
which have been planted on more than 80 million mu (about 5.3
million ha).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- All over China people are
expressing their grief over the death of Deng Xiaoping in various
ways.
</P>
<P>
"We were so saddened by the news," said a man named Chen, an
employee in a government organization in north China's Tianjin
City. He was woken up on the morning of February 20 by his wife,
who told him that Deng had passed away Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to Song Yuanpu, a 70-year-old woman living in
Tianjin's Heping District, Deng was both a great figure and an
ordinary senior citizen.
</P>
<P>
"I was greatly moved by his will to donate his body and cornea
for medical use," said Song, in tears. She persuaded her children
not to celebrate the Lantern Festival, which fell on February 21,
in respect for Deng.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yujun is a young vegetable farmer in the suburbs of
Tianjin. "I don't think the good policies of the government will
change just because Deng Xiaoping has passed away," he said
confidently. He plans to invest 5,000 yuan in the expansion of his
greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
Some college students in Tianjin also expressed their
confidence in China's future under the guidance of Deng's theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In recent years students at the city's 21 universities have
formed more than 1,000 groups to read the Selected Works of Deng
Xiaoping and study his theories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tens of thousands of residents in Chengdu flocked to
bookstores to buy portraits of Deng.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 portraits, which had been transported by air to
the city Friday evening, were sold out within an hour Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"The reform and opening-up policy pioneered by Deng Xiaoping
has helped the Chinese people to lead a better life," said Chen
Jinlan, a retiree, who bought eight portraits of Deng.
</P>
<P>
"I will give these to my children to let them remember Comrade
Xiaoping forever," she said.
</P>
<P>
Many bookstores in the city have set up special counters to
sell books, picture albums and audio and video publications
connected with Deng Xiaoping. Video tapes and VCDs of a TV series
on the late leader have already been sold out in Chengdu.

<HEADLINE> Primakov in Brussels for Talks With Solana on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov arrived today in Brussels where NATO has its
headquarters to hold another round of talks with NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana on post-Cold War relations between NATO and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The talks, the second between the two men since January, was
reportedly being held at Solana's official residence in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Solana is expected to spell out the details of the conventional
arms initiative and other features of a special security
partnership in an attempt to alley Russia's concerns about NATO's
eastward expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
After talks with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in
Moscow Friday, Primakov said Moscow remained "negatively disposed
to the expansion of NATO."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin reportedly said
today in Moscow that a compromise deal could be reached at a
summit with US President Bill Clinton in Helsinki next month if
NATO was to delay its expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Moscow remains firmly opposed to NATO's plans, but NATO has
already committed itself to invite some countries of the former
East bloc to join the alliance and is not likely to compromise on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the last few weeks have seen many diplomatic
activities as NATO tried to reach a deal with Moscow before its
summit meeting in July, when membership invitations are expected
to be issued to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
NATO is offering Russia a special charter setting out relations
between the two sides, but Russia wants this to be a legally
binding treaty while the West is looking for something flexible.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis, AIDS Hit North Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Two killer diseases,
Meningitis and AIDS, are hitting Mogadishu, capital of the Horn
of Africa country of Somalia, local doctors said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mohamed Ahmed, Director of Al-Arafat Hospital in North
Mogadishu, said 12 cases of meningitis have been diagnosed in his
center this month.
</P>
<P>
Victims are mainly children between four and eight years old
who, according to Dr. Ahmed, are Somali refugees who had just
returned from neighboring Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Although all the patients have been given necessary treatment,
the doctor warned against a possible spread of the extremely
communicable disease of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
In the Mother and Child Health Care Center in North
Mogadishu, doctors have registered four meningitis victims, who
were all children under five.
</P>
<P>
Doctors of the two hospitals, which are visited by more than
90 sick children every day, also worried about local communities'
lack of knowledge of the symptoms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"They always confuse the meningitis with cerebral malaria that
resembles the disease in terms of the high fever, muscle
paralysis and body stiffness," said Dr. Ahmed,
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Joint Health Authority (JHA) of Mogadishu has
revealed the existence of AIDS in the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to JHA Coordinator Dr. Osman Dufle, nine AIDS cases
were discovered in Mount Sinai Clinic of North Mogadishu. Most of
the patients were women.
</P>
<P>
The doctor, who declined to comment on the number of AIDS
patients in Mogadishu, said the disease was "sporadic" in
general.
</P>
<P>
Both meningitis and AIDS are uncommon in Somalia. It was only
last year that 63 AIDS cases were diagnosed in the northern part
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Autonomous Regions Mourn Deng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic-minority people in
China's five autonomous regions have been plunged into deep sorrow
by the news about Deng Xiaoping's death in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic groups have held various mourning services to review
Deng's great contributions to the country's prosperity and unity,
and to accelerating its reform and opening-up, and the
modernization drive in the autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The regions are the Xinjiang Uygur, Tibet, Inner Mongolia,
Guangxi Zhuang and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping died of illness here Wednesday at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days organizations of the Communist Party of
China and government organs and press institutions in Xinjiang
have continuously received telephone calls expressing the callers'
profound grief over Deng's death.
</P>
<P>
Ayimhan, deputy manager of a textile company in Urumqi, capital
of Xinjiang, recalled her meeting with Deng in Beijing's Great
Hall of the People on September 29, 1988, when she was attending a
conference of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
She presented Deng with a hat as a gift from the ethnic groups
in Xinjiang, and Deng shook hands with her and encouraged her to
work hard for the unity of China's nationalities and for a better
Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Kasim, an 83-year-old herdsman, still remembers the visit to
his home by Deng in August 1981, when the elderly statesman gave
him a gift of tea. Over the past decade he has listened to the
radio every day to hear news about Deng.
</P>
<P>
"Deng looks so healthy and energetic in the picture in my
room. It's a great pity he passed away so suddenly," Kasim said,
adding that it was Deng who led him and his fellow herdsmen to a
better-off life.
</P>
<P>
In Tibet, Party and government institutions held various
meetings to mourn the passing of Deng, and many Tibetan officials
re-read an article by Deng on "The Equality of the Nationalities
and Acceleration of Tibet's Development".
</P>
<P>
Losang Jamcan, mayor of Lhasa, said that he and his colleagues
should implement Deng's guidelines on work in Tibet and do a
better job in Tibet, adding this is the best way to cherish Deng's
memory.
</P>
<P>
Degyi, the first woman director of a township government in
Tibet, said that without Mao Zedong's and Deng Xiaoping's correct
leadership, the Tibetan people would never have such a stable and
well-off life as they have today.

<HEADLINE> People of Chongqing City Mourn for Deng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The words of condolence, in a
poetic refrain, from an ordinary family in southwest China's
Chongqing city may reveal the close relation of Deng Xiaoping to
the city:
</P>
<P>
"From here, a vigorous young man at the age of 16, embarked on
the road to revolution, and to the city he returned, a man of 45,
the founding member of China, leading thousands and thousands of
soldiers, to liberate his people. "
</P>
<P>
Ever since the local people heard the news of Deng's death last
Thursday morning, the largest industrial city in populous Sichuan
province fell into deep sorrow, according to today's "People's
Daily".
</P>
<P>
The same sad topic can be heard everywhere in the city, in
government offices, schools, company offices and workshops and
among the young and the old, and those who had been with Deng were
overwhelmed with sorrow.
</P>
<P>
Duan Daming, 87, who soldiered with Deng, fell into a reverie
of days spent with the great man: "I remember clearly the words
Deng told us at a gathering before the army marched to Dabie
Mountains half a century ago. He quoted Chairman Mao Zedong as
saying that there were three possibilities: either we hold our
ground in the mountainous area, or are forced to withdraw, or we
move around. He said that he chose the first."
</P>
<P>
"Such resourcefulness and determination encouraged me for the
rest of my life," Duan said.
</P>
<P>
In the city government building, the site of the former
Southwestern Bureau of the CPC Central Committee where Deng served
as first secretary for three years, there appeared a large scroll
with the words: "Eternal Glory To Our Respected and Beloved
Comrade Xiaoping!"
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhicheng, who had worked at the bureau, said that he was
impressed by Deng's focus on economic construction: "The first
decision he made was to build a railroad between Chongqing and
Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, which proved to be a key to
revitalizing Chongqing's economy."
</P>
<P>
In subsequent years, the city built a gymnasium, a workers'
palace, a city museum and an exhibition hall. "We were impressed
then that Comrade Xiaoping was trying his best to do some
practical things for Chongqing's economic growth and for the local
people," said Wang Xiaocai and Liu Longhua, the former director
and the deputy-director of the city Party Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Delin, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee
of the city, said that Deng always cared about Chongqing's
economic development. Chongqing was listed as the first big city
to try the reforms and then became the first city to enjoy the
status of province.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever Deng met with officials from Chongqing he would ask
for details on Chongqing's development," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday morning, city and Party officials gathered to
commemorate Deng and his accomplishments. They expressed their
determination to fulfill Deng's wish that Chongqing be built into
a beautiful, modern city, and to complete the task of relocating
people in the Three Gorges project and promoting rural development.
</P>
<P>
If it is approved by the National People's Congress, Chongqing
will become the country's largest municipality directly under the
control of the central government, with an area of 82,000 sq km
and a population of 30 million.

death. They are grateful to Deng for his great contributions to
the development of the ethnic-minority areas.
</P>
<P>

tearfully: "It was only after liberation that we herdsman became
our own masters. And it was only after the implementation of
Deng's reform and opening-up policy that we got to lead a well-off
life."
</P>
<P>
He said that now the yearly income of his family exceeds 30,000
yuan (about 3,700 US dollars), more than ten times what it was
only a decade ago. He has built his own spacious and well-equipped
house.
</P>
<P>
Xurigan, a scientist of the Mongolian nationality and the
president of Inner Mongolia University, told a reporter that the
policies initiated by Deng have created favorable conditions for
researchers of different ethnic groups to make advances.
</P>
<P>
"My achievements in biological research can not be separated
from the Party's education and care," he said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chengwu, a 15-year-old student of the Zhuang nationality
in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, burst into tears when he
heard about the death of Deng. In 1992 he and 13 other poor
students were helped to continue their schooling with money
donated by Deng.
</P>
<P>
"I will turn my sorrow into strength and encourage myself to
study harder to repay grandpa Deng's care with my deeds," he said.
</P>

In the former revolutionary base of Baise, where Deng once lead
a famous uprising, people of different ethnic groups went to the
Baise Uprising Museum to mourn for Deng one after another.

<HEADLINE> NATO Expansion Costs 35 Bln Dlrs, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- It will cost up to 35
billion U.S. dollars over the next 12 years for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) to expand into central and Eastern
Europe, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the Washington Post said, will share about
200 million U.S. dollars of the total each year.
</P>
<P>
The cost projections are contained in a 31-page European
security strategy study that the Clinton administration is to
submit to Congress Monday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The 16-nation NATO plans to select at its special summit in
July in Madrid the first group of new members from among 11
central and Eastern European countries that are seeking to join.
Top on the list are Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
To upgrade their armed forces, integrate them into the NATO
command structure and make them part of NATO's collective air
defense system will cost 2.1 billion to 2.7 billion U.S. dollars a
year, according to the estimate.
</P>
<P>
The document assumes that the new members selected at the
Madrid summit will pay 35 percent of the cost, the 15 European
members of the alliance, 50 percent and the U.S., 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The cost projections do not include the potential U.S. share
of a joint NATO-Russia peacekeeping brigade, which the United
States offered to create last week in an effort to ease Russian
opposition to NATO expansion," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the cost estimate covers only the first group of
new members while the Clinton administration stresses NATO will
welcome additional candidates.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton vowed to start accepting new
members into NATO by the year 1999 in despite of the strong
opposition from Moscow.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- In a major fire tragedy in
India, well over 200 devotees were burnt to death and 500 others
wounded, 300 critically, in an inferno of flames which swept
through a number of temporary sheds constructed for a religious
conference in India's Orissa state today, Press Trust of India
(PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that about 300 people with serious burn
injuries had been rushed to a major hospital in Baripada district
of Orissa, where the tragedy took place.
</P>
<P>
"The toll is going up fast," as more bodies were being
recovered from under the debris, A.B. Tripathy, director general
of the local police, told PTI.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said over 4,000 devotees attending the
religious conference in Baripada were trapped when the sheds
caught fire.
</P>
<P>
There was a stampede among the people to escape as they were
encircled by the fire.
</P>
<P>
It was not yet clear as to how the fire started as there were
conflicting reports about the cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
While one report said that an electric short circuit had
sparked the fire, another report said that it was caused by the
bursting of a gas cylinder.
</P>

Fire fighters rushed to the scene from the nearby town, but by
then the blaze had charred the sheds with injured people lying
scattered all over.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Continue to Mourn for Deng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- People throughout China are
continuing to pay tribute to Deng Xiaoping, recall his great
contributions to modernizing China and vow to unite under the
Chinese Communist Party leadership with Jiang Zemin at its core.
</P>
<P>
So far, 400,000 copies of Deng's portraits have been printed
and another 100,000 will soon come off the press. Among them, more
than 200,000 have been sent to 20 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities in China.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hu Fuming, President of the Social Sciences Academy
of east China's Jiangsu Province and the original author of the
well-known article "Social practice is the sole criterion for
verifying truth," said he was shocked to hear about Deng's Death.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was Deng who initiated the nationwide
discussion on the criterion of truth in 1978 and laid a sound
basis for the ideological emancipation afterwards.
</P>
<P>
It was Deng's ideological policy that made possible the smooth
progress of the reform and opening-up and the shift of the Party's
work focus to the modernization drive, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiwen, director of the agriculture department of the
Development and Research Center under the State Council, said Deng
advocated to give farmers more freedom in doing business and it
was under this guideline that the rural areas undertook the
contract responsibility system which led to a successful rural
reform.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shijia, a farmer manager of a medicine company in
Shandong Province, said without Deng's right direction, the
farmers would not have left the farmland and turned to advanced
businesses such as medicine manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
"As long as China marches along the road of socialism with
Chinese characteristics charted by Deng, it will become even
stronger and richer," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the recent days, China's artistic circles also held various
seminars to mourn for Deng.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xiaozhong, President of the China Central Drama Institute,
said China has entered a prosperous period for artistic and
literary development which was inspired by the Deng-initiated
ideological emancipation.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing this historic period, literary and art workers feel
very proud and develop a grateful feeling toward Deng.

<P>
Deng Xiaoping, who loved his country and served the people
wholeheartedly, had set a good example of being "the son of the
Chinese people".
</P>
<P>
While recalling his great deeds of devoting his life to the
Chinese people, people from all walks of life decided to follow
his suit to make more contributions to China with their
professional skills and to serve the people better.
</P>
<P>
"The donation of his body and cornea showed the selflessness of
Deng," Said Xu Hu, a model worker noted for repairing water and
electricity facilities in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"He had kept his promise of being the son of the Chinese people
and served the people till his death," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"As a grass-roots cadre and Party member, I will make every
effort to solve problems, even trifles for the people, so as to
continue the work along the road charted by Deng," said Wu
Tianxiang, deputy director of Wuchang District in Wuhan, capital
of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
He said that by observing Deng's great personality, he has made
some simple rules for himself, which include refraining from
seeking personal fame and gain, or expecting high ranks, or taking
any glory for granted.
</P>
<P>
Qiu E'guo, a model policeman in Nanchang in Jiangxi Province,
broke into tears on learning about Deng's death.
</P>
<P>
"To serve the people better is the best mourning service for
Deng," he said, describing Deng as always putting the destiny of
the country and people before his own.
</P>
<P>
Li Suli, a model conductor on No.21 Bus Route in Beijing, could
not help crying each time she heard or saw the news about Deng's
death on radio, television and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
She said she will turn grief into strength and make more
efforts to serve the passengers.

Deng's idea that "both material progress and cultural and
ideological advancement should be enhanced" is an important
guidance for China's socialist development.
</P>
<P>
"This idea reflects Deng's foresight and sagacity as a great
statesman," said Zheng Keyang, deputy director of the Policy
Research Office of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
When the well-known writer Zhang Haidi from east China's
Shandong province heard about the death of Deng, she burst into
tears, saying "the old man will live in my heart forever."
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1980s, the whole nation was once
shocked by Zhang's story of making unremitting efforts to improve
herself despiting her deformity.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Xiaoyang, an official of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, said that Deng's idea of enhancing the
legislation work and administering the country by laws is a
treasure Deng leaves to China.
</P>
<P>
He said that a series of Deng's instructions on legislation has
made great contribution to the nation's improvement in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Senglin, chairman of the provincial legislature in
Guangdong, can still remember the scene when Deng made an
inspection tour of southern China in the spring of 1992.
</P>
<P>
"His instructions on Guangdong's reform and opening-up as well
as the establishment of special economic zones at that time have
always been a great ideological force to push forward social and
economic development in Guangdong," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Zhangjiagang city in Jiangsu province, officials said they
will mourn for Deng by working harder to build the city better.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 when Deng was on an inspection tour of Shanghai, he
attached great importance to Shanghai's development. Now,
according to Xu Deming, a Party official in charge of propaganda
work, Shanghai is advancing fast to reach its objectives.
</P>
<P>
"We will persevere in carrying out Deng's behests to make
Shanghai an modernized international metropolis," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein met here this
afternoon with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
and expressed his concern over Israeli government's settlement
policy in Jerusalem, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which was also attended by Jordanian Crown
Prince Hassan and Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, the two
leaders also discussed issues on removing the existing barriers to
increase trade among Jordan, the Palestinian self-rule areas and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hussein called for collective efforts to help remove the
obstacles impeding the Middle East peace process and press ahead
for comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's visit to Jordan is amid at solving a major dispute
between Israel and the Palestinians over the Jewish state's plans
to build settlements in the Palestinian territories, including
East Jerusalem seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who returned home from a visit to Europe and Morocco
Thursday, has voiced serious concern over the Israeli plans,
which he described as "posing a serious threat to the entire Middle
East peace process."
</P>
<P>
In comments to reporters upon his return, Hussein warned that
any new construction in East Jerusalem could pre-empt final
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the status of
the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was originally scheduled to visit Jordan earlier this
month, but he delayed the trip following the death of 73 Israeli
soliders in a mid-air collision of two Israeli helicopters in
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first visit by Netanyahu to Jordan since the
Hebron agreement was signed last month between Israel and the
Palestinians under the successful mediation of Hussein.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Briefs AL on Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Middle East peace envoy of the
European Union (EU) Miguel Moratinos today briefed Secretary
General of the the Arab League (AL) Esmat Abdul Meguid on his
efforts to reactivate peace talks on the Israeli-Syrian and
Israeli-Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Meguid, Moratinos voiced satisfaction
with the role of the EU in the peace process, the Egyptian MENA
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The European envoy, on the first leg of his three-nation
Mideast tour, said he presented the AL chief with some "definitive
points" and "new ideas" on how to make progress in the peace
process, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
On EU's close contacts with Egypt, he said that he has
discussed those ideas with other Egyptian officials during the
current visit.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the EU role in the region would be
furthered politically and economically during the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and EU have been working for restarting the
Israeli-Syrian talks, frozen since last March after a series of
suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants Israel to return the Golan Heights captured in the
1967 Mideast war for a comprehensive peace agreement. But Israel
reportedly only agrees to a partial withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos urged collective efforts to secure progress in the
peace process and expressed the hope that Arabs and Israel will
establish normal relations in the future through "positive steps."
</P>
<P>
He also called for maximizing the positive aspects of the
January 15 agreement on Israeli troop redeployment from Hebron,
the result of months of laborious talks.
</P>
<P>
EU, the largest donor to the Palestinians, has provided a
letter of guarantee to Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat to ensure the implementation of the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that no counter-action would develop in the coming
weeks against the efforts exerted to ensure a comprehensive peace
in the region," said the envoy, appointed last August to advance
the peace march in a drive to bring into full play the European
role in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meguid, for his part, asserted the importance to intensified
efforts to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He described the European role in this regard as complementary
and supportive of the U.S. role, but not replacing or competing
with it since the latter has played a definitive role since a long
time ago.
</P>
<P>
Recently the EU has warned the U.S. to avoid playing its role
in the interest of Israel only, while Europe should also shun
supporting the Palestinians alone.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour today promised that the government will provide seeds of cereal
crops free of charge to farmers in Pemba and Unguja whose crops have
been destroyed by a prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
The president gave the promise when talking to farmers during
his visit to several drought-affected villages in central and
southern Unguja, according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He urged the farmers to prepare their land for the long rains
falling between March and June as the government is drawing logistics
to supply seeds to them.
</P>
<P>
He said Zanzibar faces its worst dry spell for years
that affects hundreds of acres of crops including cassava and beans
with some trees especially organge trees on the brink of death.
</P>
<P>
He was told by agricultural experts that the drought has been caused
by a lack of rains.
</P>
<P>
The experts also said that livestock is having a hard time
searching for grass and water, saying livestock keepers are now
forced to take their livestock to far places.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Zanzibar Chief Minister Mohammed Bilal had a similar
tour of the affected villages by the dry sell.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Accused of Being Uncooperative in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Police investigators this
afternoon accused Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of being
uncooperative in the questioning about Bar-On affair scandal,
the state-run Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said that they may have to question him
again. The charge came only hours after the Justice Ministry
said that there would be no more comments about the on-going
investigation until it is completed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, sources close to the prime minister criticized
police and the State Attorney's Office for being behind what they
called slanderous leaks about the investigation. They claimed that
their aim is to blacken Netanyahu's name.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was questioned by Police officers Sando Matzor, his
deputy Ya'cov Grossman and Rami Zotler four hours Tuesday night
about the circumstances surrounding Bar-On's appointment as
attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was questioned under caution. According to Israel
law, remarks made when a person is questioned under caution can be
used against the person in following criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Netanyahu Saturday night appointed a
senior attorney to represent him in the Bar-On investigation.
The attorney met with State Attorney Edna Arbel informing her
that the prime minister is highly critical of the leaks about
the questioning.
</P>
<P>
This morning, there was a high-level consultation over recent
leaks in the police investigation. Taking part were
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein, Edna Arbel, Deputy Police
Commander Gabi Last and two police investigators, Sando Mazor and
Ya'cov Grossman.
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, several closest advisers of Netanyahu are
expected to be questioned under caution, including Director of
the Prime Minister's Office Avigdor Lieberman, Cabinet Secretary
Danny Naveh and Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi.
</P>
<P>
The police investigation began after Channel One reported
last month that Bar-On's appointment was part of a deal in
which Shas Party leader Aryeh Deri was promised a plea bargain
by Bar-On, in exchange for Shas' support in the Hebron
agreement. Deri, according to the story, threatened to quit the
Likud-led coalition unless Bar-On was appointed.
</P>
<P>
If the allegations prove true, according to local legal
experts, the Netanyahu government would fall.

<HEADLINE> UK Economy Most Unstable Among Major Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's economy has been the
most unstable among the leading industrial nations for 20 years,
with the worst record for swings in output, according to Lloyds
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Taking a basket of 12 economic pointers, including inflation,
interest rates, GDP and government borrowing, Britain is ranked
the most unstable of the world's top 14 economies.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Foley, chief economic adviser to the bank, wrote in its
latest Economic Bulletin that the UK's inflation rate has been
three times as unstable as the best performing country and its
unemployment rate four-and-a-half times as unstable.
</P>
<P>
However, recently Britain has moved up the international
stability rankings. Sustaining this improvement, Foley said, would
remove an important barrier to investment and faster long-term
growth in living standards.
</P>
<P>
Foley also found strong evidence that countries with
independent central banks have enjoyed relative economic
stability.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans to Build Gas Transmission System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Liquefied Natural
Gas Ltd has unveiled an environment impact assessment report to
prepare for the construction of an 86-km natural gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled to be completed within 17 months in the
leading oil-producing country in Africa, is part of the proposed
200-km pipeline for transmitting natural gas from various gas
fields to its liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Bonny Island
in southeast Nigeria for processing and export.
</P>
<P>
The project comprises the construction and operation of a new
liquefied natural gas plant, a gas pipeline, seven oceangoing
cryogenic vessels and associated utilities for storage and
loading. It will curb the recurrent gas flaring that has been the
bane of the petroleum industry, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The route of the gas transmission system will follow those of
the existing pipelines and only small areas of fresh water, swamp
forest and rainforest will be affected, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced by a Britain-based environmental company,
has been submitted to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency
for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian company has been engaged in a 3.8-billion-U.S.-Dollar
LNG project, a joint venture involving companies from Italy, Spain,
France and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in 1992, the ENEL company of Italy
will buy 3.5 billion cubic meters of gas from Nigeria annually
when the giant LNG is completed in 1999. ENEL's purchase accounts
for about 50 percent of the total production of the Nigerian
company.
</P>
<P>
So far 30 percent of the work has been done at the plant,
which is expected to produce as much as seven billion cubic
meters of LNG a year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Cautiously Optimistic over Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today expressed its
cautious optimism over the signing of an Euro-Egyptian partnership
agreement to facilitate better cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The document will probably be signed in the first half of 1998,
a senior Egyptian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Gamal Bayoumi, Assistant Foreign Minister assigned for the
agreement file, issued a press statement today, beating a
cautiously optimistic note about the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that talks with the European Union countries
in this regard hit several snags, especially regarding the
agricultural file.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is pressing for easier access to EU markets for Egyptian
food stuffs, especially rice and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
The EU has agreed on quotas that reflected the historical level
of Egyptian exports which Egypt argues are based on a time when it
traded mainly with the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Bayoumi blamed the delayed conclusion of the agreement on the
European offers which do not meet Egyptian requirement for its
agricultural produce export.
</P>
<P>
"But the European side has begun to appreciate the Egyptian
potentials in this sector, which contributed to advancing
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has said recently that the European side wants to end the
partnership negotiations before Barcelona II meetings which will
be held in Malta in April.
</P>
<P>
The Malta gathering will probe economic partnership between the
EU and the Middle East within the context of the agreements that
Morocco, Tunis and Israel have already signed. Egypt, Jordan and
Lebanon are negotiating terms for such agreements.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Finance Philippe Maystadt today ended
his three-day visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Saudi Arabia, he signed an agreement on
preventing dual taxation on air transportation between the two
countries, according Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reports from Riyadh,
the capital of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The reports, which were monitored here, said the Belgian
minister said in a pre-departure statement that he was
satisfied with the positive results achieved at the economic,
trade and investment levels between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Maystadt said the agreement signed with his Saudi counterpart
Ibrahim Al-Assaf Saturday on preventing dual taxation on air
transportation was the significant part of his trip, pointing out
that such a move would help increase trade and air transportation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He anticipated that more steps supporting joint economic,
trade and investment cooperation between the two countries would
be taken in the upcoming stage.
</P>
<P>
Maystadt arrived in Saudi Arabia Friday. During his stay in
the kingdom, Maystadt conveyed a letter from Belgian Crown Prince
Philippe to Saudi Prime Minister and Commander of the National Guards
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz. However, the content of the letter was not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He also met with a number of Saudi ministers and other senior
officials on means of bolstering bilateral relations in the

<HEADLINE> Jordan, S. Arabia Call for Efforts to Bolster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Jordan
have called for efforts to bolster the sluggish Middle East peace
process on all tracks, demanding Israel to respect all of its
commitments and agreements to realize a just and comprehensive
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency reports, filed from Saudi capital of Riyadh
today and monitored here, said that Saudi King Fahd and Jordanian
King Hussein agreed Thursday night that the Middle East peace
talks should rest on U.N. Security Council resolutions 242, 338
and 425 as well as Madrid principle of trading land for peace.
</P>
<P>
The two monarchs discussed the recent developments of the
Middle East peace process in the light of the Hebron deal
between the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on bilateral relations and ways of
upgrading their level in various fields, including economic
cooperation, trade exchange and employment of Jordanian workforce
in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, King Hussein elaborated on the efforts
he made to end the stalemate in talks between the PNA and Israel
on Hebron, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi cabinet welcomed the deal and considered it a step
towards achieving lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein arrived in Saudi Arabia's second holy city of
Al-Madina Thursday morning on his second visit to the Kingdom in
five months to meet King Fahd pay pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off by King Fahd and other Saudi high officials at
the airport late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's ties with its largest southern neighbor and other
Gulf Arab states were strained when King Hussein refused to
join Saudi Arabia and other Arab and Western countries in
condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Saudi oil supplies to Jordan were cut off the next month
and Amman was forced to rely solely on Iraq for its energy
needs.
</P>
<P>
Things began to improve when King Hussein turned against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein after the defection of two
senior Iraqi officers to Jordan in 1994 and relations between
the two countries improved dramatically after King Hussein's
last visit to Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Peace Between Jordan, Israel Example </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The peace between Jordan and
Israel is an example for other countries in the Middle East,
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this evening after meeting with
Jordanian King Hussein, Netanyahu admitted, however, that there
was difference on the issue of East Jerusalem between Jordan and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was possible for Israel to score a comprehensive solution
to its dispute with the Palestinians, Netanyahu said. He called
on the Palestinians to give up using violence, which, he said,
might pose danger to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said at the press conference that Jordan was willing
to play the role of middle man to settle the disputes between
Israel and Syria if such a role is needed.
</P>
<P>
During their talks today, both sides stressed the importance to
continue the peace process and discussed the 16 agreements of
cooperation in trade.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed that the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan
and Israel must be respected and Jordan will be responsible for
the issue of the Holy City of Jerusalem until the city's fate
is decided during the final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Hussein explained to Netanyahu Jordan's
stand on the issue of the Jewish settlement in Jerusalem and
stressed that the Israeli policy of establishing Jewish
settlements in Jerusalem must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was scheduled to visit Jordan earlier this month,
but he delayed the trip following the death of 73 Israeli
soldiers in a mid-air collision of two Israeli helicopters in
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit by the Israeli prime minister to
Jordan since the Hebron deal was signed last month between Israel
and the Palestinians under the successful mediation of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu left here for home after the press conference.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Should Fall Along With Oil Prices: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices are
tumbling, making it possible for gasoline prices to fall in the
United States, the USA Today reported today.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices fell 1.11 U.S. dollars a barrel Thursday and
Friday to 21.39 U.S. dollars on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
An oil expert predicted that the oil price will drop to 18 U.S.
dollars a barrel by May.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline retail prices typically respond to lower oil prices
more slowly than to higher oil prices, according to market
analysts. A slide of 5 cents to 7 cents a gallon by May is likely.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Federal Express, one of leading express parcel
service companies of the country, says it has no plans to remove a
2 percent surcharge on packages, which it started three weeks ago
due to higher jet fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper listed several reasons for the oil changes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, banned from exporting oil since 1990, is being allowed to
raise 1 billion U.S. dollars from humanitarian aid by March 1.
That will "exaggerate" oil price swings, according to some
experts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as oil-producing countries lose market share, they
increase production. OPEC production has hit a 17-year high and
will outpace demand by 1.4 million barrels a day, the paper
reported.
</P>
<P>
A mild winter in the U.S. and Europe eased demand for heating
oil and permitted refineries to switch over to gasoline production
sooner.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 former Chinese
students who had studied abroad and are now working in Hong Kong
voluntarily gathered here this evening to discuss the great deeds
and contributions of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Deng passed away last Wednesday at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
These people, most in their 30s, went to study in the United
States, Germany, Canada, Britain and some other countries in the
late 1980s and have found their jobs in Hong Kong in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
"When we heard the news that Mr. Deng passed away, we were
deeply saddened and thought that we should do something to
commemorate the great man, so we decided to hold this informal
discussion," said Chen Keshi, who got his Ph.D. in Britain and is
now Chinese Market Director of TBV Consult in Hong Kong. Chen was
one of the sponsors of the discussion.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yuxiang, who returned from Germany and is now working in
KSB-Jebsen (China) Ltd. in Hong Kong, said that Deng was one of
the world's greatest leaders in the 20th century. Both his great
contributions to his country and the world and his noble character
should be remembered forever, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhenquan, an economist with the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council, said: "The opening up and reform policy led
by Mr. Deng has sent our country on the fast development track;
Deng's concept of 'one country, two systems' makes it possible for
Hong Kong's continued stability and prosperity. We have all
benefited from his great deeds and will remember him forever."
</P>
<P>
All participants pledged to work hard to contribute to the
prosperity of Hong Kong and of the mainland as a whole.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela has sent a message of condolences to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin over the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Mandela said that the 20th century saw a
generation of great leaders who left their mark not only on China
but the world and Deng Xiaoping was amongst them.
</P>
<P>
The president said that forged in the revolution and
strengthened by the Long March, Deng, who died Wednesday at the
age of 93, finally placed China, through opening to the world and
economic reform, in an excellent position to face the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"He established a foundation on which the next generation of
leaders can build with confidence," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "this century has seen China emerge from the ashes of
the past and witnessed the founding of the People's Republic of
China in 1949. That event restored to China the dignity befitting
a culture with a history encompassing thousands of years."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said,"in its long history China has always produced
leaders who have risen to the challenges of the time." He added in
this period of mourning by the Chinese people, Jiang Zemin's
leadership will no doubt be a source of great strength and
comfort.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Against Turkish General's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
strongly protested against a statement by a Turkish army general
by summoning Turkish Ambassador to Tehran to the Iranian Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that Osman Koruturk,
Turkish Ambassador to Tehran, was summoned to the Iranian Foreign
Ministry to receive the protest over the remarks by Gen. Cevik
Bir, Deputy Chief of Staff of Turkey's Armed Forces, that Iran
supports terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish general made the remarks in Washington while
attending an annual meeting of an organization that promotes
Turkish-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the Foreign Ministry told Koruturk that
Bir's remarks on Iranian sponsorship of terrorism were
"Irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ambassador responded that Ankara's policy was
based on attaching importance to its relations with its
neighbors, including Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the Turkish government is announced by the
Foreign Ministry. The statement made by Bir is not the position
of the Turkish government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Sunday
expressed regrets over the statement by the top Turkish officer,
saying that his statement contradicted positions announced
earlier by the government led by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has been under fire by Turkey's fiercely secular and
strongly pro-U.S. army chiefs for getting closer to Iran.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Rejects Joint Bid for 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body
FIFA ruled out on Monday any possibility of a joint bid by Germany
and England to host 2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
British media carried reports that German soccer federation
president Egidius Braun had mentioned the idea of the two
countries co-hosting the event.
</P>
<P>
But German officials denied the reports and FIFA said it would
not approve of such an arrangement anyway.
</P>
<P>
"I must say that I am not aware of these remarks by the German
FA president and I have seen no mention of them in the German
press," FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
"But even if a joint bid was put forward it would not gain
approval. FIFA decided after awarding the 2002 finals jointly to
Japan and (South) Korea that the subsequent finals would revert to
being played in one country, " he added.
</P>
<P>
German soccer federation spokesman Michael Novak said Braun's
remarks in a sports television show Sunday night were
misunderstood by the British media. He said Braun never referred
to a joint bid or co-hosting the finals, and spoke only of whether
it was desirable to have one European candidate.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Portuguese Presidents Mull Macao Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Portuguese President
Jorge Sampaio said here today that he is fully confident about the
smooth settlement of the Macao issue.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio, who arrived here Sunday on a state visit to China,
made the remark during his talks with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio added that the idea of "one country, two systems"
proposed by Deng Xiaoping had laid the basis for the settlement of
the Macao issue.
</P>
<P>
He praised Deng for having made a major contribution to the
signing of the Sino-Portuguese joint declaration on the Macao
issue.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed condolences over the death of Deng, who
passed away Wednesday evening at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the Macao issue will make Portugal-China
relations "a model of state-to-state relations" and will benefit
the all-round development of the relations between the European
Union and China, Sampaio noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese government has always attached
importance to the proper settlement of both the Hong Kong and
Macao issues and to the stable transition and smooth transfer of
power in Hong Kong and Macao in an effort to maintain the
prosperity and stability of the two areas.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 will be an important year in the Chinese history,
since the Chinese people's long-cherished wish of resuming the
exercise of the sovereignty over Hong Kong will come true, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that, taking advantage of the valuable experience
gained in resolving the Hong Kong issue and the good cooperation
between China and Portugal, the Macao issue will be settled
smoothly and satisfactorily," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang commented that China and Portugal have had "good
cooperation" since the two governments signed the joint
declaration on Macao nearly 10 years ago. He added that the work
of the Sino-Portuguese joint liaison group on the issue has been
"effective."
</P>
<P>
There is a lot to do in the remaining three years of the
transitional period of Macao, and the two countries should further
enhance their cooperation and speed up the work of the joint
liaison group, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Major tasks pinpointed by Jiang include the localization of
civil servants, the localization of laws, securing the official
status of the Chinese language, and the transfer of archives and
assets.
</P>
<P>
The proper settlement of these issues will be conducive to the
stability and development of Macao and is in the common interest
of both China and Portugal, Jiang added.

building socialism with Chinese characteristics and fulfill the
great cause of reform and opening to the outside world, which was
initiated by Deng.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said that since the establishment of Portuguese-Chinese
diplomatic relations, high-level exchanges of visits have been
frequent, with extensive growth in bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Sampaio, his entourage includes a large number of
entrepreneurs, who hope the visit will help secure their economic
and trade ties with China.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the European Union (EU), Portugal always insists
that EU should strengthen its ties with China. It also supports
China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) at an early
date.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang welcomed Sampaio's visit to China, saying he
believes that Sampaio's current trip will further invigorate
development of bilateral ties and the cooperation on the issue of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Portugal, since their establishment of
diplomatic relations 18 years ago, have been enjoying a friendly
relationship of cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Particularly in recent years, both sides have increased their
high-level contacts, which helped deepen mutual understanding and
promote bilateral cooperation, he noted, adding that bilateral
trade volume has grown steadily.
</P>
<P>
Jiang believed that the visit of President Sampaio and
entrepreneurs accompanying him will help further enhance the
development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to developing friendly
cooperative relations with Portugal, which are not only in the
fundamental interests of the Chinese people but also conducive to
establishing a new Asian-European partnership, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates Portugal's stance on the "one China" policy
and its efforts in supporting China's entry into WTO and promoting
the improvement of Sino-European relations, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Jiang and Sampaio attended a signing ceremony
for an agreement on the Sino-Portuguese cultural exchange program
for the years 1997-99.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Says Not to Stop Drive to Amend Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said today he would not try to stop the on-going signature
drive by several groups to amend the country's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on his Sunday's conversation with former President
Corazon Aquino, Ramos said he has assured Aquino that he was not
pressing for immediate changes in the Charter, but would not stop
the current campaign to amend the Charter.
</P>
<P>
"I explained to (former) President Aquino that it is a matter
of timing. If there is no opportunity any more for some of these
important questions to be attended to under the present
Constitution, then they can wait for a better time. Maybe after
1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos decided not to stop the drive to amend the Constitution
after the country's judiciary recently meddled in some of the
government's businesses.
</P>
<P>
In turning down his predecessor's appeal for him to stop a
people's initiative aimed at amending the Charter, Ramos said that
he was only upholding the people's freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
"As President who is responsible for the well-being of the
people and for our national interest, I will not curtail the right
of the people to know what the important issues are regarding the
Charter," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos voiced once again his opposition to the
extension of his term through amending the Constitution. He
promised to Aquino that he would step down when his term expires
in 1998.

JERUSALEM -- Turkmen Foreign Minister Boris Shikhmyradov has
requested a meeting with Israeli National Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon to discuss the supply of natural gas to Israel,
local daily Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior Israeli industry source as saying
that Shikhmyradov has apparently asked Foreign Minister David
Levy to arrange the meeting for Shikhmyradov's visit here on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
If a deal is to come out of the negotiations, it would provide
an alternative to lines of supply from Qatar and Egypt, which are
proving difficult to secure, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Turkomen are proposing the construction of a pipeline under
the Caspian Sea to Turkey, from where Israel will be supplied.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli government sources suggested the financial
and political costs will be too large a burden for the former
Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli Company Merhav was last week involved
in two deals with the Turkomen worth some 600 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first was for a refinery upgrade and construction of a new
petrochemical plant, and the other project is for upgrading the
country's natural gas infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Acting for the Turkmen government, Merhav is organizing both
projects and will supervise their execution.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Africa's Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has been hailed these days for its decision to
immediately ban the use, development, production and stockpiling
of anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
As many as 70 civilians across the world are killed or maimed
by landmines every day, officials of the South Africa Campaign to
Ban Landmines said.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the ban would "open the floodgates for our
African neighbors to implement domestic measures to outlow
anti-personnel mines".
</P>
<P>
"By taking the bold step of abandoning its program to develop
smart mines, the government has finally recognized that the
global landmine crisis is a humanitarian issue and not a security
issue," they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ceasefire Campaign, which coordinates more than
100 community and non-governmental organizations in South Africa,
have also praised the move as a "good ban".
</P>
<P>
South Africa announced last Thursday to impose a comprehensive
and immediate ban on anti-personnel landmines, calling on other
countries to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Minister Joe Modise told reporters that
some 160,000 anti-personnel mines stockpiled in the country,
except a limited number for training personnel in de-mining
techniques, would soon be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the latest cabinet decision, South Africa announced
last year to ban export of all kinds of landmines.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, a strong economical and military power in
Africa, was deeply involved in conflicts on the continent,
especially in the southern African region during the apartheid
era.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 20 million mines scattered around southern Africa
were produced in South Africa, Local daily the Citizen quoted a
reliable source as saying today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Angola, which is embarking on an uneasy
peace process after 20 years of civil war, has between five and
10 million hidden mines, while Mozambique, a neighbor of South
Africa, has one million uncleared mines.
</P>
<P>
"This grave international problem can only be addressed by
concerted international action to restrict the availability and
use of landmines," Modise said.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African government would resolutely seek a
complete ban on anti-personnel mines and would do everything
possible to encourage other governments and international
institutions to follow.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's vow to ban anti-personnel mines has apparently
drawn great attention from international society and is being
welcomed by international peace organizations.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) has expressed
hope that the Pretoria decision will promote similar initiative
throughout southern Africa and eventually lead to the
establishment of a regional zone entirely free of landmines.
</P>
<P>
It will also build up momentum towards the signing of a new
treaty prohibiting anti-personnel mines worldwide in December,
the ICRC said.
</P>
<P>
According to ICRC, there are an estimated 119 million
landmines scattered across 71 countries on five continents.
</P>
<P>
So far 22 countries, including South Africa, have permanently
renounced the use of anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 15 countries are in the process of
destroying all or some of their mine stockpiles, ICRC official
said. enditem

<HEADLINE> West African Gas Project Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The West African Gas Project
involving the delivery of gas from Nigeria to Ghana, Gambia and
Togo has been delayed due to disagreements among the nations, the
Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Nigerian Ministry of Petroleum Resources was
quoted as saying that the date of gas delivery originally set for
1998 would now run into the year due to the delay.
</P>
<P>
The countries have failed to reach agreement on issues such as
the setting-up of an independent company to manage the project
and the appointment of a developer, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is originally intended that the project is granted to
Chevron Nigeria Limited, following a proposal the company has
articulated in support of the project, but the candidacy is
later opened to other oil firms, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Asian Gourmets Threat Marine Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Garoupa, a myriad marine
creature that boasts diversified species in the Indo-pacific sea,
are dying out at the table of Asian gourmets, reports today's
South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
All over the world, there are 159 species of garoupa, 110 of
which are discovered in the Indo-Pacific region. In the sea around
Hong Kong, 21 species of garoupa were commercially fished in the
1960's, while today only two or three are commonly found,
according to the English paper.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong ecologist attributed the fast disappearance of
garoupa to increasing demand from gourmets. Overfishing is the
largest threat to survival of the fish and worsening marine
environment also plays a part in their demise.
</P>
<P>
The English daily says that the garoupa is now facing another
threat -- cyanide fishing, which not only stuns fish but also
destroys coral reefs, the habitat of marine creatures.
</P>
<P>
The destiny of the fish has aroused concerns among
conservationists worldwide, who insisted that 17 species of
garoupa be put on the World Conservation Union's Red Data list. To
protect garoupa from cyanide fishing will become the top priority
of a leading US conservation body, the Nature Conservancy, which
is expected to open a Hong Kong office soon.

JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A South African police
union said on Monday the government will have to spend more money
on the force if the Olympic Games are to be held in Cape Town in
2004.
</P>
<P>
An evaluation report on the 11 cities bidding for the Games
released last week noted that it would be a challenge for South
Africa to address the concerns over crime in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
But the South African government, committed to reducing its
budget deficit, has placed a moratorium on recruiting new police
officers and has cut police spending to the bone.
</P>
<P>
"If they want the Olympics in the Western Cape, and crime is a
problem, then they must put their money where their mouth is and
get more cops on the beat," said Andy Miller, provincial secretary
of the South African Police Union for Western Cape province, which
includes Cape Town.

He said police needed more and better equipment as well as pay
increases to improve their morale.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier on Sino-US ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the principles
enshrined in the three Sino-US joint communiques should be the
basis for the furthering of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, under the guidance of these
principles, the Sino-US ties have moved forward despite twists and
turns, Qian told a news briefing before his talks with visiting US
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States signed the Shanghai Joint
Communique in 1972, the joint communique for establishment of
diplomatic relations in 1978 and that of August 17th in 1982.
</P>
<P>
During the briefing, Qian noted that China welcomes President
Bill Clinton's statement that US policy on China is that of
comprehensive engagement rather than that of containment.
</P>
<P>
Recently, progress has been made in Sino-US relations, he
said. Now, the two sides are making preparations for the exchanges
of official state visits between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
US President Bill Clinton. US Vice-President Al Gore will also
visit China soon at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that while China and the US share many interests, the
two countries should not evade differences, and China is ready to
work with the US to seize the current favorable opportunity for
improving Sino-US ties by increasing dialogue, expanding
cooperation, enhancing common understanding and comprehensively
addressing differences.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here earlier today on her 20-hour China visit
at the invitation of Qian.
</P>
<P>
She reaffirmed at the briefing that the US will continue to be
committed to the "One China" policy and principles enshrined in
the three joint communiques.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Sees No Trouble Assimilating Into ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Deputy Prime
Minister Maung Maung Khin said today that his country is ready to
join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and will
have no trouble assimilating into the grouping in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, once under British rule, adopted much of the British
system as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei did and used to be on a
par with the other ASEAN nations, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Maung Maung Khin is here in connection with a two-day
high-level roundtable for the formulation of strategic plans for
cooperation and promotion of foreign direct investment in the
ASEAN which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said Myanmar would cooperate with
ASEAN members and abide by its rules when it becomes a member.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam and it is expected to be
expanded to include Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos this year.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar official said the ASEAN accounts for 53 percent of
foreign direct investment in his country which currently stands at
6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the European Union (E.U.) position against Myanmar's entry
into the ASEAN, he said, "Myanmar is a friendly country... They
(the E.U.) have their own way of thinking and have been putting
pressure on us over the years."
</P>
<P>
However, ASEAN members have been very supportive of Myanmar's
entry into the grouping, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "There are distorted views about Myanmar and people
should come and see the country for themselves."
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is on the path toward democracy, he said, adding that
the country wants a stable government for the future.

Olympian who will join the American WNBA this season, will
spearhead a new Chinese women's basketball team to defend the
title of the Asian Championship in April.
</P>

"Regarding her age and physical condition, I am satisfied with
her performance right now," newly-appointed head coach Zhu Jiazhi
told a press conference Monday, announcing the 14-member roster of
the team.
</P>
<P>
"She will turn 30 on March 7 this year and has suffered waist
and knee injury problems for a long time," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"But the Chinese team still needs her role for the upcoming
Asian Championship," added Zhu.

August First, replaced Chen Daohong to coach the national team on
January 9.

Chinese women team, which dropped to ninth at the Atlanta Olympic
Games last summer from the runners-up in Barcelona and the 1994
World Championship in Australia, is expected to face strong
challenges from Japan and South Korea. Japan and South Korea
finished seventh and tenth in Atlanta respectively.
</P>
<P>

to form a team to win the Asian Championship," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The team roster also includes centers Li Dongmei and Liang Xin,
guards Li Xin and Shen Li, forward Liu Jun, all of whom took part
in the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>

Guard Wang Fang, key starter in the Chinese team at the 1994
world Championship but disqualified for the Olympic team last
summer, is suprisely in the new team at the age of 30.
</P>
<P>
"She deserves to be a member of the national team with her
ability and sportsmanship which our new team needs," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"My first task is to recover the team's confidence for the
championship."
</P>
<P>
Other new members of the Chinese team are centers Shao Rui and
Liu Yuexiu, forwards Gao Lianhuan, Xiang Dongweng, Xin Lihong,
Jiang Xu, guard Li Hong.
</P>
<P>
The team will take one month training in Zhengzhou, capital of
Henan Province, from March 2-25, before taking part in an
international tournament with squads from Russia and Ukraine in
Zhengzhou or Hangzhou.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Urges Reassessment of U.N. Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore called here today
for a rigorous assessment of the U.N. peacekeeping role, as the
number and complexity of the U.N. peacekeeping operations (PKOs)
have kept growing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on "Humanitarian Interventions and
Peacekeeping Operations," Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar
said the challenge is to learn from those PKOs which were
successful and to avoid repeating the mistakes of those which
failed.
</P>
<P>
The end of the Cold War, coupled with the proliferation of new
conflicts, has led to the quantitative and qualitative expansion
of U.N. PKOs, he noted, adding, "This has placed a tremendous
strain on the U.N.'s budget and raised questions about the U.N.'s
organizational capabilities to cope with the new demands."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the effectiveness of the United Nations in its
peacekeeping role depends on what its member states are prepared
or not prepared to do.
</P>
<P>
For a start, the United Nations cannot remain a financial
cripple if it were to perform its peacekeeping role properly, he
said against the backdrop that as of the end of last month, member
states owe 3.2 billion U.S. dollars to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister said Singapore recognizes the
important role the UNPKOs have played and will continue to support
the United Nations in its peacekeeping missions.

<HEADLINE> AFTA Can Be Realized Ahead of Target, ASEAN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) is expected to be realized ahead of schedule with the
smooth run of tariff reduction schedules and other measures being
implemented, a senior ASEAN official said today.
</P>
<P>
The AFTA can be realized by the year 2000, three years ahead of
target, if the tariff reduction schedules and other measures being
implemented run smoothly, Secretary-General of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Ajit Singh said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing a two-day high-level
roundtable for the formation of strategic plans for cooperation
and promotion of foreign direct investment in the ASEAN here.
</P>
<P>
The year 2003 is the timetable agreed upon by leaders of ASEAN
members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam at their summit in Bangkok at
the end of 1995 for free trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
Singh said tariff reduction schedules of ASEAN member countries
indicated that more than 87 percent of the total tariff lines
would be cut to between zero and 5 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The products covered by these tariff lines account for 97
percent of intra-ASEAN trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN's efforts so far in economic cooperation have
concentrated on getting the AFTA off the ground.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the initial hesitations and doubts from some quarters
and protectionist pressures from certain sources, AFTA is well on
the road to succeeding in its goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a number of foreign firms are already expanding
their activities to invest in the region as they see the long-term
potential of the AFTA.
</P>
<P>
General Motors plans to build a 750 million U.S. dollar plant
in eastern Thailand and General Electric (GE) to open a 20 million
dollar plant in Surabaya, Indonesia, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the ASEAN's own multinational enterprises,
businessmen and entrepreneurs will not wait until 2003 when the
AFTA is completed to avail themselves of the opportunities offered
by the AFTA and other ASEAN economic cooperation schemes.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will resume their
low-level talks in the southern Philippines Tuesday, the
Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for political affairs, was
quoted as saying the front is now ready to face government peace
negotiators after bowing out of the scheduled February 16 talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF called off the February 16 talks due to sporadic
clashes this month between government forces and MILF rebels in
Buldon and Datu Agwak towns in Maguindanao Province in central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming three-day negotiations in Sultan Kudarat
Town in Maguindanao Province, two technical committees set up by
the two sides will hold separate meetings on the cessation of
hostilities and an agenda for formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The cessation group will focus on issues concerning the recent
conflicts in Buldon and Datu Agwak while the agenda committee will
deliberate on matters confronting the country's Muslims, known as
the Bangsamoro people.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), is one of the several rebel groups still fighting
the Philippine government forces. It refused to accept the peace
deal concluded between the MNLF and the government and wanted
separate peace talks with Manila.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began their exploratory talks on
January 9 but the second round of the talks has been postponed
repeatedly due to sporadic fighting between the two sides in the
southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Report: Turkmenistan Seeks to Supply Gas to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkmen Foreign Minister
Boris Shikhmyradov has requested a meeting with Israeli National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon to discuss the supply of
natural gas to Israel, local daily Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior Israeli industry source as saying
that Shikhmyradov has apparently asked Foreign Minister David Levy
to arrange the meeting for Shikhmyradov's visit here on March 19.
</P>
<P>
If a deal is to come out of the negotiations, it would provide
an alternative to lines of supply from Qatar and Egypt, which are
proving difficult to secure, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Turkomen are proposing the construction of a pipeline under the
Caspian Sea to Turkey, from where Israel will be supplied.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli government sources suggested the financial and
political costs will be too large a burden for the former Soviet
state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, too many competing nations would have to give
permission for the pipeline to be constructed to the coast of
Turkey, which itself has expressed considerable interest in
supplying Israel with natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The idea cropped up before, said an Israeli Foreign Ministry
official. "But it looks far-fetched to me."
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan, bordered by Russia and Iran, is reportedly
attempting to pursue an independent middle line between the two
strong neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post pointed out that the pipeline would give
Turkmenistan, which holds the world's fourth-largest gas reserves,
an important inroad to the so-called U.S.-Turkish-Israeli
triangle.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli Company Merhav was last week involved
in two deals with the Turkomen worth some 600 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first was for a refinery upgrade and construction of a new
petrochemical plant, and the other project is for upgrading the
country's natural gas infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Acting for the Turkmen government, Merhav is organizing both
projects and will supervise their execution.

<P>
SINGAPORE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 139 Singaporeans
were found to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunity deficiency
syndrome), registering a 25-percent increase over the previous
year, the Ministry of Health said today.

It said that of the 139 cases of HIV infection detected in

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Industry Rides on Market Economic Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Deepening reforms of
state-owned enterprises in Tianjin have given a stronger push to
the industrial development in north China's largest port city.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique recently released after the third
industrial general survey conducted by the city, the city
generated more than 45 billion yuan in industrial added value in
1995, accounting for nearly 50 percent of local GDP and rising 116
percent compared to the figure ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin also strengthened its competitiveness in the
international market, enabling industrial enterprises at and above
local county level to increase exports to more than 21 billion US
dollars in 1995, more than four times the 1985 figure.
</P>
<P>
The city gives priority to developing name-brand products, as
well as accelerating technological improvements for leading
industries, building up a number of group enterprises on the basis
of capital and assets reallocation.
</P>
<P>
Four local leading industries, involving metallurgical
products, chemicals, automobiles and machinery, and electronics,
contributed 48 percent of the city's industrial added value in
1995, forming a greater force to spur on local economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The city had a total of 1,927 state-owned industrial
enterprises in 1995, with total assets surpassing 139 billion
yuan, accounting for 54 percent of the local industrial total.
</P>
<P>
The companies earned nearly 4.5 billion yuan of pre-tax profits
in 1995, accounting for more than 33 percent of the local
industrial total.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the city had increased its foreign-funded enterprises
to 1,948 from only 18 ten years ago. The firms made more than 6.2
billion yuan in pre-tax profits in 1995, accounting for nearly 28
percent of the local total.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UN, Iraq Achieve Progress on Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- An outstanding dispute between
the United Nations and Iraq was basically solved as Baghdad agreed
Sunday to turn over parts of missiles for testing.
</P>
<P>
The progress was believed to have been achieved through mutual
concessions at the talks here between the U.N. Special Commission
on Iraq (UNSCOM) and the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Iraq agreed to transfer abroad its destroyed missile engines
for in-depth analysis to allay U.N. fears that it had removed and
hidden sophisticated Russian-built engines from long-range
missiles before they were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference held Sunday by visiting UNSCOM
Chairman Rolf Ekeus and Riyadh al-Qysi, Iraqi undersecretary of
foreign affairs, Ekeus declared that the commission and Iraq have
made progress on the "hottest issue for the time being."
</P>
<P>
"The analysis will be carried out with the assistance of a team
of international experts, under the supervision of the
commission, at laboratories offered by contributing governments,"
said the joint statement signed on here Sunday by the UNSCOM
chairman and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The statement didn't say where the analysis will be carried
out. But Ekeus told reporters that "the UNSCOM welcomes all
offers from the United States and France, and the Russian
laboratories are also under consideration."
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the UNSCOM will not make public the findings
of the analysis without prior consultations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
All these indicate that both sides made concessions and met
each other half way in the three rounds of talks which led to the
agreement..
</P>
<P>
The commission had demanded the transfer of the missile engines
destroyed unilaterally by Iraq to the U.S. for analysis.
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqi government turned down the request and asked the
UNSCOM to send experts to study the engines inside the country
instead, saying that the request for the removal was intended to
prolong the U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will not lift the six-year-old economic
embargo imposed on Iraq after the latter's 1990 August invasion of
Kuwait until the UNSCOM proves Iraq no longer has any banned
weapons of mass destruction and cannot replace them.
</P>
<P>
Then, Aziz proposed in a letter last December to Ekeus that the
Scud missile engines stockpiled in the boxes of the commission's
offices in Baghdad be transferred to Russia for analysis, which
was rejected by the U.N. body.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress made in the missile engine testing, the
lifting of U.N. sanctions is still not in sight in view
of other pending issues plus UNSCOM's dissatisfaction over Iraq's
cooperation in its work, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The impasse on handing over the documents on weaponry
development program still remains unsolved. Ekeus accused Iraq of
concealing "a large part of documents on the program," and called
on Iraq to cooperate more actively with the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Undersecretary al-Qysi refuted Ekeus by saying that the
"so-called documents in fact are individual diaries or something
else." He claimed that Iraq had given all the relevant documents
already.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus said his commission is still investigating Iraq's
chemical weapon production.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus arrived in Baghdad on February 20 on a bi-monthly visit
and left for New York Sunday. Ekeus and Aziz have agreed to meet
in Baghdad during the first week of April this year for further
talks.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- In a cold morning wind,
no flags of member states are raised on some 180 poles before the
U.N. headquarters, only the blue flag of the United Nations is
fluttering at half-mast, mourning in silence over the departure of
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping passed away!" The breaking news on CNN
Wednesday shocked the whole United Nations headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the U.N. headquarters, people were seen fixing their
eyes with astonishment on the television. They were deeply
saddened by the news and were paying tributes to the late Chinese
leader.
</P>
<P>
"A great and extraordinary figure." "A tremendous loss to the
whole world." Diplomats from world over extended their hands to
Chinese diplomats and correspondents, expressing heartfelt
condolences on Deng's death.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping had indelibly stamped his mark on this most
recent and vibrant period of China's long history," said U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, moments after hearing the grieve
news.
</P>
<P>
"He will be remembered, not just in his own country, which he
so faithfully served for so long, but also in the international
community at large as a primary architect of China's modernization
and dramatic economic development," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Deng passed away in Beijing Wednesday night at the age of 93,
18 years after introducing the policy of economic restructuring
and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have benefited from his wise leadership.
The world at large has gained through his efforts to underline
global peace and development," said U.N. General Assembly President
Razali Ismail. He lauded Deng as the illustrious son of China.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping made a monumental contribution to China, which
has firmly placed it in the rank of the major countries of the
world," Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has seldom witnessed so deep a sadness. The
U.N. headquarters changed its usual appearance of colorful flags
into an atmosphere of solemnness and grieveness.
</P>
<P>
At the sight of the half-mast U.N. flag, many senior diplomats
and U.N. officials recalled the speech by Deng on "the three
worlds" in 1974 at the Sixth Special Session of the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
At the session, for the first time, Deng outlined Mao Zedong's
"three worlds" theory, which divides the world countries into
three groups, with the former Soviet Union and the United States
in the first world, the other developed countries in the second
and the developing countries in the third. Deng also called for a
new international economic order.

managed to let them know what is "Taiwanese rule Taiwan" and "Hong
Kong Residents rule Kong Kong."
</P>

"He removed doubts held by some of our attendants by assuring
that the Chinese government, in relevant negotiations, would take

also to the whole world," Secretary-General Annan wrote in the
visitor's memorial book after paying his last respect for Deng in

<HEADLINE> Egypt Extends Emergency Law to Combat Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian parliament has
ratified a presidential decree to extend the emergency law for
another three years to reinforce the government's anti-extremist
drive.
</P>
<P>
The 450-member People's Assembly voted for a proposal of
President Hosni Mubarak, who is also the supreme commander of the
armed forces, to extend the martial law for the coming three
years, the English language Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The emergency law has been in force for 15 years since former
President Anwar Sadat was assassinated by Muslim extremists in
1981.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri said the extension of the law
ensures the protection of Egypt's expanding economic achievement
and ongoing development plan against sabotage by extremists.
</P>
<P>
He said that the extremists are trying to scare off the mainly
Western investors from coming to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy is moving fast to become international and the
forces of evil have moved to stop... the investments in Egypt," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The evil forces are sending a message to the West that there is
no security in Egypt, said Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen opened fire last April at a group of Greek
tourists, who were mistaken for Israelis, in front of a hotel in
Cairo, killing 18.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, when rendering the approval, also condemned
the recent extremist attack of a Coptic church in southern Egypt,
killing 10 people.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Strive to Be Global Trade City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is to make efforts
in three aspects to become a global trade city.
</P>
<P>
A high-level panel on international trade announced here today
its recommendations, which focus on three strategic thrusts, for
developing Singapore as a global city of international trade.
</P>
<P>
The panel, officially known as the Committee on International
Trade (COIT), said that for Singapore to aspire to be a global
city of international trade, it needs to develop exports from
Singapore of merchandise and services, exports through Singapore,
exports by consumption in Singapore and exports via Singapore's
commercial presence overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said the panel has
focused on how threats to further expansion of Singapore's
international trade could be minimized.
</P>
<P>
In its recommended three thrusts, the panel, comprising top
officials from the TDB and private sector business leaders, called
for a paradigm shift in how Singapore conducts its international
trade.
</P>
<P>
This calls for Singapore to leverage its information technology
advantage and business expertise to position the country as a
center for doing business electronically.
</P>
<P>
The second recommendation is to strengthen supporting services
and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The panel said Singapore should be developed as a center for
exhibitions on the scale of Dusseldorf and Frankfurt in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The committee's third recommendation is for greater
inter-agency teamwork for Singapore's overall competitiveness as
an international trading center and in world markets.
</P>
<P>
The panel, set up to provide strategic direction for the
development of Singapore's trade, said earlier that though the
country has moved up several notches in the ranking of the world's
exporting nations, it is facing growing competition from newly
emerging economies like Malaysia and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Canada Defense Minister Ends Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Defense
Minister Douglas Young wrapping up a three-day visit to Kuwait
today indicated that there was large potential of military
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters before departure at a press conference
jointly held with his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Salem Sabah
Al-Salem at the airport that "we have discussed a wide range
of possibilities" to provide Kuwait with "the best equipment,
at the best prices and with the best support systems."
</P>
<P>
He said "the potential areas are from the supply of
vehicles, lorries and trucks to various types of air defense
systems, and there has been discussion about some vessels."
</P>
<P>
Young said his country took interest in supplying world class
military equipment to Kuwait, but he stopped short of saying
whether any concrete contract in the military domain was signed
during his visit here.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his country's commitment to the security
of Kuwait and the support for various resolutions of the
United Nations concerning Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister said: "I want to express in the most
direct way our support for the people of Kuwait and our concern
about the security and stability of this region."
</P>
<P>
He said "Canada's commitment to the security of Kuwait and
the region is beyond doubt."
</P>
<P>
Canada has provided naval frigates for the multinational
interception force monitoring United Nations sanctions against
Iraq. Young said the "next ship is due to arrive in the
Gulf in April and we have also contributed to the United
Nations peacekeeping mission on the Kuwait-Iraq border."
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Young also discussed with the
Kuwaiti defense minister programs of joint military
training.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti defense minister said that arrangement in this
field will be discussed in the future. He said that "I think the
military known-how and the technologies of Canada are very
useful to us."
</P>
<P>
Young, who arrived here Friday, also met with Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and other Kuwaiti leaders.
</P>
<P>
Issues of mutual interest and bilatera1 relations, especially
in the military field, were discussed during his meetings with the
Kuwaiti leaders.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Defer Local Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Amidst strong opposition, the
Bangladeshi Parliament Sunday night passed a bill giving the
central government unlimited power to hold local government
elections at any time after the expiry of the local governments'
five-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers called the bill a black law and
unconstitutional, fearing that the law will deny the people the
right to vote and disrupt democratic dispensation at the
grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposed that "where, for any reason, the elections
cannot be held within the period" specified in the existing law,
they "may be held within a period, after expiry of the term of the
local authority, as the government may, by notification in the
official gazette, specify."
</P>
<P>
Before the passage of the bill, named "Local Government Bill
(Amendment) 1997," it was mandatory for a government to hold
elections within 180 days before the expiry of the tenure of the
local authority.
</P>
<P>
Defending the bill, Local Government and Rural Development
Minister Zillur Rahman told the house that the five-year term of
the government of seven out of 4,461 townships would expire on
February 28 while that of the government of some remaining
townships will come to an end in April and May.
</P>
<P>
"But there would be problems to hold the polls in April or May
due to monsoon and inclement weather," said Rahman.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the cabinet meeting resolved that the township
elections would be held in September this year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fertility Technique May Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
found that the five-year-old technique that has made thousands
of infertile men around the world into fathers is believed to
pass on a defective gene that may make their male babies
infertile, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
This potential problem, which has been discovered by
Prof. Josef Itskovitz, head of gynecology and obstetrics at the
Rambam Hospital in Haifa and his colleague Dr. Shahar Kol, has
aroused much concern and poses serious ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
The technique, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI),
is a sophisticated method of in-vitro fertilization developed in
Belgium in 1992. It is meant for producing pregnancies in the
partners of men whose semen contains almost no sperm or sperm
suffering from almost total lack of modility. Reproductive
specialists shoot single sperm into the ova or make a hole in
the ova's outer layer to facilitate conception. Many thousands
of healthy babies have been produced this way, hundreds of them
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Itskovitz studied 30 male babies born as the result of ISCI
and found that three had inherited a defect in the Y chromosome
believed to be the cause of their fathers' infertility. Girls
have only X chromosomes so they are not affected.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jon Pryor, a urologist and cell biologist at the
U.S. University of Minnesota, conducted a study that bolstered
Itskovitz's conclusions by studying the frequency of the genetic
defect in 200 men.
</P>
<P>
The problem is apparently most serious when a biopsy of the
tests is performed to remove immature sperm directly and inject
them in the ovum.
</P>
<P>
Itskovitz said Sunday night, however, that he would not go as
far as to ban ISCI or even to choose for implantation only
female embryos produced by the technique.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Assures Foreign Investors of Good Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today assured foreign investors that his country
is still worthwhile and cost-effective for them to locate their
operations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment is vital to Malaysia's economic
growth and development and has already contributed significantly
to the growth, he said at a function in Seremban, 65 kilometers
south of here.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia has succeeded in not only attracting the
multinationals to invest in Malaysia but also in creating
conditions conducive to expansion and diversification of
operations in line with the growth of their businesses," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister hoped that foreign companies in the country
would continue to expand and diversify their operations and
particularly set up high value-added and technology-intensive
industries in the country.
</P>
<P>
The focus of Malaysia's Second Industrial Masterplan
(1996-2005) would be on the manufacturing of semiconductors and
high-end components, electronic digitals, professional and
industrial equipment and multimedia software, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the added value of some electrical and electronic goods
like semiconductors, computer software, consumer electronic goods
and electrical equipment is expected to reach 33.3 percent in the
year 2005 from 30.3 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
The huge increase in Malaysia's export during the last two and
a half decades was due to the contributions and activities of
multinational companies, their subsidiaries and affiliated
companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the electrical and electronics industries would
continue to dominate the manufacturing sector in terms of
production, export and labor.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, the manufacturing sector recorded an average
 production growth of 30.7 percent per year while its contribution
to export and employment each registered an annual growth of 30.1
percent and 16.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia has become the main exporter of consumer
electronic and electrical products and semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
The industry remains the main sector in terms of the number of
projects and is the top sector in terms of total investments
approved, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investments in the sector, Mahathir said, foreign
direct investments amount to 9.2 billion ringgit (about 3.68
billion U.S. dollars) or 71 percent of the total, while local
investments account for 3.9 billion ringgit (about 1.56 billion
dollars) or 29 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- An Austrian company is to
cooperate with Uganda in a bid to set up a joint venture to
manufacture cement and fertilizer in Jinja, 80 kilometers east of
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision reported today that the Edith Kraal Investments
Limited (EKIL) which is already involved in copper smelting in
Jinja will use limestone at the Sukulu hills in Tororo, over 100
kilometers east of Jinja to produce cement.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 200-million-U.S.-Dollar joint venture
is projected to begin between the end of 1997 and the first
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The firm signed a memorandum of understanding on January 14
with the Uganda Development Corporation (UDC) which is
responsible for the coordination of all exploitation of the
minerals at Sukulu hills.
</P>
<P>
UDC officials were quoted as saying that related negotiations
are expected soon to enter into binding legal commitments.
</P>
<P>
EKIL, with equipment that can separate limestone from
phosphate during the manufacture of fertilizer, has also proposed
to set up a phosphate fertilizer project worth 107.881 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project will produce 108,000 metric tons of triple single
phosphate and 50,000 tons of phosphate nutrients annually to
supply western Kenya, northern Tanzania and the whole Uganda.
</P>
<P>
It will initially produe 500,000 tons of cemet per year with
an aim to double the output in the future. enditem

<HEADLINE> India to Take Measure to Stop Foreign Takeover Bids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- the Indian government is
taking all possible measures to check hostile takeovers of
domestic companies by foreign investors, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
A recent inter-ministerial meeting decided to subject takeover
proposals of foreign investors to a stringent approval system. The
meeting also outlined the role of various government departments
with regard to takeover applications.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that the Foreign Investment Promotion Board,
whose approval is mandatory for takeover proposals of foreign
investors, would seek the recommendations of the ministries
concerned before it takes a final decision on such proposals. In
other words, a foreign investor will have to go through a chain of
government departments before the final takeover could take place.
</P>
<P>
The inter-ministerial meeting decided that all foreign funds
coming to the country for takeovers would be treated as investment
in equity. Hence, all applications in this regard will be treated
on their merits and as normal foreign direct investment.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong University To Meet Demand For Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Baptist
University plans to provide its first courses in Chinese medicine
for a group of 30 students this year, said Wu Qinghui, president
of the school's Faculty of Science.
</P>
<P>
The university's Traditional Chinese Medicine Department is
expected to provide the first academic degrees of their kind.
</P>
<P>
The four-and-a-half-year schooling, nine semesters, includes
the basics of Chinese medicine, research on Chinese medicinal
ingredients, and clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that they also plan to invite renowned Chinese doctors
specializing in traditional medicine to augment their program,
which is backed by the Higher Education Assistance Committee in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Fees charged by Hong Kong's doctors trained in Western medicine
have continued to rise, so easing the financial burden on patients
is a significant consideration for increasing the use of
traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese University of Hong Kong is also preparing to
institute these courses, and Hong Kong University set up a
traditional Chinese medical center last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Vast deposits of sand for
glass manufacture have been found at Bukakata and Lambu beaches
of Lake Victoria, southwestern Uganda, reported the local daily
The New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
Fred Kabagambe-Kallisa, the deputy permanent secretary in
Ugandan Ministry of Natural Resources was quoted as saying that
the deposits near Masaka, over 100 kilometers southwest of
Kampala can last beyond the next century.
</P>
<P>
The exploration, conducted in 1994 by the geological and mines
department of his ministry, covers 31 pits.
</P>
<P>
He said 80 samples of sand were collected and a chemical
analysis was done, showing the percentage of silica was 98
percent.
</P>
<P>
The iron in the sand is 0.24 percent which is high for the
manufacture of colorless glass (glass window type) that needs
only 0.03 percent iron content.
</P>
<P>
Colorless glass can be obtained after extracting the iron by a
magnetic separator, he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Sichuan's Booming Foreign Trade from Processing Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province leads the country's inland areas in its more than one
billion US dollars of foreign trade from the processing business
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Since March of 1995, Sichuan's processing business has kept a
profitable momentum in foreign trade. This helped the province get
143 million US dollars in favorable foreign trade in the sector, a
significant rise compared with the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
The success was resultant from increased efforts by local
businesses to guarantee product quality, which enabled all
products for export to be standardized.
</P>
<P>
Local processing business, which focuses most on
labor-intensive production, exported goods to more than 10
countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, and the
Hong Kong region.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Deficit Narrows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's trade balance
for the first 11 months of 1996 improved with the deficit dropping
by a sharp 85.1 percent compared with the same period of the
previous year, according to the latest official data released
today.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for the January-November period 1996 decreased to
1.5 billion ringgit (about 600 million U.S. dollars) from 10
billion ringgit (about 4 billion dollars) a year earlier, the
Statistics Department's data showed.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the cumulative deficit resulted from a higher
growth of 7.2 percent in exports to 179.6 billion ringgit (about
71.84 billion dollars) for the period from 167.5 billion ringgit
(about 67 billion dollars) for the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports during the review period grew by only 2
percent to 181.1 billion ringgit (about 72.44 billion dollars)
from 177.5 billion ringgit (about 71 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The data showed thermionic valves and tubes and parts continued
to be Malaysia's top export, with exports totaling 32.5 billion
ringgit (about 13 billion dollars), or 18.1 percent of total
exports earnings during the 11-month period.
</P>
<P>
Other major exports were palm oil, liquefied natural gas, crude
petroleum, apparel and accessories and petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
But major drops in export earnings were recorded for sawn
timber, rubber, sawn logs and methanol.
</P>
<P>
Among imports, the biggest category was machinery and transport
equipment which totaled 108.7 billion ringgit (about 43.48 billion
dollars), or 60 percent of the country's entire import bill for
the 11 months under review.
</P>
<P>
"Lumpy" imports (comprising ships and aircraft plus parts)
totaled 5.6 billion ringgit (about 2.24 billion dollars) in the
11-month period against 8 billion ringgit (about 3.2 billion
dollars) in the same period of 1995, showing a drop of 30.1
percent, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States and Singapore were among Malaysia's
major trading partners in the period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cambodians Mourn Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 23 (Xinhua) -- "We feel deeply grieved
that Deng Xiaoping has passed away," said two Chinese Cambodians
at the mourning hall at the Chinese Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people should fulfill what Deng has not finished
by building China into a more powerful country," they said.
</P>
<P>
"We overseas Chinese feel relieved when the motherland becomes
stronger and people's living standards are improved," said the two
grey-haired Cambodian Chinese, both aged 58.
</P>
<P>
They came to the embassy on Sunday morning, each with a white
flower in hand, to pay tribute to the late Chinese leader, who
died in Beijing last Wednesday at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
When staff members of the embassy asked them to sign their
names, one of them shook his head, and the other explained in less
fluent Chinese, "We both are old Chinese, and he can't read."
</P>
<P>
The two men identified themselves as Guo Yifeng and Wei
Maosheng.
</P>
<P>
They told reporters that both of them were born and grew up in
Cambodia and that they had never been to China.
</P>
<P>
They said that they were doing small business to support their
families, and that they had not had much education.
</P>
<P>
However, they came to know by TV and radio that since Deng
began to lead China (in 1977), the living standards of ordinary
people have been greatly improved and China's international
position has significantly risen, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina has urged all opposition parties to maintain the
prevailing peace and stability in the country to attract more
foreign investment in the capital.
</P>
<P>
"We could draw the attention of foreign investors who have
become eager to invest in the country and the opposition parties
should not do anything that might destabilize this congenial
investment climate," Hasina, who took office eight months ago,
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government has already got investment offers to the tune of
30 billion taka (about 725 million U.S. dollars) from foreign
investors, the prime minister told a public meeting in the
southwestern city of Jessore, where she was attending a function
marking the 173rd anniversary of the birth of poet Michael
Madhusudan Dutta.
</P>
<P>
Political stability, however, is a must for economic
development of the country and all should try their best to ensure
that, she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has vowed to
launch a mass movement to "realize reasonable demands and
inalienable rights of the people."
</P>
<P>
The BNP at a high-level meeting Saturday blamed the government
for resorting to dilly-dally practice in implementing an agreement
between the ruling and opposition parties, which was signed one
month ago for smoothly conducting parliamentary activities.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also demanded unconditional release of detained
leaders and workers of the BNP and an end to what they called
repression of the party's members.

<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital reported
more than 300,000 mobile phone users by January of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, of that number, some 140,000 were
added last year and some 100,000 of them were digital mobile phone
users.
</P>
<P>
Many mobile phone users in Beijing prefer digital mobile phones
because they give them easier access to the person called at home
and overseas through automatic roaming.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is now linked to more than 200 Chinese cities and a
number of foreign countries, through the automatic roaming service.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the third-phase expansion of the Beijing
telecommunications and digital mobile phone project, where the
world's most advanced micro-cellular phone technology from
Motorola and Nokia has been used, Beijing will see its GSM (global
system of mobile telecommunications) capacity enough to handle
250,000 calls at one time, a net increase of 150,000.
</P>
<P>
The municipality will also see the number of local relay
stations for digital mobile phone service increase from 70 to 140,
and its high-frequency signal channels increased by some 10,000.

<HEADLINE> U.N.-Sponsored Afghan Peace Talks Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
Afghan Taliban militia and its rivals began a meeting here today
in another bid to end the conflicts in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting of the Afghan Technical Working Group with
three members from each side is being hosted by U.N. special envoy
for Afghanistan Nobert Holl.
</P>
<P>
The working group met last month without an agenda but failed
to make any headway.
</P>
<P>
The talks bogged down as the three-party anti-Taliban alliance
demanded that the Islamic student militia demilitarize Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance includes the ousted Afghan government
led by former military chief Ahmad Masood, the northern militia
led by warlord Rashid Dostum and Hezb-e-Wahdat of Karim Khalili.
</P>
<P>
The alliance reportedly claimed that it would reiterate its
demand for the demilitarization of Kabul at the current meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which captured Kabul last September, turned down
the demand, fearing that demilitarization of the capital could
encourage the opposition to recapture it.
</P>
<P>
The student militia, which now controls two-thirds of Afghan
territory, also opposes the formation of a neutral force for the
security of the Afghan capital or the deployment of international
peacekeepers there.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it proposed the formation of a joint commission to
handle issues such as cease-fire, exchange of war prisoners and
ultimately the formation of an interim government.
</P>
<P>
Taliban officials contended that cease-fire and exchange of
prisoners should be top on the agenda while other matters could be
taken up later.
</P>
<P>
Holl had merely termed the meetings of the working group, which
has no decision-making power, as a step forward toward peace in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Minor Adjustments Can Be Discussed in Kashmir: Gowda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda has expressed New Delhi's readiness to discuss minor
adjustments in Kashmir with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Khaleej Times, which was also
published in newspapers here today, Gowda said he is prepared to
discuss "minor adjustments in relation to Kashmir within the scope
of the Simla Agreement."
</P>
<P>
However he did not elaborate on the adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Previously India had refused to discuss the Kashmir issue with
Pakistan, with which it has gone to war twice over the Kashmir
dispute in the past.
</P>
<P>
"The boundaries had been drawn by my predecessors in office but
I am optimistic on beginning discussions with the new Pakistan
government on trade, commerce and communication and other
bilateral issues," he further said.
</P>
<P>
Gowda said he has been giving priority to India's neighbors in
foreign policy and his government has resolved long-standing
issues with Bangladesh and Nepal. Relations with China have
improved and the president of China has visited India for the
first time recently. Ties with Russia are very close and he is
tentatively planning to visit Moscow next month.

India and the United States should come closer together, Gowda
said, adding that he had invited President Bill Clinton to visit
India this year.
</P>
<P>
India enjoys cordial relations with the Gulf countries and the
focus is on trade relationship, particularly in the bilateral
field, he added.

<HEADLINE> 4 Ministers Resign in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Four ministers from Nepal's
main ruling party have tendered their resignations to press Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to reduce the size of his coalition
cabinet, sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the ministers, they resigned to help the
prime minister, who is also from the Nepali Congress (NC) party,
and follow the party's directive to trim the grand-sized cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that the prime minister would
accept their resignations.
</P>
<P>
The Ministers who tendered resignation letters Sunday include
Home Minister Khum Bahadur Khadka, Education Minister Govinda
Joshi, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narhari Acharya and Health
Minister Arjun Narsingh K.C., the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the main ruling NC party earlier this
month has ordered Prime Minister Deuba to hold talks with the two
ruling partners on the reduction of his 47-member cabinet. But
Deuba has yet to initiate such talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over a dozen of the NC lawmakers have decided to
boycott the forthcoming winter session of parliament from early
next month to show their dissatisfaction with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Prime Minister Deuba would call a vote of
confidence for his three-party government under opposition
pressure in the parliament session and any ruling MPs' absence
would cause adverse impact to the fate of the government.
</P>
<P>
14 NC MPs Sunday registered their letters to the party's
parliamentary office saying that they would not be able to attend
the parliament session, scheduled from March 3, due to important
programs outside the capital.

to the Gran Melia Hotel here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The reception for Olympic champions Alan Budikusuma and Susi
Susanti was opened by the Badminton Association of Indonesia
chairman Soerjadi.
</P>
<P>
Amigos Para Siempre (friends forever), a theme song of the 1992
Barcelona Olympics, accompanied the bride and groom as Alan and

</P>
<P>
Indonesian gymnast Zainal Abidin, dressed in red and white,
performed around the circle of Olympic ribbons.

</P>
<P>
Susi, born on February 11, 1971, in Tasikmalaya, west Java, won

several grand prix series and the 1993 World Championships. He has
supported the Indonesian men's team at the Thomas Cup for several
times.

<HEADLINE> India to Increase Subsidies for Fertilizers, Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
expected to increase its subsidies for fertilizers and food in the
new fiscal year of 1997-98 in a bid to boost their production, an
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under decisions of the United Front government, the subsidies
for fertilizers and food are bound to rise by 25 percent in the
next fiscal year from the estimated 142.56 billion rupees (about 4
billion U.S. dollars) in the current year's budget.
</P>
<P>
The government effected a 10-percent hike in farm gate prices
for urea last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The larger subsidy bill is being projected for the next fiscal
due to a number of reasons, the first and foremost being the new
scheme of "food for the poor" being introduced by the United Front
government.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, people living below the poverty line would be
provided with rice and wheat at heavily concessional rates through
the revamped Public Distribution System (PDS). The United Front
Steering Committee has recommended a two-tier pricing structure
for rice and wheat to be sold through PDS outlets across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The second contributing factor is a projected jump of 10
percent in fertilizer consumption while the third is the
outstanding dues to the fertilizer industry against subsidy claims
which would be around 1,200 million rupees ( 33.8 million
dollars). The third factor needs to be cleared immediately to pull
the fertilizer industry out of the liquidity crunch, the same
source said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebels Blamed for Stalled Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Armed Forces on
Sunday blamed the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) for
the temporary suspension of its peace talks with the government,
the local newspaper the Manila Chronicle reported today.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Nestor Castillo, chief of the Civil Relations Service
of the Armed Forces, was quoted as saying it was due to the fault
of the MILF, not of the military, that the peace talks were
stalled.
</P>
<P>
The MILF earlier announced that due to the offensives of the
military, it was forced to reconsider its position and suspend the
talks with the government panel, which are supposed to resume
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Castillo said government troops were merely conducting
routine security patrols in Buldon town in central Mindanao island
when they were attacked by MILF guerrillas, which triggered the
exchange of fire.
</P>
<P>
He said this was a clear violation of the local truce, which
the two sides reached last month to put an end to their fierce
one-week long conflict in Buldon town starting from February 16.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway group of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), refused to accept the peace deal signed
last September by the MNLF and the government and wanted its own
peace talks with Manila.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began their first exploratory talks
on January 9 but the second round of the talks were postponed
repeatedly due to sporadic fighting between the two sides in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government force in the
Philippines, with an estimated membership of more than 12,000.

<HEADLINE> ADB Funds Sri Lanka's Rural Electricity Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
has granted Sri Lanka a sum of Rs 1,650 million (30 million US
dollars) to further develop electricity facilities in rural areas
of Sri Lanka, Electricity Board sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Government has given priority to the development
of electricity facilities in the rural sector and under the grant
project 1,500,000 persons who have been waiting for several years
will get electricity supply, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The project covers 1,100 villages in the county and is expected
to extend the power lines by 4,282 kilometers and high tension
power lines by another 1,700 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to rural electricity supply, the government has
been pushing to increase its thermal electricity supply. The
country depends on hydro power for 84 percent of the electricity
supply at present, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Consequently with the failure of the monsoon rains and the
severe drought which affected hydro power reservoirs, the
government was compelled to introduce power cuts for seven months
last year which extended from two to 10 hours per day.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Foreign Minister
Abdus Samad Azad said Sunday the death of Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping has removed a titan from our midst.
</P>
<P>
Mourning Deng's death in the Chinese Embassy here, Azad said,
"In a world becoming increasingly scarce of statesman, Deng's
death will make it much poorer."
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping passed away when all his ambitions had been
fulfilled except the desire for a trip to Hong Kong after
it returns to China, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Deng has seen China transformed into "a world economic and
political power" by his wise opening-up policies which have earned
for him immortality, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh State Minister of Foreign Affairs A.H. Chowdly and
Foreign Secretary Farooq Sobban also went to the Chinese Embassy
here today to pay their tribute to Deng Xiaoping, who died last
Wednesday.

dim prospects this week due to lack of positive news that can
offset adverse reactions on bidding fiascoes and plans to revise
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Political rows and the controversial decision of the Supreme
Court voiding the sale of Manila Hotel to a winning bidder
dampened sentiments in the Philippine equities market last week.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index (Phisix) lost
20.31 points or 0.61 percent over a five-day trading period to
close at 3,301.98 Friday.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said stocks are headed for another decline this
week, with the Phisix likely to test the 3,275 support level.
</P>
<P>
Other sub-indices ended lower during the week, except for the
mining and oil sectors which were buoyed by speculative trading.
</P>
<P>
The mining index surged 551.06 points or 10.46 percent in last
week's trading to end the Friday session at 5,818.06 from previous
week's close of 5,267.00.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Proposes 30 Percent ASEAN Equity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Ministry of
Thailand is proposing to allow ASEAN entities to hold up to 30
percent equity in Thai insurance companies as part of
intra-regional cooperation on trade in services.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government's commitment under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) is to allow foreigners to hold up to 25 percent
equity in insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The equity increase proposal is part of an ASEAN effort to
expand the scope of economic cooperation from the manufacturing
sector to services.
</P>
<P>
A ministry source said that under the new proposal, Thailand
would not face more foreign competition since ASEAN investors
cannot take up more than 30 percent of a Thai insurance firm,
noting that the spirit of ASEAN cooperation is more important.
</P>
<P>
Thailand expects to raise the proposal, if approved by the
cabinet, at an ASEAN coordination committee meeting on trade in
service in early March in Jakarta, ahead of the ASEAN economic
ministerial meeting in October.
</P>
<P>
 ASEAN leaders have decided to accelerate talks to open up the
finance, transport, tourism and insurance's sectors.

<HEADLINE> Paediatric Heart Unit Urged For Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan doctor Dudley Halpe
based in the United States has urged the setting up of a modern
paediatric heart unit in Sri Lanka for children including babies
born with heart problems, according to health service sources here
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that he has offered the government help to set
it up.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that at present facilities available in Sri
Lanka for paediatric heart surgery are limited and most of the
babies born with heart conditions do not survive.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, facilities were available for heart
surgery on babies within a few hours of birth. Similar facilities
were essential in Sri Lanka as many babies born have heart
problems specially due to malnourished mothers and mothers who
take alcohol, drugs, and smoke, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that Dr. Halpe has assured that the 400 Sri Lankan
doctors resident in the United States were willing to assist Sri
Lanka to set up the paediatric heart unit.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has never had a paediatric heart unit and children
and infants requiring heart surgery have been attended to at the
general cardiology unit which caters to both the young and the
old.

vehicles in January increased sharply, encouraging industry
officials and many corporate executives, experts and analysts to
advocate rapid development of the industry.
</P>

Output of 12-meter-long buses increased by 110 percent and that
of passenger cars by 32 percent. In total, 120,000 cars, buses and
trucks were produced, up 4.3 percent on an annual basis, compared

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Satisfied with His Three-nation Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
who returned home Sunday was satisfied with the results of his
visits to Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The president was confident that the trip would help foster
mutual understanding and friendship between Indonesia and the
countries he had just visited, Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono
said Sunday aboard the aircraft that took President Soeharto home
from Yangon, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto visited the three countries from February 17 to 23.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he said, the president extended his warmest
welcome to the wish of the three countries to join ASEAN (the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) at appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
With the inclusion of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, ASEAN's
population would reach about 500 million people. This will extend
ASEAN's potential market, Moerdiono quoted the president as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, ASEAN currently groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's great potential requires the region to foster its
economic cooperation, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said this could be done by each ASEAN member state
selling its products at a lower price to other member states.
</P>
<P>
The president also suggested ASEAN member countries to
intensify their counter-purchases as this would provide mutual
benefits for the countries involved.

WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Olympic champion
Lindsay Davenport won the 164,250-U.S.-dollar IGA Tennis Classic
by beating her compatriot Lisa Raymond 6-4, 6-2 in Oklahoma City,
the United States on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was the top-seeded 20-year-old Californian's eighth career
pro victory.
</P>
<P>
In the final, Davenport led the first set 5-4 but trailed 30-40
in the 10th game. She got the game to deuce and won the set with
an ace.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, she broke Raymond's first serve as the
fourth-seeded player made double faults. Davenport stormed to a
4-0 lead and was never challenged for the title.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, ranked eighth, had won three tournaments in 1996,
but nothing after her victories in the Atlanta Olympics and a
450,000-dollar tournament in Los Angeles.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage in China's Spring City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Jinan, the provincial capital of
east China's Shandong Province, is facing a serious water shortage
this spring because of little rainfall over the past three months
and the shrinking Yellow River in the Jinan section.
</P>
<P>
The city government has called on citizens to conserve water
and has improved the management of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
according to statistics from the Jinan Meteorological Bureau,
the amount of precipitation from the end of November to February
20 was only 1.6 mm, the lowest on record since the city started
keeping hydrology records in 1916.
</P>
<P>
The average precipitation during that period in an ordinary
year is 11.9 mm, and the bureau predicted a spring drought in most
parts of Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The city lies on the lower reaches of the Yellow River, which
is Jinan's only water supply. From February 8, no water came down
from the upper reaches of the river. Experts say they believe that
a big increase of precipitation in the upper reaches is impossible
and that areas along the Yellow River are expected to use larger
amounts of river water for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The Jinxiuchuan Reservoir, the city's only surface water
supply, has 17 million cubic meters, the head of the reservoir
says, and can only suply about five months of water.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Water Plant has shut, leaving only the Nanjiao
Water Plant, which gets its water from the Jinxiuchuan Reservoir,
and two other water plants using ground water.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjiao Plant supplies more than 80,000 tons of water for
urban areas every day while the industrial and private daily water
consumption is about 800,000 tons, so the city has to use large
amount of ground water.
</P>
<P>
The ground water level is dropping three centimeters every day.

BONN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Iva Majoli of
Croatia rallied from one set down to defeat top seed Jana Novotna
of Czech Republic in the final of the Faber Grand Prix in Hanover,
Germany on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Majoli, seeded third, won the championship match 4-6, 7-6 (7-2)

WTA tour victory.
</P>
<P>
Her last victory was in the same tournament a year ago, when it

<P>
Novotna who ranked third in the world, dominated the first set,
but Majoli gained confidence with 3-1 in the second before Novotna
pulled ahead.

Majoli's decisive break came when Novotna squandered a match
point with an unforced error at 5-4. Majoli forced a tiebreaker
that she won easily 7-2.
</P>
<P>
In the decider, Novotna surged ahead 3-1 but Majoli fought back

<HEADLINE> Sharif Pledges to Take Pakistan out of Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's new Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif today promised "giant strides", through
indigenous efforts rather than foreign donations, to take the
country out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his first televised address since assuming premiership on
February 17, Sharif reassured the nation of his determination to
face the crisis boldly.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan needs to revive the spirit it demonstrated during 1947
and 1965. "We have to stand on our own feet and pull the country
from the list of loan seekers," the Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is now facing serious economic crisis with a fiscal
deficit so far of 20 billion rupees (about 500 million US
dollars), a widening trade gap of 3.6 billion dollars and a
stunning foreign debt of about 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that despite devaluation of the local currency by
50 percent, Pakistan's exports could not rise. "Never in
Pakistan's history, the balance of payments tilted against us to
this extent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif stressed that the restoration of economy is the top
priority of his government. In order to meet the target, the
government will need foreign exchange forthwith, he said, adding
that if more loans are to be borrowed, more conditions will have
to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister has called upon Pakistanis living abroad to
come to the rescue by sending 1,000 dollars each to their accounts
in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is confident that his country and the non-resident
Pakistanis will give positive and enthusiastic response to this
"green bullet campaign."
</P>
<P>
He urged the countrymen of all walks of life to join him in
this national crusade, and save the coming generation from the
evil of colossal debt.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister invited the international entrepreneurs to
invest in Pakistan, assuring them that their investment would be
secure and safe.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to revamp the banking pattern, saying that his
government will provide a safe, profitable, modern and dynamic
system.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said that natural resources will be exploited and
agriculture output would be increased. He promised more
farm-to-market roads, better returns on agriculture yield and
roads to airports for export of fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The new government will encourage use of modern technology in
agriculture, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister noted that his government is working to
constitute a task force for better marketing of agriculture
products and to suggest ways to provide better returns to farmers.
The government will also reduce its non-development expenditure,
said Sharif.

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Mobile telecommunications
capacity will double this year as a result of a 70 million US
dollars contract signed recently between the Shanghai Post and
Telecommunications Administration (SPTA) and Siemens Shanghai
Mobile Communication Ltd (SSMC), today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English language newspaper quotes an official
from SPTA as saying that the expansion project is expected to be
accomplished by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
After the expansion, Shanghai's cellular phone network will
cover 450,000 users.
</P>
<P>
The project will mainly focus on high-density mobile telecom
areas, office buildings and areas with difficulty in
telecommunications such as downtown area and the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Shanghai has expanded the mobile
telecommunications network three times. Currently, Shanghai's
mobile telecommunications network has a capacity of 180,000 users
with more than 130,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project will adopt the advanced GSM (Global
System for Mobile Telecommunications) technology, which was
introduced in Shanghai by Siemens two years ago.

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Government has warned Papua New Guinea that
defense co-operation and aid programs are at risk following Port
Moresby's authorization of a 36 million Australian dollars (27.7
million US dollars) covert operation using foreign mercenaries
against rebels on Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Government could address Australia's mounting
pile of nuclear waste by reprocessing it domestically, a move
environmentalists say would create a massive facility taking waste
from overseas in order for it to be commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Fourteen women in a Victorian country town have complained
of sexual harassment by police, including allegations of rape. The
scale of the problems emerged only after they were brought to the
attention of the New South Wales Royal Commission on Police
Corruption in January last year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Government is widening its crackdown on tax
avoidance by Australia's richest people, targeting another 100
wealthy taxpayers this year. The tax hit list was originally aimed
at the use of trusts and other tax minimization practices by 80 of
the country's wealthiest people.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Expects Compromise With Clinton on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he was hoping to reach a compromise on NATO's
expansion plans at a summit meeting next month with U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told reporters after a wreath-laying ceremony at the
Tomb of Unknown Soldiers that Russia's opposition to the Western
military alliance's eastward expansion not only remains unchanged,
but will also be held in future.
</P>
<P>
"They went too far, and the priority task now is to stop this
process, and not allow the renewal of confrontation, as was in the
past," Yeltsin said on his first public appearance since he caught
pneumonia at New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said he and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had agreed at a meeting on Friday to look for a
compromise on prospects for relations between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to look for a compromise and I think we will
find this compromise at the summit we are holding with President
Clinton on March 20-21 in Helsinki," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Yeltsin discussed plans for the summit with
Albright. Albright said she made "important progress" but much
work was still needed.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov was due to meet NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana in Brussels late today.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said Solana wanted to see how far Moscow was
prepared to compromise following several NATO concessions.
</P>
<P>
NATO has offered to revise a 1990 treaty on the deployment of
conventional forces and give Russia a say in NATO. The West has
pledged not to base nuclear arms in new member states.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are the favorites for
early entry into NATO.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, which sees NATO expansion as a threat and a domestic
political embarrassment, has been holding out for a legally
binding treaty on relations between NATO and Russia. But the West
wants to avoid a treaty which needs parliamentary ratification.

<HEADLINE> Medical Care for Shandong Farmers Greatly Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- About half of the rural
residents in east China's Shandong Province no longer need to
worry about expensive medical care, because they have joined a
co-operative medical insurance system.
</P>
<P>
The co-operative system, which the country's public health
authorities intend to introduce nationwide within 15 years, allows
farmers to pay premiums and only part of their medical costs, with
the collective they belong to paying the rest.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year the province has invested 150 million yuan
(about 18 million US dollars) in its rural health care network,
which comprises village clinics, epidemic prevention stations and
maternal and infant health care centers in more than 150 counties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local public health departments have trained more
than 6,000 village doctors and checked the qualifications of some
120,000 established village doctors in the province.
</P>
<P>
The rural co-operative medical insurance system experienced a
boom in rural areas in the late 1960s, but was largely abandoned
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
At present nearly 90 percent of farmers have to pay all of
their medical costs, which sometimes may exceed their
incomes. About half of the rural poor are said to have been
reduced to that condition by having to pay medical bills.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health announced last July that it would
resume the cooperative medical insurance system in the rural areas
by the year 2010, when at least 80 percent of the country's 900
million rural residents will benefit from the system.

<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- College students who are in
school are not allowed to run businesses or involve in sales in
China, the State Education Commission (SEC) said in a latest
announcement.
</P>
<P>
College students cannot apply for commercial licenses and
should cherish their college life and focus on studies instead the
SEC said.
</P>
<P>
Some colleges students have used a great deal of time and
energy to get involved in direct selling on or off
campus. Frequent involvement in such commercial activities have
affected their study routine and gotten many negative results,
said the SEC.
</P>
<P>
Students on campus are not allowed to participate in
profit-making activities, and those who refuse to stop will face
criticism or harsher punishment.
</P>
<P>
But the SEC said that it still supports work-study, and prefers
labor services that help students become independent and
hardworking. It encourages students to turn what they learn in the
classroom into cultural, scientific, or technological services.
</P>
<P>
It also asked colleges and universities to help poor students
solve their financial problems.

<HEADLINE> Banks Hold Key Role in Enterprise Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior central bank officials
have urged the financial sector to give full support to the
bankruptcy and merger of state-owned enterprises while stressing
the management of banks' obligatory rights, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes Dai Xianglong, governor of
the People's Bank of China (PBOC) as saying that, banks should
make great efforts to make bankruptcy and merger an important tool
for better allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
Dai said bankruptcy and merger of state-owned enterprises are
an important measure in restructuring the national economy. And
"the financial sector will make full use of the leverage of credit
and interest rates to promote the restructuring of state-owned
firms".
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a separate national conference was held in
January to announce a series of policies concerning the bankruptcy
and merger of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Though China's macroeconomic situation has seen continuous
improvement in recent years, some state-owned firms have reported
continuous losses, which have become a key problem in the economy,
according to the PBOC governor.
</P>
<P>
PBOC Deputy Governor Chen Yaoxian said banks will play an
important role in pushing the bankruptcy and merger of state-owned
firms since 80 percent of their working capital is from bank loans
at present.
</P>
<P>
He said banks have done great work supporting enterprises'
efforts to transform their operating mechanism in recent years by
writing off some bad loans, he said, adding that banks will adopt
more favourable policies to encourage good firms to take over poor
enterprises, and banks will offer favourable interest rates to
firms which have been suffering losses due to heavy debt burden
but have a market for their products and will gain profits after
reducing their workforce.
</P>
<P>
While vowing to give support to state-owned firms, senior
central bank officials also stressed the preservation of state
assets. Banks should persist in commercial bank laws and rules to
improve the management of their obligatory rights, the paper
says.

<HEADLINE> More Fresh Vegetables, Meat for HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residents now have
more and fresher vegetables and meat on their dining tables,
thanks to a more efficient supply system from China's interior
areas.
</P>
<P>
A special freight train carrying vegetables, eggs and meat has
been shuttling back and forth between central China's Zhengzhou
City and Hong Kong and is expected to continue its 35-year-old
trip after Hong Kong's return to the motherland in July this year,
according to a local businessman.
</P>
<P>
The daily train has already cut the transportation time to less
than 70 hours, compared with the previous seven to eight days, in
order to ensure the freshness of the goods, said Zhang Kai,
manager of the Storage and Shipment Department under the Henan
Provincial Grain, Oil and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"We have persisted in providing the best products to the Hong
Kong people, and we shall do so in future," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
This capital of agriculturally-developed Henan Province has
earned a reputation as "a big vegetable garden for Hong Kong"
since the early 1960s, when the Chinese government started
vegetable and meat supply to Hong Kong despite severe local
shortages.
</P>
<P>
As the only means for transportation of the goods, the
Zhengzhou-Hong Kong train has already made more than 12,000 trips
in the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
Henan now provides Hong Kong with more than 300,000 pigs and
10,000 heads of cattle annually, as well as about 30 kinds of
poultry, fruits and vegetables.

</P>
<P>
Chang, who celebrated his 25th birthday on Saturday, pocketed
120,000 U.S. dollars and earned enough computer points to jump
into number three when the next rankings were to be issued on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive American broke the Australian's serve four times
although the Australian saved nine other break-points.
</P>
<P>
The win helped Chang improve to 11-2 lifetime against
eighth-seeded Woodbridge, winner of eight Grand Slam doubles
titles with compatriot Mark Woodforde.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Michael Chang,
captured his 27th career ATP Tour title on Sunday by storming past
eighth seed Todd Woodbridge of Australia 6-3, 6-4 in the
championship match of the Kroger St. Jude tournament in Menphis,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who turned 25 on Saturday, also won his first title
since winning the Infiniti Open last August. The victory, after
an hour and 39 minutes fighting, will upgrade him from fourth to
third with the 260 points he earned when the ATP rankings are
released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the final here for the first time after four previous
semifinal appearances and broke Woodbridge's serve four times as
the latter had to save nine other break-point opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He won his first match during his first trip to Menphis,
beating Rick Leach, but lost in the second round in three sets.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who became the sixth consecutive American to win the
event, improved to 11-2 lifetime against Woodbridge and has won
the last seven meetings.

his second singles victory of the year after capturing the
Australian Hardcourt tournament in Adelaide last month.

He is one-half of the world's top doubles team, along with
fellow Australian Mark Woodforde. Together, they have won 42
career doubles titles, fourth all-time.

<HEADLINE> US Air Force Blasts Off Powerful Rocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force blasted
a powerful rocket, Titan 4B, into space from the Cape Canaveral
Air Station in Florida today, a significant progress in military
satellite launching in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The giant rocket climbed skyward from the station at 3:20 p.m.
EST (2020 GMT). Nestled in its bulbous nose cone was a 200 million
U.S. dollar missile warning satellite, similar to the satellite
used during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The new rocket is the result of a nine-year, 1 billion dollar
upgrade for the Titan 4, the workhorse of the U.S. military space
program.
</P>
<P>
The rocket will primarily be used to launch spy satellites, but
will also be employed by NASA in October to launch it's
nuclear-powered Cassini probe to Saturn.
</P>
<P>
Improved and enlarged twin solid rocket motors and built by
light-weight composite materials, the rocket has reportedly
increased cargo capacity by 25 percent. In its most powerful
configuration the rocket can loft 48,000 lbs (21,770 kg) into low
earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
The rocket's flight was one of the most important Air Force
space missions ever conducted.
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes after blastoff the missile warning satellite
separated from the Titan. The satellite will be sent by a
two-state rocket into a stationary orbit 22,300 miles (35,900 km)
above the equator.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebels Take Town Looted by Gov't Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean Defense Ministry
today confirmed that the rebels led by Laurent-Desire Kabila had
taken the town of Kalima, abandoned by its inhabitants after being
looted by government forces.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Zairean Defense Ministry
officials as saying in Kinshasa that Kalima, situated 100
kilometers east of Kindu, the chief city of the Maniema region,
had been given up by local residents "following lootings
perpetrated by elements of the Zairean Armed Forces."
</P>
<P>
"The chief of staff, which followed the movement of the
rebels, has decided not to scatter the troops in order to
reinforce the front near Kindu," AFP quoted a Zairean official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Zairean officials said that rebels opened fire in the air when
entering the town, in order to "terrorize the population who
still stayed in the locality."
</P>
<P>
The refugee camp of Kalima, which once sheltered 25,000 people,
was also abandoned by Saturday morning, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Officials expressed their hope that the rebels will be
"evicted" from Kalima, as they don't have back-up bases there.
</P>
<P>
But they failed to tell how the government forces will take
back the territory newly lost to the rebels.

<HEADLINE> US May Continue Aid to Mexican Drug Program: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that the United States could cite
national security reasons to continue aid to Mexican
anti-narcotics program.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed from Tokyo on ABC's "This Week," Albright
appreciated Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo's action in
arresting Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo in an effort to fight
corruption in the battle against drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Charges that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the head of Mexico's
drug program, was taking money from Mexican drug smugglers were
very serious and "that does make the glass half-empty," she said.
</P>
<P>
But, President Ernesto Zedillo's quick action in arresting
Gutierrez "makes the glass half-full," she added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton also said last week that Zedillo
deserves praise for his strong stand against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton must decide by March 1 whether Mexico deserves
re-certification and further aid for the program in fighting drugs
in that country.
</P>
<P>
Albright said it was possible the administration could fail to
certify that Mexico is cooperating in the war against drugs, then
grant a waiver to permit aid to continue, on grounds of U.S.
national security interests.
</P>
<P>
She said she would look at the facts and make a recommendation
after returning from her current world tour this week.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Confirms Resumption of Air Flight to Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Algeria today confirmed that its
national carrier, Air Algeria, will resume air flights between
Algiers and Paris in one month and a half or two months, after a
two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Algerian Foreign Minister
Ahmed Attaf as saying that Algeria has "notified the French
government today" its acceptance to resume the flight.
</P>
<P>
Air Algeria will use the Roissy Airport north of Paris as its
terminal, instead of the Orly-Sud Airport of Paris it originally
used.
</P>
<P>
France suggested two years ago that Air Algeria transfer its
terminal to Roissy out of security reasons, a demand rejected by
Algeria which regarded it as "discriminatory," and Air Algeria
suspended flights to Paris in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian foreign minister said that the exact date of the
resumption of the flight will depend on "the rapidity with which
the installation of our company will be done in the new
localities."
</P>
<P>
Air Algeria is the only air company which served direct flight
from Algiers to Paris.
</P>
<P>
During the period of suspension, Air Algeria used Brussels as
its transfer point for sending its passengers to Paris.

<HEADLINE> No Substantial Progress After Solana-Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Russia held another
round of talks on NATO enlargement here today, but the meeting
between NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov ended without making any substantial
progress.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in a statement after the talks
that the discussion took place in a "constructive atmosphere," but
differences still remained although "progress is emerging."
</P>
<P>
He said Secretary General Solana and Minister Primakov, who met
for the second time since January, tasked their collaborators to
start "as early as tomorrow" preparations for the next round of
consultations, and they agreed to meet again soon in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
According to local news reports, during the talks Moscow
insisted that no significant defense equipment should be moved
onto the territory of NATO's new members and the alliance
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
Russia also wants a legally binding agreement governing future
relations with NATO, but the alliance is only offering a flexible
politically binding charter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin reportedly said
today in Moscow that a compromise deal could be reached at a
summit with US President Bill Clinton in Helsinki next month if
NATO was to delay its expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Moscow remains firmly opposed to NATO's plans, but NATO has
already committed itself to invite some countries of the former
East bloc to join the alliance and is not likely to compromise on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
However, both NATO and Russia wish to reach a deal before
NATO's Madrid summit in July, when membership invitations are
expected to be issued to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
