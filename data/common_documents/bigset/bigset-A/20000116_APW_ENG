<HEADLINE> One Dies in Mo. House Explosions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Explosions destroyed a home and scattered debris
over a wide area of a south Kansas City neighborhood Saturday, killing one
person and setting an adjacent house on fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The body of the victim was found in the house that exploded, said Fire
Department Deputy Chief Pat Gilchrist.
</P>
<P>
	   A large amount of explosive chemicals were found. Gilchrist said the type of
chemicals was unknown but they appeared to be powerful pyrotechnics that would
be used in making fireworks.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire officials said they did not know the cause of the explosions, but ruled
out a natural gas leak. Gilchrist said the fire would be investigated as a crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Wood, glass and other debris littered the streets in the area. Some
businesses close to the house that exploded had their windows blown out.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses reported a series of explosions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We thought at first someone was shooting at the house, but then there was
just a real loud boom,'' said Dave Ross, who lives in the house on the other
side of the exploded house.

<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Rick Tocchet broke a third-period tie with a rebound goal,
and rookie Robert Esche made 40 saves as the Phoenix Coyotes beat the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks 4-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Tocchet's winning goal was the 900th point of his career. He scored it with
3:27 left to play, and Keith Tkachuk added an insurance goal 18 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix clinched the season series with its Pacific Division rival, going up
4-1-0 with one game left.
</P>
<P>
	   Teppo Numminen had the first goal for Phoenix, and Shane Doan scored
short-handed in the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Fredrik Olausson and Paul Kariya scored for Anaheim, Kariya tying it 2-2 in
the second.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mighty Ducks put a season-high 42 shots on Esche, who might be sent to
the minors next week when Sean Burke and Bob Essensa recover from injuries. But
he stopped all but two in his best performance in six games (2-4-0).
</P>
<P>
	   Guy Hebert of Anaheim had 26 saves, not enough to allow the Ducks to snap a
six-game road-winless streak (0-5-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Trevor Letowski had two key assists, the second on Tocchet's goal.
</P>
<P>
	   He got the puck in the neutral zone when Anaheim's Pascal Trepanier tried to
knock down a flying puck with his glove, but muffed it. Letowski skated into the
circle and let a shot go. Tocchet crossed in front and knocked the rebound in.
</P>
<P>
	   Doan, whose previous best was seven goals during his 1995-96 rookie season,
scored his 16th with 9:41 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   He broke for the other end when Letowski got the puck during a Ducks power
play. Letowski passed to Doan, who crossed to his right in the slot, and beat
Hebert between the legs for Phoenix's eighth short-handed goal of the season,
tying Detroit for tops in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
	   It sent the Coyotes into a short-lived 2-1 lead, but Kariya tied it 1:53
later, sweeping in for a fore-hand wrist shot that Esche couldn't stop.
</P>
<P>
	   Teemu Selanne, Anaheim's other scoring leader, had an assist on the goal --
his first in five games against the Coyotes. Until Saturday, the Kariya-Selanne
attack managed just one point, by Kariya, in the series.

<HEADLINE> New Advantage Takes Derby Prep  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Calif. (AP) -- Thrown off stride by a hard thump into the rail, New
Advantage recovered in time to overtake Nurdlinger in the stretch for a
one-length victory Saturday in the $150,000 Golden Gate Derby.
</P>
<P>
	New Advantage was battling for the lead on the far turn when pace-setting Shake
Loose drifted slightly inside, squeezing New Advantage against the rail and
forcing jockey Adalberto Lopez to pull back on the reins.
</P>
<P>
	Despite the break in momentum, New Advantage never fell further back than
third. He shot past the tiring Shake Loose in mid-stretch, briefly bumping his
rival one more time before securing the 1 1-16th mile event, one of the first
major West Coast preps for 3-year-olds gearing up for a run at the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
	``I had kind of a rough trip, but I knew this horse wasn't going to give up,''
said Lopez, who also overcame trouble with New Advantage in winning the colt's
previous start last month, the Doonesbury Handicap. ``This horse is pretty
tough. He keeps grinding.''
</P>
<P>
	New Advantage, owned by John and Betty Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm near San
Diego, covered the distance in 1:42.66 over a wet track. The colt earned a
$90,000 first prize, more than doubling his career earnings and returned $10.60,
$5 and $5.40 as the third betting choice in the field of nine. Runner-up
Nurdlinger paid $9.80 and $6.80, and Shake Loose returned $5.20.
</P>
<P>
	Favored Globalize and Hurricane Carter, who ran coupled in the wagering because
of joint ownership ties, finished fourth and eighth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Jenda, the trainer of New Advantage, said he wasn't sure where the horse
would run next, but was encouraged by the colt's ability to overcome trouble.
</P>
<P>
	``He can get bumped around a little bit and continue to run and that certainly
helps, especially when you start running into crowded fields,'' Jenda said.
</P>
<P>
	``This horse is very exciting. He lays his body down every time he goes out
there. He seemed to reach down and grab for more. I thought he was done, but
Adalberto kept throwing the reins at him and he just hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
	If the horse remains in Northern California, the $100,000 Golden State Mile on
Feb. 12, and the $200,000 El Camino Real Derby on March 11, both at Bay Meadows
race track in nearby San Mateo are possibilities. There also is a chance the
Mabees could bring the horse down to Southern California, where they also
maintain a stable at Santa Anita race track.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gabe Muoneke scored 30 points, including 20 in the
second half, as No. 15 Texas beat No. 16 Oklahoma 79-66 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Muoneke was 12-of-14 from the field and 6-of-9 from the free-throw line for
Texas (11-4, 3-0 Big 12), which took advantage of the physical game by going
28-of-34 from the line.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma's Eduardo Najera, locked in a scoring battle with Muoneke most of
the night, led the Sooners (14-2, 2-1) with 28 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Muoneke started taking over the game in the first half with six straight
points -- on a dunk and two fade-away jumpers -- to spark a 9-2 Texas run that
gave the Longhorns a 26-15 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma came right back to cut the deficit to 28-24 after Najera and Tim
Heskett hit consecutive 3-pointers for the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
	   But Muoneke, the Longhorns' most physically intimidating player, continued
to thrive in the game that saw the two teams whistled for 46 fouls.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma held center Chris Mihm, Texas' leading scorer, without a field-goal
attempt in the first half, but could do nothing to stop Muoneke from muscling
his way near the basket.
</P>
<P>
	   After Oklahoma closed to 37-34 on J.R. Raymond's 3-pointer, Muoneke scored
seven points in an 11-6 run that gave the Longhorns a 48-40 lead with 13:59
left.
</P>
<P>
	   Heskett's 3-pointer got Oklahoma to 51-47 before Muoneke converted again on
a layup that started another run that gave the Longhorns a 60-49 lead with 8:46
to play. Oklahoma wouldn't threaten again.
</P>
<P>
	   Mihm finished with 15 points and William Clay added 12 for Texas, which shot
76 percent from the floor in the second half and 57 percent for the game against
the Big 12's best defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond had 13 for Oklahoma, which shot 38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Extends Cuban Lawsuits Bar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has extended for six more months a ban
on U.S. companies suing companies that deal in properties seized after Fidel
Castro took power in Cuba, the White House said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the press office said Clinton notified Congress on Friday
that he was taking the action ``in the national interest and because it is the
best way to secure the ... objective of promoting a transition to democracy in
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has regularly used his authority to suspend the right of U.S.
companies to sue under the 1996 Helms-Burton Act in an effort to avoid angering
European countries and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of companies headquartered in Canada and Europe do business with
Cuba and have been critical of the Helms-Burton law.

<P>
    PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) -- Trish Juhline could barely hear herself think over
the racket from the 6,362 Rutgers fans as she stood at the foul line with 17.2
seconds left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   But the noise hardly affected her aim as the Villanova freshman made two
free throws to give the Wildcats a 66-65 upset of No. 9 Rutgers on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Villanova (9-5, 2-1 Big East) went the final five minutes of regulation and
all of the five-minute overtime without scoring a basket, but scored 19 points
from the foul line during that span to shock the Scarlet Knights.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutgers (11-3, 4-1) had a chance to win the game in the final seconds, but
Tasha Pointer twice had driving shots bounce off the rim.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was so loud I couldn't hear at the end," Villanova coach Harry Perretta
said. "But Trish has played under this kind of pressure all her life. She's
accustomed to the noise."
</P>
<P>
	   "I just tried to concentrate," Juhline said. "I just want to make them, and
I'm glad I did."
</P>
<P>
	   Villanova ended Rutgers' eight-game winning streak. It was also Rutgers'
first loss on its home floor in 10 games dating back to last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to make excuses, like we were looking ahead to UConn," said
Rutgers coach C. Vivian Stringer.
</P>
<P>
	   Rutgers plays at No. 1 Connecticut on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was more important for us to win this game tonight than whether we win
or lose at UConn. I just hope we play with pride against UConn on Monday," she
said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   Shawnetta Stewart led the Scarlet Knights with 23 and Pointer had 16.

<HEADLINE> No. 3 Stanford 85, Oregon 71  </HEADLINE>
    By LANDON HALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Jarron Collins had 19 points and 13 rebounds, and No. 3
Stanford used timely 3-point shooting in the second half to fend off Oregon
85-71 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   David Moseley added 20 points and was 4-of-6 from 3-point range for the
Cardinal (13-1, 3-1 Pac-10), who won their seventh straight over the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
	   Alex Scales had 21 points and A.D. Smith had 13 for Oregon (11-3, 2-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford, coming off a 28-point rout of Oregon State on Thursday night,
didn't earn its sweep of the Oregon teams until late in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Three free throws by Collins, followed by Moseley's 3-pointer, put the
Cardinal up 68-56 with 4:23 remaining. But the Ducks ran off seven straight
points, and a 3-pointer by Scales cut the lead to 68-63 with 2:51 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ducks got no closer, and a 3-pointer by Michael McDonald with 1:49 left
pushed the lead to 73-63.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford was 14-of-14 at the line in the final 2:20.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon trailed by eight with 17:41 to go, but Bryan Bracey completed an 8-2
run by the Ducks with a reverse layup to cut it to 46-44. Three free throws by
McDonald and a tough 3-pointer in the corner by Casey Jacobsen made it 52-46.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobsen scored 12 points and hit all four 3-pointers, breaking the Stanford
freshman record of 30 set by Dion Cross during the 1992-93 season
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford's Mark Madsen was held scoreless in the first half because of foul
trouble, but he was productive in the second half, hitting two free throws and a
layup before the Ducks made their final run.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon clung to a slim lead in the first half until Moseley hit a 3-pointer
to put the Cardinal ahead 21-20. Stanford pushed the lead to nine before the
Ducks hit a couple of jumpers to pull within 39-34 at the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon was outsized by Stanford's front line of Madsen, Collins and his
brother Jason Collins, and the Ducks weren't helped by the absence of 6-foot-8
backup center Julius Hicks, who injured his back late in Thursday's victory over
Cal.

<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Rookie Alex Tanguay broke a tie with a power-play goal early
in the third period, and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-1
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado remained unbeaten in its last eight home games (7-0-1) despite
losing star forward Peter Forsberg to an injury. Forsberg bruised the back of
his right knee in the second period and did not return.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Roy posted 27 saves to earn career victory No. 429. He trails only
Terry Sawchuk (447) and Jacques Plante (434) on the NHL career list.
</P>
<P>
	   Jocelyn Thibault had 25 saves for the Blackhawks, whose season-high
three-game winning streak came to an end.
</P>
<P>
	   At 4:31 of the third, Colorado's Dave Reid kept the puck alive in front of
the goal and Tanguay's shot deflected off the stick of Chicago's Eric Daze into
the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments later, Roy, helped by trailing defenseman Adam Foote, stopped Tony
Amonte on a breakaway. Roy had several more solid saves before Dave Reid scored
into an empty net at 19:51 on an assist from Tanguay, who had just emerged from
the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
	   Forsberg's seventh goal of the season -- just 28 seconds into the game --
was the only score in the first period. Joe Sakic passed from the left side to
Forsberg, whose shot from just inside the right circle struck Thibault's pads
and trickled into the goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Forsberg extended his points streak to a league-high and career-best 11
games, and Sakic ran his points streak to nine games.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado had a 12-6 edge in shots in the first, but Chicago reversed the
ratio in the second, when Jean-Pierre Dumont tied it at 3:20 on his ninth goal.
Dumont knocked in a rebound of a shot from the left circle by Josef Marha.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago's Ed Olczyk limped to the locker room with an injury in the first
period, and both Forsberg and Chicago's Alexei Zhamnov also went to the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
	   Forsberg was felled by a slash to the back of his right leg by Dave Manson,
but no penalty was called.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado defenseman Alexei Gusarov was serving the first game of a two-game
suspension for cross-checking Pittsburgh's Matthew Barnaby on Thursday night.

    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Kirk Muller scored his second
game-winner against the Vancouver Canucks this season, lifting the
injury-riddled Dallas Stars to a 2-1 victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Zubov also scored for the Stars, who bounced back from Wednesday's
2-1 overtime loss in Calgary despite missing their two leading scorers Mike
Modano (slight concussion) and Brett Hull (groin strain).
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Belfour stopped 19 shots as the Stars -- 6-2-0-1 in their last eight
games -- maintained a share of the top spot in the Pacific Division standings
with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim Sharifijanov, acquired in Friday's trade with New Jersey, scored on
his first Canucks shift. Vancouver, coming off Thursday's 4-3 overtime win at
Nashville, wasted an opportunity to win two straight for the first time since
Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   After Zubov scored from the blueline to tie the game with a power-play goal
9:09 into the second period, Muller put the Stars ahead for good five minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
	   Muller got to the puck behind the Vancouver net, reversed directions and
wrapped a shot in off the far left post.
</P>
<P>
	   Muller, who has four goals in 12 games after missing most of the season as
an unsigned free agent, also scored the game-winner in his Dallas debut on Dec.
18.
</P>
<P>
	   Belfour held the Canucks off the rest of the way, foiling Peter Schaefer on
a short-handed breakaway with six minutes left. Ten minutes earlier, Belfour
made a remarkable save while lying on his side, getting his right pad up to stop
Sharifijanov from in-close.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a bit of redemption for Belfour after he looked foolish on
Sharifijanov's game-opening goal. Belfour was behind his own net attempting to
play the puck, only to have it bounce off him and to Sharifijanov. The new
Vancouver player scored into the open goal at 1:36.
</P>
<P>
	   Modano and Hull, who have combined to score 31 of the Stars' 107 goals, are
expected to return for Dallas' next game, Wednesday at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks, already missing Alexander Mogilny (pelvic injury), lost rookie
center Lubomir Vaic, who suffered a left-shoulder injury in the first period.

Serb Paramilitary Leader Killed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Masked gunmen opened fire in a hotel lobby
Saturday, killing a feared Serb paramilitary leader indicted by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal for alleged atrocities in Bosnia and Croatia. Reputedly one of
Serbia's wealthiest individuals, Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was a
longtime ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Arkan, 47, was indicted
for war crimes in Bosnia in September 1997, but the indictment was kept under
wraps until the NATO air campaign in the Balkans began in March. His
paramilitary forces also have been accused of involvement in atrocities during
the Croatian war, which broke out in 1991. He denied involvement in war crimes.

Bush, McCain Clash on Tax Plan

	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush accused John McCain on Saturday of
seeking a $40 billion tax increase on the job benefits of American workers, and
the senator retorted that the governor was trying a "Texas two-step" around his
own failure to plan for the future financing of Social Security. After the
90-minute debate among the six GOP presidential candidates, McCain's spokesman
said Bush was wrong, and that the taxes envisioned in the senator's proposal
would be about $4 billion. Bush's aides insisted their candidate had the number
right. In the Iowa debate, Steve Forbes called both Bush and McCain "timid tax
cutters."

Fighting in Colombia Leaves 50 Dead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In some of the worst fighting in months, clashes
between leftist rebels and security forces near Bogota killed 50 people
Saturday, the same day Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited northern
Colombia. Rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
staged an early morning attack on Guayabetal, 30 miles southeast of Bogota,
Colombia's capital. Fighting in the region continued throughout the day, and was
still going on Saturday night. The Colombian government and FARC also held peace
talks Saturday. It was not clear if the rebel attack was meant as a show of
force to coincide with the peace talks or Albright's visit.

Cubans Frustrated by Boy's Stay in U.S.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Increasingly frustrated by 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's
extended stay in the United States, an estimated 150,000 Cubans rallied to
demand the child's return, the angriest protest so far in six weeks of
demonstrations. A march of tens of thousands of mothers on Friday appealed to
familial sentiment. But Saturday's gathering was more of a strident political
meeting, held at the street corner where Fidel Castro declared that his
government was socialist almost four decades ago. The government, which
organized the event and brought in the protesters, estimated the crowd at
150,000.

Nigeria Troops Stay in Sierra Leone
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   KOIDU, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Nigeria has halted the pullout of intervention
troops from Sierra Leone to help keep the fragile peace in the country until a
U.N. force is fully deployed, officials said Saturday. Maj. Gen. Gabriel Pamba,
a commander of the Nigerian-led West African intervention force known as ECOMOG,
said the troops would remain in place to prevent a dangerous power vacuum in
Sierra Leone, where the rebel group Revolutionary United Front and government
forces signed a peace accord in July. Despite the accord, the rebels continue to
terrorize civilians in the dense jungle interior.

Report Says Pinochet's Outlook Grim
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The independent medical team examining Gen. Augusto Pinochet
concluded he would die "long before" the expected 18 months needed to complete
his extradition to Spain on torture charges, The Sunday Telegraph reported. Last
week, Home Secretary Jack Straw said he was inclined to stop extradition
proceedings against Pinochet after four specialists unanimously found the
84-year-old general unfit to stand trial. Pinochet requires a pacemaker and has
reportedly suffered from two mild strokes, diabetes, heart disease and
depression.

<HEADLINE> Phoenix Coyotes Are for Sale  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- An ownership group has been formed to buy out Phoenix
Coyotes owner Richard Burke, who believes his inability to reach agreement with
an arena developer threatens the team's stability.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's been going on for probably the last week," team president Shawn
Hunter said Saturday night. "Obviously, there's a group that's interested in
buying the team, but ultimately we have to see whether or not they're for real
and whether Richard wants to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Hunter said the negotiations were too preliminary to discuss whether Burke
would accept a minority shareholder's position in new ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   "His ultimate goal is to be the owner and have it be successful long-term,
but he's said, "Hey, if it takes a different structure ..." he's going to do
it," said Hunter, the only president the Coyotes have had since Burke moved the
former Winnipeg Jets to Arizona in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   He made his remarks during the Coyotes' 4-2 victory over Anaheim in the the
America West Arena, where the Coyotes' lease expires after the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix, reported earlier Saturday
that the founder of the Ellman Cos. was acting as broker to line up potential
investors, and that Ellman might join one or more to buy out Burke.
</P>
<P>
	   Burke is anxious about the future of the Los Arcos project, a $535 million
mall redevelopment in suburban Scottsdale with an 18,000-seat hockey arena as
its centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes and Ellman persuaded voters in November to approve public
funding for part of the project, but Scottsdale officials said last week no one
had applied for the construction permits.
</P>
<P>
	   Burke, eyeing the planned October 2001 opening of the arena, wanted
groundbreaking to begin this month. Instead, he and Ellman have failed to agree
on finances or a construction timetable.
</P>
<P>
	   Scottsdale voters will elect a new mayor and several new City Council
members in March, and unless a redevelopment agreement is in place by then,
newcomers to the council could decide not to commit the public funds the
electorate authorized. That, in effect, would kill the project.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellman founder Steve Ellman met with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman last
week. He declined comment when reached by the Tribune on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes magazine listed the Coyotes franchise value at $89 million last year.
Burke paid $65 million for the former Winnipeg Jets franchise, which he moved to
Arizona in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The arena seats only 16,210 for hockey. Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza offered a
$12 million plan last March to fix and replace 3,300 seats from which only one
end of the ice is visible, but Burke rejected the plan in favor of Los Arcos.

<HEADLINE> Kings 114, Warriors 99  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Webber matched a season high with 37 points as
the Sacramento Kings beat Golden State 114-99 on Saturday night, sending the
Warriors to their 12th straight loss.
</P>
<P>
	   The skid is the longest since Golden State lost 14 straight in the 1997-98
season. The club record is a 17-game losing streak during the 1964-65 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Warriors coach Garry St. Jean is winless in nine games since the former
Kings coach took over for the fired P.J. Carlesimo on Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber added 16 rebounds for his 23rd double-double in 32 games. Corliss
Williamson had 23 points, and Vlade Divac had 14 for the Kings, winners of four
straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Williams had 10 assists to go with nine points.
</P>
<P>
	   Antawn Jamison had 23 points to lead the Warriors, who haven't won since a
Dec. 20 victory over the Kings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings, leading 90-84, began the fourth quarter in spectacular fashion
with Webber dunking off an alley-oop pass from Jon Barry. Fouled by Vonteego
Cummings, Webber converted the free throw for a three-point play and a
nine-point advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State then ran off eight straight points, pulling to 93-92 on
Jamison's short hook shot, but the Kings answered with an 11-1 run that carried
them to a 104-93 lead with 5:11 left.
</P>
<P>
	   The flurry was punctuated by Barry's breakaway dunk after a Golden State
turnover, and a twisting one-handed layup by Williams that turned into a
three-point play when he was fouled by Adonal Foyle.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State got no closer than seven the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber had 22 points in first half to help the Kings take a 63-58 lead. The
Warriors, who trailed 44-37 after Predrag Stojakovic's driving layup with 6:03
left in the second, came back to go in front 58-57 on Mookie Blaylock's
3-pointer, but Webber scored six straight points over the final 49 seconds of
the period -- twice hitting long jumpers off feeds from Williams -- to put the
Kings back in front.

<HEADLINE> No. 8 Kansas 97, Nebraska 82  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG TUCKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- This was the game Luke Axtell has been looking for.
</P>
<P>
	   The lanky transfer from Texas, struggling with a shooting slump for much of
his first season at Kansas, scored 15 points as the eighth-ranked Jayhawks
remained unbeaten at home Saturday night with a 97-82 victory over Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   "The slump is busted. It's official," the 6-foot-10 Axtell said. "I might go
back into another slump tomorrow, but for now this one is busted."
</P>
<P>
	   Axtell's biggest bucket was a 3-pointer that capped a 17-2 run at the end of
the first half and gave Kansas (14-2 overall, 3-0 Big 12) a 49-32 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was basically the story of the game, a 17-2 run at the end of the
half," Kansas coach Roy Williams said. "We got more active defensively, got some
turnovers, got the ball inside and scored. One great spurt right before the half
and that was about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Axtell made three 3-pointers and hit a pair of free throws that kept the
Jayhawks in charge with a 66-46 lead with 12:43 remaining. It was the first time
Axtell led his new team in scoring.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cornhuskers (7-9, 0-3), trying to avert their first 0-3 start in the
conference in seven years, trailed by only two until Kansas took charge in the
final three minutes of the half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jayhawks then scored the first four points of the second half to open a
22-point lead over the team that beat them twice last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kansas' press is terrific," Nebraska coach Danny Nee said. "When we got the
16 turnovers in the first half, I thought that was the turning point of the
game."
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest lead Kansas managed in the first half was eight when Axtell made
a 3-pointer for a 32-24 lead. The Huskers then scored the next six points and
trimmed the lead to 32-30 before Kenny Gregory's bucket and Kirk Hinrich's
3-pointer ignited the take-charge run.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska, 1-16 in its last 17 trips to Allen Fieldhouse, was led by Kimani
Ffriend's 23 points and 14 rebounds. Cary Cochran had 17 points, including five
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We played our hearts out," Ffriend said. "They made a big run and our
turnovers did us in in the first half. You don't have to be No. 8 in the nation
to beat us when we do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Louis Truscott's free throw sliced Kansas' lead to 60-45 before Drew Gooden
hit a pair of free throws and Axtell followed with two more. Gooden, a 6-foot-9
freshman, brought the sellout crowd of more than 16,000 to its feet with a
follow shot at the 11:47 mark that gave the Jayhawks a 69-48 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   A few minutes later, reserve Ashante Johnson scored six of Kansas' next
eight points as the Jayhawks improved to 8-0 at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Gooden and Gregory had 14 points for Kansas, while Nick Collison had 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskers outrebounded Kansas 55-48.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 3, Kings 2, OT  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Jeff Friesen scored 65 seconds into overtime and
Owen Nolan had his 28th and 29th goals, one short-handed, as the San Jose Sharks
defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Luc Robitaille sent the game into overtime with a goal for the Kings with
1:33 left in the third period, but Friesen took a long pass off the boards and
knocked his 17th goal past Los Angeles goalie Jamie Storr for the game winner in
the extra period.
</P>
<P>
	   Storr, who came off the injured list Friday, was making his first start
since being sidelined Dec. 17 due to symptoms from post-concussion syndrome. He
was hurt Dec. 11 when his head struck the crossbar while he was stopping a
breakaway by Montreal's Martin Rucinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Brad Chartrand scored the other goal for the Kings in a game between
struggling teams. It was just the fourth win in 11 games for San Jose, while the
Kings have won just twice in 11 contests.
</P>
<P>
	   Nolan, third in the league in goals, opened the scoring just 96 seconds in
when -- with the Sharks killing a penalty -- he took the puck in his own end and
skated along the boards until the top of the faceoff circle, then blasted a shot
over Storr's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sharks now are tied with Detroit and Phoenix for the league lead with
eight short-handed goals. Only two of those have come at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Nolan made it 2-0 later in the period when he completed a 3-on-1 break with
his 29th goal. But Chartrand scored 28 seconds later to pull the Kings within a
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sharks had an excellent opportunity to increase their lead when two
Kings were called for penalties and San Jose had a two-man advantage for two
minutes in the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   But they went scoreless, and got off only two shots while Los Angeles got
one shot on goal. The performance left San Jose fans loudly booing their team.
</P>
<P>
	   Robitaille scored his 18th goal late in the third with one second remaining
on a San Jose penalty. Gary Suter fanned on a clearing attempt for the Sharks,
and the puck was passed to Robitaille in front of the net.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In some of the worst fighting in months, clashes
between leftist rebels and security forces near Bogota killed 50 people
Saturday, the same day Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited northern
Colombia. Rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
staged an early morning attack on Guayabetal, 30 miles southeast of Bogota,
Colombia's capital. Fighting in the region continued throughout the day, and was

Bush, McCain Clash on Tax Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush accused John McCain on Saturday of
seeking a $40 billion tax increase on the job benefits of American workers, and
the senator retorted that the governor was trying a "Texas two-step" around his
own failure to plan for the future financing of Social Security. After the
90-minute debate among the six GOP presidential candidates, McCain's spokesman
said Bush was wrong, and that the taxes envisioned in the senator's proposal
would be about $4 billion. Bush's aides insisted their candidate had the number
right. In the Iowa debate, Steve Forbes called both Bush and McCain "timid tax
cutters."

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore leads Sen. Bill Bradley among
people who say they plan to vote in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, says a
Newsweek poll released Saturday. In polling Wednesday through Friday, the
newsmagazine said 50 percent of people who plan to vote in the Feb. 1 primary
favored Gore to 36 percent Bradley. The other 14 percent were undecided.
Newsweek said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., moved in the Republican campaign from a
statistical dead heat to a slight lead over the national front-runner, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. The poll showed McCain with 42 percent to Bush's 34
percent.

created the joint unit at Peterson Air Force Base to make sure there were no
accidental missile launches at the dawn of the year 2000. They wanted to ensure,

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Sunday's presidential election in Chile is so close

Lagos or his rightist rival, Joaquin Lavin. Some 8 million Chileans are eligible
to cast ballots in a run-off vote for a new leader in this country, where the
economy is emerging from its deepest recession in 16 years. Economic
considerations will be uppermost in voters' minds as they choose between Lavin,
the strongest conservative candidate in years, and Lagos, representing the
Concertacion, a center-left coalition that has governed Chile since a
dictatorship ended in 1990.

Serbia's wealthiest individuals, Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was
indicted for war crimes in Bosnia in September 1997, but the indictment was kept

<HEADLINE> Even Headgear Can't Protect Boxers  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA DREYFUSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Getting your brain banged around is bad for your thought
processes, and even headgear doesn't block that, a study of boxers says.
</P>
<P>
	   "Headgear doesn't prevent the rotational acceleration that you see in
boxing," said Dr. Barry D. Jordan, director of the traumatic brain injury
program at Burke Hospital in White Plains, N.Y. "The key to a knockout or a
technical knockout is the kind of blow that causes the head to rotate."
</P>
<P>
	   Another doctor who has done research on boxing injuries, however, believes
the assertion of risk is overblown and the paper's argument against headgear is
unsupported.
</P>
<P>
	   The study by Jordan and colleagues in the Netherlands looked at Dutch
amateur boxers in what Jordan described as Golden Gloves level of competition.
The report was published in the medical journal The Physician and
Sportsmedicine.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the boxers were given paper-and-pencil tests in such areas as the
ability to pay attention, plan and remember. Thirty-eight were tested before and
after a bout; 28 were tested before and after doing rounds of punching bag
practice. In accordance with Dutch rules, all of the 38 who fought wore headgear
in the ring.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fights, 35 percent of the competitors received more than 10 punches
to the head. Thirteen percent of the bouts ended in a knockout or a technical
knockout.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers checked whether the fights affected the boxers' ability to
think. And the tests showed the fighters did worse after their bouts, compared
with the controls who did not fight, in their abilities to plan, remember and
pay attention, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes were not so great as to be obvious from the fighters' behavior,
but they did indicate concussion, Jordan said. Blows to the head affect the
frontal lobes behind the forehead and the temporal lobes behind the eyes, and
those regions of the brain are crucial for planning, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Headgear can offer some protection, notably to the ears, but the study
indicates headgear does not protect the brain against the impact of dangerous
punches to the chin, Jordan said. These blows send the brain sloshing against
the inside of the skull, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. R.T. Ross of Memorial Medical Center in Savannah, Ga., said he believes
the report overdramatizes the risk of concussion. "I believe it is a very real
problem, but it has a much lower incidence than you might be led to believe," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate study, Ross looked at eight years of data on Marine Corps
basic trainees for whom boxing was part of training.
</P>
<P>
	   This study is not directly comparable to the Jordan research. Although the
fighters wore gloves and headgear, they had only three 15-second rounds of
trainee-to-trainee fighting. The researchers looked for serious acute brain
injuries. They found three among approximately 180,000 participants, said the
study in the journal Military Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   "The risk of serious head injury in a well-supervised, instructional boxing
program is relatively minimal," the paper concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem that boxing faces is that injuries get outsized public
attention, Ross said. "The very graphic nature -- and it's a very newsworthy
event -- lends itself to attracting a lot of attention," he said. "I doubt you
reported very much on the last high school football player seriously injured."
</P>
<P>
	   Ross said he considered the Jordan paper's conclusion that headgear is not
protective to be "absolutely unfounded."
</P>
<P>
	   "Common sense would tell you anecdotally that the use of any protective gear
is a more safe option," Ross said. To show otherwise would require an experiment
in which one group of boxers would fight while wearing headgear while another
group would fight without it -- and this would not be allowed for ethical
reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A member of the American Medical Association board also supports the use of
headgear but would rather see boxing itself outlawed. "Headgear will protect the
area under the headgear, but you are still pounding the head and knocking the
brain back and forth in the skull," said Dr. Joseph A. Riggs of Haddonfield,
N.J. The acute damage to the brain may lead to chronic deficiencies that could
take years to develop, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The AMA's position on boxing is that it should be banned. Until there is a
ban, however, blows to the head should be prohibited, the policy statement says.
And until blows to the head are prohibited, boxers should wear headgear, it
says.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plants Environmental Legacy  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservation proposals are falling like rain from the
White House as President Clinton tries to create an environmental legacy without
the help of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   With just 12 months left in Clinton's presidency, agencies are working
quickly to try to complete more than a dozen major rules this year. Authorities
inside and outside government cannot remember when there has been so much
activity.
</P>
<P>
	   The rule-making is ``absolutely unprecedented,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the interior. He
is hopeful the next president can undo many of Clinton's initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Dale Riddle, who tracks regulatory proposals for Seneca Sawmill Co. in
Eugene, Ore., compares the blizzard of proposals to the New Deal years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've never seen anything like this,'' Riddle said. ``There's so many,
it's hard to keep up with all of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   In October, Clinton sought regulations to place up to 50 million acres of
already roadless national forests off-limits to development.
</P>
<P>
	   Two months earlier, Clinton announced an ambitious proposal to clamp down on
loggers, farmers and other landowners who indirectly may foul waterways with
runoff from their property.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Clinton designated three new monuments in Arizona and California,
protecting hundreds of square miles of federal land from development.
</P>
<P>
	   Other proposals would put forest health above all other priorities in
managing national forests, encourage state and local rules to help threatened
salmon in the Pacific Northwest, and broadly dictate land use on 64 million
acres of public lands in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, and on 10
million acres of national forests in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Bureaucrats are stretched thin as they hold hearings and collect public
comments. The 29 meetings the Forest Service's Rocky Mountain region has held on
Clinton initiatives in recent months -- combined with other local efforts --
have overburdened employees and confused the public, said Lyle Laverty, regional
forester for the area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dialogue conducted under these conditions is not likely to produce the
quality of feedback that you are looking for,'' he wrote in a memo last month to
his boss, Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say Laverty's memo shows Clinton is trying to do too much too
quickly. Rules written in haste only will increase public cynicism and prompt
lawsuits, they warn.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials say Clinton has little choice but to use his executive
clout.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where Congress has been unable or unwilling to act, this administration
has not hesitated to use its full executive authority to protect public health
and the environment,'' said Elliot Diringer, spokesman for the president's
Council on Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP-controlled Congress has taken to criticizing administration
officials, threatening legislation and urging agencies to improve regulatory
processes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is not entirely avoiding Congress. He is working with lawmakers, for
instance, on legislation that would secure billions of dollars of additional
federal revenue for land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
	   While the blitz to finish the rules may at times be messy, awkward and
demanding, ``This is nothing short of democracy in action,'' said Chris Wood, a
top aide to Dombeck. He noted 500,000 people submitted comments on Clinton's
roadless initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Zukoski, a Boulder, Colo., attorney who tracks rule-making for a handful
of environmental groups, acknowledged the thousands of pages of proposed
regulations can be cumbersome, confusing and overwhelming. But the environmental
protections that will result make it worthwhile, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're excited about the opportunity to see this administration end with a
bang and not a whimper,'' he said. ``It's the kind of work we're happy to
have.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson: 'Zero Tolerance' Unfair  </HEADLINE>
   By SARA BAKER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- Calling the fight over ``zero tolerance'' discipline
policies the biggest civil rights issue in America, the Rev. Jesse Jackson told
hundreds of supporters that the strict rules are victimizing blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson returned to Decatur on Saturday for a church rally organized in
support of six black students expelled from the school system in September for
brawling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Decatur is symbolic of a national crisis,'' Jackson said. ``Youth are
being expelled disproportionately and jailed disproportionately without a plan
to educate them.''
</P>
<P>
	   During protests in Decatur late last year, Jackson said the expulsions were
not a racial issue. But at the rally he argued recent studies show zero
tolerance policies imposed in schools amid fears of mass shootings and riots are
having an unfair impact on black students.
</P>
<P>
	   He said 82 percent of students expelled by the Decatur school district are
black, even though black students comprise only 46 percent of area's public
school population.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson used the birthday of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr. as a rallying point in his crusade. He said what is happening in Decatur is
the biggest civil rights movement in America today.
</P>
<P>
	   The six teen-agers were expelled for up to two years as the result of a
bleacher-clearing fight at a football game. After intervention by Jackson and
the governor, the city's school board cut the time to one year and let the six
teens attend alternative schools.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge earlier this month upheld the expulsions in a decision that
Jackson has pledged to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Disease Threatens Fla. Fruit Groves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Signs of an outbreak of citrus canker, a plant disease that
threatens Florida's multibillion-dollar fruit industry, have reached 10
commercial groves in Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It might have the possibility of wiping out the whole lime industry down
here,'' said Alcedes Acosta, owner of Acosta Farms in the southern part of the
county.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of his groves are affected, and the trees may have to be bulldozed and
burned.
</P>
<P>
	   Eating infected fruit does not make people sick, but the bacteria makes
citrus unsightly and unmarketable. There is also risk that other countries would
stop importing Florida fruits for fear their crops would catch the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 110 Florida Department of Agriculture inspectors were sent to
examine lime trees in the area for signs of the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're hoping we caught it early enough to get it in check,'' said Ken
Bailey, director of the state Citrus Canker Eradication Project. ``This is one
of the most serious problems that any citrus industry can face.''
</P>
<P>
	   The area has more than 3,000 acres of lime trees, the only citrus grown
commercially in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   Since there is no cure for citrus canker, the main containment method is
removal of infected trees and nearby trees, and a quarantine to limit and
control distribution of fruit from infected areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Land where groves have been removed must lie bare for a minimum of two
years. Once groves are replanted, it takes at least four years before new trees
will produce fruit.
</P>
<P>
	   Last February, the bacteria was reported about 50 miles from the nearest
commercial grove. Authorities said then the highly contagious bacteria was
detected in the Miami area in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on Internet Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the presidential candidates a
question on the issues. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Internet Sales Tax
</P>
<P>
	   Should Internet commerce remain exempt from sales taxes to encourage the
growth of online business or should it be subject to the same taxation faced by
storefront companies?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I supported the moratorium on taxation of electronic
commerce and I support the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce's efforts
to develop a tax policy which encourages the astonishing growth of the Internet
and electronic commerce, but is fair to bricks-and-mortar companies and doesn't
erode the state and local revenue stream.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``I supported the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which President Clinton
signed into law. The act imposed a three-year moratorium on state and local tax
and trade issues associated with electronic commerce and comparable sales
activities. I do not want to prejudge the work of the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce, but I will tell you that I am committed to finding a
solution to this issue that will allow the Internet and e-commerce to flourish,
but without stripping states and localities of the revenue they need to educate
our children and fight crime. Additionally, I support making cyberspace a
'duty-free' zone internationally.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``Internet commerce should remain exempt from sales taxes. This
will ensure continued growth of the most dynamic sector of our economy, but we
should also work at providing tax relief to non-Internet outlets.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I support the current moratorium on Internet sales taxes
and would extend it for several more years to determine the full impact of
e-commerce on our society.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``Politicians see the Internet as another source of government
cash. As a conservative business leader, I know e-commerce is a new frontier
giving families more control over their lives, creating new jobs and boosting
economic growth. That's why a critical part of my 'New Economy Plan' for the
21st century is a permanent ban on special, new Internet taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``I have repeatedly opposed various proposals to tax the
Internet or e-commerce. In fact, I have advocated making the current three-year
federal moratorium on Internet taxation permanent. This new economy is still in
its infancy. Its promise is great, but its potential will never be realized if
the federal government hinders its development with taxes and regulation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``I sponsored the law in the Senate that put in place the
current moratorium on Internet taxation. The Internet continues to be the
greatest engine of economic growth in America today, and we must not strangle it
with new taxes. Online sales totaled $40 billion in 1999, that if taxed would
have taken $2 billion from hard-working American families. As President, I will
keep the Internet a tax-free zone. Studies show that taxing the Internet would
reduce e-commerce by 75 percent -- a blow that would limit growth and kill
jobs.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Tested by Vietnam Captivity  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stooped in his cell, ravaged by dysentery, and
whisper-close to confessing to his Hanoi captors, John McCain heard Dooley
Wilson singing ``As Time Goes By'' in his head and Humphrey Bogart promising
Ingrid Bergman a beautiful friendship.
</P>
<P>
	   The young Navy lieutenant commander pretty much gave up during all of the
torture, solitary confinement and other punishments he endured for displaying
what his captors called a ``bad attitude.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tried to hang himself twice,'' his medical records note.
</P>
<P>
	   But his memory of books and movies ultimately gave him what attempted
suicide did not -- a way out of his harrowing circumstances -- and a route that
kept alive his chances of seeing his wife and three children again after the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
	   He delved often into his silent reveries, visiting worlds painted by history
books and movies, imagining other battles, mighty warriors and forbidden loves
far from his cell and the pain he suffered there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had to carefully guard against my fantasies becoming so consuming that
they took me permanently to a place in my mind from which I might fail to
return,'' McCain wrote in his memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers.'' McCain was
imprisoned after being shot down during a bombing mission over Hanoi on Oct. 26,
1967. He was 31.
</P>
<P>
	   If he wasn't replaying ``Casablanca'' in his mind, then it was books such as
``The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' or the Civil War history, ``Lee's
Lieutenants.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The important thing in those conditions is to keep the mind stimulated,''
McCain, 63, says now. ``That's what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the dingy walls, McCain also picked up the sounds of real life --
footsteps of the guards coming to interrogate him or bring him a meal of rice,
sometimes ruined with pebbles. If he was lucky, they offered pumpkin soup.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain would greet them with streams of profanity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He strongly resented their coming around and bringing him back to reality
by intruding,'' say his medical records. ``He was enjoying his fantasies so
much.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain says his more than five years as a prisoner of war taught him
confidence, humility and the ambition to pursue larger dreams, namely his 18
years in Congress -- he now represents Arizona in the Senate -- and his
Republican run for president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I gained a seriousness of purpose that observers of my early life had
found difficult to detect.''
</P>
<P>
	   The suicide attempts were his darkest moments, when his captors tried to
beat a confession out of him and succeeded in breaking his arm again, his teeth,
and finally his will. Once, McCain threaded his shirt through the window shutter
of a torture cell and around his neck, but was caught and beaten. He tried
again, with the same result. Finally, he said he was ready to talk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I couldn't control my despair. I shook, as if my disgrace were a fever,''
McCain writes. ``All my pride was lost, and I doubted I would ever stand up to
any man again. Nothing could save me.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was thrown in solitary three times -- for two straight years beginning in
March 1968, later for nine months, and finally for three months.
</P>
<P>
	   The solitary cell was 5 feet by 6 feet. ``A dim and spooky place,'' recalled
retired Vice Adm. James Stockdale, who occupied one of those cells before McCain
moved in and went on to a brief encounter with politics as Reform Party founder
Ross Perot's running mate in the 1996 presidential election; now he's an
enthusiastic campaigner for McCain in California. ``Maybe a little light crept
in under the eaves,'' Stockdale added.
</P>
<P>
	   Replaying books and movies to pass the time was part of the culture of the
American POWs imprisoned in the ``Hanoi Hilton.''
</P>
<P>
	   Designated as the recreation officer when he was in a big cell with 30
others, McCain would organize plays and skits or simply talk about the plots of
films.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I used to tell movies,'' he said in an interview. ``I told many, many
movies. You have, literally, a captive audience.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prisoners acted out an irreverent version of ``A Christmas Carol.'' They
were going to do ``Stalag 17,'' the prison-camp film that later inspired
``Hogan's Heroes'' on television, but he said the Vietnamese came in and removed
the men slated to be the lead actors.
</P>
<P>
	   Freedom came in March 1973 with the Paris Peace Accords, and McCain went
home a hero for refusing an offer to be released ahead of his fellow prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   An issue lingering from his youth still needed to be dealt with -- the
towering presence of his father, Adm. John Sidney McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has been preoccupied with escaping being in the shadow of his father
and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others,'' says his
post-release psychological records. ``He feels his experiences and performance
as POW (have) finally permitted this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, at a public dinner in his honor, McCain heard the admiral introduced
as ``Commander McCain's father.'' The young man smiled and winked at his dad.
``He had arrived,'' say his records.
</P>
<P>
	   These days McCain is rarely asked by voters other than veterans about the
most trying time in his life.
</P>
<P>
	   Politics, unlike prison, does not offer a captive audience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you're running for public office, people will respect you for what
you've done,'' McCain said recently as his bus rolled through New Hampshire.
``But they want to know what you're going to do for them.''

<HEADLINE> New Restrictions on Biotech Corn  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is putting new planting restrictions on
genetically engineered corn to address various environmental concerns, including
a fear that it could endanger Monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 percent of the corn grown last year was Bt corn, named because of
the bacteria it contains to kill an insect pest, the European corn borer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new restrictions, which the Environmental Protection Agency worked out
with the industry, will require farmers to plant at least 20 percent
conventional corn in most areas, and 50 percent in areas where cotton is grown.
</P>
<P>
	   Seed companies will be required to expand field monitoring so they can tell
whether insect pests are developing resistance to the biotech crop.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies also are to "communicate voluntary measures" to protect the
Monarch butterfly. EPA posted a brief notice about the new restrictions Friday
on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The butterflies feed on milkweed, which sometimes is found around corn
fields. A study released in May by Cornell University said Monarch larvae died
when they ate pollen from the Bt corn.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are really happy to see that the agency is taking the resistance issues
and the Monarch issue seriously," said Margaret Mellon, director of the
agricultural and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the agency has done a good job of jawboning the industry and
getting them to agree to the restrictions in an environment where strictly
speaking they don't have to. We're concerned that they didn't go far enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Rebecca Goldburg, senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, said
the new restrictions "confirm the fact that Bt corn can pose both an
environmental and resistance management risk."
</P>
<P>
	   The European Commission, which enforces rules for the 15-member European
Union, cited the Cornell study last summer in delaying approval of pending
requests to sell the corn variety. Mexican environmentalists urged their
government to ban its import and use.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to the study, EPA scientists said last year that they knew that
the pollen could kill insects but did not believe the butterflies would be
exposed to the toxin outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency is to consider renewing expiring registrations for Bt corn later
this year and has asked seed companies to provide data on its impact.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal Enjoys 80th Birthday Fete  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, who had surgery to remove a brain
tumor only months ago, brought a healthy sense of humor to the gala celebrating
his 80th birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will soon be evicted,'' O'Connor joked Saturday night at the
Waldorf-Astoria. ``I will have the distinction of bring the first living
cardinal to be thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor spoke eloquently for 15 minutes during the party and drew several
standing ovations -- and many laughs. The dinner featured tributes to the
cardinal and a video about his legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor said he anticipates being relieved of his post in the near future,
but promised not to disappear from the public's view. He also said he will
assist his successor in any way that he can.
</P>
<P>
	   Included among the 1,500 people attending were several men whose names have
been mentioned as possible successors: Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis;
Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, who heads the archdiocese for the U.S. Military; and
Bishop Henry Mansell of Buffalo, a former top aide to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   The dinner raised $5.2 million for Catholic charities, including support for
parochial schools in the New York Archdiocese and funding for a seminary
position named for the cardinal.

<HEADLINE> Key Facts About Chilean Election  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Key facts about Chile, which held a presidential run-off election Sunday:
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ELECTION SUNDAY: More than 8 million voters registered to take part in the
presidential election. Winner to succeed President Eduardo Frei, 59, for a
six-year term.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   CANDIDATES:
</P>
<P>
	   --Ricardo Lagos, 61, a moderate socialist. Backed by the center-left
coalition that has governed Chile since civilian rule was restored in 1990,
ending Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 17-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   --Joaquin Lavin, 46, a conservative economist supported by a unified
right-wing opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates battled to a virtual draw in a first round vote Dec. 12,
forcing the run-off, as no candidate received a majority of the vote. Lagos
received 47.9 percent, Lavin 47.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   COUNTRY: Located on South America's western seaboard, Chile runs 2,700 miles
south from Peru, and is also bordered by Bolivia and Argentina. A long and
narrow country, Chile has average width of 110 miles. Population: 14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   POLITICS: A republic, Chile enjoyed one of the longest-lasting democracies
in Latin America until 1973, when a bloody military coup led by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet toppled Marxist President Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet's authoritarian rule lasted until 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, he was arrested in Britain on a warrant by a Spanish judge
who wants to extradite and try him on torture charges stemming from human rights
abuses during his regime. In the final week of the campaign, Britain said he is
too ill to stand trial, which could lead to his return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ECONOMY: Chile pioneered liberal, free markets policies in Latin America
with remarkable success in the mid-80s. For over a decade, growth averaged 7
percent annually. But as the Asian financial turmoil spread throughout Latin
America, the economy suffered its worst recession in 16 years. Unemployment has
reached a record 11 percent, but signs of recovery have appeared.

<HEADLINE> Jessye Norman: performing a musical hard-sell - for Girl Scout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - She's the diva of Girl Scout cookies.
<P>
	   Opera star Jessye Norman sold more than 2,000 boxes in the past year, "my
best year ever!
</P>
<P>
	   "I get the chipmunk and the stuffed bear and the patch and everything - just
like the 10-year-olds," says the 54-year-old soprano about her sideline from
"that night job" - a career as a concert artist with a goddess-like aura.
</P>
<P>
	   "I will sell cookies to anybody, anywhere, on the street, to people out of
the back of my car" - a chauffeured one, that is. And she's an honorary lifetime
Girl Scout, attached to a troop in, of all places, Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing odd about that. After all, the Georgia-born singer first became a
musical icon in France. Her following was so over-the-top that the 1980s film
"Diva" was based on a real-life, obsessive admirer who planned his life around
her concerts.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, her first solo recording in three years is of French music and -
surprise - it's not classical.
</P>
<P>
	   "I Was Born in Love With You" is an album of cabaret songs by the
Grammy-award winning songwriter Michel Legrand, to be released Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a sexy switch from the formidable operatic heroines that won Miss
Norman fame.
</P>
<P>
	   To lyrics in both French and English, "I'm dying of love from beginning to
end of the album, which is just fine!" says the newly minted chanteuse,
releasing an exuberant peal of laughter that erupts like Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
	   On Valentine's Day, she's bringing the songs to Manhattan's Studio 54 for a
show benefiting God's Love We Deliver, which delivers free meals to homebound
people with AIDS. It's one of dozens of charities to which she volunteers her
time.
</P>
<P>
	   "On Feb. 14, we are so occupied with romantic love, we forget there are
other kinds of love too," she says. "The love of one's community, and the love
that we need to put into that to make it all a bit better, is something that I'd
like us to focus on this first Valentine's Day of the new century."
</P>
<P>
	   Offering love to strangers doesn't quite fit Miss Norman's cliched public
image - that of a bigger-than-life star, ready to dazzle. That's the woman
viewers saw on worldwide television in 1989 singing for the bicentennial of the
French Revolution, standing by the Arc de Triomphe draped in the "tricolor"
flag, and again in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, and in 1997 for
President Clinton's inaugural.
</P>
<P>
	   They were media spectacles, featuring a public figure emanating supreme
control and elegance in both dress and bearing, along with a voice that's an
opulent force of nature.
</P>
<P>
	   During a recent interview in a Manhattan hotel suite, a far more
down-to-earth, even vulnerable, woman emerged.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't like to completely disillusion people who think I wear a tiara
all day," she jokes. Still elegantly dressed, she sits quietly on a sofa,
occasionally wringing her hands as she ponders aspects of her seemingly
glamorous life.
</P>
<P>
	   "What IS a diva, anyway?" she asks suddenly, backing the question with her
disarming style - a simple, short manicure and no eye-popping jewels.
</P>
<P>
	   She often putters around her suburban Westchester County home in sweatshirts
and baggy pants. "Sometimes I look down and say, 'Did I get dressed today, or
what?"'
</P>
<P>
	   And this diva doesn't do her hair every day. "Oh no! You'd be shocked."
</P>
<P>
	   To fans, however, she is a diva in the true sense of the Italian word that
describes an ancient goddess praising Achilles in Homer's "Iliad."
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, Miss Norman has vocally personified the doomed characters
created by composers like Wagner, Berlioz and Strauss, prompting The Washington
Post to dub her "a virtual incarnation of the mask of tragedy."
</P>
<P>
	   Her vocal outpouring has been accompanied by the world's premier orchestras,
and she's filled concert halls with art songs and churches with gospel music.
She was soloist with the Chicago Symphony for Bela Bartok's "Bluebeard's
Castle," which won a Grammy in 1998 for best opera recording.
</P>
<P>
	   But for now, she's into jazz and cabaret - and she likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone might get up in the middle of the song and that's just sort of the
way it goes. It's a different format," she says of her upcoming Studio 54
appearance. Besides, being short-sighted, she's closer to the audience, "and I
can see them."
</P>
<P>
	   In March, she's up for a series of U.S. recitals starting at Carnegie Hall,
where she is to premiere a piece by composer Judith Weir, with texts by Toni
Morrison, Maya Angelou and Clarissa Pinkola Estes.
</P>
<P>
	   But whether in concert hall or cabaret, Miss Norman can't seem to get far
from one thing: "I'm dying always!"
</P>
<P>
	   There's another constant: "It's the same vocal chords. The change takes
place here," she says, pointing to her head. "Singing happens very much in the
mind, as well as in the rest of the body."
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Norman wraps her rich voice around the English language with
ever-varying inflections, depending on where she's been living most recently.
</P>
<P>
	   "I sound like a Southern girl who's spent many, many years working in
Europe, who's lived in Germany. So that is - that's a mess!" she says with a
hearty laugh. "I'm all of that. It confuses people; they say, 'Where do you come
from?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Actually, she's very much at home in Paris, where nobody addresses her by
her last name, she says.
</P>
<P>
	   "I love it if I'm walking through the Gare de Lyon," a Paris train station,
"and somebody who's in charge of the luggage says, 'Bonjour, Jessye!"' -
pronounced "Zhecee."
</P>
<P>
	   The admirer who follows the singer in "Diva" was a Paris messenger who would
travel all over Europe, by third-class train when available, to hear Miss
Norman. He has since died.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was one of these people that one thinks about on a concert day when,
really, you're not quite sure how you're going to be able to get out of bed,
much less perform, one is feeling so unwell," she says. "But one thinks that,
'Alain is going to be there,' so I'm going to make an effort."
</P>
<P>
	   He would almost never come backstage, she says, but "he was very important
to me. ... He would come to the foot of the stage and either say hello, or let
me know that he was there, or hand me up some flowers."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New, supposedly improved Lobbying Commission underfunded, groups  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - As the smoke clears from the Philip Morris scandal,
the commission charged with disclosing how much money lobbyists spend pleading
their clients' cases has been left with a toothier set of statutes.
<P>
	   But only on paper, government watchdog groups say, unless state leaders put
more money behind the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York chapters of both Common Cause and the League of Women Voters
say they will urge Gov. George Pataki to include funding increases for the
Lobbying Commission in the 30-day amendments he will file next month to his
2000-01 state budget proposal to the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   "It cannot be expected to do the job that is expected of it with its current
resources," said Barbara Bartoletti, legislative director for the League of
Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The current commission has nine people reviewing more than 2,000 agencies,
executive director David Grandeau said. The new law doubles the amount of
paperwork required of those the commission regulates and, consequently, the
commission will need more staffers to review those additional records.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no mention of increased resources for the commission in the
governor's budget proposal last week. "We need more staff," Grandeau said,
refusing to speculate as to whether the governor planned to boost his funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Conway, a spokesman for the state's Budget Division, said it was
premature to discuss the contents of the 30-day amendments.
</P>
<P>
	   The need to reform the state's lobbying laws was brought home last fall,
when Sharon Portnoy, lobbyist for tobacco giant Philip Morris, admitted she
manipulated documentation to hide thousands of dollars she had spent wining and
dining lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Her techniques included falsely submitting the names of people attending
receptions and nights out with lawmakers in order to keep individual meal costs
down overall. It is illegal in New York to give lawmakers and officials any
gifts worth more than $75 if they are intended to influence their official
duties.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris was fined $75,000, which the Lobbying Commission said was the
maximum it could impose under state law. Portnoy was also fined, banned from
lobbying in New York for three years and she faces a possible criminal
investigation in Albany County for her activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The highly publicized incident helped spur passage of a new lobbying law
which took effect on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with being subject to random audits, lobbyists are now required to
file reports far more frequently than under the old law and they could be
subject to fines of up to $25 a day for late reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Lobbyists are also required to list the bill, rule, or regulation they are
discussing with legislators. In addition to civil penalties, lobbyists who fail
to file timely statements or reports, submit false information, or exceed the
$75 gift limit may be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor charge for the first
offense and a Class E felony for subsequent offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The law also extends the "temporary" commission's term for eight years,
rather than the two-year reprieves that had been typical during the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Erik Joerss, a spokesman for Common Cause, said his organization had
advocated a law that covered state agencies such as the Office of General
Services, which issues statewide contracts on everything from police cars to
computer systems, and which would have included oversight of local-level
governments as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the organization welcomed the changes that were passed.
</P>
<P>
	   "But for this to be an effective agency with expanded powers it needs more
money," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, lobbyists are grumbling about some of the new law's requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of what we do is not bill related," said Mary Downes, of the
Syracuse-based Dairylea Cooperative. She said a Dairylea lobbyist might be
discussing ways to help the state's agriculture industry that had nothing to do
with a pending bill or regulation. "We won't be able to put that down," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Drug Compromise  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will begin trying to reach
compromise with pharmaceutical companies this week on a new Medicare
prescription drug benefit, a top White House official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope to push forward with a comprehensive solution to the Medicare
problem, to deal with the baby boom generation,'' John Podesta, President
Clinton's chief of staff, said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Front and center in that will be a prescription drug benefit, which we
think the American people want and the American people need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the president prepares for his State of the Union address to Congress on
Jan. 27, Podesta said he plans to meet Thursday with representatives of the drug
industry to explore its offer for compromise on Medicare drugs. Last year, the
industry ran a television ad campaign sharply critical of the administration's
proposal, which bogged down on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting, Podesta said, will be ``to see if we can make some progress on
this and see if we can find some common ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   The drug companies continue to support improved prescription coverage for
the elderly through the private sector. Clinton has proposed having a Medicare
drug benefit run by the government by contracting with companies used by many
private health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta outlined several other White House legislative priorities as
Congress prepares to return to the Capitol later this month. They include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Gun control initiatives, including money in the fiscal 2001 budget to
develop a ``smart gun'' that only the weapon's owner would be able to use and
money for law enforcement to crack down on a small percentage of gun dealers who
sell large numbers of firearms used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to be pushing ahead on all of these fronts in an effort to
reduce gun violence in America,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
	   --An additional $1 billion for the National Institutes of Health to continue
research in many areas, including decoding the human genome and cancer research.
In addition, Podesta said the administration would ask Congress to loosen
restrictions on an additional $4.3 billion already approved for NIH.
</P>
<P>
	   --A balanced budget that would pay off the national debt by 2015 while
proposing new spending on Medicare, Social Security, education and the military
-- but may not adhere to previous spending caps.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget agreed to last year by Clinton and congressional Republicans
surpassed those caps, which few of either party believe are realistic in an era
of huge budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not sure I can tell you what the budget caps are right now,'' Podesta
said.

<HEADLINE> New film traces history of New York, America along Hudson,Mohawk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - History flows through New York's Hudson and Mohawk
river valleys, and a new state-commissioned film will soon try to make the point
to thousands of school children.
<P>
	   "The Natural Corridor: New York's Transportation History" shakes off the
image of the old static film strips and dull industrial films with rich
photography and background music from gentle strings and woodwinds. The
narration is a mix of analysis by historians, writers, artists and engineers
mixed with dramatic readings of historic speeches.
</P>
<P>
	   The film will be sent to 3,000 schools by the end of the month after some
initial screenings at a half-dozen public broadcasting stations around the
state. The 90-minute film that has won five documentary film awards cost the
state $269,000, said Michael Fleischer, spokesman for the state Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The intent was to tell the story of transportation and how New York state
transportation really transfixed the nation," Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   From footpaths of the Iroquois to global airports around New York City to
the promise of high-speed rail, the film about New York transportation history
is as much a story about New York history through transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of the road systems followed these water routes," said labor and
business history Professor Gerald Zahavi of the state University at Albany. "I
think we're rediscovering rivers as industry has pulled out."
</P>
<P>
	   Zahavi, who wasn't involved in the documentary, said New York's Erie Canal
and then rail systems helped turn cities like Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo
into important hubs. The path of the Mohawk and Hudson river and significant
waterways in other states like the Connecticut and Chesapeake rivers provided a
natural lowland for travel.
</P>
<P>
	   "Early America owed its existence to these rivers and they established
regional economies," Zahavi said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a debt the documentary considers closely.
</P>
<P>
	   A 22-page teachers' guide identifies themes and context for the film along
with a list of books, authorities and Internet sites for further study.
</P>
<P>
	   The documentary begins at the beginning, with the ancient geological forces
that created the Hudson and Mohawk valleys critical from post-Colonial
settlement to the rise of railroads and the state Thruway.
</P>
<P>
	   When America was developing, an accessible trade route from cities as
far-flung as Manhattan and Buffalo was unheard of, especially because mountains
at that time might as well as been 500 miles high because of a lack of
technology to overcome them, said private sector engineer Frank Griggs.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, this is a transportation documentary presented with the hubcaps off.
Several speakers address the destruction expanding highways have had on the
environment, on the rise of suburbs and a lost sense of community, and of the
neglect of inner cities and their people too poor to leave or "unwelcome" in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The film is peppered with anecdotes, like the federal government's refusal
to help pay for the Erie Canal that would open up the country's West in the 19th
Century. President Thomas Jefferson in 1809 called the idea "little more than
madness," in part because the canal was projected to cost three times the price
of the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City's contributions to American transportation was a study of its
own. The first mass transit was born there, first horse drawn and later powered
by trains, which for the first time allowed people to live further than walking
distance from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   This created America's first suburb, what the Dutch called "broken land" and
New Yorkers later called Brooklyn Heights.

<HEADLINE> Politicians waging war against New York educational establishment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It's tough to be an education official right now.
<P>
	   Not only are there cheating and attendance controversies in New York City
and low scores on standardized tests around New York state, but now the two most
powerful Republicans have education bureaucracies square in their sights.
</P>
<P>
	   But is it politics or progress? Depends on who you ask.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wants to boot the city's Board of
Education out of its current building since he can't get it abolished.
</P>
<P>
	   The city will sell the board's Brooklyn headquarters and put the board in a
much smaller facility in order to force it to reduce the size of its
bureaucracy, Giuliani threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany, frustrated because he can't abolish the Board of Regents - the
statewide equivalent of the city's Board of Education - Gov. George Pataki wants
the Regents directly under his control. He wants to pick the Regents, the
Regents' chancellor, the state education commissioner, move the Education
Department's charter school money to the State University of New York - which he
already controls - and take over control of the State Library, State Museum and
State Archives.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither plan is likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state Legislature, and they elect the
Regents. Those Democrats are unlikely to approve any changes in the command
structure of the Regents and the state Education Department they oversee,
especially not at the behest of a Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
	   And the city Board of Education would have to approve the sale of its
building, and is highly unlikely to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Is this just about politics, the executives' urge to control everything they
can get their hands on or genuine concern about the educational systems of New
York City and New York state?
</P>
<P>
	   "Governors always want control over what they don't control," Education
Commissioner Richard Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pataki and Giuliani can point to recent test scores as reasons they
should be in control instead of their respective education boards.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half the fourth grade students statewide did not pass the Regents'
new English test, a third failed the fourth-grade math test and a quarter of
those who took the senior English exam needed to graduate have to take it again.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost 80 percent of New York City's eighth graders were categorized as only
being able to use "simple" math or "basic reasoning" on the new statewide test.
</P>
<P>
	   These mediocre test results have come despite record state educational
funding increases in the past three years, the two politicians argue.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't seen the results from the schools that we should have expected
when you pour this amount of money into them," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The system doesn't work," Giuliani said. "It hasn't worked in a long time,
and it's about time we moved on to a more accountable system."
</P>
<P>
	   Both men talk about bloated education bureaucracies they would like to
eliminate. For example, Pataki's budget proposal says he wants to cut 10 percent
of the Education Department's staff.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked, however, Pataki's budget officials admitted that the cuts would
be through attrition and be only be 18 of the 180 people that state taxpayers
fund in the Education Department. But still "we would rather spend general fund
dollars on the classrooms, not on the bureaucracy," Joe Conway, a spokesman for
Pataki's Budget Division, said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York isn't the first place where a mayor and a governor have tried
taking over the state's educational system, said Kathy Christie, policy analyist
for the Education Commission of the States. Governors and mayors around the
country have tried the same things, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's normal for them to want control," said Christie, who studies education
trends for the nonprofit, nationwide organization whose mission is to help state
leaders improve the quality of education. "That's been an ongoing discussion and
has been for years."
</P>
<P>
	   Education is an easy target of politicans because it relates to all of their
constituants, Christie said. "It's a focus," she said. "Among politicans, it's
something they feel that they need to control."
</P>
<P>
	   In places like Chicago, where the mayor has direct control over the city
education system and Wisconsin, where the state Board of Education has been
abolished, the education system has gotten better, Christie said.
</P>
<P>
	   "My question about this always is: Is it the change in the people or is it
the change in the structure?" Christie said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other words, did the person in charge just pick better people to run the
educational system or did the actual systematic change make a difference, she
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can argue it both ways," she said. "I guess time will tell."

<HEADLINE> Cyber-terror to jury duty: a diverse agenda for lawmakers on break  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - One sat through a briefing on cyber-terrorism threats.
One sat through jury duty.
<P>
	   From the exotic to the prosaic, members of the New Jersey congressional
delegation fulfilled a range of civic obligations during their annual holiday
season break from Washington. Recess began before Thanksgiving and runs through
next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-Paterson, traveled to Worcester, Mass., to attend the
Dec. 9 memorial for six firefighters killed in a warehouse fire. Pascrell wants
Congress to spend $5 billion over five years to help local fire departments hire
more members, increase training and buy high-tech safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before Thanksgiving, Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, spent six days
in Russia meeting with that country's leaders about international economics and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Robert Torricelli and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle raised $1.1
million for the Democratic election effort in the Senate during a four-day trip
to San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles and New York City. The Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, which Torricelli chairs, announced Jan. 12 that
it entered 2000 with nearly $11 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Back home in New Jersey, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-Harding, met with 150
mayors, municipal officials and community leaders to encourage full
participation by Morris County residents in the upcoming census. Frelinghuysen
stressed that a state's population determines its share of federal money.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Dec. 9 crash in Hasbrouck Heights of a small plane bound for
Teterboro Airport prompted action by other lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Steve Rothman, D-Fair Lawn, urged the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey to close the airport from midnight to 6 a.m. Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., urged the Federal Aviation Administration to evaluate the safety of
small planes flying over highly populated areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers unleashed an uproar among several New
Jersey lawmakers by approving two dredging projects that will result in
contaminated muck being dumped in the ocean off Sandy Hook. Torricelli, Saxton,
and Reps. Chris Smith, R-Robbinsville, and Frank LoBiondo, R-Vineland, all said
they will try to enact legislation to block the dumping.
</P>
<P>
	   Several members of the delegation spoke out against returning Elian
Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy at the center of an international dispute, to his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bob Menendez, D-Union City, a Cuban-American, said he will introduce
legislation that would grant the boy permanent resident status, effectively
moving the matter out of the jurisdiction of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and into the hands of a family court.
</P>
<P>
	   Other lawmakers also used the break to lay groundwork for legislative
efforts in the upcoming term.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Rush Holt, D-Pennington, held three events to underscore his support
for legislation to provide billions in federal funding to help districts build
or renovate schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Rob Andrews, D-Haddon Heights, received a briefing Jan. 5 on
cyber-terrorism and toured a Virginia military installation working on guarding
the country against that threat. Andrews said he agreed to be a leading voice on
Capitol Hill in support of President Clinton's request for $91 million next year
to guard against cyber-terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   LoBiondo said his district activities included presenting an award to an
Eagle Scout, congratulating Atlantic City High School's football team for
winning a state championship and meeting with members of the Bridgeton Board of
Education.
</P>
<P>
	   Holt held six town hall meetings and donated to a Red Cross blood drive.
</P>
<P>
	   And speaking of civic duties, Menendez reported for jury duty on Jan. 11. He
was rejected as a panel member for a criminal case because he knew the defense
attorney and two of the witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Arkan's Crimes Testimony Was Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The slaying of the most prominent Serb
paramilitary leader -- an ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic --
triggered frustration Sunday among Western leaders who wanted to see him testify
before the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeljko Raznatovic's death also inspired suspicion among Milosevic's foes.
Some suggested that Raznatovic, an indicted war crimes suspect, might have been
killed to stop him from revealing Milosevic's true role in the breakup of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Someone was making sure that one of the key people who knew too much
should not live too long,'' said Mirza Hajric, adviser to Muslim member of the
Bosnian presidency, Alija Izetbegovic. ``Unfortunately, he missed an opportunity
to testify against President Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was gunned down Saturday in a plush
Belgrade hotel as he sat in a sectioned-off part of the lobby. One source said
he was shot in the eye. The unidentified hitmen, who some reports said were
wearing masks, also killed two of his bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
	   A day later, international officials weren't mourning the man accused of
killing 250 people during the Croatian war for independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think tears can be shed for a psychopathic mass murderer,'' said
Jacques Klein, the top international official supervising postwar Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   But officials did express regret that Arkan will never tell the war crimes
tribunal at The Hague what he knows about the violence that has torn the former
Yugoslavia apart.
</P>
<P>
	   Two months ago, reports in the independent Belgrade media claimed Arkan was
considering defecting to the West. The reports, denied by Arkan's lawyer, also
said he was trying to cut a back-room deal with the war crimes tribunal to
testify against Milosevic in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sad part of all of this is that he was not actually brought to
justice, that he was not brought to The Hague,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in a statement that the United
States takes ``no satisfaction in Arkan's murder and would have wanted him to
stand trial in The Hague for his crimes.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgrade, however, tears were shed for Arkan, who had won popularity by
relentlessly whipping up Serb nationalism. A crowd swarmed to the hospital where
an ambulance brought Arkan after the shooting, and men and women cried as they
were told the man known as ``babyface killer'' was dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic's foes, meanwhile, expressed suspicion over the death of the
former bank robber who rose to prominence in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying is one of a series of unsolved murders of prominent Belgrade
figures, including Milosevic's police chief, Radovan Stojicic, and his communist
party ally, Zoran Todorovic, both of whom died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A number of people who had a prominent role in the past wars are vanishing
in professionally organized murders,'' said Zarko Korac, an opposition
politician.
</P>
<P>
	   During the wars in Bosnia and Croatia, Arkan's paramilitary units spread
fear among non-Serbs, amassing wealth by looting and smuggling. Arkan's Tigers
militia was covertly organized in the early 1990s by Milosevic's secret police
which also equipped, trained and commanded the paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan was used as a front man. His role as the leader of an ostensibly
independent militia gang allowed Milosevic's government to publicly disassociate
itself from the ethnic cleansing its security forces were perpetrating in
Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Milosevic and Arkan were careful to avoid any public sign of a link
between them, although Arkan was often seen together with Milosevic's police and
security officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's main media outlets barely mentioned the slaying. The main
state-run Politika daily published it on page 20 of its Sunday edition.
State-run television reported the death at the very end of its late Saturday
newscast -- just before the weather.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russian Jets Pummel Chechen Capital  </HEADLINE>
   By RUSLAN MUSAYEV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian warplanes circled incessantly over Chechnya's
capital on Sunday, showering bombs on Grozny as the military vowed to step up
its weeks-long effort to penetrate the city's center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian Defense Ministry said federal forces killed 120 rebels across
the breakaway republic over the previous 24 hours. The Islamic militants did not
report any losses, but rebel commander Isa Munayev said at least 18 civilians
were killed in Sunday's attacks on Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian bombers zoomed over Grozny all day, with at least eight jets in the
air at any given time. Plumes of black and white smoke spewed from fires, and
bombing was especially intense around a meat canning factory and Grozny's horse
track.
</P>
<P>
	   In some of the heaviest air strikes in weeks, the Russian military command
on Sunday reported more than 120 raids around Chechnya over the past day. Blasts
echoed through the Argun gorge, which leads south through the rebel-held
mountains to the republic of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   A top Russian commander, Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, said the offensive on
Grozny had reached ``a decisive phase'' and that the military has been
reinvigorated after a brief pause -- apparently referring to rebel attacks on
Russian-occupied towns last week that stalled the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Russian army will not leave Chechnya until the last bandit is
destroyed,'' he said Sunday, according to Russia's ITAR-Tass and Interfax news
agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel attacks in Grozny's streets devastated Russian troops in the 1994-96
Chechnya war. Seeking to avoid a replay, Russia's military this time has bombed
and shelled the city for months and sent in only small groups of soldiers to try
to gain ground.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of Russian optimism, the government's mission to Chechnya began
moving its headquarters Sunday from Mozdok in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia into Chechnya's second-largest city, Gudermes. The Russians seized
Gudermes early in the campaign and have suggested it could be a future Chechen
capital.
</P>
<P>
	   While the war has been largely popular among Russians, more and more people
are starting to voice protest.
</P>
<P>
	   Vladimir Kulikov, a former interior minister who played a key role in
commanding the botched 1994-6 Chechnya war, said Sunday that the military is
``lying about its losses'' and bogging down.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking on Russia's NTV television, Kulikov, whose son is serving in
Chechnya, suggested stopping the advance on Grozny to prevent massive losses.
Russian troops were killed in huge numbers in Grozny in the last war, and the
military is keen to avoid a repeat scenario.
</P>
<P>
	   Morale appears to be souring among some troops as fighting drags on into its
fifth month and casualties mount.
</P>
<P>
	   Two squadrons in Gudermes have been ordered to extend their tour for two
months -- even though servicemen say they haven't been paid for the last two.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In our unit alone eight servicemen were killed in the last 10 days,'' said
Vasily Krashin, a soldier in Gudermes. ``We were sleeping in a cowshed in the
open, and they're telling us to stay for a second tour.''
</P>
<P>
	   Soldiers and observers say both the Russian military and the rebels aren't
accurately reporting their losses and exaggerating those of the other side.
</P>
<P>
	   Civilian casualties are even harder to pin down. In Grozny, many dead bodies
remain in basements because residents are afraid to venture out between bombings
to bury them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many don't know what day or month it is,'' said Zaina Idigova, 45, who
left Grozny on Friday and trudged through snowy forests before reaching
Ingushetia on Sunday. ``I was born and raised in Grozny, but when I was passing
through the city I couldn't even recognize the place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Maria Gakisheva, another refugee who left Grozny on Friday said there was
nothing left to eat in the city. ``The people are like skeletons,'' she said.
``They are too weak to leave. They can only be carried out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Konstantin Kukharenko, a Russian military spokesman, said rebels
were moving their best fighters out of Grozny, leaving the defense of the
capital to younger guerrillas to fight in small groups.
</P>
<P>
	   But rebel commander Munayev said from Grozny on Sunday that the Chechens
would defend Grozny ``at least until the end of April.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into Chechnya in September to wipe out rebels who twice
invaded neighboring Dagestan and who are blamed for apartment bombings elsewhere
in Russia that killed about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Governor urges employers to let workers volunteer insurance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman wants the private sector to
offer workers paid time off to volunteer at their children's schools.
<P>
	   The governor also wants employers to offer employees long-term care
insurance to pay for nursing homes or home care in their old age.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's suggestions don't come out of thin air. She is urging New Jersey
companies to follow her lead.
</P>
<P>
	   In her State of the State speech last week, Whitman announced the state will
give its workers up to two hours' paid time off per month for school
involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know some enlightened business leaders do the same for their employees. I
challenge every employer to get on board. Let's do all we can to help our
schools become their very best," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also unveiled plans to offer state workers the option of
purchasing, at their own expense, long-term care insurance at discounted state
group rates. Buying such insurance now will enable state workers to chose from a
wide range of long-term options later, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope private employers will follow our example by offering it to their
employees as well," she said in her speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's ideas have merit in an employee-friendly market where hungry
companies are enticing recruits with competitive benefit packages, according to
Joseph Gonzalez, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Better yet, they're not mandates, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any business association on the planet doesn't have trouble with
suggestions. We have problem with mandates," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's school volunteer proposal is aimed at enhancing parental
involvement in education, which experts believe improves students' performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know how crucial parental involvement is to a child's success. Yet right
now, because the school day and workday overlap, many of us find it nearly
impossible to take part in school activities on a regular basis," said Whitman,
who teaches a fourth grade class twice per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the New Brunswick-based pharmaceutical giant, already
recognizes the importance of volunteerism, said company spokesman John McKeegan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We encourage employees to volunteer where they can," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, there is no formal policy on employee philanthropy; individual
workers arrange for paid time off with supervisors on a case by case basis, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson &AMP; Johnson also already offers workers the option of purchasing
long-term care insurance, McKeegan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another business, Jevic Transportation of Delanco, also allows employees to
go into schools on the trucking company's clock.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokeswoman Kathleen Schmucker said employees who participate in the
18-year-old "Good Neighbors Program" talk to students about truck safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "Based on my experience, it's very positive," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gonzalez warned the governor not to expect too much. Many members of the
business association are small mom-and-pop concerns that cannot afford to pay
workers for time spent away from their tasks, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Bless, owner of Broad Street Hardware in Trenton, is one example.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're here to work. People want to volunteer their time, they should do it
on their own time," said Bless, who employs only one worker.

<HEADLINE> Scientists plan pre-emptive strike on mosquitoes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP)- A strike force of state scientists is plotting a
deadly attack on a sleeping enemy in Fairfield County - mosquitoes.
<P>
	   Since last fall's outbreak of West Nile encephalitis, state officials have
been concerned about preparing form the coming mosquito-biting season.
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Andreadis of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment station in New
Haven has been making forays into dark and dank areas to find mosquitoes and
bring them back for testing to see if they carry West Nile encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
	   So far none of the 178 mosquitoes collected by Andreadis were infected with
West Nile.
</P>
<P>
	   The insects collected are helping state scientists develop a profile of
where mosquitoes go to survive the winter. Such information will allow experts
to devise strategies for the anticipated return of West Nile virus in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, seven people died of West Nile encephalitis in New York and at
least 59 others, who experienced high fevers and brain swelling, were stricken
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   In Connecticut, there were no human cases of West Nile virus. But the
disease was linked to the die-off of hundreds of birds, primarily crows.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now the question is what do you do about it to lower the risk and prevent
it from transmitting to people?" said Michele Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary proposal to combat West Nile encephalitis, now being reviewed
within the DEP, calls for the state to allocate $2 million for a comprehensive
strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Included in the plan is mosquito surveillance and the application of
larvacide in 20 towns along a 62-mile stretch from Greenwich to Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   The larvacides, which would be deposited in selected catch basins in each of
those cities and towns, would kill up to 90 percent of the mosquitoes before
they hatch and can transmit the virus.
</P>
<P>
	   Several agencies as well as environmentalists believe the application of
larvacides presents the best way of quashing or containing the threat of West
Nile.
</P>
<P>
	   "Larvacides are not totally safe for the environment, but they are less
damaging to human and animal health. They are more specific than pesticides,"
Diane Lauricella, chairwoman of the Sierra Club's Fairfield County chapter.
</P>
<P>
	   If the pre-emptive strike fails or additional communities discover bird
kills connected with West Nile, a contingency fund of $800,000 is built into the
proposal for larvaciding additional towns and for spraying adult mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
	   Stamford officials are coming up with their own plan of action. Stamford
officials want to set up surveillance and prepare an arsenal of chemical agents
to ward off any public health threat from mosquitoes that bear the West Nile
encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
	   The city's Department of Health and Social Services is inviting companies to
submit proposals for a comprehensive mosquito-control program that could be
enacted quickly if mosquito-borne illnesses appear to pose a threat to public
health this season, said Director of Public Safety, Health and Welfare John
Byrne.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Denies Partying During Slide  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez on Sunday denied
allegations that he was drunk and partying on a Caribbean island with Fidel
Castro the day thousands of Venezuelans died in mudslides.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, he said he risked his life by flying into the disaster zone in near
zero-visibility.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One meter (yard) beyond the cabin the pilot could see absolutely
nothing,'' Chavez said on his weekly radio program.
</P>
<P>
	   Torrential rains last month triggered avalanches of mud, boulders, water and
trees that killed between 5,000 and 30,000 people by official estimate. It has
been difficult to determine a more accurate casualty count because most of the
victims were buried beneath tons of mud or washed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's detractors charge that he left the capital, Caracas, the night the
disaster struck on Dec. 15 and flew to La Orchila island off Venezuela's coast
to celebrate the approval earlier that day of a new constitution he supported.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez said Sunday his opponents have been circulating an e-mail message in
which an anonymous military official says the president was too drunk to return
to Caracas until late the night of Dec. 16. That's when the normally highly
visible president appeared on television for the first time after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   The e-mail, which was forwarded to The Associated Press, also says Fidel
Castro and other foreign political leaders attended the party.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez said the allegations are an attempt to discredit him. A former coup
leader who was elected president in Dec. 1998, Chavez has sharply divided
Venezuelans. Millions of poor people adore him, while the wealthy elite fear he
is taking the country toward authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What a capacity to lie!'' he said, likening the alleged campaign to Nazi
propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels' technique of repeating a lie until people
start to think it's the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez said he was in Miraflores presidential palace the night of Dec. 15 in
a Cabinet meeting, and by noon the next day flew by helicopter over the mountain
that separates Caracas from the Caribbean Sea to reach to the worst hit areas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he overruled pilots who told him it was too dangerous to fly, and
did not bring any journalists because he did not want to put their lives in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez said he spoke with flood victims near the port city of La Guaira in
Vargas state, and then tried to fly to another devastated town. But near-zero
visibility forced them back.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorge Olavarria, a leading Chavez critic, said Sunday he remained
unconvinced by the president's explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a government of lies,'' Olavarria said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents also accuse Chavez of putting politics ahead of public safety by
failing to call off the national referendum on the constitution, which took
place after two weeks of unusually heavy rains. But Chavez said the torrential
downpour that triggered the floods did not start until late the night of the
referendum.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Economies Eye Dollar  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GRAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- When Latin American economies tumbled last
year on the heels of a Brazilian currency devaluation, Argentina's
then-President Carlos Menem floated a plan to ward off future turmoil: why not
abandon the peso and replace it with the dollar?
</P>
<P>
	   Soon Mexico, too, was considering so-called dollarization. Prominent Mexican
businessman, tired of the chronic inflation and currency volatility that plagued
most of Latin America through the 90s, publicly lofted the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   But the idea never caught on in either country. While Menem went so far as
to enter informal talks with the U.S. Treasury, his hopes of an Argentine
economy supported by the dollar died out with the end of his decade in power in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, it was tiny Ecuador that dared to take the bold step, becoming
the first South American country seeking to dump its own currency in favor of
the greenback.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, President Jamil Mahuad said the nation planned to buy back the
sucre and replace it with the dollar, joining Panama and nine other countries in
the world where the U.S. dollar is legal tender.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts criticized Mahuad's plan as unfeasible: a desperate,
last-ditch attempt to rescue his embattled presidency and an approval rating
sinking as fast as Ecuador's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the nation's economy shrank 7 percent and inflation topped 60
percent, the highest rate in Latin America. Ecuador also had the dubious
distinction of becoming the first nation to default on Brady bonds when it
missed a $44.5 million interest payment in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Without some sort of government intervention, many economists predicted that
speculation against the sucre would send Ecuador into hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who oppose dollarizing Latin American countries say they simply need
to address the fundamentals: reducing deficits, cutting back on bloated state
bureaucracies, tackling corruption and boosting competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   In the cases of both Mexico and Argentina, talk of adopting the dollar faded
as the speculative attacks on their currencies waned. But for Ecuador's
crumbling economy, there seem to be few choices left. The value sucre has
dropped 20 percent over the past week and nearly 67 percent over the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've made a good choice,'' said Omar Borla, an economist with Robert
Fleming in New York. ``But Ecuador has got their work cut out for them.''
</P>
<P>
	   By adopting the dollar, Ecuador can curb inflation and borrow money at
lower, U.S. interest rates. That should help shore up its battered image with
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   However, this means the country must give up control of its monetary policy
to the Fed, which acts only in the best interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say Mahaud's decision to establish the conversion rate at 25,000
sucres to the dollar will have devastating repercussions for the thousands of
Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was valued at
7,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   As in Mexico and Argentina, there has been opposition to the plan in
Ecuador. Authorities began preparing Saturday for nationwide protests by
indigenous groups in defense of the sucre, charging Mahuad's plan will
exacerbate poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent poll indicates the majority of Ecuadoreans are welcoming Mahuad's
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With the value of the sucre rising and falling, nobody could do anything.
Business was bad and there were no customers,'' said Pedro Torres, 37, a Quito
merchant. ``I am just happy I will finally be able to work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Guillermo Ruiz, a 27-year-old music student, said dollarization would
achieve the fondest wish of many of his compatriots: a stable currency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ideally, we're going to have money whose value is constant, one that
doesn't go up and down like the sucre has done the past year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional critics were upset with the way the president has acted
single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This decision was adopted in a way the country didn't want,'' said
Congress President Juan Jose Pons. ``Congress has part of the responsibility of
enacting the legislative changes to make dollarization work in this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Esteban Mafla, a 28-year-old waiter, was circumspect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one really understands this. Will we be paid in dollars?'' he asked.
``If so, then that's good because my salary will be consistent. But I would like
to have some more information.''

<HEADLINE> Thailand Ready for Privatization  </HEADLINE>
    By NINA SUEBSUKCHAROEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Emerging from its worst economic crisis in modern
times, Thailand appears ready to begin privatizing at least parts of major state
enterprises as urged by international lenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Improvements in the economy in recent months have put the government in a
better position to profit from selling stakes in the key sectors it controls --
energy, communications, transportation and water supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Privatization won't be a "distress sale" now, the World Bank's country
director, Jayashanker Shivakumar, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   But while raising cash for the government is one of the objectives,
Shivakumar said greater efficiency, lower costs and improved services are the
real reasons to sell off state businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Privatization of state-owned enterprises was a key condition of the $17.2
billion aid package put together by the International Monetary Fund to bail out
Thailand's economy after the crisis began in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
	   There is opposition among Thais to selling stakes in state enterprises, but
the government is pushing ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "The good news is that most state enterprises interested in privatization
have planned to finalize their privatization plans within the year 2000," said
Patareeya Benjapolchai, senior vice president at the Stock Exchange of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
	   Shivakumar said foreign investors are still cautious about the general state
of Thailand's economy. "Recovery is there but it is fragile," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Bank official said there is particular interest in the national
airline, Thai Airways International, from several foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial advisers to Thai Airways recommended Jan. 4 that the state sell
enough shares this year to reduce its stake from 93 percent to 70 percent. The
recommendation is being studied by a government committee, and any sale will
have to be approved by the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's telecommunications holding will also generate interest
among investors, Shivakumar said, while small concessions in the water supply
field already are being granted.
</P>
<P>
	   The government won an important victory in mid-November when the
Constitutional Court backed key legislation on privatizing state firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The parliamentary opposition had challenged an article that enables the
government to issue decrees to dissolve individual enterprises rather than seek
an act of Parliament for each one. The court upheld the decrees, noting
Parliament approved the legislation providing for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Resistance to privatization is strong. Labor unions and workers have
protested, fearing loss of jobs, while other critics say Thailand would be
selling its vital assets to cash-flush foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   About a third of the state-owned Bangchak oil refinery is to be sold soon,
after the government appeased opponents by agreeing to give Thai investors
priority. Sixteen percent of Bangchak shares will go to the Thai public and
another 16 percent to a strategic partner, Thai or foreign.
</P>
<P>
	   Protests also led the government to revise its plans for selling part of a
power plant under construction in the western province of Ratchaburi.
</P>
<P>
	   The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand had planned to raise $15.4
billion by selling shares to investors and reducing its stake in the plant to
around 30 percent. Now it will sell 40 percent to the Thai public and 10 percent
to 15 percent to the authority's employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Shivakumar argues private ownership will benefit Thais by opening up those
sectors now controlled by the state, noting that the rest of the economy has
long had capitalist-style competition.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe that one of the main objectives of privatization in Thailand is
to create more efficient and competitive enterprises, to bring in cutting-edge
knowledge, technology and better service and quality products to the consumers,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> US Soldier Charged in Kosovo Death  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VITINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An American soldier serving with the
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo was charged Sunday with sexually
assaulting and killing an 11-year-old ethnic Albanian girl, the U.S. military
announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi is accused of murder and indecent acts with a
child, Col. Ellis Golson told reporters. It is the first time a peacekeeper from
any country has been accused of such serious crimes since the 50,000-strong
NATO-led peacekeeping force entered the province on June 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident threatens relations between the Americans and Kosovo civilians
whom the peacekeepers were sent to protect. The peacekeepers were sent in after
the 78-day NATO bombing campaign forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
halt his bloody crackdown against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want them here to give us security if they are going to do
this,'' said Muharram Samakova, a neighbor of the girl's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi, 35, is a weapons squad leader assigned to A Company, 3rd Battalion,
405th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, N.C., Golson said. His
hometown was not immediately available. He was being held in detention at nearby
Camp Bondsteel pending transfer to the U.S. Army's confinement facility in
Mannheim, Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl's body was found late Thursday in the countryside near the city of
Vitina, 45 miles southeast of the provincial capital, Pristina, the army said. A
senior U.N. official who asked not to be named said Saturday that the girl
appeared to have been raped before she was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vitina, the slain girl's father, Hamdi Shabiu, showed reporters a photo
of his daughter's corpse that he said a U.S. officer brought him late Thursday,
when he was informed of her death. The girl's face appeared battered and
bruised, with a small cut on her forehead.
</P>
<P>
	   Shabiu said he last saw his daughter early Thursday when she left to go to
the market. She did not return. Neighbors in an apartment complex across the
street told him she had been killed in the basement of the building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They killed her 20 meters (yards) away from the house,'' he said. ``They
took her -- she was only 11 1-2 years old.''
</P>
<P>
	   Serbian state-run television, which regularly criticizes the NATO
peacekeeping mission, said Sunday evening that the case ``exposed an
unprecedented disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was too early to tell how the incident would affect relations between the
Americans and ethnic Albanians. Other similar cases -- like the rape of a
12-year-old Japanese girl by three U.S. servicemen in 1995, for example -- have
sparked rallies against the U.S. military presence.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. peacekeepers are widely seen as heroes by Kosovo Albanians because
of Washington's role in the NATO bombing campaign. On Sunday, groups of ethnic
Albanian children could be seen milling around U.S. military vehicles, laughing,
chatting and playing with the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   However, neighbors of the Shabiu family were outraged.
</P>
<P>
	   Hxsen Islami said local residents had filed complaints with the U.S. command
in Vitina about male soldiers searching young girls for weapons. He said the
complaints had gotten no response.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sorry, but they are touching the girls,'' Islami said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. military officials at the main headquarters at Camp Bondsteel said they
knew nothing about such complaints. Brig. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the head of
Kosovo's American forces, met Saturday night with community leaders in Vitina
and offered his condolences to the family.
</P>
<P>
	   The army said Sunday it will appoint an officer to conduct a pretrial
investigation. The investigator eventually will recommend whether the charges
should be referred to a court martial. Ronghi could be tried before a military
judge or a panel of officers.

<HEADLINE> Christian Democrats Head Vows Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The leader of Germany's embattled conservatives pleaded with
the party to back him Sunday despite his growing entanglement in a campaign
funding scandal that has spread beyond former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble insisted in a newspaper article that he would not resign
as the Christian Democrats' chairman even though he accepted $52,000 from a
businessman who is a key figure in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   But Schaeuble's weakened position was underlined by the angry mood when he
spoke at a weekend rally in northern Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Party members shouted, ``Resignation'' and ``We want to know the truth,'' at
the Saturday night meeting in Kiel, which launched the party's campaign for Feb.
27 state elections in Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet he vowed to fight on, writing in a Sunday newspaper that ``I will do
everything within my power and strength to lead the Christian Democratic Union
out of this difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``For that, I need the help and solidarity of everyone in the CDU,'' he said
in Welt am Sonntag.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble has been widely condemned for disclosing a 1994 donation by
businessman Karlheinz Schreiber only last week -- more than a month after
parliament began an inquiry into whether donations influenced decisions during
Kohl's 16 years in power.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDU leader conceded the money was wrongly reported, but denied
wrongdoing, blaming a former party treasurer instead.
</P>
<P>
	   However, two newsweeklies raised questions about parts of Schaeuble's story
over the weekend, including the exact timing of the cash handover and whether
Schaeuble received the money personally, as he claims, or through an
intermediary.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble was Kohl's hand-picked successor as party leader after the
chancellor lost 1998 elections after 16 years in power. Polls last week showed
Germans split about whether he should quit.
</P>
<P>
	   Fallout from the scandal has spread to several state branches of the
conservatives, including Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
	   A local party leader, Johann Wadephul, has written to Kohl asking he help
clear up what happened to a donation the national party organization channeled
to the former state party chief in 1997, the Focus newsweekly reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Even more damaging were irregularities by the Christian Democrats in Hesse,
where a former party leader revealed last week that the state branch transferred
$6.8 million to its coffers from a foreign account -- reportedly in Switzerland
-- between 1989 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount involved was the biggest yet in the scandal, and Schaeuble spoke
of a ``catastrophe'' Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Local Social Democrats and Greens said Sunday they would seek a confidence
vote against Hesse governor Roland Koch, who has said he won't resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Kohl has canceled an appearance at a Berlin award ceremony
because of his involvement in a campaign funding scandal, a newspaper said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Plans had called for Kohl to receive the $15,000 Adolph Bentinck Prize from
Jacques Delors, former head of the European Union's executive Commission, at a
gala attended by other former statesmen, Bild am Sonntag said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Participating in this event seemed rather inappropriate at the present
time,'' the paper quoted Kohl's spokesman Michael Roik as saying.

<HEADLINE> Museum To Show M.L. King Evidence  </HEADLINE>
   By WOODY BAIRD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Evidence pointing to James Earl Ray as Martin Luther
King Jr.'s killer, including Ray's rifle, is heading for its first public
display at the museum on the site of the civil rights leader's murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The exhibit will mention a recent civil court verdict that the King family
says supports their belief that Ray was an unknowing fall guy in a murder
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   But the government evidence against Ray -- much of which has been locked
away for more than three decades -- is expected to dominate the exhibit at the
National Civil Rights Museum, which opened in 1991 at the old Lorraine Motel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are not going to be theories about who killed Martin Luther King
presented. What we will present is pieces of evidence that will help people
evaluate the various theories,'' said Clayborne Carson, a Stanford University
history professor working on the project.
</P>
<P>
	   King was shot on the motel's second-floor balcony on April 4, 1968. He was
in Memphis to help lead a garbage workers strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday is the national holiday in his honor.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the display of evidence, visitors will get to see the view of
the murder scene from the flop house from which Ray admitted firing the fatal
shot. The flop house, across a small side street, also is to become part of the
museum.
</P>
<P>
	   The state plans to give the museum the physical evidence and investigative
reports that it would have used against Ray had he gone to trial. He died in
prison in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The material is expected to go on display by next year, after the Justice
Department finishes a new, limited investigation into the murder. Information on
that investigation also will be part of the museum exhibit.
</P>
<P>
	   State prosecutors and a congressional committee have concluded Ray was the
killer, though he may have had help from a small group of conspirators. His
confession was upheld eight times by state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, a civil court jury hearing a wrongful death suit filed by the
Kings against a former Memphis restaurant owner concluded that King was the
victim of a murder conspiracy involving government agents and other
conspirators. Critics described the trial as a hodgepodge of vague conspiracy
claims and unsupported testimony.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Criticizes Burundi Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG NELSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Nelson Mandela took his first step on Sunday into
the troubled Burundi peace talks, accusing negotiators of dawdling while
innocent men, women and children are slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
	   The former South African president and Nobel Peace Prize winner was
appointed by regional leaders in December to mediate the talks, which in 18
months have made little progress toward ending a six-year war between Hutu
rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting has killed more than 200,000 people, most of them civilians, in
the small Central African nation.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first visit as mediator to the talks in this northern Tanzanian town,
Mandela prodded negotiators to end divisiveness and exclusion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the armed groups do not respect what we've decided, then we will not
achieve a breakthrough. The process must include everybody who can contribute to
a solution,'' the 81-year-old Mandela told representatives of Burundi's
Tutsi-controlled government, the National Assembly and 16 opposition and
pro-government factions participating in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hutu rebel Forces for the Defense of Democracy and the National
Liberation Forces have refused to take part in the negotiations. The FDD has
called instead for direct talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority of Burundi's 6.5 million people are Hutu, but Tutsis have
dominated the government, the military and the economy since independence from
Belgium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela became mediator for the peace talks after former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere died last year.
</P>
<P>
	   His gait slow but his voice resonant and firm, the 81-year-old Mandela
scolded the negotiators for ``inflexibility'' while the fighting in Burundi
raged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The daily slaughter of men, women and children is an indictment of every
one of you ... The lack of urgency is an indictment of every one of you,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the upbraiding, Mandela received a standing ovation for his
90-minute speech and uniformly enthusiastic praise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The main feeling I have is that he is really committed to helping Burundi
get rid of this crisis and it's wonderful,'' said Ambroise Niyonsaba, the
Burundian government's representative to the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Mandela met representatives of donor nations and requested $2.5
million to fund the talks. The European Union has already contributed $5.5
million and the United States $500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela set no deadline on Sunday for completion of an agreement, but
pressure is building to reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Burundi's army has herded more than 350,000, mainly Hutu, civilians into 58
camps near the capital Bujumbura. It hopes to clear the countryside of everyone
but Hutu insurgents, which it can then pursue freely.
</P>
<P>
	   But the camps, rife with cholera, dysentery and malnutrition, also threaten
to compound resentment against the government and undermine any political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, increases in the price of oil and beer on Jan. 1 have put added
strain on mostly impoverished Burundians, already beleaguered after three years
of regional economic sanctions that ended last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela was to board a plane late Sunday for New York, where he is scheduled
to address the U.N. Security Council on the deteriorating situation in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> German Media Firm Wants More Music  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BERLIN (AP) -- German media giant Bertelsmann AG said Sunday it wants to
become the world's largest music company, but a spokesman refused comment on a
report that it may seek to buy Sony Music or EMI Group.
</P>
<P>
	   The news weekly Der Spiegel reported over the weekend that Bertelsmann was
interested in buying one of the companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "We confirm that we are going to be No. 1 in the music business, but we
don't give any details about how we will achieve this," Bertelsmann spokesman
Oliver Herrgesell said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   An acquisition is one way that Bertelsmann Music Group could grow, but not
the only one, he said. Bertelsmann Music Group now ranks about fourth in the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Der Spiegel said Bertelsmann plans the purchase of a large music company
over the coming months. It said Sony Music and EMI are at the top of the list of
targets.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper quoted Bertelsmann chief executive Thomas Middelhoff as
saying: "I intend to become No. 1 in the music business this year."

<HEADLINE> Year Later, No Lesbian Wedding Flap  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif.(AP) -- A lesbian couple who survived fears of clerical
retribution celebrated their first anniversary in a ceremony that was part
down-home revival, part joyous homecoming and part uncertain look to the future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We asked people who came last year to come back. This time, it is really
just a party, a way of saying, 'We're still here,''' said the Rev. Donald Fado
of St. Mark's United Methodist Church of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 people on Saturday honored Ellie Charlton, 64, and Jeanne Barnett,
69, who were married last year in ceremonies led by Fado. The women, both church
leaders, were supported by dozens of members of the Methodist clergy.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple came forward after Fado, who is married and has four children,
told his congregation that he wanted to protest church policy by publicly
blessing a same-sex union. The Methodist Judicial Council had previously ruled
that a minister could be removed for violating the ban on homosexual weddings.
</P>
<P>
	   Fado, who could face a church trial, so far has not been disciplined, and
the two women remain church leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, 1,500 people attended the wedding while protesters marched
outside. But this weekend, the atmosphere was far more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
	   Folding chairs were scattered across the floor; bunting, posters and cards
signed by well-wishers covered the walls; and spectators were treated to
thunderous organ music and a choir.
</P>
<P>
	   No one protested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're close friends with Jeanne and Ellie, and we came to express our
solidarity and love,'' said Jim Strathdee of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnett, a retired state unemployment administrator and lay leader of the
Methodists' Nevada-California Conference, and Charlton, a divorced
great-grandmother and trustee of the conference, sat quietly with family members
and friends, rising to join in the singing or to hug friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlton spoke briefly, thanking the attendees and Fado for ``setting an
example for our gay community.'' Her daughter and granddaughter jointly recited
a poem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an honor to call you 'grandma,''' said Bobbie Charlton.
</P>
<P>
	   Fado passed the hat and raised $6,700, some of which will be given to a
campaign to defeat Proposition 22 on the March 7 ballot. The initiative would
ban gay marriages in California.
</P>
<P>
	   The January 1999 wedding prompted a fact-finding review by a church
committee scheduled to meet next month. The committee is expected to submit its
findings to the General Conference of the United Methodist Church, which meets
in Cleveland in May.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference is the church's international governing body. About 600
conferees from the United States and overseas are expected to attend the event,
which is held once every four years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rev. Fado is not following our book of discipline. We are not out of line;
he is out of line. The discipline now says that no pastor shall have a same-sex
covenant,'' said Rev. John Sheppard II of the United Methodist Church of Yuba
City, about 40 miles north of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard said Fado has support from the majority of ministers in the
California-Nevada Conference. However, the sentiment is sharply opposed to
same-sex unions internationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-eight members of the Methodist clergy listed themselves as
co-officiants of the wedding, and never before have so many ministers faced the
possibility of a charge of disobedience. In the past, two Methodist ministers
have been disciplined for officiating at same-sex weddings.
</P>
<P>
	   Fado said the issue of same-sex marriage is critical to many church members
and needs to be addressed by the church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are a healthier church if we include different cultural perspectives,
if we offer different latitudes for the expressions of the group,'' he said.
``We may not think alike but we can love alike.''

<HEADLINE> BMW, VW Talk About Rover Losses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BERLIN (AP) -- German automaker BMW is in cooperation talks with rival
Volkswagen because of big losses last year at BMW's Rover unit in Britain, a
magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Rover had a 1999 pretax loss of 2.5 billion marks ($1.3 billion), up from
about 1.9 billion marks ($989 million) the year before, according to the weekend
report by Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
	   Rover's losses have prompted BMW chief Joachim Milberg to discuss
cooperation possibilities with VW boss Ferdinand Piech, the report said. BMW and
VW officials were not available Sunday for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine said VW could supply the platform for BMW's next Polo model in
a move that would enable Rover to develop successors to its 25 and 45 models
more cheaply and quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   In return, VW could receive the Rolls-Royce brand rights owned by BMW, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 loss at Rover resulted partly from a rise in the value of the pound
against the mark in the second half of the year and from costs linked to
greater-than-expected job cuts, Der Spiegel said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Seeks Support in Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Growing impatient with 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's extended
U.S. stay, Cuba's foreign minister left for Europe on Sunday to seek support for
the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is inconceivable and unacceptable that this small child remains
kidnapped,'' Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told Cuba's Prensa Latina news
service before leaving. He was to visit Italy, San Marino, France, Denmark and
Russia and also meet with Vatican and Spanish officials before returning to
Cuban on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Cuba's strategy back home, ``Our mobilizations will continue,'' Perez
Roque said, according to the news agency. ``No one should make the mistake to
think that we are going to get tired.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were no mass demonstrations scheduled for Sunday. But over the
weekend, Fidel Castro's communist government appeared to be gearing up for more
and larger protests in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
	   Several dozen workers wearing T-shirts emblazoned with Elian's portrait
mixed and poured cement for a new concrete plaza outside the U.S. Interests
Section, where many of the rallies to demand Elian's repatriation have been
held.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the largest protests in recent weeks were held Friday and Saturday.
In the first demonstration, more than 100,000 Cuban mothers marched outside the
American mission. On Saturday, more than 150,000 protesters held an angry
political rally on the site where Castro defined the Cuban revolution as
socialist almost four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to inner tube off the coat of Florida on Nov. 25
after his mother, stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S.
shores. Since then he has been the subject of a fierce international custody
battle between his father, who is in Cuba, and his paternal great-uncle, who has
temporary custody of the boy in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled that the child should
be reunited with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. But Elian's Miami relatives
and others who oppose Elian's return to Cuba have launched a series of legal
moves aimed at delaying or stopping his repatriation, and Cuba has become
increasingly fed up with delays in the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   Both President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno supported the INS
decision, but Cuban officials complain that American officials have done nothing
to enforce the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives are expected to take their case to federal court in
Miami this week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Biomedical Funding  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose $1 billion more for
biomedical research and seek to remove congressional restrictions delaying an
additional $4.3 billion in previously approved research money, a top White House
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, also said the president will
accelerate efforts this week to reach a compromise with pharmaceutical companies
on a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   The president will propose $19 billion for the National Institutes of Health
in his fiscal 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're at the cusp, I think, of breakthroughs in medical technology,''
Podesta said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   A statement released later Sunday by the White House said the increase, if
approved, would raise the NIH budget to twice what it was when Clinton took
office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said the increase would provide ``new funding for research on
every major disease,'' including AIDS, cancer, heart disease, diabetes and
Alzheimer's. It will continue work on decoding the human genome and help turn
research into real-world practice.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, a new $20 million Center for Research on Minority Health would
be established to examine why some racial and ethnic minorities experience high
infant mortality rates, low rates of childhood immunization and greater
incidence of many diseases, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the prescription drug issue, Podesta said he would meet Thursday with
representatives of the drug industry to explore its offer for compromise on
Medicare prescriptions. Clinton plans to address the issue in his State of the
Union speech Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope to push forward with a comprehensive solution to the Medicare
problem, to deal with the baby boom generation,'' Podesta said. ``Front and
center in that will be a prescription drug benefit, which we think the American
people want and the American people need.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the industry ran a television ad campaign sharply critical of the
administration's proposal, which bogged down on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting, Podesta said, will be ``to see if we can make some progress on
this and see if we can find some common ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   The drug companies continue to support improved prescription coverage for
the elderly through the private sector. Clinton has proposed having a Medicare
drug benefit run by the government by contracting with companies used by many
private health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta outlined several other White House legislative priorities as
Congress prepares to return to the Capitol later this month. They include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Gun control initiatives, including money in the fiscal 2001 budget to
develop a ``smart gun'' that only the weapon's owner would be able to use and
money for law enforcement to crack down on a small percentage of gun dealers who
sell large numbers of firearms used in crimes.

<HEADLINE> Blair Looking Forward to New Baby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Now that he's over the shock, Prime Minister Tony Blair said
Sunday he's looking forward to the arrival of a new baby -- and he's even ready
to change diapers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was wholly unexpected. I'm 46, she's 45 -- it's not quite what you
expect,'' Blair said, looking slightly embarrassed when talk turned from
politics to the baby during a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The baby will be the fourth child for Blair and his wife, Cherie. They have
two sons, Euan and Nicholas, ages 15 and 14, and an 11-year-old daughter,
Kathryn.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair said he and his wife don't know the baby's sex; they turned down the
chance of finding out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm really now looking forward to it. It's just at the time I got quite a
shock,'' said Blair.
</P>
<P>
	   On changing diapers, Blair replied: ``I did that last time. I suppose I'll
do it again.''

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Lucy Liu never would have predicted as a girl that she
would make People magazine's list of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't have the whole blond flipped hair or the curves," she says in the

	   Liu, who plays the saucy Ling Woo on "Ally McBeal," says acting is one of
several artistic interests. Her photography has been exhibited in galleries in
Los Angeles and New York. And she shares a passion for the accordion with
co-star Greg Germann.

    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wayne Newton plans to return to Las Vegas in style this
month with a police motorcade escorting his $360,000 Rolls-Royce to the Stardust
Resort.
</P>
<P>
	   Newton on Saturday announced a 40 weeks-a-year, decade-long contract with
Boyd Gaming Corp., owners of the Stardust Resort and Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am thrilled to begin what I believe will be the most exciting, productive

multimillion dollar deal one of the biggest in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
	   To celebrate the event, the entertainer will be on hand Thursday to flip the

    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jena Malone, a 15-year-old actress who appeared in
"Contact" and "Stepmom," won legal emancipation from her mother after accusing
the woman of squandering Ms. Malone's earnings, her attorney said.
</P>
<P>
	   The actress is a "very mature young girl" who has been living on her own for
some time, with homes in Los Angeles and New York, said attorney Neil Olsen.

<P>
	   Ms. Malone contended that her mother, Debbie Malone, "squandered" her
earnings through "excessive spending and mismanagement," according to court
papers.

	   On Friday, she won a court order barring her mother from interfering with
her professional engagements.

<HEADLINE> Union Heads Arrested in India  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCKNOW, India (AP) -- Police arrested 1,800 engineers and four trade union
leaders after a strike produced power outages and water shortages in India's
most populous state, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   With four of the six power plants stopping power generation, many parts of
the sprawling northern Uttar Pradesh state were plunged into darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   State authorities met some of the shortfall by obtaining supply from power
plants run by the federal government, the officials said. The state has a
population of more than 140 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers struck on Saturday to protest the government's plan to privatize
electricity distribution and reorganize the Uttar Pradesh State Electricity
Board, which runs the power plants in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The state government declared the strike illegal and arrested four trade
union leaders and 1,800 engineers, hoping that a crackdown would break the
strike. Many union leaders evaded arrest by leaving their places of work.
</P>
<P>
	   The government also invoked the National Security Act and threatened
striking workers with dismissal if they didn't return to work by Monday, the
Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are going to publish a notice in the newspapers tomorrow to appeal to
the striking employees to return to their duties during the next 24 hours, and
if they do not, they would be treated as dismissed,'' said Atul Chaturvedi, the
energy secretary of Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
	   The worst hit was the agriculture sector, which consumes nearly 26 percent
of 6,000 megawatts generated daily by the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are trying to privatize the distribution of electricity in the state,''
Power Minister Naresh Agarwal said in Lucknow, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Corruption is rampant in the state, where millions of people get illegal
electricity connections by bribing the workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The state government declared the strike illegal and arrested four trade
union leaders, hoping that a crackdown would break the strike. Many union
leaders evaded arrest by leaving their places of work.
</P>
<P>
	   The state electricity board reported a loss of more than $188 million in the
past five years, mainly through poor collection of electricity bills and meeting
a massive wage bill for 95,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Shailendra Dubey, a spokesman for the striking state electricity workers,
said: ``We shall not withdraw from the strike until the government takes back
its decision to reorganize the state electricity board.''

<HEADLINE> Birmingham Steel Cuts 40 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Birmingham Steel laid off 40 of its headquarters
employees -- 30 percent of its front-office workers -- as the company continues
cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel bad because these are people's lives," said John Correnti, chief
executive officer. "No one got laid off because they didn't do a good job. We
just can't afford any niceties anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   The layoffs came on Thursday, little more than a month after Correnti took
over as CEO after a successful proxy fight. At the time, Correnti said the job
cuts were likely.
</P>
<P>
	   The laid-off workers got severance equal to a week's pay for every year of
service, Correnti said.
</P>
<P>
	   Birmingham Steel has about $800 million in debt, he said, and needs
concessions from banks and bondholders to regain its financial footing. He said
he hoped new loan agreements and investment partners will emerge in coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The company operates plants employing about 2,000 people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Birmingham Steel lost $224 million, and its stock has slid to
about $10 from its 1994 price of about $30 per share. The decline prompted the
proxy battle initiated by former CEO Jim Todd.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Peter Freistadt, who worked as a filmmaker and an actor in
his native Czechoslovakia and in Israel, has died in Tel Aviv from a long-term
illness. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel television and the Yediot Ahronot daily reported that he died Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Freistadt was born in Czechoslovakia and studied film there. He survived the
Nazi occupation and fled the Communist regime in 1964. He moved to Israel in
1964 where he later became well-known for the epic movies he directed, including
``Motive to Kill'' and ``Sabina and Her Men,'' both in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   He produced dozens of films in cooperation with Czech and Israeli television
networks about Jewish figures, including Franz Kafka. He acted in some of the
major Israeli films of the 1980s, including the Palestinian-Israeli prison
drama, ``Beyond the Walls'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
	   Freistadt helped found Israeli state-owned television and served on the
boards of movie, television and theater associations in the country. He also
served as the Israeli cultural attache in Prague.
</P>
<P>
	   Freistadt was to be buried on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Chileans Vote for President  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chileans went to the polls Sunday to select their
next president, with both the rightist and moderate socialist candidates
promising to hasten the nation's recovery from its worst recession in more than
15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Joaquin Lavin and socialist Ricardo Lagos, both touting similar
economic programs, battled to a virtual draw in the first-round election in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout appeared heavy as Chileans trekked to the polls under sunny skies
across this South American nation of 15 million people. Some 8 million were
registered to vote. Polls closed with no reports of problems in the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic issues dominated the campaign as voters decided between Lavin, 46,
of the right-wing Alliance for Chile, and Lagos, 61, of the Concertacion -- a
center-left coalition that has governed Chile since democracy's return a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, the candidates sought to outdo each other with similar promises
to fight rising street crime, aid strapped farmers, and create hundreds of
thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   As he cast his vote at a school in this capital, Lavin described the runoff
as a ``vote-by-vote fight'' and predicted ``a very tight victory'' for himself.
</P>
<P>
	   He was drowned out by a crush of supporters who shouted, ``We feel it! We
feel it! Lavin is our president!''
</P>
<P>
	   Also predicting a triumph, Lagos voted under similar circumstances at
another Santiago school, calling the election ``a party for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he added, ``The party ends tonight and tomorrow, everybody to work to
build a better Chile for all.''
</P>
<P>
	   The winner will be inaugurated March 11 for a six-year term, succeeding
Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat who was constitutionally barred from
re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost boyish looking at 46, Lavin is a successful two-term mayor of Las
Condes, Santiago's swankiest suburb. He is acclaimed for putting more police on
that suburb's streets and ending traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin was a strong supporter of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 1973-90 military
regime. He worked as a junior economist at the Planning Ministry under the
Pinochet and has written several books praising his regime.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, however, Lavin tried to distance himself from the
former dictator, saying Pinochet's rule is a thing of the past, and that it was
now time to look to the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos, a former Pinochet opponent, has attracted attention by promising
unemployment insurance in a country seeking to improve its social safety net.
</P>
<P>
	   An academic for many years, with a Ph.D. in economics from Duke University,
Lagos emerged as a leading figure in the fight against Pinochet in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   After leftist guerrillas made an attempt on Pinochet's life in 1986, Lagos
was one of several leftists arrested by state security agents in a crackdown.
Although he had nothing to do with that attempt, Lagos spent several days in
jail, coming out to work full time for the restoration of democratic rule. He
remains a hero for Pinochet foes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been detained in Britain since October 1998 on a warrant from a
Spanish judge who wants the general to stand trial for alleged human rights
abuses during his iron rule.
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw said Tuesday that a panel of doctors
concluded Pinochet is too ill to face trial, and that he felt inclined to send
the former dictator home.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- T.N. Kaul, former diplomat and a key architect of
India's peace agreements with China, Pakistan and the former Soviet Union, died
in his cottage in northern India Sunday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaul, who is survived by a son and a daughter, collapsed in his cottage in
Himachal Pradesh and was rushed to a hospital, where he died, the United News of
India reported. The news agency gave no details of the illness that caused his
death.
</P>
<P>
	   A member of the Indian Civil Service, Kaul helped mold India's foreign
policy in the immediate aftermath of independence from British colonial rule in
1947. He co-authored the Panchsheel Agreement between India and China in the
1950s, preparing the groundwork for friendship between the world's two most
populous nations.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, Kaul assisted Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in formulating the
Shimla Agreement with neighboring Pakistan in which both countries agreed to
resolve their disputes through bilateral dialogue.
</P>
<P>
	   He also helped prepare the Indo-Soviet Friendship Treaty and was involved in
peace initiatives with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaul served as India's ambassador to Moscow twice and also as ambassador to
the United States.

<HEADLINE> 'Happy Birthday' sung to cardinal by 3,000 at St. Pat's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The organ music surged and the crowd of 3,000
worshippers lifted their voices Sunday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
<P>
	   But this time the familiar melody and lyrics echoing off the stone walls
came not from a religious hymn, but from "Happy Birthday," as Cardinal John
O'Connor was saluted by his flock the day after turning 80.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, this is wonderful, but does anybody have a job for me?" the cardinal
quipped after the singing and a standing ovation ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Cardinals lose their voting power for new popes once they turn 80, and Pope
John Paul II is expected to name a replacement for O'Connor soon. O'Connor is
also in frail health, unable to stand for long periods as he slowly recovers
from a brain tumor that was removed in August.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this time when your illness makes new demands upon your spiritual and
physical resources, I pray that you will press forward, with faith and hope,"
the pope said in a letter read during the Sunday service.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, the Vatican announces new appointments for U.S. posts on
Tuesdays, and O'Connor's successor could be named as early as this week. Towards
the end of Sunday's service, which included numerous tributes to the cardinal
and stretched on for nearly two hours, O'Connor said: "It's almost Tuesday - we
can't go on much longer."
</P>
<P>
	   But the cardinal's spokesman Joe Zwilling noted that the announcement may
not be made that soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "It might happen six months from now," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling said O'Connor "has left the decision of his future entirely in the
hands of Pope John Paul II."
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling acknowledged that O'Connor has a role in making a recommendation
about his successor, but that the final decision is made by the pope after
consultations with laity, priests and other officials on the needs of the
diocese.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday night, the cardinal attended a gala birthday party at the
Waldorf-Astoria in his honor which raised over $5 million for Catholic education
and other charities. The 1,500 guests included several of the cardinal's
potential replacements, including Edwin O'Brien, archbishop to the U.S.
military; Buffalo's Bishop Henry Mansell, a former top aide to O'Connor; and
Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis, who is close to the pope.
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling said O'Connor "was very pleased with the reception he got last
night. He feels very honored and it meant a lot to him to have the people stand
and sing 'Happy Birthday' to him."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor is the spiritual leader of 2.4 million Catholics in Manhattan,
Staten Island, the Bronx and seven upstate counties. Forty percent of the
cardinal's flock is Hispanic, with Catholics of Italian and Irish heritage the
next largest groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's Mass at St. Patrick's included representatives from all 413
parishes and reflected their diversity, with a reading in Spanish and speakers
that included an Asian woman and a black priest.
</P>
<P>
	   Zwilling said that "when and if the holy father accepts his retirement,"
O'Connor would "like to visit with people in parishes, celebrate Mass with them,
and go and do a lot of the things the administrative responsibilities of the
archdiocese of New York have prevented him from doing."
</P>
<P>
	   The service at St. Patrick's was briefly disrupted by two men who stood and
began shouting before being escorted out of the church.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Borelli, 58, of Aurora, Colo., and Brian Byrnes, 41, of Colorado
Springs, Colo., were later charged with disrupting a religious service, said
Detective Vincent Gravelli, a police spokesman. "They were apparently blurting
out verses from the Bible," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Calls Tax Plan 'Realistic'  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush says his tax-cut plan is more
realistic than those offered by his Republican presidential rivals because it
would leave less of the budget surplus available to tempt Congress into spending
it. Sen. John McCain countered that Bush's priorities for the projected surplus
are all wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview aired Sunday on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Bush said his
five-year, $483 billion tax-relief proposal -- which would consume most of the
anticipated surplus not already earmarked for Social Security -- would help curb
bigger government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The surest way to make sure the budgets aren't bloated is to give the
people their money back,'' Bush said in the taped interview.
</P>
<P>
	   A five-year, $237 billion tax cut offered by McCain, R-Ariz., would reserve
about $729 billion to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent as the baby boom
generation retires. But Bush said his own plan is ``more realistic'' because it
doesn't depend on Congress to safeguard that money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He trusts money left in Washington, D.C., will be properly spent,'' Bush
said of his rival. ``I happen to think it's going to be spent on bigger
government and more programs.''
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' argued that Bush's tax
cut is too skewed toward the wealthy and does little to protect the big
government retirement programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm saying it's a matter of priorities,'' McCain said Sunday, a day after
he and the Texas governor sparred over taxes during a debate in Iowa. ``I'm
saying we have obligations, and I'm saying it's conservative to make sure that
we make the promises hold that we made in the form of Social Security, Medicare,
and not lay a huge debt down on future generations of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, meanwhile, dismissed Bush and McCain as the ``timid twins'' on
tax cuts and touted his proposal for a flat tax and an end to the federal tax
code as being far bolder than anything the governor and senator have advanced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I get to the heart of the problem: get rid of the code, don't tinker
around the edges,'' Forbes said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes also began airing a television commercial Sunday in Iowa, site of the
Jan. 24 caucuses that open the presidential nominating season. The ad stresses
character and repeats the millionaire publisher's contention that he isn't
beholden to any special interests. ``He'll keep his word,'' the announcer says.
``Character matters, a lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new ad is a follow-up to one running in Iowa and New Hampshire that
accuses Bush of breaking his no-tax pledge as governor. A Forbes aide said
Sunday that the ad is meant to draw contrasts between Forbes and Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In other issues Sunday:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bush, McCain and Forbes agreed that South Carolina voters should
determine whether the Confederate flag continues to fly atop its state capitol
and that it should not be an issue for the presidential campaign. ``That's a
legitimate debate that will be decided by the people of South Carolina,'' said
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bush said if he were in office now he would withhold International
Monetary Fund aid and Export-Import Bank loans from Russia until interim
president Vladimir Putin halted bombing in Chechnya that hits ``innocent women
and children.'' But that would not extend to U.S. aid intended to dismantle
nuclear weapons. ``I think that's a different issue as far as I'm concerned,''
he said. McCain also has said he would withhold such funding from Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   -- McCain said he was concerned about industry mergers and that the Senate
Commerce Committee he chairs will hold hearings on the proposed union of America
Online and Time Warner. ``You reach a point at some time where it's not good for
the consumer and it stifles competition.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Forbes rejected criticism that his TV ads upbraiding Bush over a Texas
tax-cut pledge will hurt the GOP in the November election. ``Do we want an
honest, vigorous debate, or do we want to pretend there are no differences
between the candidates?'' Forbes said. ``This is not going to be a coronation.
This is going to be a real contest.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- When he was mayor of a Santiago suburb, Joaquin
Lavin reined in a growing street gang problem by reaching a deal with their
leader -- at a city hall financed hot-dog party.
</P>
<P>
	   And at a time of worsening smog in this gritty capital, the mayor of Las
Condes hired an airplane to seed the clouds to induce rain, cleaning the air. He
also helped eased traffic congestion in his community.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin earned a reputation as a politician who gets things done.
</P>
<P>
	   And in his race for president, the 46-year-old economist is credited with
having given Chile's political right a new, more amicable face.
</P>
<P>
	   Formerly a strong supporter of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Lavin campaigned
throughout the country in a style unknown for the right, even meeting with
relatives of victims of repression under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
	   Saying he wanted to stress his commitment to the poor, he stayed several
nights during his campaign at the modest homes of Chileans living in the slums
that ring the largest cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Pinochet, Lavin worked as a junior economist at the Planning Ministry.
He has also written several books praising the military's 1973-90 regime.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, however, Lavin tried to distance himself from the
former dictator, saying Pinochet's rule is a thing of the past, and that it was
now time to look to the future. He has said Pinochet should be tried in Chile
for human rights violations if a judge so decides.

<HEADLINE> Arkan's Crimes Testimony Was Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By MISHA SAVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The gangland-style slaying of Serbia's most
notorious paramilitary leader was aimed at silencing a man who could tie key
figures in President Slobodan Milosevic's government with Balkan war crimes,
opposition members claimed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeljko Raznatovic, a hero to radical Serb nationalists and symbol of terror
to thousands of non-Serbs in the former Yugoslavia, was gunned down Saturday in
a plush Belgrade hotel as he sat in a sectioned-off part of the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   One source said Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was shot in the eye. Two
of his bodyguards were also killed in the hail of bullets, and the assailants
escaped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Someone was making sure that one of the key people who knew too much
should not live too long,'' said Mirza Hajric, adviser to Muslim member of the
Bosnian presidency, Alija Izetbegovic. ``Unfortunately, he missed an opportunity
to testify against President Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan, 47, had been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in The
Hague for atrocities committed by his ``Tigers'' militia during secessionist
wars in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan's Tigers were purportedly organized in the early 1990s by Milosevic's
secret police to fight alongside government troops in Bosnia and Croatia. That
enabled Milosevic's government to try to disassociate itself from the ethnic
cleansing and other atrocities committed during those conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgrade police issued no statement about the killing, and witnesses gave
conflicting reports about whether one or more assailants were involved.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Arkan was often seen in the company of senior police and security
officials. The links between Arkan and the government led to speculation among
Serbian opposition figures and others that the killing was meant to silence
Arkan.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic and several other key government figures were indicted by The
Hague court last year. Two months ago, reports in the independent Belgrade media
claimed Arkan was considering fleeing to the West. The reports, denied by
Arkan's lawyer, also said he was trying to cut a back-room deal with the war
crimes tribunal to testify against Milosevic in exchange for immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   And Arkan's killing was not unprecedented: More than a dozen prominent
journalists, police, politicians and underworld figures have been victims of
unsolved murders in Belgrade since 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A number of people who had a prominent role in the past wars are vanishing
in professionally organized murders,'' said opposition politician Zarko Korac.
</P>
<P>
	   While independent media covered the murder as its top story, official
newspapers and broadcasters barely mentioned the slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   The main state-run newspaper, Politika, published its report on page 20 of
its Sunday edition. State-run television reported the death at the end of its
late Saturday newscast -- just before the weather report.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, international officials expressed regret that Arkan would never
be called to account for his actions in Balkan wars before a court of law.
Jacques Klein, the chief U.N. representative in Bosnia, called Arkan a
``psychopathic mass murderer.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sad part of all of this is that he was not actually brought to
justice, that he was not brought to The Hague,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United States takes ``no
satisfaction'' in Arkan's death and ``would have wanted him to stand trial in
The Hague for his crimes.''
</P>
<P>
	   But in Belgrade, some shed tears for Arkan, who had won popularity by
relentlessly whipping up Serb nationalism. A crowd swarmed to the hospital where
an ambulance brought Arkan after the shooting, and men and women cried as they
were told the man known as ``babyface killer'' was dead.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Bosnian and Croatian wars, Arkan settled in Belgrade and married a
folk singer with whom he had two children. He is also survived by seven other
children from his previous marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan's funeral was scheduled for Wednesday. His body will lie in state
beginning Tuesday at the Serbian Unity Party headquarters in the plush Dedinje
district in Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> 'Next Friday' Is a Big Hit Now  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- "Next Friday," starring Ice Cube as an inner-city man
hiding out from a neighborhood brawler, bullied its way to a top debut at the
weekend box office, according to industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The sequel to the 1995 film "Friday" took in $14.5 million Friday through
Sunday. The movie has grossed $19.1 million since opening Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little," the No. 1 movie three of the last four weekends, dropped to
second place with $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Hurricane," which opened in limited release in late December, expanded
to 1,454 theaters Friday and came in at No. 3 for the weekend with $9.1 million.
The movie stars Denzel Washington in the prison saga of boxer Rubin "Hurricane"
Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   "Girl, Interrupted," starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie as mental
patients, also broke out of limited release and grabbed fourth place with $8.2
million in 1,902 theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernova," a sci-fi adventure featuring James Spader and Angela Bassett,
fizzled with $5.7 million in 2,280 theaters its opening weekend, debuting in
eighth place.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in just 1,103 theaters, "Next Friday" averaged an impressive $13,146
a screen, compared with $6,259 for "The Hurricane" and $4,311 for "Girl,
Interrupted."
</P>
<P>
	   Like last year's "Austin Powers" sequel, "Next Friday" traded off the first
film's video success.
</P>
<P>
	   The first "Friday" movie did a modest $27 million at theaters but went on to
become a video hit. "Next Friday" already has done about two-thirds of that
box-office business and grossed twice its production budget in just five days.
</P>
<P>
	   With strong appeal to black movie-goers, the film also benefitted from its
release during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, when movie-going is
up because many people have Monday off.
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Friday" drew well among 18-to-25-year-old white crowds, too, said
David Tuckerman, head of distribution for New Line, which released the movie.
Other recent hits with black casts, such as "The Best Man," have had similar
crossover appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "The movie played well in white areas. We were sold out all over the place,"
Tuckerman said. "It appeals to all audiences. It just feels like the country is
maturing about that."
</P>
<P>
	   In "Next Friday," Ice Cube has another battle with the bully from the first
movie, who gets out of prison bent on revenge. The comedy offered some frivolous
fare in a movie market crowded with Oscar contenders.
</P>
<P>
	   "Audiences were ready for something to lighten things up a bit," said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks the box
office. "That's why 'Stuart Little' is doing so well. There's a dearth of fun,
escapist movies right now."
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little" crossed the $100 million mark Saturday, grossing $106.8
million in about five weeks. Also hitting that milestone was Tom Hanks' "The
Green Mile," which has taken in $101.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   They were the 18th and 19th films released in 1999 to pass $100 million,
breaking the record of 18 movies set in 1998, Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures are to be released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Next Friday," $14.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "Stuart Little," $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "The Hurricane," $9.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "Girl, Interrupted," $8.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "The Green Mile," $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "Galaxy Quest," $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "The Talented Mr. Ripley," $6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   8. "Supernova," $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   9. "Toy Story 2," $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   10. "Any Given Sunday," $4.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Chile's Leftist Leader  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Ever since he was imprisoned briefly in the
mid-1980s by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Ricardo Lagos has been a hero for foes of
Chile's former dictator.
</P>
<P>
	   After leftist guerrillas made an attempt on Pinochet's life in 1986, Lagos
was one of several leftists arrested by state security agents in a crackdown.
Although he had nothing to do with that attempt, Lagos spent several days in
jail, coming out to work full time for the restoration of democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
	   He went on to play a key role in defeating a 1990 referendum to extend the
dictator's power until the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
	   Before his getting involved in politics, Lagos had been an academic for many
years. He holds a law degree from the University of Chile and a Ph.D. in
economics from Duke University.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos, 61, appears distant from the brand of Marxism touted by Salvador
Allende, the socialist president toppled Pinochet in a bloody 1973 coup, and
dismisses opponents' claims that his presidential candidacy represents a return
to the radical left.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos has supported Chile's efforts to get Pinochet released from detention
in London, saying that if he is going to be tried, justice should be done in
Chile. A Spanish judge wants to extradite Pinochet to Spain to try him on
torture charges.
</P>
<P>
	   He has said he would support Pinochet's release on compassion grounds,
``although he never showed compassion. We are different.''

<HEADLINE> Shyness Among Common U.S. Disorders  </HEADLINE>
    By WILLIAM McCALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Marissa Turner thought she was "weird" because she
spent most of her time alone as a child, even avoiding a stop to play with her
cousins on her way home from school.
</P>
<P>
	   She was terrified of raising her hand to answer questions in class because
she feared she would embarrass herself or her classmates would make fun of her.
She would sweat and tremble, and her throat would tighten if a teacher called on
her.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew I was afraid of a lot of people," said Turner, now 26. "I didn't
have a lot of friends. I thought I was different."
</P>
<P>
	   Turner is among the roughly 10 million Americans who are so shy they are
considered to suffer from "social anxiety disorder," ranked the third most
widespread mental health problem in the nation, just after depression and drug
or alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Their shyness is taken to such an extreme it affects everyday living --
talking to coworkers, friends or family or even ordering a snack at the corner
coffee stand. It often goes untreated for years, even decades, because the very
nature of the disorder prevents sufferers from seeking help. Some stay at home,
even confining themselves to a single room to avoid contact with others.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an awful experience for the people who suffer a severe form of it,"
said Dr. Michael Resnick at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   In Turner's case, the problem persisted into adulthood as she moved to the
Washington, D.C., area to find a job.
</P>
<P>
	   "The average reaction for me walking into a room full of people would be a
rapid heart rate, sweaty hands, that kind of racing feeling in my head and a
sort of fuzziness," she said. "I found it very hard to focus mentally on
anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates vary, but doctors say 3 percent to 5 percent of Americans are so
shy they need clinical treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Although it is widespread, social anxiety disorder is considered mild
compared to less common but more profound mental diseases, such as
schizophrenia. Still, it can ruin lives and disrupt families, businesses and
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   "I see kids in my practice who can't function in class, who can't
participate in class. They don't have friends, they eat alone, they spend time
in libraries alone," said Dr. Robert Reichler of the Pacific Institute of Mental
Health in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   He tells of a woman who "did date in high school but she was so
uncomfortable she could never talk to her date, and never got asked out again by
the same guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Many who suffer from the disorder "say they have trouble getting a job, they
have trouble handling job interviews, their hearts pound, they sweat, they can't
talk," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really a major, major impairment, not just shyness," Reichler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The basis of social anxiety disorder is biological, Resnick said. Ancient
humans evolved a certain level of anxiety to cope with danger and survive
against wild animals when hunters barely had the advantage of rocks and sharp
sticks.
</P>
<P>
	   "But some people have more of this (anxiety) than others," he said, "and it
gets to the point that it's not helpful. It goes haywire, and instead of a
protective mechanism, it's actually harmful."
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Fox, who did not begin suffering symptoms of the disorder until he
began high school in Salt Lake City, said he was as skeptical as his family at
first, even though he started skipping school because of his fear of social
situations.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew it was unreasonable, but I couldn't cope with it. I couldn't get it
to subside," Fox said. "I did tell my folks about it, but my whole family was
skeptical. I remember my sister told me it's nothing real, you should be able to
go to school."
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, Fox and his parents sought psychiatric help for him, exactly
what Turner's husband cajoled her into doing.
</P>
<P>
	   In a study presented to the American Psychiatric Association last year, Dr.
Mark Olfson of Columbia University said the average delay from onset of the
disorder to first professional contact was nearly 13 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, the average sufferer waited nearly eight years to confide in a
friend or family member about the problem, Olfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some new drugs have been effective in treating the disorder, including
Paxil, which recently won approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But
often the best remedy is to train patients to confront their fears about social
situations and force themselves to overcome it, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
	   "The longer you have it, the more you avoid the situation, and the worse it
gets," Reichler said.

<HEADLINE> Trapped Miners in SAfrica Found Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORKNEY, South Africa (AP) -- Rescuers on Sunday recovered the last of the
bodies of six miners who died in a tunnel collapse -- a disaster from which nine
other miners emerged alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Three bodies were pulled from the gold mine Saturday and another three
Sunday, said Margaret Heylen, spokeswoman for African Rainbow Minerals mining
company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All 15 miners have now been accounted for,'' Heylen said.
</P>
<P>
	   An earth tremor triggered the rockfall 1.3 miles below the surface on
Monday, trapping the 15 miners. Four died instantly or minutes later. Another
two were seriously hurt and succumbed to their injuries before they could be
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
	   But, in a drama that captivated a nation built on mining, rescuers tunneled
through tons of rock and emerged on Thursday with nine survivors. They were in
good condition and were being held in a hospital for observation.
</P>
<P>
	   South Africa has some of the deepest and most dangerous mines in the world.
In 1995, the Orkney mine was the scene of one of the South Africa's worst mining
accidents. A mine train fell into an elevator shaft on a carriage full of men,
crushing 104 to death.

<HEADLINE> American Music Awards Given Monday  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- From Ricky Martin to Cher, Shania Twain to Santana, the
American Music Awards on Monday reflect age, racial and cultural diversity that
would not have been seen a few years ago, says Dick Clark.
</P>
<P>
	   Take the favorite male pop or rock artist category, where the nominees are
retro-funk rocker Lenny Kravitz, Latin sensation Ricky Martin and hip-hop star
Will Smith, said Clark, the show's executive producer.
</P>
<P>
	   "A while back, you would have had young, white, male, probably pop singers,"
he said. "Then it graduated to young, white, male, rock singers. Now you have
racial diversity and musical diversity that's very interesting."
</P>
<P>
	   Other pop and rock categories are similarly varied. For favorite female
artist, the nominees are rhythm and blues singer Whitney Houston, teen star
Britney Spears and country diva Shania Twain.
</P>
<P>
	   Twain, Cher and Phil Collins are nominated for favorite adult contemporary
artist. The favorite band, duo or group nominees in pop or rock are the youthful
Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync plus 1970s hitmaker Santana. Carlos Santana's band
made a commercial comeback in 1999 with the multiplatinum album "Supernatural."
</P>
<P>
	   "As someone who's been around since the beginning of time, I'm glad to see
another veteran get the light thrown on him again," Clark said of Santana.
</P>
<P>
	   "Supernatural," combining the guitarist's searing instrumentals with vocal
collaborators such as Dave Matthews, Lauryn Hill and Rob Thomas, also is
nominated for favorite pop or rock album. The other nominees are the Backstreet
Boys' "Millennium" and Spears' "...Baby One More Time."
</P>
<P>
	   Comedian Norm Macdonald is host for the 27th annual American Music Awards,
set to air on ABC. Winners are decided by votes from a sampling of about 20,000
music fans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Performers scheduled to appear on the three-hour show include Kravitz,
Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, the Eurythmics and Enrique Iglesias.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Music Awards traditionally are a buildup to the Grammys, which
will be presented Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana leads Grammy nominees with 10, including record and album of the
year. The album also scored a songwriting nomination for Itaal Shur and Thomas
for the single "Smooth."
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel very grateful and honored, but I don't trip on it because I don't go
to work on an album with award expectations," Santana said after the Grammy
nominations came out earlier this month. "That's just not my motivation. My
motivation is to reach people's hearts."
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's awards show also will feature results of an Internet poll on
listeners' favorite musical artists for each decade from the 1950s through the
1980s.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers say drug industry 'waved white flag' on Medicare-drugs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two national lawmakers said Sunday that a recent
turnabout in policy by the pharmaceutical industry offers hope to millions of
senior citizens whose fixed incomes are strained by the high cost of
prescription drugs.
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Pharmarceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, or Pharma, which represents most of the nation's major
drug makers, has dropped its opposition to putting prescription drugs under
Medicare - a key element of the Clinton adminstration's legislative program.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a joint news conference with Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y.,
Schumer said putting prescription drugs under Medicare would be a major issue
before Congress this year, and "just this week, we picked up a major ally - the
prescription drug industry. The big pharmaceutical industry, which fought us
last year, waved the white flag and said, 'we are going to support this
benefit."'
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to the Washington, D.C., headquarters of Pharma were not immediately
returned. The drug industry has previously cited the cost of research on new
drugs for the high prices charged for some medications.
</P>
<P>
	   The voluntary proposal would cover 80 percent of the cost of generic drugs
and 90 percent of the cost of those produced by a single source. Schumer said
seniors on Medicare would pay $24 a month, and half the cost of their drugs up
to $5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Without this coverage, many seniors not covered by other plans are forced to
"weigh the cost of drugs against the cost of food or other essentials," Schumer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors, who make up 12 percent of the population, buy a third of the
country's prescription drugs, and 13 million seniors with no medical coverage
pay entirely from their own pockets, according to a study released Sunday by
Weiner.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also found that some drugs, when prescribed for animals, cost only
a fraction of what people must pay for the same medication for themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those he cited were Lanoxin, a heart medicine that costs $25 for a
human dose and only $6 for animals, and Medrol, used to treat arthritis, allergy
and asthma, at $20 for a one-month supply for humans, compared to $3.90 for
dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   "When one in eight seniors is choosing each month between paying for
medicines and paying for food, yet our pets can get identical drugs for the cost
of a box of milk bones, we must call on the nation's pharmaceutical companies to
revamp their price-gouging practices," Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
	   The difference in prices overall is about 150 percent, Weiner said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact of the matter is that the costs of these prescription drugs are so
high that most seniors can't afford them, plain and simple," Schumer said.

<HEADLINE> American Killed in Costa Rica Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By ROYDEN ALVARADO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- An American man and a Spaniard were among four
tourists killed when a commercial flight carrying 20 people crashed into a San
Jose neighborhood shortly after takeoff, Costa Rican authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men were identified as Sigfreid Riskter of the United States and
Antonio Sanchez Diaz of Spain. Their hometowns and ages were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saturday afternoon crash also killed two women, but their identities
weren't released.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen people, most of them Spaniards, where injured when the Czech-built
LET 410 plowed into a house in an upscale neighborhood near the Tobias Bolanos
airport, Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were in the house, including a Nicaraguan housekeeper who
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like a bomb. Pieces of cement, wood and even a wall fell on top of
us,'' the housekeeper, Yamileth Saenz, told the daily La Nacion.
</P>
<P>
	   The injured passengers included nine Spaniards, two French citizens, one
American, one Salvadoran and three Costa Ricans, the Red Cross said. Most were
in stable condition in San Jose hospitals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Costa Rican pilot was seriously injured, according to Pamela Villalta,
spokeswoman for the San Juan de Dios Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no details on the status of two other flight crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, leased by Taxi Aereo Centroamericano, crashed en route to the
Tortuguero national park on Costa Rica's Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the accident was under investigation. It was unclear whether
heavy winds at the time played a role.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was coming up the street when suddenly I saw the plane start to
fishtail,'' one witness, Pedro Chinchilla, told the daily La Republica. ``It
fell, and then I heard a loud noise, like a hurricane. When I reached the site I
could hear screams coming from inside the house.''
</P>
<P>
	   The home is rented by Herman Stalder of Switzerland and his wife, Zaida
Garcia of Panama, both of whom were outside the capital at the time of the
crash.

<HEADLINE> China Unicom Plans Internet Service  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEIJING (AP) -- China's No. 2 telecommunications company wants to complete
its long-delayed overseas share listing in the middle of this year, a state-run
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   China United Telecommunications, or Unicom, plans to use some of the
proceeds of a listing to fund aggressive diversification into Internet services,
China Daily Business Weekly quoted company vice president Wang Jianzhou as
saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Unicom's plan to raise at least $1 billion with a listing in New York or
Hong Kong, originally set for last October, has been delayed by disputes with
former foreign partners. The wrangling arose after the Chinese government banned
a roundabout investment system Unicom had used for joint ventures in the tightly
restricted telecom sector.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's report said there has been "final resolution" to that controversy
but did not give details.
</P>
<P>
	   It quoted Wang as saying the company was considering expansion into overseas
markets in cooperation with foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Unicom's business so far has focused on experimental mobile telephone
networks using the CDMA, or code division multiple access, technology. The
company plans to push ahead with CDMA development to compete against China
Telecom, which uses the GSM, or Global System for Mobile communications,
standard, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unicom's share of the mobile telecommunications market climbed to 11 percent
by the end of last year from 5 percent at the year's outset, Business Weekly
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wang said Unicom will expand its business to include fixed-line
long-distance services. The company signed a cooperation deal with China Telecom
last week that will allow it to offer both domestic and international long
distance, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   It will begin providing basic Internet access service this month and start
offering services in the second half of the year that connect users to the
Internet using their mobile phones, the report said. The service initially will
be limited to the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, it said.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Troops Pursue Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By VIVIAN SEQUERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Army units backed by helicopter gunships chased
rebels into a mountainous zone south of Bogota on Sunday, a day after the
heaviest fighting in months killed at least 50 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Clashes between the army and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia continued into Sunday near the town of Guayabetal, 30 miles southeast
of Bogota, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels tried to take over the town on Saturday but were repelled by some
1,000 troops backed up by the Colombian Air Force. On Sunday the town was
squarely in government hands, a statement from the army's press office said.
</P>
<P>
	   Army officials said troops were pursuing the rebels. Hundreds of soldiers
could be seen patrolling a main road in the Guayabetal area.
</P>
<P>
	   A Colombian television reporter covering the fighting near Bogota was
injured in the stomach Sunday when a peasant who was guiding her mishandled a
grenade and it exploded in his hands. The peasant, whose identity was not
immediately known, died instantly. The reporter, Astrid Legarda of RCN
television, was in stable condition at a local hospital, station officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Saturday's fighting, residents ran for cover and motorists hid underneath
vehicles while the army's Blackhawk helicopters pounded the mountainous region
with rockets and machine guns. Television images showed a slain rebel, his hands
and feet tied to a branch, being carried out of the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Army commander Gen. Fernando Tapias said 44 rebels died in the fighting on
Saturday. Five soldiers and a policeman also were reported killed. There were
reports of several civilian casualties, but the exact number was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   The army said the original offensive was carried out by 500 FARC rebels. It
was the worst fighting in Colombia in six months.
</P>
<P>
	   The FARC, which has about 15,000 fighters, is one of two main guerrilla
groups that have been fighting the Colombian state for more than 35 years. At
least 30,000 people have died in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's fighting occurred on the same day that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright visited the northern Colombian city of Cartagena to promote a
proposed $1.6 billion aid package to help Colombia fight drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   FARC rebel commanders lambasted the proposed aid, saying it will only worsen
the country's armed conflict. The guerrillas control about a third of the
nation, earning huge payoffs from protecting drug traffickers' operations and
taxing peasants who grow illegal drug crops.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Evict Clerics  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian police evicted clerics from the
compound of the exiled Russian Church in Jericho, then handed over the property
to the Moscow Patriarchate, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian police stormed the church Saturday, dragging out four nuns and
monks, officials from the church-in-exile, known as the ``White'' church, said.
They accused the Palestinians of seizing the compound illegally to placate the
more powerful Moscow church, known as the ``Red'' church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's all politics,'' Superior Abbess Moses of Jerusalem's Russian Convent
said Sunday, noting that the Palestinians have been tightening their ties with
Moscow and hosting a Jan. 6 visit by powerful Russian clerics in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
	   After police stormed the compound, Sister Maria (Anastasia) Stephanopoulos,
the sister of President Clinton's former aide, George Stephanopoulos, returned
to the compound and refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   She was later joined by another American nun.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials said Sunday they have formally handed ownership of the
compound to Patriarch Alexy II of the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We received an official request from Patriarch of Moscow Alexy II claiming
the property,'' said Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The request presented during the Russian clerics' January visit was
supported by ownership documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the church-in-exile said the documents were false. Hieromonk John
Smelic said he has asked the U.S. State Department to help retrieve the
property.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second time the Palestinian Authority handed over lands to the
Moscow church since the Palestinians gained control of parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Russian revolution in 1917, the Communist regime seized control of
the Russian Orthodox church while remnants of the defeated anti-Communist armies
set up a church-in-exile, called the ``White'' Russian church.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``White'' church controlled Russian shrines in the Holy Land until 1948,
when the newly-created Israel recognized the Moscow Patriarchate's claim as a
gesture of gratitude to the Soviet Union for its recognition of the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Church property in east Jerusalem and the West Bank remained under ``White''
control through Jordanian and later Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, however, at the request of Alexy II, Palestinian police expelled
``White'' church clerics from Hebron's Monastery of Abraham's Oak and installed
their ``Red'' church counterparts.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the fall of Soviet Communism in 1991, the two churches never
reconciled.

<HEADLINE> Castro Aide Knocks Citizenship Talk  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Cuban official derided U.S. lawmakers' attempts to
grant citizenship to 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez while American politicians on
Sunday urged the boy's relatives to travel from the island nation and make their
case in a U.S. court that he should return home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congress is supposed to be a serious institution and not an instrument to
permit what amounts to a kidnapping of a small boy,'' said Ricardo Alarcon,
president of the Cuban National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   The citizenship idea, he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' is ``absolutely
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled the boy must be returned to
his father in Cuba. But last week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the
deadline to give Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight in federal court
to keep the boy with them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let the father come to the United States, bring his family here, both
grandmothers, make his case in court and then have it decided right there,''
Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez said last week he feels like ``breaking the neck'' of
politicians fighting the boy's return to Cuba and has no intention of coming to
Miami to pick up his son. ``Miami Cubans would just entangle me in their
political games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan, however, said he did not believe ``for a second that that father
is speaking his heart and mind when he knows that his ex-wife and his boy almost
died for freedom. I think they want freedom, and I would not be surprise if he
wanted it, too.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela, has said she was willing to go to
Florida if she was assured she could pick him up and return immediately to Cuba
without becoming embroiled in legal or political problems. Alarcon said the
boy's other grandmother feels the same way.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in the United States since the Coast Guard found him Nov. 25
clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast. His mother, stepfather and
others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
	   A second presidential hopeful, GOP Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, said he
hopes the elder Gonzalez ``would be allowed to come ... inhale that great breath
of freedom, to see how is son is being accepted here, take some time for
himself, and make the decision (about Elian's future) here on U.S. soil.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking from Havana, Alarcon said Juan Miguel Gonzalez is free to go
whenever he can be assured of getting his son.
</P>
<P>
	   But Fidel Castro's point man on U.S.-Cuban matters added: ``We have gotten
the advice of many lawyers, including U.S. officials, that he should not go to
that country.'' Among other perils Gonzalez could face, Alarcon said, would be
the threat of a congressional subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon said anger is real and widespread in Cuba over Elian's continued
presence in the United States. He also acknowledged that mass protest
demonstrations have been organized by the Castro government, in part to protect
U.S. property and diplomats in Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are behind the protests because everybody in Cuba is protesting, from
the government to the last citizen,'' Alarcon said on ``Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because of that, he said, the government's only options are either to let
protesters vent their anger ``completely spontaneously,'' or ``to channel them
in a way to permit you to ensure the safety of the U.S. diplomats'' and other
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, there are efforts to make the boy a U.S. citizen. Some
lawmakers are weighing resident status for his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential candidate John McCain suggested Sunday that
citizenship for Elian might be the answer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've done that to so many others who have been able to escape,'' the
Arizona senator said on NBC. ``Look, the only people that have been returned to
Cuba have been criminals. I don't think that Elian falls into that category.''
</P>
<P>
	   The idea brought an angry denunciation from Alarcon:
</P>
<P>
	   ``You cannot impose citizenship upon anybody. And this individual, this
6-year-old boy, has not requested anything, and he cannot, legally speaking. ...
This is going too far, really,'' he said on NBC.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba, he said, ``is one of the last places of oppression and repression. To
somehow think that you're going to send this boy back to anything but a life of
repression and oppression denies history.''
</P>
<P>
	   But President Clinton's chief of staff said a special congressional act of
citizenship was not proper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The best place for this to be decided is in a court of law rather than the
halls of Congress,'' John Podesta said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the White House's position is ``Let's try to keep this as best we
can out of politics.''

    MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- A strike on the island state of Tasmania by
baggage handlers of Australia's second-largest airline has affected travel plans
for up to 5,000 people, union and airline officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Services to and from the state on Ansett Ltd., Australia's second-largest
domestic airline, and its regional subsidiary Kendell Airlines have been brought

prompted by job-shedding plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Among passengers affected are athletes who took part in last week's swimming
world cup shortcourse championships in the state capital of Hobart.
</P>
<P>
	   An Ansett spokeswoman said the airline was trying to arrange other means of
travel for stranded passengers, including finding seats on ferries to the
mainland and connecting flights. She spoke on condition her name not be used.
</P>
<P>
	   She said Ansett hoped the dispute would be mediated by the Australian
Industrial Relations Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Transport Workers' Union official John Allan said the work stoppage would

<HEADLINE> New Restrictions on Biotech Corn  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is putting new planting restrictions on
genetically engineered corn to prevent insects from developing resistance to the
toxin in the biotech crop.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 percent of the corn grown last year was Bt corn, named for the
bacteria it contains to kill the European corn borer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new restrictions, which the Environmental Protection Agency worked out
with the industry, will require farmers to plant at least 20 percent
conventional corn in most regions, and 50 percent in areas where cotton is
grown.
</P>
<P>
	   Seed companies will be required to expand field monitoring for signs of
where insect resistance may be occurring.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies also are to "communicate voluntary measures" to protect
Monarch butterflies from the corn. The EPA posted a brief notice about the new
restrictions Friday on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The butterfly larvae feed on milkweed, which sometimes is found around corn
fields. A study released in May by Cornell University said Monarch larvae died
when they ate pollen from the Bt corn.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are really happy to see that the agency is taking the resistance issues
and the Monarch issue seriously," said Margaret Mellon, director of the
agricultural and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the agency has done a good job of jawboning the industry and
getting them to agree to the restrictions in an environment where strictly
speaking they don't have to. We're concerned that they didn't go far enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Rebecca Goldburg, senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, said
the new restrictions "confirm the fact that Bt corn can pose both an
environmental and resistance management risk."
</P>
<P>
	   The planting restrictions are along the lines of recommendations made by the
National Corn Growers Association, said Leon Corzine, an Illinois farmer who
serves on an association committee that handles biotech issues.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA action is unlikely to have much effect on farmers because they
already are likely to cut back on production of Bt corn due to consumer
resistance to biotech food in U.S. export markets. Also, corn borer infestations
have been low throughout much of the Midwest for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The planting restrictions will be higher in cotton-growing areas because of
the widespread use of a Bt-version of cotton.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Commission, which enforces rules for the 15-member European
Union, cited the Cornell study last summer in delaying approval of pending
requests to sell the corn variety. Mexican environmentalists urged their
government to ban its import and use.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to the study, EPA scientists said last year that they knew that
the pollen could kill insects but did not believe the butterflies would be
exposed to the toxin outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency is to consider renewing expiring registrations for Bt corn later
this year and has asked seed companies to provide data on its impact.

<HEADLINE> Janus Closes Global Tech Fund  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Denver-based mutual fund group Janus closed its Global
Technology Fund to new investors last week after a meteoric rise in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund recorded a 211 percent return last year and reached $8 billion in
assets, even though it's just 13 months old.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm as surprised as anybody at the type of returns that we were able to
obtain," said Mike Lu, the fund's 31-year-old manager. "This fund was not meant
to be a go-go fund. It was meant to be a longer-term, broad-based, diversified
technology fund."
</P>
<P>
	   The Global Technology fund invests most of its assets in technology
businesses, such as semiconductor, computer networking, telecommunications and
software companies, according to the Janus Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   People who already have invested in the fund will be allowed to add to their
investment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Janus group manages more than $240 billion and runs 21 mutual funds for
retail investors.

<HEADLINE> Economist Says Ruble Will Be Weak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's ruble will remain weak for at least five years and
the overall economy will take a few years to revive, Russia's top economic
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who was appointed last week to
oversee Russia's economic policy, said on Russia's RTR television that "the
economy is now weak and ... it will take three or four years" to regain the
strength it had in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's economy has been in decline for most of the past decade. While it
registered growth in 1997 and early 1998, that was wiped out by a financial
collapse in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasyanov, a liberal reformer who also serves as finance minister, also said
"the ruble's strengthening will start in five to seven years."
</P>
<P>
	   The beleaguered ruble suffered another blow earlier this year when it
dropped suddenly against the dollar. Officials said the fall was technical, and
the currency later rallied slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasyanov expressed hope for economic growth this year, but acknowledged it
would likely be minimal.
</P>
<P>
	   He predicted few reforms would be made in the first quarter because the
government and the country will be distracted by the campaign for presidential
elections, scheduled for March 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting President Vladimir Putin, who appointed Kasyanov, is widely expected
to win the vote.

<HEADLINE> McCain Tested by Vietnam Captivity  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stooped in his cell, ravaged by dysentery and
whisper-close to confessing to his Hanoi captors, John McCain heard Dooley
Wilson singing ``As Time Goes By'' and Humphrey Bogart telling Ingrid Bergman,
``We'll always have Paris.''
</P>
<P>
	   The young Navy lieutenant commander pretty much gave up during all of the
torture, solitary confinement and other punishments he endured for displaying
what his captors called a ``bad attitude.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tried to hang himself twice,'' his medical records note.
</P>
<P>
	   But his memory of books and movies ultimately gave him what attempted
suicide did not -- a way out of his harrowing circumstances -- and a route that
kept alive his chances of seeing his wife and three children again after the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
	   He delved often into his silent reveries, visiting worlds painted by history
books and movies, imagining other battles, mighty warriors and forbidden loves
far from his cell and the pain he suffered there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had to carefully guard against my fantasies becoming so consuming that
they took me permanently to a place in my mind from which I might fail to
return,'' McCain wrote in his memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers.'' McCain was
imprisoned after being shot down during a bombing mission over Hanoi on Oct. 26,
1967. He was 31.
</P>
<P>
	   If he wasn't replaying ``Casablanca'' in his mind, then it was books such as
``The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' or the Civil War history, ``Lee's
Lieutenants.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The important thing in those conditions is to keep the mind stimulated,''
McCain, 63, says now. ``That's what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the dingy walls, McCain also picked up the sounds of real life --
footsteps of the guards coming to interrogate him or bring him a meal of rice,
sometimes ruined with pebbles. If he was lucky, they offered pumpkin soup.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain would greet them with streams of profanity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He strongly resented their coming around and bringing him back to reality
by intruding,'' say his medical records. ``He was enjoying his fantasies so
much.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain says his more than five years as a prisoner of war taught him
confidence, humility and the ambition to pursue larger dreams, namely his 18
years in Congress -- he now represents Arizona in the Senate -- and his
Republican run for president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I gained a seriousness of purpose that observers of my early life had
found difficult to detect.''
</P>
<P>
	   The suicide attempts were his darkest moments, when his captors tried to
beat a confession out of him and succeeded in breaking his arm again, his teeth,
and finally his will. Once, McCain threaded his shirt through the window shutter
of a torture cell and around his neck, but was caught and beaten. He tried
again, with the same result. Finally, he said he was ready to talk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I couldn't control my despair. I shook, as if my disgrace were a fever,''
McCain writes. ``All my pride was lost, and I doubted I would ever stand up to
any man again. Nothing could save me.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was thrown in solitary three times -- for two straight years beginning in
March 1968, later for nine months, and finally for three months.
</P>
<P>
	   The solitary cell was 5 feet by 6 feet. ``A dim and spooky place,'' recalled
retired Vice Adm. James Stockdale, who occupied one of those cells before McCain
moved in and went on to a brief encounter with politics as Reform Party founder
Ross Perot's running mate in the 1996 presidential election; now he's an
enthusiastic campaigner for McCain in California. ``Maybe a little light crept
in under the eaves,'' Stockdale added.
</P>
<P>
	   Replaying books and movies to pass the time was part of the culture of the
American POWs imprisoned in the ``Hanoi Hilton.''
</P>
<P>
	   Designated as the recreation officer when he was in a big cell with 30
others, McCain would organize plays and skits or simply talk about the plots of
films.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I used to tell movies,'' he said in an interview. ``I told many, many
movies. You have, literally, a captive audience.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prisoners acted out an irreverent version of ``A Christmas Carol.'' They
were going to do ``Stalag 17,'' the prison-camp film that later inspired
``Hogan's Heroes'' on television, but he said the Vietnamese came in and removed
the men slated to be the lead actors.
</P>
<P>
	   Freedom came in March 1973 with the Paris Peace Accords, and McCain went
home a hero for refusing an offer to be released ahead of his fellow prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   An issue lingering from his youth still needed to be dealt with -- the
towering presence of his father, Adm. John Sidney McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has been preoccupied with escaping being in the shadow of his father
and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others,'' says his
post-release psychological records. ``He feels his experiences and performance
as POW (have) finally permitted this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, at a public dinner in his honor, McCain heard the admiral introduced
as ``Commander McCain's father.'' The young man smiled and winked at his dad.
``He had arrived,'' say his records.
</P>
<P>
	   These days McCain is rarely asked by voters other than veterans about the
most trying time in his life.
</P>
<P>
	   Politics, unlike prison, does not offer a captive audience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you're running for public office, people will respect you for what
you've done,'' McCain said recently as his bus rolled through New Hampshire.
``But they want to know what you're going to do for them.''

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in Downing Street Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- An American tourist injured by a car that smashed into the
gates that guard the entrance to Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street
residence left the hospital Sunday and flew home to New Jersey accompanied by a
nurse.
</P>
<P>
	   Ursula Webster, 39, suffered a broken leg in the incident early Saturday
afternoon and was treated overnight at St. Thomas's Hospital. Her three sons and
husband were not hurt. Webster flung her 8-year-old son out of the way just
before she was hit, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police filed charges Sunday against the driver of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Bonnett, 26, an engineer from Chelmsford, east of London, was
charged with causing grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving, police said. He
was due to appear in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said tourists were clustered at the gates that lead to Downing
Street when Bonnett's car skidded and crashed. It was not immediately clear
whether he is suspected of deliberately crashing into the ornate black iron
gates or whether he simply lost control of the car.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hails U.S.-Mexico Ties  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, hailing close
ties with Mexico, all but promised Sunday that Mexico need not fear a failing
grade next month in the Clinton administration's annual evaluation of its
neighbor's counterdrug performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright and Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green both praised the levels
of cooperation the countries have reached on a range of issues. Green said the
U.S.-Mexican ``dialogue of the deaf'' of previous years is past.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico and other countries that serve as drug producers or transit points
have complained bitterly about the yearly process under which those deemed to be
not fully cooperating with U.S. control efforts can be subject to economic
penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   In some years, there has been almost a cliffhanger atmosphere in the
countdown toward the State Department decision on whether Mexico should be
``certified'' as fully cooperating or ``decertified'' for not doing enough in
the drug war.
</P>
<P>
	   Some administration officials periodically have advocated vigorously a
decision to decertify but were overruled.
</P>
<P>
	   Any suspense over the State Department's decision on Mexico this year, due
at the end of February, seemed to evaporate Sunday when Albright said Mexican
cooperation has been ``at a very good level.''
</P>
<P>
	   At another point, Albright said, ``Our problems are not as much with each
other as they are with those who are trying to undermine what we are trying to
do.'' This year's certification process involves an evaluation of Mexico and 25
other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Green said certification did not come up during discussions Sunday at this
picturesque city in Mexico's deep south, the last stop on a three-day Albright
visit to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   Green noted that the two countries have greatly enhanced mechanisms of
cooperation over the years. Both governments hope to hand over a solid base for
continued strong friendship when successor governments assume power in both
countries over the next year, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright began her day with a trek to nearby Monte Alban, scene of a
once-thriving indigenous culture where settlers first arrived 2,500 years ago.
An estimated 30,000 people lived there in the early part of the first
millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   The community has long since been abandoned, but trappings of the culture
remain in the numerous edifices still standing and in still-visible etchings
carved into beige-colored stone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No setting has been more inspiring than this one,'' said Albright,
speaking to reporters after her return to Oaxaca. Before arriving Saturday
night, she visited Colombia and Panama; she returns to Washington Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In her comments on Mexican drug performance, Albright talked about Mexico's
willingness to cooperate and made no reference to results.
</P>
<P>
	   This tactic has been a sore point with some lawmakers who believe the State
Department's evaluation should be more results-oriented.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico was certified last February, even though its cocaine seizures were
down 35 percent in 1998 and eradication of opium poppies did not keep pace with
new cultivation. The overall harvest increased by 25 percent, government figures
show.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Fiano, chief of operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration,
said in congressional testimony in September that ``continuing reports of
corruption and the rapidly growing power and influence of the major organized
criminal groups in Mexico cause us great concern about the long-term prospects
for success.''
</P>
<P>
	   Weeks later, however, Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said record
hauls of 1,235 tons of marijuana and 185 kilograms of heroin had been seized by
Mexico over the previous year. He said the 25.5 tons of confiscated cocaine was
among the highest totals in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Barry McCaffrey, the administration's drug control chief,
agreed that Mexican efforts were producing results.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The numbers are spectacular,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Truck Drivers Hide Illness  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Cracks in the system designed to check commercial truck
and bus drivers for dangerous medical conditions have allowed people with sleep
disorders, heart problems and other serious illnesses to take to the nation's
highways, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Department of Transportation requires commercial drivers to undergo
physicals every two years. However, many doctors are not aware of the specific
demands of drivers -- as federal regulations require -- and many drivers simply
shop around for examiners willing to give them a clean physical, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you've nailed a loophole in the licensing process. That's
definitely a deficiency in the system,'' said James Kolstad, who served as
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board from 1987 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   During Kolstad's tenure, the agency released an eight-state study of 182
fatal accidents and found that 10 percent of truck drivers who were killed had a
health problem that was a major factor in the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   In a more recent case, Frank Bedell drove a tour bus that crashed en route
to Mississippi on Mother's Day, killing 22 people. He had been granted a
two-year medical certificate nine months earlier, despite a diagnosis of
congestive heart failure that should have disqualified him.
</P>
<P>
	   Bedell survived the May crash but died of a heart attack in August. The day
before the trip, he underwent dialysis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Should he have been qualified for two years? Probably not. Should he have
been driving the day he was? Obviously not,'' said Dr. Natalie Hartenbaum of
Philadelphia, author of a guide on Department of Transportation medical
certification.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My feeling is, there are a lot of drivers out there who are as bad, or
worse, but don't get picked up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartenbaum is scheduled to testify this week at an NTSB hearing in New
Orleans on the Bedell crash and related safety issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulations allow ``any licensed medical examiner'' to perform the
physicals, including physician assistants and chiropractors, without requiring
specialized training or demonstrated proficiency.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartenbaum serves on a federal regulatory committee that has looked at
proposals to improve the screening process.
</P>
<P>
	   One would mimic the Federal Aviation Administration's system of having
designated examiners perform the physicals.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say it's impractical to apply the FAA system to millions of
commercial drivers. But at least one federal official disagrees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's absurd,'' said James Hall, current chairman of the NTSB. ``It's
only impractical if you're not the person whose life is at risk.''

<HEADLINE> Private Job Bias Lawsuits Tripled  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aided by new federal laws, private lawsuits alleging
discrimination in the workplace more than tripled during in the 1990s, the
Justice Department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics said job bias lawsuits filed
in U.S. District Courts soared from 6,936 in 1990 to 21,540 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The growth in civil rights cases has been due largely to the increase in
employment cases between private parties,'' bureau statistician Marika F.X.
Litras wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil rights complaints of all varieties more than doubled from 1990 to
1998, from 18,793 to 42,354. They accounted for 8.6 percent of the 217,879
federal civil cases in 1990, compared with 16.5 percent of all 256,787 civil
cases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a tiny fraction were federal government lawsuits against a business,
individual or government for alleged civil rights violations: 747 cases in 1990
and 672 in 1998. Government-initiated lawsuits fell sharply from 4 percent of
all civil rights cases in 1990 to 1.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the federal government was a civil rights defendant much more often
than a plaintiff. It was accused of bias in 9.2 percent of all civil rights
lawsuits in 1990, compared with 5.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   New civil rights laws paved the way for the explosion in job bias cases,
including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Civil Rights Act
of 1991, Litras wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1991 law amended five older federal employment discrimination laws. It
also allowed plaintiffs to win compensatory and punitive damages in certain
cases, permitted jury trials when plaintiffs sought monetary damages, and
overturned seven Supreme Court rulings, ``broadening the scope of employment
practices considered discriminatory,'' Litras wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Employment cases accounted for 65 percent of the overall increase in civil
rights cases. These are cases alleging an employer discriminated in hiring,
promotion, firing, pay or privileges because of a person's race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or exercise of legal rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawsuits alleging bias in housing, hotels, restaurants or other public
accommodations accounted for 2 percent of the increase in civil rights cases,
rising from 342 cases in 1990 to 838 cases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Complaints over bias in welfare declined from 129 to 66 during the period.
Voting rights complaints peaked at 500 in 1992, based on challenges to
redistricting after the 1990 Census, then declined to 108 cases by 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining third of the overall increase came in other civil rights cases
related to handicapped children, the education of the disabled and vocational
disabilities and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
	   During the study period, outright dismissal of cases rose from 66 percent to
71 percent of all cases filed. The percentage of cases reaching a jury verdict
fell from 8 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the cases decided by trial, plaintiffs won just under a third on average,
but the percentage awarded monetary damages declined from 83 percent in 1990 to
76 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the median awards ranged from $65,000 in housing cases to $137,000
in employment cases. The percentage of winning plaintiffs awarded $10 million or
more rose from 1 percent in 1990 to 9 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   On average, plaintiffs won 35 percent of jury trials annually, compared with
23 percent of trial decided by judges.
</P>
<P>
	   None of these figures included civil rights claims filed by state and
federal prison inmates. Inmates civil rights complaints rose from 25,992 in 1990
to 41,679 in 1995. But the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 restricted such
claims and they fell to 26,462 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> UPN Likes Shows With 'Testosterone'  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Next up for the television network that likely owes
its survival to professional wrestling: monster trucks, motorcycle daredevils
and hip-hop bounty hunters.
</P>
<P>
	   UPN teetered on the brink of extinction last year before its "WWF
Smackdown!" series brought in teen-aged boys in droves, so now its programming
plan is geared almost entirely to pleasing that audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it has high testosterone, we'll air it," Dean Valentine, network
president, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   UPN's total viewership is up 36 percent from last season, and 158 percent
among teen-aged boys. The five-year-old UPN is still competing with the WB for
status as the fifth broadcast network, and executives concede it needs several
more years of growth to show a profit.
</P>
<P>
	   At least, chief programmer Tom Nunan said, "for the first time in our
history, we've made contact with an audience -- young men."
</P>
<P>
	   The network plans a one-hour monster truck special on Feb. 29. It hopes
eventually to turn the event into a regular series, if it can develop
personalities the way professional wrestling has.
</P>
<P>
	   On UPN's development slate are an animated series with Howard Stern as
executive producer; a claymation series by the maker of MTV's "Celebrity Death
Match"; a series, "I Spike," with pro volleyball players as spies; and a series
entitled "Hip-Hop Bounty Hunters."
</P>
<P>
	   UPN's audience is also 41 percent African-American, due primarily to the
comedies "Moesha" and "The Parkers." Valentine didn't talk much about new shows
aimed chiefly at this audience, but said the high minority viewership may help
UPN survive at a time networks are being watched closely for its attention paid
to diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   UPN's new reality series, "I Dare You," starts Tuesday. Evel Knievel is the
color commentator for a show that features wild stunts like motorcycle jumps and
free-falls.
</P>
<P>
	   It's billed as "the most dangerous new show of the millennium," but its
producer insists it will be safe. UPN won't air the footage if anyone is killed
trying a stunt. As for injuries, well, that's negotiable.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything will be taken on a case-by-case basis," said creator Bruce Nash.
"It depends on what seriously injured means. I think good taste and propriety
will prevail."

<HEADLINE> Syria Wants Israelis Out of Golan  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SEVAREID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria, venturing into the sort of public negotiating
it says it detests, made clear Sunday that it would be unwilling to let Israeli
settlers remain on the Golan Heights as part of any peace deal that returns the
territory to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian newspapers, which are mouthpieces of the government, said in
editorials that Syria would reject any Israeli proposals to allow some of the
17,000 Jewish settlers to remain on the Golan. Israel seized the border plateau
in the 1967 Mideast war and Syria demands its full return as the price for an
end to 50 years of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria went public with their perspective on the talks after an Israeli
newspaper published a U.S.-drafted working paper detailing how the historic
Israeli-Syrian peace talks are progressing. Syria, which likes to conduct such
business quietly, was clearly annoyed by the leaks to Israel's Haaretz
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The leaks drew a reluctant Syria into publicly countering Israeli reports
that some settlers could be allowed to stay on the plateau and that Syria had
agreed to joint management of the Golan's water sources.
</P>
<P>
	   The English-language Syria Times said Sunday that such Israeli suggestions
``would be rejected.'' Israel also should provide ``definite answers'' about
returning the Golan to Syria in peace talks this week, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the scenes, the two sides prepared for a third round of talks
scheduled to begin Wednesday. Syria's official SANA news agency said U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa spoke about the peace process Sunday by telephone, but it did not
provide details.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, speaking in Oaxaca, Mexico, said she also spoke to the Israeli
side Sunday. Without going into details, she said the issues are ``difficult
ones''.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiations go on and they will go on,'' she said. ``The United States is
doing everything that we can to facilitate it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, U.S. officials confirmed Sunday that a third round of talks
between Israel and Syria would begin this week as planned, despite unconfirmed
media reports in Lebanon that the talks would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are still planning for the next round of talks to resume'' Wednesday,
State Department Deputy Spokesman James B. Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli Cabinet minister Haim Ramon said Israel was aware of
Syria's ``tough stand.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have positions that are no less steadfast on matters that deal with
security of the country and the quality of the peace,'' Ramon said in an
interview with Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Also this weekend, a pro-Syrian Lebanese newspaper reported what it
described as Syrian amendments to the U.S. document that Haaretz published. The
amendments published by As-Safir emphasize a complete Israeli withdrawal to the
1967 prewar border and the removal of Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. working document took Israel's side on many points, As-Safir
reported, particularly regarding security arrangements and normalization of
peacetime relations. The document cited gaps on security positions but did not
indicate any on the nature of future relations, including an exchange of
ambassadors and promoting trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
	   As-Safir did not provide the source of the amendments, but they appear to
have been disclosed to counter the U.S. document's publication in Israel. The
Israeli leak drew condemnations from Syrian media.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why did Israel leak the American document and publish, through its media,
its full contents? Was it just to kill negotiations?'' Al-Thawra newspaper asked
in an editorial Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   More likely, the motivation was to assuage Israeli fears. Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak returned from the second round of talks earlier this month
to large demonstrations against withdrawing from the Golan. Some opposed to his
peace efforts claimed he'd already agreed to return the Golan to Syria. The
document indicated otherwise.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Voting in Guinea-Bissau  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- The West African nation of Guinea-Bissau took an
important step toward democracy Sunday, completing a second round of
presidential elections without the violence that marred the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 525,000 registered voters chose between Kumba Yala, the populist
leader of the Socialist Renewal Party, and Malam Bacai Sanha, leader of the
former ruling African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde.
</P>
<P>
	   Yala was favored to win after capturing nearly 39 percent of the first-round
votes, while Bacai Sanha won 23 percent in that round.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's vote was the second since former President Joao Bernardo Vieira was
deposed in May 1999, following an 11-month army rebellion. Unlike the first
round in November, which was marred by isolated riots and widespread delays, no
incidents were reported in the former Portuguese colony, according to the
Portuguese news agency Lusa.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislative elections were also held on Nov. 28. Yala's Socialist Renewal
Party won the most seats, securing 38 of the 102 spots in the National Popular
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the 6,000-strong army revolted in June 1998, claiming Vieira was
corrupt and that he had failed to lift the country out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   While many civilians fear the military may be reluctant to step aside. Some
view the soldiers as heroes for toppling Vieira, whose government is accused of
siphoning off millions of dollars from state coffers since taking power in a
1980 coup and winning elections in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Samsung Developing Cyber-Microwave  </HEADLINE>
    By TAMMY WEBBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Too lazy to read the directions on that TV dinner? Soon you
may not have to. Your microwave oven will do it for you with the swipe of the
package bar code across a special sensor.
</P>
<P>
	   One such oven, being developed by Samsung with Rutgers University
researchers, will then contact the manufacturers' Internet site, read the
directions and cook the meal -- even taking care of any necessary turning --
while you do something else.
</P>
<P>
	   Cyberspace is headed into the kitchen, according to manufacturers at the
International Housewares Show, which opened Sunday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal is to simplify people's lives by reducing the amount of time they
must spend preparing meals, said Joy Weis Daniel, product development manager at
Sharp Electronics Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharp has developed a convection microwave oven that can download recipes
from the company's Web site. The microwave then gives step-by-step instructions
on preparing the meal -- and automatically sets the time and adjusts the power
for roasting, baking, broiling and grilling.
</P>
<P>
	   "It does all the thinking," Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither microwave is yet available to U.S. consumers. Sharp began selling
its product in Japan in October and hopes to introduce it in the United States
in the next year or so. Samsung officials say they hope to have their oven in
stores next year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sharp microwave requires a separate PC that can be in any room. The
recipe is downloaded into a data box, which is then connected to the microwave.
Customers could only download recipes from the Sharp Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The new-style of cooking isn't inexpensive. Sharp's new oven sells for about
$1,000 in Japan, said Heather Sweet, an associate marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
	   Samsung's bar code-reading oven will likely cost less than $500 when it hits
the market, said Dennis Joyner, the company's national marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the unit may even be capable of keeping an inventory of groceries
and notifying users when it's time to restock, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, it could be connected to a touch-screen computer that allows
access to the entire Internet -- including everything from nutritional
information about the meal being cooked to weather and news reports -- said
Rutgers University researcher Kit Yam, who is helping to develop the technology.
</P>
<P>
	   So, why swipe a bar code when you can just read the package directions?
</P>
<P>
	   Yam gives soggy fish sticks as an example. Directions currently can't be
tailored to every microwave. If they're not right for the oven you're using, you
end up with food that has poor consistency and bad taste, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans are ready to take the next step in microwave technology,
especially if it means better, faster food, said Kota Chang, who was checking
out new products for a Pasadena, Calif., appliance manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it is the trend for the future," he said. "I just think people are
getting more and more lazy."

<HEADLINE> Healing, Disney Develops New Sores  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. has liberally applied salve to
the public relations pinpricks and larger financial wounds suffered in the last
year or so. Yet even as the entertainment giant tries to heal, new sores
develop.
</P>
<P>
	   After a disappointing 1999 financial preformance, a public airing of dirty
laundry in court and other publicity headaches, Disney was hit last week by the
resignation of studio chairman Joe Roth -- the latest in a string of executive
departures.
</P>
<P>
	   It all adds up to the shakiest times for the company since Michael Eisner
took over 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney earned what sounds like a healthy $1.3 billion in 1999. But that was
down from $1.8 billion in 1998, itself a stagnant earnings year, and revenues
showed only a marginal gain. Though the company's stock has rebounded a bit,
trading at about $35 a share, it remains off about 20 percent from its high in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Considering Disney's rapid expansion and stellar returns under Eisner
previously, and given the comparative runup elsewhere in the stock market, it's
small wonder the House of Mickey has been looking a little ramshackle to
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   While conceding the problems, Eisner said Disney's difficulties have been
exaggerated and the company has made broad moves to promote growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you're as successful and big as we are and you're liked as much as we
are and your products have as much emotion behind them as ours, any stumble is
elevated to a complete fall," Eisner said. "But in the area of creation of
content, there's no company as stable as this company."
</P>
<P>
	   A spate of problems converged to put the company down, including overkill on
Disney products and home videos, spiraling film costs, heavy spending on theme
parks and operations bloated by acquisitions, ABC television among them.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than "The Lion King," Disney's recent animated films had not produced
durable merchandising characters to join Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and the
studio's other icons.
</P>
<P>
	   "One problem is, people's closets are just too full of this stuff," said Tom
Wolzien, an industry analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Flat earnings are expected to continue for the first half of this year, but
analysts said Disney should begin to show improvement after that as some of the
company's turnaround measures kick in.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney is slashing administrative and film-production costs and reducing the
number of licensees and product lines at studio stores to better control sales.
Slow out of the gate in its online and DVD presence, Disney now is rolling out
films in the newer video format and building up its Web presence after acquiring
Internet portal Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
	   Some assets, such as Disney's Angels baseball and Mighty Ducks hockey teams,
could be sold to focus capital on the company's most profitable operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has scrapped its periodic video reissues of classic animated
films. Most of those movies now will be available year-round, with 10 top
titles, such as "Snow White," being withheld for an annual re-release.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those 10 will give us an event to rally around, whereas the year-round
titles are our bread and butter" to boost lagging video sales, said Peter
Murphy, Disney's chief strategic officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides money and merchandise troubles, Disney went through costly
settlements with Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood deal broker who departed as
Eisner's second-in-command after barely a year, and former studio chief Jeffrey
Katzenberg, who sued for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The Katzenberg case last spring revealed embarrassing moments from Disney's
private corporate life and the feud between him and Eisner.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth, Katzenberg's successor as Disney studio chief, became the latest in a
line of top brass to depart the company in the last few years -- an executive
exodus analysts blame on Eisner's heavy-handed management style. "Have you heard
of any executive who's happy working with Michael Eisner?" said Robert
Bucksbaum, a film industry analyst for Reel Source Inc. "It's not easy working
for somebody who so much likes to be in control."
</P>
<P>
	   Eisner insists that a company the size of Disney inevitably gets raided and
that the studio has retained a deep bench of veteran talent.
</P>
<P>
	   "What happens is every headhunter in the world cruises our company, not
because of me but because we have identified the most talented, brightest young
people," Eisner said. "I take it as a compliment."

<HEADLINE> American Killed in Costa Rica Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By ROYDEN ALVARADO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- An American man and a Spaniard were among four
tourists killed when a commercial flight carrying 20 people crashed into a San
Jose neighborhood shortly after takeoff, Costa Rican authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men were identified as Sigifred Riskter of the United States and
Antonio Sanchez Diaz of Spain. Their hometowns and ages were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saturday afternoon crash also killed two women, but their identities
weren't released.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixteen people, most of them Spaniards, where injured when the Czech-built
LET 410 plowed into a house in an upscale neighborhood near the Tobias Bolanos
airport, Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were in the house, including a Nicaraguan housekeeper who
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like a bomb. Pieces of cement, wood and even a wall fell on top of
us,'' the housekeeper, Yamileth Saenz, told the daily La Nacion.
</P>
<P>
	   The injured passengers included nine Spaniards, two French citizens, one
American, one Salvadoran and three Costa Ricans, the Red Cross said. Most were
in stable condition in San Jose hospitals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Costa Rican pilot was seriously injured, according to Pamela Villalta,
spokeswoman for the San Juan de Dios Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no details on the status of two other flight crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, leased by Taxi Aereo Centroamericano, crashed en route to the
Tortuguero national park on Costa Rica's Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the accident was under investigation. It was unclear whether
heavy winds at the time played a role.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was coming up the street when suddenly I saw the plane start to
fishtail,'' one witness, Pedro Chinchilla, told the daily La Republica. ``It
fell, and then I heard a loud noise, like a hurricane. When I reached the site I
could hear screams coming from inside the house.''
</P>
<P>
	   The home is rented by Herman Stalder of Switzerland and his wife, Zaida
Garcia of Panama, both of whom were outside the capital at the time of the
crash.

<HEADLINE> Snow Over Plains and Northeast  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Moist air streamed across the nation on the jet stream Sunday, contributing
to rain in parts of the West and snow showers in the northern Plains states and
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Rain showers were scattered across the West Coast from southern California
to Washington's Puget Sound region, with some locally heavy rainfall in northern
California and Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Occasional light showers also stretched from southern California across
southern Nevada into Utah, and across eastern sections of Oregon and Washington
into Idaho.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow fell in the Cascade and Sierra Nevada ranges. Parts of the Sierra also
got heavy snow on Saturday. Additional snow fell across parts of northern
Washington and Idaho into western Montana.
</P>
<P>
	   Farther east, the moist air combined with cold air sinking out of Canada to
produce light snow flurries that were scattered across the Dakotas and Nebraska
into southern Minnesota and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the Northeast, light snow fell across wide areas of northern
Pennsylvania and New York state. The snow also extended into parts of Vermont,
Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and over most of Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   Accumulations of 5 to 8 inches of snow were possible by Monday morning in
some northern sections of New England.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, a few rain showers moved across parts of Tennessee and northern
sections of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from morning lows of
20 below zero at Minot, N.D., and Warroad, Minn., to a midday reading of 77 at
Palacios, Texas. The lowest wind chill was 46 below zero at Grand Forks, N.D.,
and the highest heat index was 79 at Palacios.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bradley Gain in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE WEBSTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley have
gained support from independents and women in New Hampshire in the last two
months, according to a Dartmouth College-Associated Press poll showing both with
an overall edge just two weeks before voters cast the first ballots of campaign
2000 on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll Sunday suggested that McCain and Bradley also improved their
standing with registered voters in their own parties. Both Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Democratic and Republican front-runners
nationally, had the advantage in a November Dartmouth-AP poll of New Hampshire
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest poll, taken from Jan. 9-12, McCain had 42 percent support to
33 percent for Bush in the Republican race; Bradley was at 49 percent to 43
percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous poll, conducted Oct. 31-Nov. 3, had Bush in the lead, 44
percent to 31 percent, and Gore had an edge over Bradley, 48 percent to 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The margin of error for the sample of 518 likely voters in the Republican
primary was 4.5 percentage points while it was plus or minus 5 percentage points
for the 418 likely voters in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The other GOP candidates -- publisher Steve Forbes, former U.N. Ambassador
Alan Keyes, conservative activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah --
trail the front-runners. Only Forbes was in double digits, with 11 percent, the
same as in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Republican and Democratic races are very close, with many New
Hampshire polls showing a tilt toward McCain and Bradley, and others showing the
races too close to call or with an edge for Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The AP-Dartmouth poll disclosed some interesting dynamics in the races that
have developed into tight contests in both parties in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll included 498 likely voters who were first contacted in early
November and were reinterviewed from Jan. 9-12.
</P>
<P>
	   Among that group, one out of three Republicans and one out of five Democrats
had switched candidates. The differences were most pronounced among Republicans
-- with 80 percent of the switchers from Bush going to McCain, a senator from
Arizona, and Bush getting 20 percent of former McCain supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain pulled slightly ahead of Bush on the questions of who is perceived as
most trustworthy and as providing the strongest leadership, according to the
poll.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the Republican switchers were those who said they had been
paying very little attention to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that basically McCain has been able to establish himself with
voters,'' said Linda Fowler, a professor of government and director of
Dartmouth's Rockefeller Center. ``There have been a lot of debates, a lot of
advertising, a lot of free media. People were responding to names, now they're
responding to a more substantial picture of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some candidates are converting people, and Bush isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain improved his appeal with women by 16 percentage points since
November, and is now supported equally by men and women -- 42 percent among each
group, the poll showed. He also improved his standing with independents by 16
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Marise LaPorte, 62, of Milford, attended a town hall meeting held by McCain
last week and liked his straightforward approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems that when something comes up, McCain addresses it. He doesn't
evade the issue. He meets things head-on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes in voters' perceptions of the candidate weren't as pronounced on
the Democratic side. Slightly more people viewed Bradley as more trustworthy
than Gore in the November and January polls, with more than four-out-of 10
saying that about Bradley and under a third saying it about Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Linda O'Mahoney, a Democratic-leaning independent from Pembroke, said
Bradley came across as wishy-washy when she first saw him in television ads and
news coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But when I saw him in person, I was tremendously impressed and moved by
what he had to say,'' she said. ``He was just more dynamic in person.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Troops Pursue Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By VIVIAN SEQUERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Army units backed by helicopter gunships chased
rebels into a mountainous zone south of Bogota on Sunday, a day after the
heaviest fighting in months killed at least 50 people.
</P>
<P>
	   Clashes between the army and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia continued into Sunday near the town of Guayabetal, 30 miles southeast
of Bogota, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels tried to take over the town on Saturday but were repelled by some
1,000 troops backed up by the Colombian Air Force. On Sunday the town was
squarely in government hands, a statement from the army's press office said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This terrorist attempt failed miserably,'' armed services chief Gen.
Fernando Tapias told reporters at an air base near the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Army officials said troops were pursuing the rebels. Hundreds of soldiers
could be seen patrolling a main road in the Guayabetal area.
</P>
<P>
	   A Colombian television reporter covering the fighting near Bogota was
injured in the stomach Sunday when a man who was guiding her mishandled a
grenade and it exploded in his hands. The man, whose identity was not
immediately known, died instantly. The reporter, Astrid Legarda of RCN
television, was in stable condition at a local hospital, station officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Saturday's fighting, residents ran for cover and motorists hid underneath
vehicles while the army's Blackhawk helicopters pounded the mountainous region
with rockets and machine guns. Television images showed a slain rebel, his hands
and feet tied to a branch, being carried out of the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Tapias said 44 rebels died in the fighting on Saturday, although as of
Sunday afternoon reporters had been shown only 20 bodies. Five soldiers and a
policeman also were reported killed. There were reports of several civilian
casualties, but the exact number was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   The army said the original offensive was carried out by 500 FARC rebels. It
was the worst fighting in Colombia in six months.
</P>
<P>
	   The FARC, which has about 15,000 fighters, is one of two main guerrilla
groups that have been fighting the Colombian state for more than 35 years. At
least 30,000 people have died in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's fighting occurred on the same day that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright visited the northern Colombian city of Cartagena to promote a
proposed $1.6 billion aid package to help Colombia fight drugs.
</P>

	   FARC rebel commanders lambasted the proposed aid, saying it will only worsen
the country's armed conflict. The guerrillas control about a third of the
nation, earning huge payoffs from protecting drug traffickers' operations and
taxing peasants who grow illegal drug crops.

<HEADLINE> US Soldier Charged in Kosovo Death  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VITINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An American soldier serving with the
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo was charged Sunday with sexually
assaulting and killing an 11-year-old ethnic Albanian girl, the U.S. military
announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi is accused of murder and indecent acts with a
child, Col. Ellis Golson told reporters. It is the first time a peacekeeper from
any country has been accused of such serious crimes since the 50,000-strong
NATO-led peacekeeping force entered the province on June 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident threatens relations between the Americans and Kosovo civilians
whom the peacekeepers were sent to protect. The peacekeepers were sent in after
the 78-day NATO bombing campaign forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
halt his bloody crackdown against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want them here to give us security if they are going to do
this,'' said Muharram Samakova, a neighbor of the girl's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronghi, 35, is a weapons squad leader assigned to A Company, 3rd Battalion,
504th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, N.C., Golson said. His
hometown was not immediately available. He was being held in detention at nearby
Camp Bondsteel pending transfer to the U.S. Army's confinement facility in
Mannheim, Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl's body was found late Thursday in the countryside near the city of
Vitina, 45 miles southeast of the provincial capital, Pristina, the army said. A
senior U.N. official who asked not to be named said Saturday that the girl
appeared to have been raped before she was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vitina, the slain girl's father, Hamdi Shabiu, showed reporters a photo
of his daughter's corpse that he said a U.S. officer brought him late Thursday,
when he was informed of her death. The girl's face appeared battered and
bruised, with a small cut on her forehead.
</P>
<P>
	   Shabiu said he last saw his daughter early Thursday when she left to go to
the market. She did not return. Neighbors in an apartment complex across the
street told him she had been killed in the basement of the building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They killed her 20 meters (yards) away from the house,'' he said. ``They
took her -- she was only 11 1-2 years old.''
</P>
<P>
	   Serbian state-run television, which regularly criticizes the NATO
peacekeeping mission, said Sunday evening that the case ``exposed an
unprecedented disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was too early to tell how the incident would affect relations between the
Americans and ethnic Albanians. Other similar cases -- like the rape of a
12-year-old Japanese girl by three U.S. servicemen in 1995, for example -- have
sparked rallies against the U.S. military presence.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. peacekeepers are widely seen as heroes by Kosovo Albanians because
of Washington's role in the NATO bombing campaign. On Sunday, groups of ethnic
Albanian children could be seen milling around U.S. military vehicles, laughing,
chatting and playing with the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   However, neighbors of the Shabiu family were outraged.
</P>
<P>
	   Hxsen Islami said local residents had filed complaints with the U.S. command
in Vitina about male soldiers searching young girls for weapons. He said the
complaints had gotten no response.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sorry, but they are touching the girls,'' Islami said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. military officials at the main headquarters at Camp Bondsteel said they
knew nothing about such complaints. Brig. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the head of
Kosovo's American forces, met Saturday night with community leaders in Vitina
and offered his condolences to the family.
</P>
<P>
	   The army said Sunday it will appoint an officer to conduct a pretrial
investigation. The investigator eventually will recommend whether the charges
should be referred to a court martial. Ronghi could be tried before a military
judge or a panel of officers.

<HEADLINE> Septuplets' Parents Endorse Bauer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLISLE, Iowa (AP) -- The famous McCaughey septuplets are playing a role in
the Iowa Caucuses, even though they won't be able to vote for another 16 years.
</P>
<P>
	   A select group of donors can catch a rare glimpse of the McCaugheys this
week. They first donated $250 apiece to Gary Bauer's Republican presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey, who made history in 1997 when the world's first
living set of septuplets were born, have endorsed Bauer's bid for the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCaughey family has intensely guarded the privacy of the children,
granting rare media interviews and making few public appearances. The political
event isn't exploiting the children, campaign spokesman Tim Goeglein said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The McCaughey family just embodies the family values that Gary has talked
about all across the state of Iowa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCaugheys have been outspoken about their views against abortion -- an
issue that is a hallmark of Bauer's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Bauer campaign said two events will be held Thursday
evening, at the McCaughey home in Carlisle, then at a Des Moines hotel without
the children.

	   DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore have solidified their
leads among Iowans planning to attend the Jan. 24 caucuses, a new poll says.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty-seven percent of the 504 Democrats questioned in the Jan. 10-13 poll
for the Quad-City Times said they planned to support Vice President Gore, while
31 percent said they supported Gore's rival, Bill Bradley. Twelve percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Republicans, 43 percent said they planned to vote for Bush, the Texas
governor, while 18 percent said they supported Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven percent of the 500 Republicans questioned said they supported Alan
Keyes, while Sen. John McCain and Gary Bauer each garnered 6 percent support.
Sen. Orrin Hatch was at 1 percent, with 18 percent of those questioned
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points,
reflected gains for both Bush and Forbes from a similar poll conducted in
August, when Bush had 31 percent and Forbes had 11 percent.

</P>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- One of Texas' largest Democratic groups has officially
endorsed Vice President Al Gore in his bid to become the nation's next
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the 2,500-member Tejano Democrats made their selection Saturday,
after a two-day meeting during which Gore and his rival, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, spoke to committee members by phone and answered a series of questions
on immigration, the school dropout rate among Hispanics, health care and
education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know how rare it is for this group to endorse in a presidential
campaign, but I would always remember it, I would always be proud of it and I
will work with you to address the agenda that begins with education,'' Gore said
via telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in the group said Gore's history of working with Texas Democrats earned
him the endorsement. Gore defeated Bradley by a vote of 1,256 to 341.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote mirrored a recent statewide poll conducted by the Houston Chronicle
and The Dallas Morning News showing Gore being favored by 54 percent of the
likely Democratic primary voters, compared to 25 percent for Bradley.

poll.

Communications Inc. showed Bush had a 34-point lead over fellow Republican Sen.
John McCain of Arizona. Democrat Gore led former Sen. Bill Bradley by 30
percentage points, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll of 600 randomly selected registered voters was conducted Jan. 7-14

<HEADLINE> German Prince Suspected in Beating  </HEADLINE>
   By CHEGE MBITIRU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- German Prince Ernest August of Hanover is suspected
in the beating of the German owner of a hotel and beach club on the Kenyan
resort island of Lamu, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is the prime suspect,'' said a police officer, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. The prince, who is married to Princess Caroline of Monaco, has a
residence less than a mile from the hotel in Lamu, about 210 miles southeast of
the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Brunlehner, the owner of the New Lamu Palace Hotel, was in intensive
care Sunday at a hospital in the coastal city of Mombasa following the Friday
night beating.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday Nation newspaper quoted Frank Neugebauer, a business associate of
Brunlehner, as saying the hotelier suffered six broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
	   Neugebauer said the prince had been complaining about the noise from the
club.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement issued by Brunlehner's hotel said he and Kenyan officials had
been trying to measure the noise level coming from the beach club when he was
attacked by a group of men.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I saw Joe receive severe blows to the chest and lower abdomen and was
quite stunned to see how he fell to the ground,'' the statement quoted John
Mwandari, one of the Kenyan officials, as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Mwandari said that some 15 African men took part in the beating, led by a
white person.
</P>
<P>
	   No further details were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Lamu's conservative Muslim traditions, the town and the coastal
islands attract tourists from all over the world, and wealthy locals and
foreigners own vacation homes there.
</P>
<P>
	   The prince has been implicated in violent incidents before.
</P>
<P>
	   He was once fined the equivalent of $47,000 for attacking a photographer.
His bodyguards also allegedly threatened a photographer who tried to take
pictures after the birth of his daughter Alexandra in July. The guards then
allegedly attacked the man at the prince's orders when he saw him again at a
charity event in Hanover in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The police officer in Lamu said police had been posted outside the prince's
residence to prevent any attempt to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   But a source close to the victim, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said later Sunday that the prince fled the island by air, flying to an unknown
destination from an airstrip on nearby Manda Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Police and immigration officials could not be reached for comment Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Women Speak Out Against Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Two women who say they were raped by Chilean secret police
during the rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet backed a last-ditch campaign on Sunday
to stop Britain from sending the former dictator home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For over 20 years I had to try and suppress and forget the memories of my
dreadful experiences,'' said Sara de Witt, who described being blindfolded,
stripped naked, given electric shocks and raped in detention in Chile between
1975 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. de Witt and another Chilean, Christina Navarrete, who also said she was
raped, spoke at a news conference by a protest group, the Chile Committee for
Justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, British Home Secretary Jack Straw said he was inclined to stop
extradition proceedings against Pinochet after four specialists unanimously
found the 84-year-old general unfit to stand trial. A Spanish judge wants to
extradite Pinochet to Spain to try him on torture charges during his 1973-90
military regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chilean protest group plans to send a three-member delegation on Monday
to appeal to London Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner David Dennes to try
to prosecute Pinochet in Britain if the government refuses to extradite him.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, supporters said 84-year-old general, already frail, is now
suffering from a bad attack of flu at the mansion in Wentworth, west of London,
where he is under police guard. The former dictator requires a pacemaker, has
diabetes, has difficulty in walking and last fall suffered a third minor stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, France, which also requested Pinochet's extradition, has asked
Britain for details of his medical report, Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``General Pinochet must be judged. We owe it to the memory of his victims,
the relatives of his victims, because the crimes committed by General Pinochet
are crimes against humanity,'' Guigou told RTL radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's Observer newspaper, which has campaigned against Pinochet, quoted
one specialist, Oxford University professor Sir John Grimley Evans, as saying
the team simply listed Pinochet's illnesses but made no finding on whether he is
fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All we did was to list the medical facts,'' Grimley Evans was quoted as
saying. ``Whether those medical facts constitute ... unequivocal grounds for
decreeing unfitness for trial is outside our field of competence and outside our
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   London's pro-conservative Sunday Telegraph said, however, that the medical
team concluded Pinochet would die long before he is extradited.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Cargo Nears Panama Canal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Administrators of the Panama Canal, which passed
from U.S. to Panamanian control last month, have expressed assurances that a
ship carrying radioactive waste will safely cross the 50-mile-long waterway.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacific Swan, carrying 44 tons of waste from a French nuclear plant to
Japan, is scheduled to make the eight-hour canal trip Monday, canal authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Various independent groups have expressed concern that the ship could be
targeted by terrorist or extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Canal administrators said Friday they had taken steps ``to guarantee the
safe and uninterrupted transit of the Pacific Swan,'' including the deployment
of public security forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Security of the canal has been a hot topic since the United States handed
over control on Dec. 31. Panama has no army, relying instead on an 18,000-strong
national police force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are seriously worried that this ship could be a tempting object for
extremist groups for sabotage,'' said Paul Leventhal, head of the
Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   Leventhal, who was in Panama to observe the passage, recalled that two years
ago activists with the environmental group Greenpeace illegally boarded the
Pacific Swan just before it was to enter the canal.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship returned a year later and passed across the isthmus without
incident.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacific Swan will be the first ship with radioactive cargo to pass
through the canal since the handover.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental groups have asked that such cargo be banned from the waterway,
but canal administrators say accords guaranteeing neutrality prevent them from
doing so if legal and security requirements have been met.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bradley Gain in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE WEBSTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley have
gained support from independents and women in New Hampshire in the last two
months, according to a Dartmouth College-Associated Press poll showing both
slightly ahead in the state that holds the nation's first presidential primary
in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll Sunday suggested that McCain and Bradley also improved their
standing with registered voters in their own parties in New Hampshire, which has
a primary Feb. 1. Both Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Democratic and Republican front-runners nationally, had the advantage in a
November Dartmouth-AP poll of New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest poll, taken from Jan. 9-12, McCain had 42 percent support to
33 percent for Bush in the Republican race; Bradley was at 49 percent to 43
percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous poll, conducted Oct. 31-Nov. 3, had Bush in the lead, 44
percent to 31 percent, and Gore had an edge over Bradley, 48 percent to 41
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The margin of error for the sample of 518 likely voters in the Republican
primary was 4.5 percentage points while it was plus or minus 5 percentage points
for the 418 likely voters in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The other GOP candidates -- publisher Steve Forbes, former U.N. Ambassador
Alan Keyes, conservative activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah --
trail the front-runners. Only Forbes was in double digits, with 11 percent, the
same as in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Republican and Democratic races are very close, with many New
Hampshire polls showing a tilt toward McCain and Bradley, and others showing the
races too close to call or with an edge for Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dartmouth-AP poll disclosed some interesting dynamics in the races that
have developed into tight contests in both parties in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The percentage of voters who have been contacted by phone, 74 percent, or by
mail, 45 percent, by at least one of the candidates' campaigns was markedly
higher than four years ago, possibly reflecting the increased organization and
financing of the challengers in 2000, said Linda Fowler, a professor of
government and director of Dartmouth's Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll included 498 likely voters who were first contacted in early
November and were reinterviewed from Jan. 9-12.
</P>
<P>
	   Among that group, one out of three Republicans and one out of five Democrats
had switched candidates. The differences were most pronounced among Republicans
-- with 80 percent of the switchers from Bush going to McCain, a senator from
Arizona, and Bush getting 20 percent of former McCain supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain pulled slightly ahead of Bush on the questions of who is perceived as
most trustworthy and as providing the strongest leadership, according to the
poll.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the Republican switchers were those who said they had been
paying very little attention to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that basically McCain has been able to establish himself with
voters,'' said Fowler. ``There have been a lot of debates, a lot of advertising,
a lot of free media. People were responding to names, now they're responding to
a more substantial picture of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some candidates are converting people, and Bush isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain improved his appeal with women by 16 percentage points since
November, and is now supported equally by men and women -- 42 percent among each
group, the poll showed. He also improved his standing with independents by 16
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Marise LaPorte, 62, of Milford, attended a town hall meeting held by McCain
last week and liked his straightforward approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems that when something comes up, McCain addresses it. He doesn't
evade the issue. He meets things head-on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes in voters' perceptions of the candidate weren't as pronounced on
the Democratic side. Slightly more people viewed Bradley as more trustworthy
than Gore in the November and January polls, with more than four-out-of 10
saying that about Bradley and under a third saying it about Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Linda O'Mahoney, a Democratic-leaning independent from Pembroke, said
Bradley came across as wishy-washy when she first saw him in television ads and
news coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But when I saw him in person, I was tremendously impressed and moved by
what he had to say,'' she said. ``He was just more dynamic in person.''

<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A man shot his stepson as the boy was leaving church
services Sunday with his family, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cedric Crutcher, 17, was gravely wounded and not expected to live, said
Huntsville police spokesman Wendell Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said 41-year-old Byrom Bonner was waiting in the parking lot when
Crutcher left Northwest Church of Christ about noon. The two exchanged words,
and Bonner allegedly shot Crutcher several times, with one shot striking the
youth in the back of the head, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonner fled the scene and police were searching for him Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonner, who had worked at the U.S. Post Office in Madison, and Crutcher's
mother, Edna, were divorcing, Johnson said. It was not clear whether Bonson
still worked at the post office, Johnson said. Police were called to her home
earlier Sunday because Bonner was there, he said, and the woman had sought a
restraining order against Bonner.

<HEADLINE> NJ tourist, injured in Downing Street crash, arrives home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The New Jersey woman British newspapers are hailing
as the "Heroine of Downing Street" for pushing her children away from an
oncoming car at the prime minister's London residence was sightseeing there
because she has a similar address.
<P>
	   Ursula Webster, 39, of Livingston, suffered a broken leg Saturday when a car
struck her, then smashed into the gates that guard the entrance to Prime
Minister Tony Blair's No. 10 Downing Street residence. Webster, her husband and
their three young sons live at 10 Downing Place in Livingston, Essex County, in
northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Webster left a London hospital Sunday and flew home with her family,
accompanied by a nurse. She arrived late Sunday afternoon at Newark
International Airport, where her mother and other relatives were waiting.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's in excruciating pain," said Webster's aunt, Ann Chrzaszcz, who had
come to take home the three Webster children. "Her leg is shattered."
</P>
<P>
	   Chrzaszcz said Webster had spoken by phone with other relatives after the
accident, saying British doctors told her she would need surgery to put pins in
her knee and ankle.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of that, airport officials whisked Webster to an ambulance that was
to take her to a hospital, and the family avoided a small group of reporters and
photographers.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the Lufthansa flight's arrival here, Webster's mother, Teresa Wnuk of
Nanuet, N.Y., said the family had gone inside the gate at the prime minister's
residence Saturday, taken some photos and were just coming back out through the
gate when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   "She got permission to go inside the gate because of having the same
address," Wnuk said. "They were thanking the bobby, and the car came careening
at them and she was in the middle (of the crowd), so she got the brunt of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Webster, a homemaker, flung her 8-year-old son out of the way just before
she was hit, witnesses said. She was tossed about 15 feet through the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "The car skidded and went straight at the gates," said Sertac Bahri, 19, who
saw the accident. "As that was happening a woman tried to push her child so he
didn't get hurt. She saved the kid, but she didn't save herself."
</P>
<P>
	   Webster was treated overnight at St. Thomas's Hospital in London. Her three
sons and husband were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Wnuk said Webster and her banker husband, Dennis, had been on a week-long
business trip with sons Peter, 3, Alex, 6, and Andrew, 8. The family had been
due to return home Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's a very devoted mother," and had already arranged for relatives to
care for the three children while she is hospitalized in New Jersey, Chrzaszcz
said.
</P>
<P>
	   London police filed charges Sunday against the driver of the car. Stephen
Bonnett, 26, an engineer from Chelmsford, east of London, was charged with
causing grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving, police said. He was due to
appear in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said tourists were clustered at the gates that lead to Downing
Street when Bonnett's car skidded and crashed. It was not immediately clear
whether he is suspected of deliberately crashing into the ornate black iron
gates or whether he simply lost control of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair and his family were at the British prime minister's country residence,
Chequers, when the crash happened. Blair has asked to be kept informed of Ms.
Webster's condition and would be writing to her, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister's official residence is visible through the gates that
seal the end of Downing Street - a short street leading on to Whitehall, the
seat of government.

<HEADLINE> Israel Cabinet OK's Bank Governor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Cabinet narrowly approved the appointment of
David Klein as central bank governor on Sunday, with Israel's finance minister
abstaining because of Klein's support for a tight monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote came after a 10-hour meeting in which Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak reportedly had to beg his ministers to approve the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Three ministers from Barak's Labor party considered to be close to the
premier, including Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, abstained from the vote
after publicly saying that Klein's policies would hurt poor and unemployed
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   The final vote was 10-7 with five abstentions and one minister absent.
</P>
<P>
	   Klein is to assume the position at a ceremony Monday, after President Ezer
Weizman formally approves the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak nominated Klein on Jan. 7 to replace Jacob Frenkel, but the
appointment required Cabinet approval. Israel TV said Barak practically begged
ministers from his own party not to vote against the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Shohat, who said he abstained out of deference to Barak, defended the
premier's lobbying.
</P>
<P>
	   "The prime minister has the right, if he sees he does not have a majority in
the Cabinet, to appeal to the ministers," he told Israel TV. "You can call that
begging or you can say he did his best to persuade them."
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of Klein's appointment see the Bank of Israel's tight monetary
policy as a main cause of economic sluggishness between 1996 and 1999. Klein is
regarded as an even-stauncher inflation hawk than Frenkel was.
</P>
<P>
	   Shohat, who objected to Barak's decision to name Klein, told the Cabinet he
is afraid Klein's policy will stifle economic growth, the Finance Ministry said
in a release.
</P>
<P>
	   He promised to work together with the new governor for the benefit of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Taxpayers to pay half of cost to bailout HMOs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey taxpayers would pay half of a $100
million HMO bailout in a proposal being assembled by the Whitman administration
and legislative leaders.
<P>
	   The proposal, if approved, would require the managed care industry to pay
the other half, ending a yearlong fight between the state's health care
providers and HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would pay bills left behind by two HMOs that failed last year. The
state took control HIP Health Plan of New Jersey and American Preferred Provider
Plan after they ran into money troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors and hospitals continued to treat patients covered under the plans
and argued that they did so with the understanding that they eventually would be
reimbursed. The money from the plan would go toward paying those bills.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's deputy chief of staff, the president of the New Jersey
Hospital Association, the Medical Society of New Jersey, and officials from the
Assembly and Senate met late last week to put together the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that we are close to an agreement with the hospital association
and the medical society," Whitman spokesman Jayne O'Connor told The Star-Ledger
of Newark in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Physicians and lobbyists for the state's hospitals said although the amount
of money won't cover all the costs, it at least reduces the debt. Irv Ratner,
president of the New Jersey Medical Society, said the amount owed to hospitals
totals $150 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "Considering the financial distress that hospitals are currently facing and
the charity care shortfall, this money is not only much needed, but it's long
overdue," said Peter J. Lillo, the lobbyist for the hospital association who
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal was expected to be introduced in the Senate Health Committee
and to the Assembly Banking and Insurance Committee this week.
</P>
<P>
	   If Whitman signs the bill into law, about $67 million of the $100 million
would be paid out shortly after that, followed by $17 million next year and the
rest in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Taxpayers would pay through the state's general fund, and the HMOs would be
taxed $50 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's 19 HMOs oppose the plan's tax, saying the surviving managed care
plans shouldn't have to bail out those that have failed. The HMOs also object to
the plan's stipulations that the tax cannot be passed along to consumers in the
form of higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where does any health insurer get their money if they don't get it from the
premiums they collect?" said Paul R. Langevin Jr., the HMO industry's top
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
	   The insurance industry has succeeded in stalling an HMO tax in the
Legislature for months.
</P>
<P>
	   One version of the tax would have established a permanent fund to pay health
care providers if any other HMOs failed.
</P>
<P>
	   That bill, which was changed into a $120 million one-time bailout for the
doctors and hospitals left with unpaid bills after the two HMOs failed, died
after the legislative session ended last Monday.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Publisher Jack Lake Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- John B. ``Jack'' Lake, who as publisher of the
St. Petersburg Times saw the newspaper grow in prominence as the city he loved
grew too, has died. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Lake died Saturday at his Snell Isle home after an apparent stroke, family
members said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lake was a community leader as much as a newspaper leader. He helped bring
the Salvador Dali Museum to St. Petersburg and paved the way for the city to
lure a Major League Baseball expansion franchise, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jack Lake combined newspaper values and community values better than any
man I've known,'' said Andrew Barnes, editor, chairman and chief executive
officer of the Times. ``He had a lot to do with making St. Petersburg the place
we all want to live.''
</P>
<P>
	   Along with Jim Healey, Lake was one of the first to dream that this quiet
but growing waterfront city across the bay from Tampa should have its own big
league baseball team. He threw out the first pitch of the first minor league
game when the Devil Rays' farm system started playing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He loved St. Petersburg so much,'' said baseball legend and close friend
Stan Musial. ``Jack was somebody who loved life and loved people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lake started his newspaper career after serving in World War II at the Eagle
Gazette, a small daily in Lancaster, Ohio. He began working in classified
advertising and stayed at the Eagle Gazette 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   After returning to active duty in the Korean War and a stint as advertising
manager at the Elizabeth Journal in New Jersey, Lake came to St. Petersburg in
1960.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Times, he rose from advertising director through the ranks until
taking over as publisher in 1971. He retired in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   His years at the paper were marked by rapid circulation growth as the
community grew.
</P>
<P>
	   The year before Lake arrived, the Times daily circulation was 100,000. The
year he left, it was 270,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Lake also served as president of the St. Petersburg Area Chamber of Commerce
and the Suncoast Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole town and all of Florida owe Jack enduring thanks for his civic
vision and dominant leadership,'' said Eugene Patterson, editor emeritus of the
Times.

<HEADLINE> Chileans Vote for President  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chileans went to the polls Sunday to select their
next president, with both candidates promising to hasten the nation's recovery
from its worst recession in more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Joaquin Lavin and socialist Ricardo Lagos, both touting similar
economic programs, battled to a virtual draw in the first-round election in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's election appeared nearly as close. With about half the votes
counted, Lagos was slightly ahead with about 51.4 percent to Lavin's 48.6
percent, Deputy Interior Minister Guillermo Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout was heavy, with more than 7.3 million of some 8 million registered
voters peacefully casting ballots in this South American nation. Polls closed
with no reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos' campaign chief Soledad Alvear, declining to claim victory, said only
that ``there was a clear trend in favor of Lagos.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin's top adviser, Juan Antonio Coloma, urged supporters ``to remain
cautious and calm until we know the final results.''
</P>
<P>
	   Economic issues dominated the campaign as voters decided between Lavin, 46,
of the right-wing Alliance for Chile, and Lagos, 61, of the Concertacion -- a
center-left coalition that has governed Chile since democracy's return a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, the candidates sought to outdo each other with similar promises
to fight rising street crime, aid struggling farmers, and create hundreds of
thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   As he cast his vote at a school in the capital, Santiago, Lavin described
the runoff as a ``vote-by-vote fight'' and predicted ``a very tight victory''
for himself.
</P>
<P>
	   He was drowned out by a crush of supporters who shouted, ``We feel it! We
feel it! Lavin is our president!''
</P>
<P>
	   Also predicting a triumph, Lagos voted under similar circumstances at
another Santiago school, calling the election ``a party for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he added, ``The party ends tonight and tomorrow, everybody to work to
build a better Chile for all.''
</P>
<P>
	   The winner will be inaugurated March 11 for a six-year term, succeeding
Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat who was constitutionally barred from
re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost boyish looking at 46, Lavin is a successful two-term mayor of Las
Condes, Santiago's swankiest suburb. He is acclaimed for putting more police on
that suburb's streets and ending traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin was a strong supporter of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 1973-90 military
regime. He worked as a junior economist at the Planning Ministry under Pinochet
and has written several books praising his regime.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, however, Lavin tried to distance himself from the
former dictator, saying Pinochet's rule is a thing of the past, and that it was
now time to look to the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos, a former Pinochet opponent, has attracted attention by promising
unemployment insurance in Chile, a country of 15 million people seeking to
improve its social safety net.
</P>
<P>
	   An academic for many years, with a Ph.D. in economics from Duke University,
Lagos emerged as a leading figure in the fight against Pinochet in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   After leftist guerrillas made an attempt on Pinochet's life in 1986, Lagos
was one of several leftists arrested by state security agents in a crackdown.
Lagos apparently had nothing to do with that attempt, and after spending several
days in jail, he came out to work full time for the restoration of democratic
rule. He remains a hero for Pinochet foes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been detained in Britain since October 1998 on a warrant from a
Spanish judge who wants the general to stand trial for alleged human rights
abuses during his iron rule.
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw said Tuesday that a panel of doctors
concluded Pinochet is too ill to face trial, and that he felt inclined to send
the former dictator home.

<HEADLINE> Bush says his tax plan is more 'realistic'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Texas Gov. George W. Bush says his tax-cut plan is
more realistic than those offered by his Republican presidential rivals because
it would leave less of the budget surplus available to tempt Congress into
spending it. Sen. John McCain countered that Bush's priorities for the projected
surplus are all wrong.
<P>
	   In an interview aired Sunday on CNN's "Late Edition," Bush said his
five-year, $483 billion tax-relief proposal - which would consume most of the
anticipated surplus not already earmarked for Social Security - would help curb
bigger government.
</P>
<P>
	   "The surest way to make sure the budgets aren't bloated is to give the
people their money back," Bush said in the taped interview.
</P>
<P>
	   A five-year, $237 billion tax cut offered by McCain, R-Ariz., would reserve
about $729 billion to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent as the baby boom
generation retires. But Bush said his own plan is "more realistic" because it
doesn't depend on Congress to safeguard that money.
</P>
<P>
	   "He trusts money left in Washington, D.C., will be properly spent," Bush
said of his rival. "I happen to think it's going to be spent on bigger
government and more programs."
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," argued that Bush's tax cut
is too skewed toward the wealthy and does little to protect the big government
retirement programs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm saying it's a matter of priorities," McCain said Sunday, a day after he
and the Texas governor sparred over taxes during a debate in Iowa. "I'm saying
we have obligations, and I'm saying it's conservative to make sure that we make
the promises hold that we made in the form of Social Security, Medicare, and not
lay a huge debt down on future generations of Americans."
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, meanwhile, dismissed Bush and McCain as the "timid twins" on
tax cuts and touted his proposal for a flat tax and an end to the federal tax
code as being far bolder than anything the governor and senator have advanced.
</P>
<P>
	   "I get to the heart of the problem: get rid of the code, don't tinker around
the edges," Forbes said on ABC's "This Week."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes also began airing a television commercial Sunday in Iowa, site of the
Jan. 24 caucuses that open the presidential nominating season. The ad stresses
character and repeats the millionaire publisher's contention that he isn't
beholden to any special interests. "He'll keep his word," the announcer says.
"Character matters, a lot."
</P>
<P>
	   The new ad is a follow-up to one running in Iowa and New Hampshire that
accuses Bush of breaking his no-tax pledge as governor. A Forbes aide said
Sunday that the ad is meant to draw contrasts between Forbes and Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In other issues Sunday:
</P>
<P>
	   - Bush, McCain and Forbes agreed that South Carolina voters should determine
whether the Confederate flag continues to fly atop its state capitol and that it
should not be an issue for the presidential campaign. "That's a legitimate
debate that will be decided by the people of South Carolina," said Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   - Bush said if he were in office now he would withhold International
Monetary Fund aid and Export-Import Bank loans from Russia until interim
president Vladimir Putin halted bombing in Chechnya that hits "innocent women
and children." But that would not extend to U.S. aid intended to dismantle
nuclear weapons. "I think that's a different issue as far as I'm concerned," he
said. McCain also has said he would withhold such funding from Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   - McCain said he was concerned about industry mergers and that the Senate
Commerce Committee he chairs will hold hearings on the proposed union of America
Online and Time Warner. "You reach a point at some time where it's not good for
the consumer and it stifles competition."
</P>
<P>
	   - Forbes rejected criticism that his TV ads upbraiding Bush over a Texas
tax-cut pledge will hurt the GOP in the November election. "Do we want an
honest, vigorous debate, or do we want to pretend there are no differences
between the candidates?" Forbes said. "This is not going to be a coronation.
This is going to be a real contest."

<HEADLINE> Civil rights leader blasts Wallingford for not celebrating MLK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - National civil rights leaders say Wallingford is
showing disrespect by not closing government offices on Martin Luther King Jr.
Day.
<P>
	   "Maybe the nation needs to know that in a state that is usually given a
liberal image, there's this pocket that hasn't joined the 21st century," the
Rev. Al Sharpton said after addressing a Hartford church congregation Sunday.
"This one particular community and some others around the North are making an
absolute decision to say that they do not adhere to the principles that Dr. King
stood for."
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a state workers' union and state NAACP news conference Saturday,
the Rev. Joseph Lowery urged town business and religious leaders to press
government to close on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they are spitting in the face of all the sacrifices of all the
people in this country who tried to bring about racial brotherhood and an end to
discrimination," Lowery said. "This seems to be more akin to Mississippi than to
the great state of Connecticut."
</P>
<P>
	   Town officials said Lowery's words will do little to help Wallingford
resolve the controversy. Wallingford is the only town in the state that keeps
its government offices open on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the government is racist," Town Councilor Tom Zappala said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lowery, 78, founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King
and the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy in 1957. He also played a major role in
ending segregation in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   He ended his 20-year tenure as president of the SCLC last week and was
succeeded by Martin Luther King III.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected the climate to be cold, but I did not expect the spirit of the
people to be cold," Lowery said at the annual United Auto Workers dinner
honoring King.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallingford Mayor William W. Dickinson Jr. wants the town's unionized
workers to swap the King holiday for another holiday, saying it would allow
workers to honor King without costing taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he admires King, but his position requires him to get the best deal
for taxpayers and to avoid giving away benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The $32,000 it would cost the town to close for the day is a small sacrifice
to honor King, said Roger Vann, president of the Connecticut chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP has tried to give town and union negotiators time to work out
their differences over the holiday. But Vann said the issue may be an indication
of a "larger problem in Wallingford."
</P>
<P>
	   The organization will address the town's poor minority hiring record and
other issues if progress is not made, Vann said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor Turns 80  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH J. HARPAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The familiar melody and lyrics of ``Happy Birthday'' echoed
off the stone walls of St. Patrick's Cathedral Sunday as worshippers saluted
Cardinal John O'Connor the day after he turned 80.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, this is wonderful, but does anybody have a job for me?'' the
cardinal quipped after the singing and a standing ovation from the 3,000
parishoners ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Cardinals lose their voting power for new popes once they turn 80, and Pope
John Paul II is expected to name a replacement for O'Connor soon. O'Connor is
also in frail health, unable to stand for long periods as he slowly recovers
from a brain tumor that was removed in August.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this time when your illness makes new demands upon your spiritual and
physical resources, I pray that you will press forward, with faith and hope,''
the pope said in a letter read during the Sunday service.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, the Vatican announces new appointments for U.S. posts on
Tuesdays, and O'Connor's successor could be named as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
	   At a gala Saturday night marking his birthday, O'Connor displayed a healthy
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will soon be evicted,'' O'Connor joked Saturday night at the
Waldorf-Astoria. ``I will have the distinction of bring the first living
cardinal to be thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Included among the 1,500 people attending were several men whose names have
been mentioned as possible successors: Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis;
Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, who heads the archdiocese for the U.S. Military; and
Bishop Henry Mansell of Buffalo, a former top aide to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   The dinner raised $5.2 million for Catholic charities, including support for
parochial schools in the New York Archdiocese and funding for a seminary
position named for the cardinal.

<HEADLINE> King's Words, Legacy Remembered  </HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The America that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned
comes closer to reality each time someone reaches out to help someone else, his
widow said Sunday at a service summit convened in the slain civil rights
leader's honor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the
compassionate actions of its members,'' Coretta Scott King said. To serve, she
said, quoting her husband, all one needs is ``a heart of grace and a soul
generated by love.''
</P>
<P>
	   The summit at Georgia State University and services at King's church,
Ebenezer Baptist, were the focal point of Atlanta's King holiday observances
Sunday. King would have turned 71 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the federal holiday honoring King, Vice President Al Gore is
scheduled to speak during a service at Ebenezer Baptist Church, and South
African President Thabo Mbeki, Gov. Roy Barnes and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell
plan to lead a march in King's honor.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, around the country, several service activities are planned,
including blood drives, neighborhood cleanups and Habitat for Humanity
house-building projects.
</P>
<P>
	   Community leaders in New Orleans plan to announce a new gun buyback program.
</P>
<P>
	   In Boston, volunteers plan to clean up trash near Northeastern University
and hold an educational fair to teach youngsters about King's life and legacy.
In Washington D.C., volunteers plan to renovate the Martin Luther King Homeless
Shelter.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest citywide service project is planned in Philadelphia, where more
than 18,000 volunteers are expected to join in projects including planting
trees, painting schools, clearing out abandoned houses and sorting groceries at
food banks.
</P>
<P>
	   The King holiday, which President Reagan signed into law in 1983, has widely
become known as a day of volunteerism and community service. The King family and
President Clinton have urged people to participate in service projects as the
best way to continue King's work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The concept here is that service to others is a way to connect to the
divine,'' Mrs. King said Sunday. She urged the service summit audience to fight
against racism, sexism, homophobia, discrimination and environmental destruction
with ``a healing and hopeful heart.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``History is calling for this generation to put right the injustices of this
nation and this world,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Travel Agents Boycott American  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- Travel agents from 13 English-speaking
countries in the Caribbean announced Sunday that they will stop selling American
Airlines tickets because of a dispute over commissions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Caribbean Travel Agents Association is angry at the airline's decision
to cut their commissions to 6 percent from 9 percent, according to the group's
president, Wayne Rodriguez. Members decided to launch the boycott during a
meeting in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "The boycott will entail moving the market share away from American Airlines
onto the other carriers that continue to offer us the 9 percent," Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines is the largest carrier in the Caribbean with more than 70
percent of flights, but it is facing challenges from other U.S. carriers,
including TWA. American said the cut in commissions was necessary to hold down
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez said agents will try to persuade travelers to take other airlines.
If they insist on American, agents will refer them to the airline's own ticket
offices.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will do so knowing that (American) does not have the facilities or
capabilities of handling the traveling public -- they're not geared for it,"
Rodriguez said.

<HEADLINE> Socialist Wins Chile Election  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Socialist Ricardo Lagos narrowly defeated
conservative rival Joaquin Lavin on Sunday in a runoff election for president
dominated by economic issues.
</P>
<P>
	   With 87.5 percent of votes counted, Lagos had 51.3 percent of the vote to
Lavin's 48.6 percent, Deputy Interior Minister Guillermo Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin conceded defeat, then quickly went to Lagos' campaign headquarters at
a downtown hotel to congratulate him. Both received an ovation as they appeared
in front of cheering Lagos supporters on a balcony and hugged each other with
their wives at their sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin waged one of the closest races in decades for a conservative
candidate, forcing Sunday's runoff after holding Lagos to a virtual tie in the
first round of voting on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos won as candidate of the center-left coalition that has governed Chile
since the end of the country's military dictatorship in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of Lagos supporters gathered at his headquarters, cheering the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout was heavy, with more than 7.3 million of some 8 million registered
voters peacefully casting ballots in this South American nation. Polls closed
with no reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic issues dominated the campaign as voters decided between Lavin, 46,
of the right-wing Alliance for Chile, and Lagos, 61, of the Concertacion
center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, the candidates sought to outdo each other with similar promises
to fight rising street crime, aid struggling farmers, and create hundreds of
thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   As he cast his vote at a school in the capital, Santiago, Lavin described
the runoff as a ``vote-by-vote fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos voted under similar circumstances at another Santiago school, calling
the election ``a party for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The winner will be inaugurated March 11 for a six-year term, succeeding
Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat who was constitutionally barred from
re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost boyish looking at 46, Lavin is a successful two-term mayor of Las
Condes, Santiago's swankiest suburb. He is acclaimed for putting more police on
that suburb's streets and ending traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin was a strong supporter of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 1973-90 military
regime. He worked as a junior economist at the Planning Ministry under Pinochet
and has written several books praising his regime.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, however, Lavin tried to distance himself from the
former dictator, saying Pinochet's rule is a thing of the past, and that it was
now time to look to the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos, a former Pinochet opponent, has attracted attention by promising
unemployment insurance in Chile, a country of 15 million people seeking to
improve its social safety net.
</P>
<P>
	   An academic for many years, with a Ph.D. in economics from Duke University,
Lagos emerged as a leading figure in the fight against Pinochet in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   After leftist guerrillas made an attempt on Pinochet's life in 1986, Lagos
was one of several leftists arrested by state security agents in a crackdown.
Lagos apparently had nothing to do with that attempt, and after spending several
days in jail, he came out to work full time for the restoration of democratic
rule. He remains a hero for Pinochet foes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been detained in Britain since October 1998 on a warrant from a
Spanish judge who wants the general to stand trial for alleged human rights
abuses during his iron rule.
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw said Tuesday that a panel of doctors
concluded Pinochet is too ill to face trial, and that he felt inclined to send
the former dictator home.

<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A man shot his stepson as the boy was leaving church
services Sunday with his family, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cedric Crutcher, 17, died hours later at a local hospital, said Huntsville
police spokesman Wendell Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said 41-year-old Byrom Bonner was waiting in the parking lot when
Crutcher left Northwest Church of Christ about noon. The two exchanged words,
and Bonner allegedly shot Crutcher several times, with one shot striking the
youth in the back of the head, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonner fled the scene and police were searching for him Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonner, who had worked at the U.S. Post Office in Madison, and Crutcher's
mother, Edna, were divorcing, Johnson said. It was not clear whether Bonson
still worked at the post office, Johnson said. Police were called to her home
earlier Sunday because Bonner was there, he said, and the woman had sought a
restraining order against Bonner.

<HEADLINE> Christian Democrats Head Vows Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The leader of Germany's embattled conservatives pleaded with
the party to back him Sunday despite his growing entanglement in a campaign
funding scandal that has spread beyond former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble insisted in a newspaper article that he would not resign
as the Christian Democrats' chairman even though he accepted $52,000 from a
businessman who is a key figure in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   But Schaeuble's weakened position was underlined by the angry mood when he
spoke at a weekend rally in northern Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Party members shouted, ``Resignation'' and ``We want to know the truth,'' at
the Saturday night meeting in Kiel, which launched the party's campaign for Feb.
27 state elections in Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet he vowed to fight on, writing in a Sunday newspaper that ``I will do
everything within my power and strength to lead the Christian Democratic Union
out of this difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``For that, I need the help and solidarity of everyone in the CDU,'' he said
in Welt am Sonntag.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble has been widely condemned for disclosing a 1994 donation by
businessman Karlheinz Schreiber only last week -- more than a month after
parliament began an inquiry into whether donations influenced decisions during
Kohl's 16 years in power.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDU leader conceded the money was wrongly reported, but denied
wrongdoing, blaming a former party treasurer instead.
</P>
<P>
	   But Germany's justice minister urged the whole national Christian Democrat
leadership to step down Sunday -- one of the sharpest attacks yet by the
governing Social Democrats, who have been largely content simply to let their
rivals sink into ever deeper trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe that anyone can trust the CDU leadership after what has
happened,'' Herta Daeubler-Gmelin said on ARD television.
</P>
<P>
	   Two newsweeklies raised questions about parts of Schaeuble's story over the
weekend, including the exact timing of the cash handover and whether Schaeuble
received the money personally, as he claims, or through an intermediary.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble was Kohl's hand-picked successor as party leader after the
chancellor lost 1998 elections after 16 years in power. Polls last week showed
Germans split about whether he should quit.
</P>
<P>
	   Fallout from the scandal has spread, to several state branches of the
conservatives, including Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
	   A local party leader, Johann Wadephul, has written to Kohl asking he help
clear up what happened to a donation the national party organization channeled
to the former state party chief in 1997, the Focus newsweekly reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Even more damaging were irregularities by the Christian Democrats in Hesse,
where a former party leader revealed last week that the state branch transferred
$6.8 million to its coffers from a foreign account -- reportedly in Switzerland
-- between 1989 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount involved was the biggest yet in the scandal, and Schaeuble spoke
of a ``catastrophe'' Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Local Social Democrats and Greens said Sunday they would seek a confidence
vote against Hesse governor Roland Koch, who has said he won't resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Kohl has canceled an appearance at a Berlin award ceremony
because of his involvement in a campaign funding scandal, a newspaper said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Plans had called for Kohl to receive the $15,000 Adolph Bentinck Prize from
Jacques Delors, former head of the European Union's executive Commission, at a
gala attended by other former statesmen, Bild am Sonntag said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Participating in this event seemed rather inappropriate at the present
time,'' the paper quoted Kohl's spokesman Michael Roik as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An American tourist injured by a car that smashed into
the gates guarding the entrance to Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street
residence left a British hospital Sunday and flew home to New Jersey accompanied
by a nurse.
</P>
<P>
	   Ursula Webster, 39, suffered a broken leg in the incident Saturday afternoon
and was treated overnight at St. Thomas's Hospital. Her three sons and husband
were not hurt. Webster flung her 8-year-old son out of the way just before she
was hit, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   Webster arrived in New Jersey with her family Sunday at Newark International
Airport, where her mother and other relatives were waiting.
</P>
<P>
	   Police filed charges Sunday against the driver of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Bonnett, 26, an engineer from Chelmsford, east of London, was
charged with causing grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving, police said. He
was due to appear in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said tourists were clustered at the gates that lead to Downing
Street when Bonnett's car skidded and crashed. It was not immediately clear
whether he is suspected of deliberately crashing into the ornate black iron
gates or whether he simply lost control of the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Webster's mother, Teresa Wnuk, said her daughter's family went inside the
gates that block access to No. 10 Downing Street to take photographs because the
Websters have a similar address in the United States. They live at 10 Downing
Place in Livingston, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She got permission to go inside the gate because of having the same
address,'' Wnuk said.

<HEADLINE> Socialist Wins Chile Election  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Socialist Ricardo Lagos narrowly defeated
conservative rival Joaquin Lavin on Sunday in a runoff election for president
dominated by economic issues.
</P>
<P>
	   With 87.5 percent of votes counted, Lagos had 51.3 percent of the vote to
Lavin's 48.6 percent, Deputy Interior Minister Guillermo Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin conceded defeat, then quickly went to Lagos' campaign headquarters at
a downtown hotel to congratulate him. Both received an ovation as they appeared
in front of cheering Lagos supporters on a balcony and hugged each other with
their wives at their sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin waged one of the closest races in decades for a conservative
candidate, forcing Sunday's runoff after holding Lagos to a virtual tie in the
first round of voting on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am confident that in the future, the message of change that we brought
into Chilean politics will prevail,'' Lavin told supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that Lagos ``can count on me. I am at his disposal to help him face
Chile's problems and to work for unity among Chileans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos won as candidate of the center-left coalition that has governed Chile
since the end of the country's military dictatorship in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout was heavy, with more than 7.3 million of some 8 million registered
voters peacefully casting ballots in this South American nation. Polls closed
with no reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic issues dominated the campaign as voters decided between Lavin, 46,
of the right-wing Alliance for Chile, and Lagos, 61, of the Concertacion
center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, the candidates sought to outdo each other with similar promises
to fight rising street crime, aid struggling farmers, and create hundreds of
thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   As he cast his vote at a school in the capital, Santiago, Lavin described
the runoff as a ``vote-by-vote fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos voted under similar circumstances at another Santiago school, calling
the election ``a party for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The winner will be inaugurated March 11 for a six-year term, succeeding
Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat who was constitutionally barred from
re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost boyish looking at 46, Lavin is a successful two-term mayor of Las
Condes, Santiago's swankiest suburb. He is acclaimed for putting more police on
that suburb's streets and ending traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin was a strong supporter of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 1973-90 military
regime. He worked as a junior economist at the Planning Ministry under Pinochet
and has written several books praising his regime.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, however, Lavin tried to distance himself from the
former dictator, saying Pinochet's rule is a thing of the past, and that it was
now time to look to the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos, a former Pinochet opponent, has attracted attention by promising
unemployment insurance in Chile, a country of 15 million people seeking to
improve its social safety net.
</P>
<P>
	   An academic for many years, with a Ph.D. in economics from Duke University,
Lagos emerged as a leading figure in the fight against Pinochet in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   After leftist guerrillas made an attempt on Pinochet's life in 1986, Lagos
was one of several leftists arrested by state security agents in a crackdown.
Lagos apparently had nothing to do with that attempt, and after spending several
days in jail, he came out to work full time for the restoration of democratic
rule. He remains a hero for Pinochet foes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been detained in Britain since October 1998 on a warrant from a
Spanish judge who wants the general to stand trial for alleged human rights
abuses during his iron rule.
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw said Tuesday that a panel of doctors
concluded Pinochet is too ill to face trial in Spain, and that he felt inclined
to send the former dictator home.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates have said that, if elected, they would allow Pinochet to be
put on trial in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Report: Drug Giants Agree To Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceutical heavyweights Glaxo Wellcome PLC and
SmithKline Beecham PLC have reached agreement to merge, forming the world's
largest drugmaker, The Financial Times reported in its Monday editions.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, to be announced later Monday, creates a new industry giant,
to be called Glaxo SmithKline, with a market capitalization of 115 billion
pounds ($184 billion), the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   The planned merger still must be approved by the Federal Trade Commission
and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for SmithKline refused to confirm the newspaper report. No one
from Glaxo returned phone calls Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The new group would be headquartered in London, but largely run from a new
operational base in the United States, possibly New Jersey, the London-based
newspaper said. The group would have a 7.5 percent share of the global
pharmaceutical market.
</P>
<P>
	   The planned merger demonstrates the pressure facing even the biggest names
in the pharmaceutical industry to consolidate with rivals as a way to afford the
rising costs of developing and selling new medicines. It is also likely to
trigger a new round of takeovers and mergers throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Only last week, Pfizer Inc. emerged as the likely winner in the battle for
U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowing to pressure from its investors, Warner-Lambert management said they
would negotiate a buyout from Pfizer, backing away from a previously announced
merger deal with American Home Products Corp. If that deal goes forward, the
combined group would have 6.5 percent of the global market.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Glaxo and SmithKline were only disclosed on Friday. Previous
discussions between the two groups collapsed two years ago over differences
between their top executives.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, the companies expect cost savings of about 1.1 billion
pounds ($1.76 billion) after three years, the Financial Times reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The group will have a worldwide work force of 105,000, the newspaper said.
But over three years, about 10 percent of those jobs will go as the new company
makes cuts in middle management and administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger is expected to take at least six months to complete and will be
realized by an offer of Glaxo or SmithKline shares, resulting in a 58.75 to
41.25 percent split in Glaxo's favor, the Financial Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections, including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
antidepressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   After news emerged that the companies were in merger talks, analysts said a
consolidation would make sense. The two companies have complementary drug
portfolios, and a merger would let them pool their research and development
funds and would give the merged company a bigger sales and marketing force.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, after announcing that talks had resumed, both companies saw their
U.S. shares surge on the New York Stock Exchange. Glaxo rose $2.25 to $60.25,
while SmithKline rose $3 to $69.75.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of the combined company would total $17.8
billion, based on 1998 annual figures. That would surpass the $15.9 billion in
sales of a combined Pfizer-Warner-Lambert.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Troops Pursue Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By VIVIAN SEQUERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Army units backed by helicopter gunships chased
rebels into a mountainous zone south of Bogota on Sunday, a day after the
heaviest fighting in months killed at least 50 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The clashes started as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited
the northern Colombian city of Cartagena on Saturday to promote a proposed $1.6
billion aid package to help Colombia fight drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clashes between the army and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia continued into Sunday near the town of Guayabetal, 30 miles southeast
of Bogota, the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels tried to take over the town on Saturday but were repelled by some
1,000 troops backed up by the Colombian Air Force. On Sunday the town was
squarely in government hands, a statement from the army's press office said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This terrorist attempt failed miserably,'' armed services chief Gen.
Fernando Tapias told reporters at an air base near the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Army officials said troops were pursuing the rebels. Hundreds of soldiers
could be seen patrolling a main road in the Guayabetal area.
</P>
<P>
	   A Colombian television reporter covering the fighting near Bogota was
injured in the stomach Sunday when a man who was guiding her mishandled a
grenade and it exploded in his hands. The man, whose identity was not
immediately known, died instantly. The reporter, Astrid Legarda of RCN
television, was in stable condition at a local hospital, station officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Saturday's fighting, residents ran for cover and motorists hid underneath
vehicles while the army's Blackhawk helicopters pounded the mountainous region
with rockets and machine guns. Television images showed a slain rebel, his hands
and feet tied to a branch, being carried out of the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Tapias said 44 rebels died in the fighting on Saturday, although as of
Sunday afternoon reporters had been shown only 20 bodies. Five soldiers and a
policeman also were reported killed. There were reports of several civilian
casualties, but the exact number was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   The army said the original offensive was carried out by 500 FARC rebels. It
was the worst fighting in Colombia in six months.
</P>
<P>
	   The FARC, which has about 15,000 fighters, is one of two main guerrilla
groups that have been fighting the Colombian state for more than 35 years. At
least 30,000 people have died in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   FARC rebel commanders lambasted the proposed U.S. aid, saying it will only
worsen the country's armed conflict. The guerrillas control about a third of the
nation, earning huge payoffs from protecting drug traffickers' operations and
taxing peasants who grow illegal drug crops.

<HEADLINE> Titans 19, Colts 16  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans didn't need another miracle. They
just needed Eddie George, their defense and some help from instant replay.
</P>
<P>
	   George scored on a 68-yard run on the third play of the second half Sunday
to lead the Titans to a 19-16 win over the Indianapolis Colts and a trip to
Jacksonville for the AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense, even with star rookie Jevon Kearse producing next to nothing,
held Peyton Manning and the prolific Indianapolis offense to just three field
goals until Manning ran 15 yards for a touchdown with 1:51 left.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was too late -- Yancey Thigpen recovered an onside kick and the
Titans ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
	   George, who finished with 162 yards in 26 carries, hoped to do well against
an Indianapolis defense that allowed 4.2 yards per carry and was depleted by the
absence of veteran linebacker Cornelius Bennett.
</P>
<P>
	   George carried just nine times for 38 yards in a first half that ended with
the Colts ahead 9-6 on three field goals by Mike Vanderjagt to two by Al Del
Greco.
</P>
<P>
	   But early in the second half, he took a handoff from Steve McNair, cut
through a huge hole in the middle of the Indianapolis line and outraced the
secondary for the game's first TD. Del Greco added two more field goals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans, who needed a lateral that turned into a 75-yard kickoff return
with three seconds left to beat Buffalo in a wild-card game last week, will play
in the franchise's first conference title game in 20 years. Tennessee handed
Jacksonville its only two losses this season, 20-19 in Jacksonville and 41-14 at
home three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tennessee defense, meanwhile, shut down an offense that averaged 26.4
points and was held to less than 20 points just three times during the regular
season, once in a meaningless final game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans held Edgerrin James, the offensive rookie of the year, to 56
yards in 20 carries, even without much hindrance from Kearse, the defensive
rookie of the year. But if Kearse rarely got close to Manning, the other
defensive linemen did, led by Kenny Holmes, the other end, although neither team
had a sack in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tennessee secondary, led by safety Blaine Bishop, also played well.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning, who completed 62.1 percent of his passes during the regular season,
was under 50 percent Sunday, going 19 of 43 for 227 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Replay finally did in the Colts, who finished 13-4, but left coach Jim Mora
winless in five playoff games, the first four with New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   Five minutes into the fourth quarter, with the Titans leading 16-9, the
Colts' Terrence Wilkins broke a punt return and finally went out of bounds at
the Tennessee 3.
</P>
<P>
	   But replay showed that Wilkins stepped out of bounds. And while Tennessee
had to burn a timeout to get its challenge heard over the din of the crowd at
the RCA Dome, it paid off -- referee Johnny Grier viewed the replay and brought
the ball back 63 yards to the Colts 33.
</P>
<P>
	   That did it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts went three and out and Derrick Mason's 19-yard punt return to the
Indianapolis 42 set up Del Greco's fourth field goal. On the next series, Kearse
got into the act, tipping a pass attempt by Manning on third down.

<HEADLINE> 2 Burnt Bodies Found in Egypt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOHAG, Egypt (AP) -- Security forces found two burnt bodies early Sunday
outside a southern town where more than 20 people have been killed in
Muslim-Christians clashes this month, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   State security prosecutors have ordered the arrest of 59 people for their
alleged role in the Jan. 2 violence in el-Kusheh, 275 miles south of Cairo, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those sought by authorities include a Coptic Orthodox priest in the
Christian-majority town, the Rev. Gabriel Abdel-Masih, who is wanted for
questioning on allegations that he opened fire on a group of Muslims in the
village.
</P>
<P>
	   The authorities have deployed a security force of 6,000 men in el-Kusheh and
neighboring villages, the pro-government Rose El-Youssef magazine reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The discovery of the two bodies in a field raises the death toll to 23
people, comprising 19 Coptic Christians, one Muslim and three unidentified
persons. Thirty-four people were wounded in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting reportedly began after a Christian shopkeeper refused credit to
a Muslim customer. It developed rapidly into the worst communal violence in
recent memory with shootings, mob attacks and arson in el-Kusheh and neighboring
villages.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose El-Youssef said the government had allocated $580,000 to rebuild the
gutted shops and houses in the village.
</P>
<P>
	   An autopsy will be performed on the bodies found Sunday to ascertain their
identities, ages and causes of death, police said on customary condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Coptic Christians make up about 10 percent of Egypt's 64 million people who
are predominantly Muslim. Although the two communities have generally lived in
peace, Copts sometimes complain of discrimination and have been attacked by
Muslim fundamentalists.

<HEADLINE> Jags Have New Worry: Overconfidence  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Complacency and overconfidence are among the few
things that petrify Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin. He found the perfect solution to
that mind-set Sunday when the Tennessee Titans earned their way to Jacksonville
for the AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee defeated Indianapolis 19-16 Sunday to set up a meeting next week
with the Jaguars (15-2), whose only two losses this season came to the Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   The coach figures that will be enough to get his team back to business after
it scored more than a point per minute in a 62-7 playoff victory over Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "It certainly will be part of our thinking," Coughlin said of the two
previous losses to Tennessee. "There's no way around it. It happened. We won't
spend a lot of time on it. But we'll throw it out there again and bring things
back to exactly where they were. That will make us very humble."
</P>
<P>
	   It's a feeling the Jaguars weren't worried about Saturday, when they posted
the second-largest victory in NFL playoff history.
</P>
<P>
	   A bundle of big plays gave the Jaguars a 38-0 lead before Dan Marino had
completed his first pass.
</P>
<P>
	   Most notable among the playmakers was Fred Taylor, who thrust himself to the
forefront of this playoff season with a pair of zigzagging plays -- a
record-setting 90-yard touchdown run and 39-yard reception off a screen pass for
another score.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor, who claims he still isn't fully recovered from his hamstring injury,
said the win was as impressive as he's ever seen, but he understands the need to
quickly regain focus.
</P>
<P>
	   "I sat back last night after I saw the clip and said 'Man, we scored 60
points,' and I was refocused already," Taylor said. "We're on a mission. Any
person on this team that sits down and lets that 62 points stay in their head,
they're crazy. It's not going to be that easy at all."
</P>
<P>
	   Coughlin says he'll continue to stress high-energy practices, the way he did
once the regular season ended and the coach went in search of a way to pull the
Jaguars out of a mini slump.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to understand the reason that we won is because we prepared so well
and our guys were ready to go," Coughlin said. "I'll make sure in no uncertain
words that we understand the focus and the time of year and that we really need
that kind of focus again."
</P>
<P>
	   Several Jaguars said it was easy to stay centered because of the constant
criticism heaped on the team by those who believed their 14-2 record was a
product of a weak schedule and not much else.
</P>
<P>
	   Others just couldn't wait to play and let the performance speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew what everybody felt about us, how we were the worst 14-2 team
ever," tight end Kyle Brady said. "If you're a person who cares what the outside
world feels, then I guess you feel better. But we've just got to believe in what
we can do. And we'll keep that belief right here in the locker room."
</P>
<P>
	   The Dolphins wish they had never brought it onto the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami guard Kevin Donnalley got the message early and left convinced there
was more to the Jaguars than a weak schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a wake-up call for the rest of the AFC -- you better take notice of
this team," Donnalley said. "It's not the same team that struggled at times this
year. Fred Taylor is back, the defense is playing outstanding. Other teams
better look out."

compassionate actions of its members," Coretta Scott King said. To serve, she
said, quoting her husband, all one needs is "a heart of grace and a soul
generated by love." The summit at Georgia State University and services at
King's church, Ebenezer Baptist, were the focal point of Atlanta's King holiday

until Manning ran 15 yards for a touchdown with 1:51 left. But that was too late
-- Yancey Thigpen recovered an onside kick and the Titans ran out the clock.

Iran, US Tie 1-1
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Armas scored in the 48th minute as the U.S.
soccer team, playing before an almost completely pro-Iran crowd, tied the
Iranians 1-1 today in a rematch of their 1998 World Cup game. The Americans,
with a new coach and mostly new players since their humbling 2-1 defeat by Iran
in Lyon, France, was on the attack constantly in the exhibition match at the
Rose Bowl, getting off 18 shots to nine by Iran. But Iran scored on Mehdi
Mahdavikia's goal just seven minutes in then withstood most of the American's
offensive onslaught.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- A fierce windstorm swept through western Washington Sunday,
killing a 19-year-old man and leaving 200,000 customers without power.
</P>
<P>
	   The man, Hien Nguyen of Lacey, was killed around noon when a 120-foot fir
tree blew down on his pickup truck, crushing the cab, Lt. Matt Koehler said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   In the Seattle area, at least 25,000 Seattle City Light customers were
without power after high winds swept through.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds forced the precautionary closure of the floating bridge linking

<HEADLINE> Bradley Invokes MLK's Dreams  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) -- Remembering how his Little League team stood up to
segregation, Bill Bradley said Sunday he still sees racism ``snuffing out the
possibilities of so many young men's lives'' and would model his presidency
after the dreams of Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask myself what would he want a presidential candidate or a president to
do at this time in our country's history,'' Bradley, the Democratic presidential
candidate, said at a celebration of the civil rights leader's birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   One day after his Democratic primary opponent, Vice President Al Gore,
definitively weighed in against the confederate flag flying over South
Carolina's state capitol, Bradley reiterated his own view.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That flag should come down,'' Bradley said to applause from 150 or so
gathered at the Waterloo Museum of Art for an evening with him and the
Corinthian gospel choir.
</P>
<P>
	   He recalled being 11 or 12 years old in his native Missouri, and playing
Little League baseball team with a black catcher and black left-fielder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After the game, we would go to a restaurant for hamburgers and we would be
denied service. But because our two African-American players were denied
service, we all left because the team stayed together. That's the way we were,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, racism ``is more subtle, but no less real,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want you to know that I know that what I (can only) see, you still feel
in terms of discrimination, in terms of racism snuffing out the possibilities of
so many young men's lives.''
</P>
<P>
	   Modern-day racism, Bradley said, includes ``not being able to get a loan at
the bank to buy that restaurant and ... doctors in this country, two-thirds of
whom won't fully participate in Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he has focused his presidential campaign on child poverty and
universal access to health care because, when 27 percent of black Americans and
30 percent of Latinos don't have health insurance, ``I'm trying to remain true
to the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley planned a morning round of King Day events on Monday, the federal
holiday. Gore planned to be in Atlanta at King's gravesite. Both candidates were
to debate Monday evening at a ``Black and Brown'' forum focused on minority
issues.
</P>
<P>
	   For those who turned out for Bradley at the art museum in their Sunday
finery, it was a brief evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley arrived later than he was expected, leaving an exasperated choir
director to lead a chorus of ``C'mon lift Jesus up!'' so interminably that one
of the tenors added this improvised plea to Bradley: ``We're waiting ... we're
waiting.''
</P>
<P>
	   After his remarks and a little girl's singing of ``Amazing Grace,'' Bradley
hustled to a community banquet before any in the audience could ask questions.
One organizer was overheard grumbling that she had promised comers a Q&AMP;A with
the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   No matter to Lou Porter, co-owner of a local radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We found out there is an option,'' Porter said of Bradley. ``Maybe this
time we won't have to vote and hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   But how many Iowans would turn out at the Jan. 24 caucuses -- the first test
of the primary season -- and pick Bradley over Gore remained a gaping question.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore leads Bradley by as much as 20 percent in statewide polls and
canvassers who bussed in from Illinois this weekend found the door-to-door it
tough going.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerome Brown, an aide to Illinois state Rep. Harold Murphy, who brought 48
aides and volunteers with him on a motorcoach, said he visited 100 households
Saturday and Sunday on Bradley's behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said he spent about 30 minutes at each one explaining the caucus and
came away with commitments from just about four out of every 10 people he tried
to convince.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Volcano Erupts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- The Pacaya Volcano, the most active in Guatemala,
erupted Sunday, spurting lava and sending glowing bursts into the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents in the nearby towns of El Caracol and Patrocino were put on alert
and warned to be ready to evacuate if needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The volcano, 15 miles south of Guatemala City, erupted at 4:15 p.m. with a
500-foot burst of lava.
</P>
<P>
	   Glowing lava flowed south from the volcano toward El Caracol, officials at
the local seismological station reported. Part of the crater appeared to have
been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   The volcano sent ash soaring as high as 6,500 feet and volcano experts
warned that activity could increase. Guatemala's national disaster response team
said it was monitoring developments and would evacuate local residents if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   Pacaya is the most active of Guatemala's 32 volcanoes, with three lava flows
formed in eruptions between 1989 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the 8,373 feet volcano twice spewed up plumes of ash, forcing
evacuations and shutting down the airport in Guatemala City.

<HEADLINE> TV's Lone Ranger Honored by Fans  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBERT JABLON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They wore dusters, spurs and black hats. One or two had
six-guns. They were there for the masked man.
</P>
<P>
	   About 600 fans and friends showed up under cloudy skies Sunday to honor
Clayton Moore, who played the Lone Ranger on TV, and in real life preached the
Western hero's values of truth and decency.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, who died Dec. 28 at age 85, played the role on television and in
several films beginning in 1949.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore was "a noble, noble gentleman. There will never be anyone like him,"
actor Johnny Crawford said in a tribute at the Autry Museum of Western Heritage.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford, who played the son "The Rifleman" television series, said he grew
up watching the Lone Ranger. He even appeared in an episode.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought I had died and gone to heaven," he said. "I remember being on the
set and wondering if (Moore) was ever going to take off the mask, and hoping he
didn't."
</P>
<P>
	   Moore never did.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends and family said Moore lived the Lone Ranger's creed of fair play,
self-reliance and self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said that he had fallen in love with the character," his daughter, Dawn
Moore, said. "My father did choose a path that most of us would not have taken,
to take on these standards and these ethics ... as his own."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Moore said she had not intended to hold a public memorial but changed
her mind after she was deluged by letters and e-mail from fans.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Mendez, 48, of Ontario, Calif., showed up in a cowboy outfit with a
gun on his hip. He belongs to a group that reenacts gunfights.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today, I think we need people that are honest like him, that are for the
little guy, that represent the type of goodness that we need out there," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on Internet Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the presidential candidates a
question on the issues. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Internet Sales Tax
</P>
<P>
	   Should Internet commerce remain exempt from sales taxes to encourage the
growth of online business or should it be subject to the same taxation faced by
storefront companies?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I supported the moratorium on taxation of electronic
commerce and I support the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce's efforts
to develop a tax policy which encourages the astonishing growth of the Internet
and electronic commerce, but is fair to bricks-and-mortar companies and doesn't
erode the state and local revenue stream.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``I supported the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which President Clinton
signed into law. The act imposed a three-year moratorium on state and local tax
and trade issues associated with electronic commerce and comparable sales
activities. I do not want to prejudge the work of the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce, but I will tell you that I am committed to finding a
solution to this issue that will allow the Internet and e-commerce to flourish,
but without stripping states and localities of the revenue they need to educate
our children and fight crime. Additionally, I support making cyberspace a
'duty-free' zone internationally.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``We should have a five-year moratorium on federal taxes on
Internet sales and e-commerece to let this business develop. Today, as a share
of retail sales, Internet sales are tiny. Let them grow.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``Internet commerce should remain exempt from sales taxes. This
will ensure continued growth of the most dynamic sector of our economy, but we
should also work at providing tax relief to non-Internet outlets.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I support the current moratorium on Internet sales taxes
and would extend it for several more years to determine the full impact of
e-commerce on our society.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``Politicians see the Internet as another source of government
cash. As a conservative business leader, I know e-commerce is a new frontier
giving families more control over their lives, creating new jobs and boosting
economic growth. That's why a critical part of my 'New Economy Plan' for the
21st century is a permanent ban on special, new Internet taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``I have repeatedly opposed various proposals to tax the
Internet or e-commerce. In fact, I have advocated making the current three-year
federal moratorium on Internet taxation permanent. This new economy is still in
its infancy. Its promise is great, but its potential will never be realized if
the federal government hinders its development with taxes and regulation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``I sponsored the law in the Senate that put in place the
current moratorium on Internet taxation. The Internet continues to be the
greatest engine of economic growth in America today, and we must not strangle it
with new taxes. Online sales totaled $40 billion in 1999, that if taxed would
have taken $2 billion from hard-working American families. As President, I will
keep the Internet a tax-free zone. Studies show that taxing the Internet would
reduce e-commerce by 75 percent -- a blow that would limit growth and kill
jobs.''

<HEADLINE> Sports Announcer By Saam Dies at 85  </HEADLINE>
    By DAN ROBRISH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- By Saam, inducted into the broadcasters' wing of the
baseball Hall of Fame after calling more than 8,000 games for the Philadelphia
Phillies and Athletics, died Sunday at the age of 85.
</P>
<P>
	   The popular radio announcer died following a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 38 years in Philadelphia, he described 13 no-hitters, including
Jim Bunning's perfect game against the New York Mets in 1964, and Ted Williams'
final two games of 1941, when he batted over .400.
</P>
<P>
	   Saam also broadcast University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia Eagles
football games, college and professional basketball, and Ramblers hockey games.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasters and others who had worked with Saam remembered him as an
even-tempered professional who never displayed any signs of an ego.
</P>
<P>
	   "Socially and professionally, By was a joy to be around," Phillies
broadcaster Harry Kalas said. "Between innings, he would crack Whitey (Richie
Ashburn) and me up with his sense of humor and one-liners. By's sense of humor
never really came across to the public. He was trained in the old school where
everything on the air was serious business."
</P>
<P>
	   Fitting his temperament, Saam often used the phrase "rolling along" -- as in
"rolling along into the fifth inning" or "rolling along here in Los Angeles."
</P>
<P>
	   Gene Kelly, Chuck Thompson, Bill Campbell and Claude Haring were among
Saam's many other broadcasting partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Byrum F. Saam began his Philadelphia broadcasting in 1937, covering football
games for Temple and Villanova. The next year, he started announcing Phillies
and Athletics home games.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasters did not travel back then, so he was able to announce for both
teams until the late 1940s, when Phillies owner Bob Carpenter wanted to announce
the road games too, meaning the city's two teams would have separate announcers.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of loyalty to Athletics owner Connie Mack, Saam became the A's home and
road announcer in 1950, and remained with the team until 1954, when the team
left town. He was the Phillies' announcer for the 1955 through 1975 seasons,
after which he retired.
</P>
<P>
	   Saam was brought back in 1976 to call the NL championship series after the
Phillies won the East division.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I came to the Phillies, he was with the A's. Later, he became part of
the Phillies family," Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts said. "He had a
beautiful voice."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, Saam was honored with the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   The native of Fort Worth, Texas, began announcing games in his senior year
of high school when appendicitis took him off the playing field. He continued at
Texas Christian University as a football announcer until nationally known
announcer Ted Husing heard him and recommended him to a Minneapolis advertising
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   He then transferred to the University of Minnesota and broadcast its
football games, then coached by the famed Bernie Bierman, in addition to
covering Minneapolis Millers baseball games.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife of 47 years, Anne Fitzpatrick Saam, died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by daughters Barbara S. Wojciechowski of Richmond, N.H., and
Carol S. Thacher of Devon, Pa.; son Byrum F. "Chip" Saam Jr. of Haverford, Pa.,
as well as a brother, Robert Douglas Saam of Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   A public memorial service is planned for 4:30 p.m. Thursday at All Saints
Church in Wynnewood, Pa., followed by a private burial.
</P>
<P>
	   Memorial contributions may be sent to Phillies Charities Inc., Box 7575,
Philadelphia, PA 19101.

<HEADLINE> Rev. Jesse Jackson and Newark Mayor honor King, unveil economic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - In what they called the largest collaboration
between the city and one of its churches, Mayor Sharpe James and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson on Sunday unveiled a project to renew Newark's neighborhoods and improve
residents' lives.
<P>
	   The $20 million project, unveiled during a celebration at Metropolitan
Baptist Church honoring Martin Luther King Jr., calls for more development
within a half-mile radius of the Springfield Avenue congregation.
</P>
<P>
	   It includes new homes, a hotel, partial ownership in an expected KMart
store, a shopping plaza, a learning center for children, and assisted living
residences for the elderly, James said.
</P>
<P>
	   A collaboration between the city of Newark and the church, the project will
be funded by private investors, the city, and local banks, James said.
</P>
<P>
	   Groundbreaking for the project is expected to begin within the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. David Jefferson Sr., Metropolitan Baptist's pastor, said renewing
the neighborhood was an important part of the church's responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech introducing Jackson, Jefferson spoke about the need for economic
literacy, especially among the city's young people.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone once said it's a fallacy to believe that it is holy to be broke.
Well, I believe that it is a crime to be holy and broke," said Jefferson. "We
need to teach our young people that's it not the spirit over here and economics
here, but that God is right here in the center."
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds showed to listen to Jackson's keynote speech, leaving standing-room
only. About 75 others were lucky enough to find a seat in the second-floor
lounge where a television was set up for viewing the speakers one floor below.
</P>
<P>
	   After his opening prayer, Jackson's speech focused on the need for Newark
residents to invest and save for their future.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson also reminded the congregation of what the late Martin Luther King
Jr. sacrificed to ensure a chance at a more positive future.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thank you, Martin Luther King Jr., for his walking, his talking, and his
sacrifice embodies the hope of centuries of people from the past, and let us
live out the hope of those dreams," said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   During his speech, Jackson asked people to raise their hands if they were in
credit card debt and had played the lottery. Nearly the entire congregation
raised their hands.
</P>
<P>
	   "No matter how you celebrate Dr. King's birthday, a culmination of credit
card debt and looking for Lotto as a bailout is a guarantee to fail as a plan,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The service here in Newark was one of several throughout New Jersey which
honored King, who was known for his message of nonviolent action and civil
disobedience.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman spoke at Rutgers University in Piscataway, and
Congressman Donald Payne addressed the congregation at the Paradise Baptist
Church in Newark.

<HEADLINE> Socialist Wins Chile Election  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Ricardo Lagos was elected Chile's first socialist
president since Salvador Allende on Sunday, narrowly defeating a conservative
rival in a runoff election that focused more on the country's economic future
than on its violent past.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative candidate Joaquin Lavin, who once worked in the government of
former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, conceded defeat and went to Lagos'
campaign headquarters at a hotel in Santiago to congratulate him. Hundreds of
Lagos' supporters cheered wildly as the two appeared on a balcony and hugged
each other with their wives at their sides.
</P>
<P>
	   A moderate socialist, Lagos has distanced himself from the radical brand of
Marxism espoused by Allende, whose government was toppled in a bloody 1973
military coup led by Pinochet. Lagos was the candidate of the center-left
coalition that has governed Chile since the end of the Pinochet dictatorship in
1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos spoke with President Eduardo Frei in a telephone conversation
broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our coalition guarantees equilibrium and stability for Chile,'' said
Lagos, whose socialists are partners with Frei's Christian Democrats in the
coalition known as Concertacion.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin waged one of the closest races in decades for a conservative
candidate, forcing Sunday's runoff after holding Lagos to a virtual tie in the
first round of voting on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We shouldn't be sad because we had a spectacular number of votes,'' Lavin
told supporters. ``And I am confident that in the future, the message of change
that we brought into Chilean politics will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin, of the right-wing Alliance for Chile, said that Lagos ``can count on
me. I am at his disposal to help him face Chile's problems and to work for unity
among Chileans.''
</P>
<P>
	   With nearly all votes counted, Lagos had 51.3 percent of the vote to Lavin's
48.6 percent, Deputy Interior Minister Guillermo Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout was heavy, with more than 7.3 million of some 8 million registered
voters peacefully casting ballots in this South American nation. Polls closed
with no reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, the candidates sought to outdo each other with similar promises
to fight rising street crime, aid struggling farmers and create hundreds of
thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   As he cast his vote at a school in the capital, Santiago, Lavin described
the runoff as a ``vote-by-vote fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos voted under similar circumstances at another Santiago school, calling
the election ``a party for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos will be inaugurated March 11 for a six-year term, succeeding Frei, who
was constitutionally barred from re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost boyish looking at 46, Lavin is a successful two-term mayor of Las
Condes, Santiago's swankiest suburb. He is acclaimed for putting more police on
that suburb's streets and ending traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin was a strong supporter of Pinochet's 1973-90 military regime. He
worked as a junior economist at the Planning Ministry under Pinochet and has
written several books praising his regime.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, however, Lavin tried to distance himself from the
former dictator, saying Pinochet's rule is a thing of the past, and that it was
now time to look to the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos, 61, considers himself part of a so-called Third Way political force
embraced by such leaders as Tony Blair in Britain and Gerhard Schroeder in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   A former Pinochet opponent, Lagos has attracted attention by promising
unemployment insurance in Chile, a country of 15 million people seeking to
improve its social safety net.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos emerged as a leading figure in the fight against Pinochet in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   After leftist guerrillas made an attempt on Pinochet's life in 1986, Lagos
was one of several leftists arrested by state security agents in a crackdown.
Lagos apparently had nothing to do with that attempt, and after spending several
days in jail, he came out to work full time for the restoration of democratic
rule. He remains a hero for Pinochet foes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been detained in Britain since October 1998 on a warrant from a
Spanish judge who wants the general to stand trial for alleged human rights
abuses during his rule.
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw said Tuesday that a panel of doctors
concluded Pinochet is too ill to face trial, and that he felt inclined to send
the former dictator home.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates and most analysts agreed that Pinochet's situation had little
if any influence on the campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
    INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Wide receiver E.G. Green broke his right leg in the
second quarter of the Indianapolis Colts' 19-16 loss to Tennessee in the AFC
divisional playoffs Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Green was injured when he made a 33-yard pass reception and hit the turf at
the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   The leg was placed in an inflatable cast on the field, and he waved to the
crowd as he was wheeled off on a cart.
</P>
<P>
	   "He did break the leg," club president Bill Polian said after the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The catch at the Tennessee 22 led to the second of three field goals by Mike
Vanderjagt, giving the Colts a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The injury was the latest in a series of physical problems that have plagued
Green in his two years with the team. He played in only 11 games as a reserve
last season because of an elbow injury during training camp, won a starting job
in this year's training camp and missed five games this season with a knee
injury.

	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The search for any sign of life from NASA's Mars
Polar Lander will be abandoned tomorrow, ending any hope that the $165 million
mission to the Red Planet can be saved. The three-legged lander was to have
touched down Dec. 3 for a 90-day mission near Mars' south pole to study the
atmosphere and dig for ice. It was last heard from minutes before beginning its
descent. Instead of reveling in new pictures and science, controllers have been
methodically testing different scenarios to explain the silence. Their last
attempt ends at 8 a.m. PST Monday, said Richard Cook, the lander's project

<HEADLINE> Soccer Fans Fill Rose Bowl  </HEADLINE>
   By TESSIE BORDEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Long before half-time, T-shirt vendors ran out of
Iranian flags. In the stands, fans wearing red, white and green shirts sat in
groups to form stadium-wide human banners.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost 50,000 Iranian-American aficionados from across the country converged
on the Rose Bowl Sunday for the exhibition rematch between the U.S. Men's
National Soccer Team and the Iran National team. The game ended in a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is just to show the two countries can get together and have some
fun,'' said Shaeda Moghaddam, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. ``This is
more like a door opening for both countries.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moghaddam said she's not much of a soccer fan, but she had to support her
home team.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I win either way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams haven't played each other since Iran beat the United States 2-1
during the 1998 World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
	   But this was not a party without mixed feelings. It was the first official
visit by a high-profile Iranian sports team since the 1979 revolution that
brought down the Shah of Iran and brought the religious leader Ayatollah
Khomeini to government power.
</P>
<P>
	   Emotions ran high.
</P>
<P>
	   In the sea of red, white and green, distinctions were evident. Some Iran
fans waved the lion-crested flag of Iran under the Shah, while others held up
the newer Muslim republic flag, with a red insignia that means ``Allah'' or God
in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't like the new flag,'' said a group of girls carrying the older
flag outside the stadium during half-time. ``We don't like that sign. We're not
Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fans represented a diverse Iranian-American community in the United
States and particularly in Southern California, where they've built their
largest home outside Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Jews and Muslims mixed in the drink lines. Older Iranians who remember the
revolution mingled among knots of twenty-something, U.S.-born Iranian-Americans
with vague memories of the Ayatollah. Activists handed out fliers near the
concession stands while entrepreneurs sold T-shirts and slipped Web site ads
under windshield wipers in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most of the business has been Iran,'' said Frank Gomez, behind the counter
at a T-shirt stall. ``Every Iranian flag has been bought.''
</P>
<P>
	   The American fans were almost an afterthought. Many of them huddled in a
corner section of the stadium for solidarity, wearing outsize Uncle Sam red,
white and blue top hats and U.S. flags for capes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes us get louder,'' said Sergio Gonzalez, 17, of Los Angeles.
``There's a whole bunch of them, but we're smaller, we're louder and we're
better.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A man shot his stepson as the boy was leaving church
services Sunday with his family, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cedric Crutcher, 17, died hours later at a local hospital, said Huntsville
police spokesman Wendell Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said 41-year-old Byron Bonner was waiting in the parking lot when
Crutcher left Northwest Church of Christ about noon. The two exchanged words,
and Bonner allegedly shot Crutcher several times, with one shot striking the
youth in the back of the head, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonner fled the scene and police were searching for him Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonner, who had worked at the U.S. Post Office in Madison, and Crutcher's
mother, Edna, were divorcing, Johnson said. It was not clear whether Bonson
still worked at the post office, Johnson said. Police were called to her home
earlier Sunday because Bonner was there, he said, and the woman had sought a
restraining order against Bonner.

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Head, Wife Aboard Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIC NUNEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Former CIA director Adm. Stansfield Turner was
among 17 people injured in a weekend airplane crash that killed his wife, a U.S.
couple and a Spaniard, Costa Rican authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner, CIA director under President Carter, was in a San Jose hospital
Sunday. No details on his condition were available.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, Karen, was killed Saturday afternoon when their Taxi Aereo
Centroamericano flight crashed into a home shortly after taking off in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
	   Also killed in the crash were Siegrid Richert and his wife, Therese, and
Spaniard Antonio Sanchez Diaz, according to Javier Montero, chief of operations
for Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner and 16 other people, most of them Spaniards, were injured when the
Czech-built LET 410 plowed into a house in an upscale neighborhood near the
Tobias Bolanos airport, Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were in the house, including a Nicaraguan housekeeper who
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like a bomb. Pieces of cement, wood and even a wall fell on top of
us,'' the housekeeper, Yamileth Saenz, told the daily La Nacion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Turner, the injured passengers and crew included nine
Spaniards, two French citizens, one Salvadoran and three Costa Ricans, the Red
Cross said. Most were in stable condition in San Jose hospitals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Costa Rican pilot was seriously injured, according to Pamela Villalta,
spokeswoman for the San Juan de Dios Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane had been destined for the Tortuguero national park on Costa Rica's
Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the accident was under investigation. It was unclear whether
heavy winds at the time played a role.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was coming up the street when suddenly I saw the plane start to
fishtail,'' one witness, Pedro Chinchilla, told the daily La Republica. ``It
fell, and then I heard a loud noise, like a hurricane. When I reached the site I
could hear screams coming from inside the house.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Peter Freistadt, who worked as a filmmaker and actor in
his native Czechoslovakia and in Israel, died Friday from a long-term illness.
He was 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Freistadt survived the Nazi occupation and fled the Communist regime in
1964. He moved to Israel in 1964 where he later became well-known for the epic
movies he directed, including ``Motive to Kill'' and ``Sabina and Her Men,''
both in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   He produced dozens of films in cooperation with Czech and Israeli television
networks about Jewish figures, including Franz Kafka. He acted in some of the
major Israeli films of the 1980s, including the Palestinian-Israeli prison
drama, ``Beyond the Walls'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
	   Freistadt helped found Israeli state-owned television and served on the
boards of movie, television and theater associations in the country. He also
served as the Israeli cultural attache in Prague.
Gene Harris
</P>
<P>
	   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Grammy-nominated jazz pianist Gene Harris, who had been
awaiting a kidney transplant, died at his home Sunday. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris was due for transplant surgery last summer because of kidney failure
caused by diabetes. His daughter planned to donate a kidney, but could not
because of illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris, who had maintained a busy schedule recording and touring both
nationally and internationally, began performing at the age of six. A native of
Benton Harbor, Mich., Harris formed the Three Sounds in 1956 and within two
years secured a record contract in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris' piano stylings made the Three Sounds one of the most popular 1960's
jazz groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris moved to Boise in 1977 where he became musical director for a hotel,
and he continued recording, eventually joining Ray Brown's Trio.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris was nominated for a Grammy four years ago.
T.N. Kaul
</P>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- T.N. Kaul, former diplomat and a key architect of
India's peace agreements with China, Pakistan and the former Soviet Union, died
in northern India Sunday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   A member of the Indian Civil Service, Kaul helped mold India's foreign
policy in the immediate aftermath of independence from British colonial rule in
1947. He co-authored the Panchsheel Agreement between India and China in the
1950s, preparing the groundwork for friendship between the world's two most
populous nations.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, Kaul assisted Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in formulating the Simla
Agreement with neighboring Pakistan in which both countries agreed to resolve
their disputes through bilateral dialogue.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaul served as India's ambassador to Moscow twice and also as ambassador to
the United States.
Jack Lake
</P>
<P>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- John B. ``Jack'' Lake, who as publisher of the
St. Petersburg Times saw the newspaper grow in prominence as the city he loved
grew too, died Saturday after an apparent stroke. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Lake was a community leader as much as a newspaper leader. He helped bring
the Salvador Dali Museum to St. Petersburg and paved the way for the city to
lure a major league baseball expansion franchise, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with Jim Healey, Lake was one of the first to dream that this quiet
but growing waterfront city across the bay from Tampa should have its own big
league baseball team. He threw out the first pitch of the first minor league
game when the Devil Rays' farm system started playing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lake started his newspaper career after serving in World War II at the Eagle
Gazette, a small daily in Lancaster, Ohio. He began working in classified
advertising and stayed at the Eagle Gazette 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   After returning to active duty in the Korean War and a stint as advertising
manager at the Elizabeth Journal in New Jersey, Lake came to St. Petersburg in
1960.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Times, he rose from advertising director through the ranks until
taking over as publisher in 1971. He retired in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   His years at the paper were marked by rapid circulation growth as the
community grew. The year before Lake arrived, the Times daily circulation was
100,000. The year he left, it was 270,000.
Clifton M. ``Demi'' McClure
</P>
<P>
	   ANDERSON, S.C. (AP) -- Clifton M. ``Demi'' McClure, who was one of the first
Americans to ride a hot-air balloon to the edge of space, died Friday in
Huntsville, Ala., from complications of a stroke. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
	   A career in the Air Force led McClure into the Man High Project, a pre-NASA
program in New Mexico used to gather information about cabin conditions in high
altitudes similar to space.
</P>
<P>
	   On Oct. 8, 1958, McClure was strapped into a gondola attached to a 3
million-cubic-foot balloon and floated up to 99,700 feet. Reports published
afterward said his body temperature went as high as 106.6 degrees as the balloon
passed through a warm layer of the atmosphere that heated the gondola to 118
degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   McClure and the program were featured in a History Channel show, ``To The
Edge of Space: Project Man High'' in August. He was the third person to see the
curvature of the earth from space.
</P>
<P>
	   McClure was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in September 1960. After
retiring from active duty, he became a pilot for the South Carolina Air National
Guard, serving in Germany during the Berlin Crisis in 1962.
By Saam
</P>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- By Saam, inducted into the broadcasters' wing of the
baseball Hall of Fame after calling more than 8,000 games for the Philadelphia
Phillies and Athletics, died Sunday after a stroke. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 38 years in Philadelphia, he described 13 no-hitters, including
Jim Bunning's perfect game against the New York Mets in 1964, and Ted Williams'
final two games of 1941, when he batted over .400.
</P>
<P>
	   Saam also broadcast University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia Eagles
football games, college and professional basketball, and Ramblers hockey games.
</P>
<P>
	   Byrum F. Saam began his Philadelphia broadcasting in 1937, covering football
games for Temple and Villanova. The next year, he started announcing Phillies
and Athletics home games.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasters did not travel at the time, so he was able to announce for both
teams until the late 1940s, when Phillies owner Bob Carpenter wanted to announce
the road games too, meaning the city's two teams would have separate announcers.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of loyalty to Athletics owner Connie Mack, Saam became the A's home and
road announcer in 1950, and remained with the team until 1954, when the team
left town. He was the Phillies' announcer for the 1955 through 1975 seasons,
after which he retired.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, Saam was honored with the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Socialist Wins Chile Election  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Ricardo Lagos was elected Chile's first socialist
president since Salvador Allende on Sunday, narrowly defeating a conservative
rival in a runoff election that focused more on the country's economic future
than on its violent past.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative candidate Joaquin Lavin, who once worked in the government of
former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, conceded defeat and went to Lagos'
campaign headquarters at a hotel in Santiago to congratulate him. Hundreds of
Lagos' supporters cheered wildly as the two appeared on a balcony and hugged
each other with their wives at their sides.
</P>
<P>
	   A moderate socialist, Lagos has distanced himself from the radical brand of
Marxism espoused by Allende, whose government was toppled in a bloody 1973
military coup led by Pinochet. Lagos was the candidate of the center-left
coalition that has governed Chile since the end of the Pinochet dictatorship in
1990.
</P>
<P>
	   In his victory speech, Lagos did not mention Allende. He promised to
encourage unity among his countrymen, inviting Lavin's supporters to help
improve the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can all work together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos also spoke with President Eduardo Frei in a telephone conversation
broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our coalition guarantees equilibrium and stability for Chile,'' said
Lagos, whose socialists are partners with Frei's Christian Democrats in the
coalition known as Concertacion.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin waged one of the closest races in decades for a conservative
candidate, forcing Sunday's runoff after holding Lagos to a virtual tie in the
first round of voting on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We shouldn't be sad because we had a spectacular number of votes,'' Lavin
told supporters. ``And I am confident that in the future, the message of change
that we brought into Chilean politics will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin, of the right-wing Alliance for Chile, said that Lagos ``can count on
me. I am at his disposal to help him face Chile's problems and to work for unity
among Chileans.''
</P>
<P>
	   With nearly all votes counted, Lagos had 51.3 percent of the vote to Lavin's
48.6 percent, Deputy Interior Minister Guillermo Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos will be inaugurated March 11 for a six-year term, succeeding Frei, who
was constitutionally barred from re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout was heavy, with more than 7.3 million of some 8 million registered
voters peacefully casting ballots in this South American nation. Polls closed
with no reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, the candidates sought to outdo each other with similar promises
to fight rising street crime, aid struggling farmers and create hundreds of
thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin, 46, is a successful two-term mayor of Las Condes, Santiago's
swankiest suburb. He is acclaimed for putting more police on that suburb's
streets and ending traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin was a strong supporter of Pinochet's 1973-90 military regime. He
worked as a junior economist at the Planning Ministry under Pinochet and has
written several books praising his regime.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, however, Lavin tried to distance himself from the
former dictator, saying Pinochet's rule is a thing of the past, and that it was
now time to look to the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos, 61, considers himself part of a so-called Third Way political force
embraced by such leaders as Tony Blair in Britain and Gerhard Schroeder in
Germany. He served as Chile's public works minister until early last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos has attracted attention by promising unemployment insurance in Chile,
a country of 15 million people seeking to improve its social safety net.
</P>
<P>
	   In the mid-1980s, Lagos emerged as a leading figure in the fight against
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
	   After leftist guerrillas made an attempt on Pinochet's life in 1986, Lagos
was one of several leftists arrested by state security agents in a crackdown.
Lagos apparently had nothing to do with that attempt, and after spending several
days in jail, he came out to work full time for the restoration of democratic
rule. He remains a hero for Pinochet foes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been detained in Britain since October 1998 on a warrant from a
Spanish judge who wants the general to stand trial for alleged human rights
abuses during his rule.
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw said Tuesday that a panel of doctors
concluded Pinochet is too ill to face trial, and that he felt inclined to send
the former dictator home.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates and most analysts agreed that Pinochet's situation had little
if any influence on the campaign. But as Lagos delivered his victory speech, the
crowd began chanting: ``Trial for Pinochet!''
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos replied that it was up to the courts to decide whether he would be
tried in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Titans 19, Colts 16  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans didn't need another miracle. They
just needed Eddie George, their defense and some help from instant replay.
</P>
<P>
	   George scored on a 68-yard run on the third play of the second half Sunday
to lead the Titans to a 19-16 win over the Indianapolis Colts and a trip to
Jacksonville for the AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
	   That was just what the Titans wanted.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before the team came out to warm up, coach Jeff Fisher went over to
George.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told him that when we traded down, then up, to get you in that draft, it
was for games like this,"' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was kind of special," the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner said of his coach's
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   George was kind of special, too, gaining 162 yards on 26 carries as
Tennessee played the game at its pace, not the run-and-gun pace the Colts would
have preferred.
</P>
<P>
	   And everyone contributed. The defense, even with star rookie Jevon Kearse
producing little, held Peyton Manning and the prolific Indianapolis offense to
just three field goals until Manning ran 15 yards for a touchdown with 1:51
left.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was too late -- Yancey Thigpen recovered an onside kick and the
Titans ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
	   George hoped to do well against an Indianapolis defense that allowed 4.2
yards per carry and was depleted by the absence of veteran linebacker Cornelius
Bennett. Still, he carried just nine times for 38 yards in a first half that
ended with the Colts ahead 9-6 on three field goals by Mike Vanderjagt to two by
Al Del Greco.
</P>
<P>
	   But early in the second half, he took a handoff from Steve McNair, cut
through a huge hole in the middle of the Indianapolis line created by a failed
blitz, and outraced the secondary for the game's first TD. Del Greco later added
two more field goals.
</P>
<P>
	   George was so clear, he even spent a little time watching TV during the run.
</P>
<P>
	   "I looked up at the video screen to see how close the pursuers were," said
George, who was caught just as he reached the goal line. "I almost got caught
looking."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans, who needed a lateral that turned into a 75-yard kickoff return
with three seconds left to beat Buffalo in a wild-card game last week, will play
in the franchise's first conference title game in 20 years. Tennessee handed
Jacksonville its only two losses this season, 20-19 in Jacksonville and 41-14 at
home three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tennessee defense, meanwhile, shut down an offense that averaged 26.4
points and was held to less than 20 points just three times during the regular
season, once in a meaningless final game.
</P>
<P>
	   "The way the game was going, we had no choice but to shut them down," said
Kearse, the defensive rookie of the year, who himself was shut down -- he had
only one assisted tackles and was credited with two passes defended.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, the offensive rookie of the year was also shut down --
the Colts' Edgerrin James, who grew up just 25 miles from Kearse in southwest
Florida was held to just 56 yards on 20 carries and caught just one pass for
eight yards.
</P>
<P>
	   And if Kearse rarely got close to Manning, the rest of the defensive line
was helped by the double teams he drew. Although Manning wasn't sacked, Kenny
Holmes and several other defenders were constantly in his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got close once and we made eye contact," Kearse said of Manning, who was
sacked just 14 times all season while Kearse had 14.5. "I told him he could at
least let me have one sack."
</P>
<P>
	   The Tennessee secondary, led by safety Blaine Bishop, also played well.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning, who completed 62.1 percent of his passes during the regular season,
was under 50 percent Sunday, going 19-of-43 for 227 yards.'
</P>
<P>
	   Then replay finally did in the Colts, who finished 13-4, but left coach Jim
Mora winless in five playoff games, the first four with New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   Five minutes into the fourth quarter, with the Titans leading 16-9, the
Colts' Terrence Wilkins broke a punt return and finally went out of bounds at
the Tennessee 3.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a good call," Mora said. "If he was out of bounds, he was out of
bounds. Those are the rules."
</P>
<P>
	   Replay showed that Wilkins stepped out of bounds. And while Tennessee had to
burn a timeout to get its challenge heard over the din of the crowd at the RCA
Dome, it paid off -- referee Johnny Grier viewed the replay and brought the ball
back 63 yards to the Colts 33.
</P>
<P>
	   That did it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts went three-and-out, and Derrick Mason's 19-yard punt return to the
Indianapolis 42 set up Del Greco's fourth field goal. On the next series, Kearse
got into the act, tipping a pass attempt by Manning on third down.
</P>
<P>
	   And when the Colts finally scored, it was too late -- they were out of
timeouts, and the onside kick didn't come close to working..
</P>
<P>
	   "We just came up short against a very good team," Mora said. "We had trouble
making a play, particularly making big plays. It was a struggle all day, both
sides of the ball.".
</P>
<P>
	   But the Colts, who were 3-13 a year ago and whose 10-game improvement was
the best in NFL history, seemed satisfied with their season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a heck of a season," Manning said. "We'll try to reload a little.
I'm confident we can get right back here next season."

	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Paul McPherson scored 12 of his 18 points in the second half
as No. 21 DePaul held off Houston 77-68 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Quentin Richardson also scored 18 points and had 14 rebounds for DePaul
(12-4, 3-1 Conference USA), which was coming off a 69-69 loss to Marquette on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   DePaul led 36-24 at halftime, but the Cougars (7-10, 1-3) rallied with a
trapping defense that forced the Blue Demons into 16 second-half turnovers. They
had 25 for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   With Gee Gervin and Kenny Younger leading the comeback, Houston cut DePaul's
lead to 56-50 with 8:59 to play on a basket by Younger. Gervin had 21 of his 26
points in the second half, and Younger scored 18 of his 24 points in the second
half.

<P>
	   The Cougars got it down to 66-62 with 1:09 to play, but Rashon Burno hit

<HEADLINE> New Restrictions on Biotech Corn  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is putting new planting restrictions on
genetically engineered corn to prevent insects from developing resistance to the
toxin in the biotech crop.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 percent of the corn grown last year was Bt corn, named for the
bacteria it contains to kill the European corn borer.
</P>
<P>
	   The new restrictions, which the Environmental Protection Agency worked out
with the industry, will require farmers to plant at least 20 percent
conventional corn in most regions, and 50 percent in areas where cotton is
grown.
</P>
<P>
	   Seed companies also will be required to expand field monitoring for signs of
where insect resistance may be occurring.
</P>
<P>
	   The restrictions are in line with recommendations made by the National Corn
Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see this to be anything major. It's right in line with what
(farmers) are already doing," said Lynn Jensen, president of the growers' group.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsanto Co. said Sunday the EPA measures "are nothing new for us or our
customers since most all of them were already in place." The seed supplier said
it has required farmers "growing our Bt-corn and Bt-cotton to plant refuge areas
since we first commercialized these products in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA also is requiring the seed companies to tell farmers about voluntary
measures they can take to protect Monarch butterflies from being hurt by the
corn's pollen. The EPA posted a brief notice about the new restrictions Friday
on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The butterfly larvae feed on milkweed, which sometimes is found around corn
fields. A study released in May by Cornell University said Monarch larvae died
when they ate pollen from the Bt corn.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are really happy to see that the agency is taking the resistance issues
and the Monarch issue seriously," said Margaret Mellon, director of the
agricultural and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the agency has done a good job of jawboning the industry and
getting them to agree to the restrictions in an environment where strictly
speaking they don't have to. We're concerned that they didn't go far enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Rebecca Goldburg, senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, said
the new restrictions "confirm the fact that Bt corn can pose both an
environmental and resistance management risk."
</P>
<P>
	   Surveys indicate farmers in Illinois and other areas that grow a lot of
their corn for export markets are expected to cut back production of Bt corn
this year due to consumer resistance to biotech food overseas, said Jensen, a
South Dakota producer. Growers in other regions whose crops are primarily used
for livestock feed may plant as much or more Bt corn then they did last year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another factor figuring into growers' considerations is that corn borer
infestations have been low throughout much of the Midwest for the past two
years. Biotech corn is more expensive than conventional varieties because of a
special fee charged by the seed companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA's planting restrictions will be higher in cotton-growing areas
because of the widespread use of a Bt-version of cotton.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Commission, which enforces rules for the 15-member European
Union, cited the Cornell study last summer in delaying approval of pending
requests to sell the corn variety. Mexican environmentalists urged their
government to ban its import and use.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to the study, EPA scientists said last year that they knew that
the pollen could kill insects but did not believe the butterflies would be
exposed to the toxin outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency is to consider renewing expiring registrations for Bt corn later
this year and has asked seed companies to provide data on its impact.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Says Palestinian Economy Grew  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Palestinian economy has grown over the past two years,
a U.N. report said Sunday, with higher wages and more people working at home and
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Investment and exports have stagnated, however, partly due to concerns
abroad about corruption and the Palestinian Authority's political future.
</P>
<P>
	   The growth rate in 1998 was 4.1 percent, and the 1999 figure is expected to
reach 4.5 percent after adjustment for inflation, U.N. Special Coordinator Terje
Roed-Larsen, the report's author, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, more than 47,000 new jobs were created, unemployment fell, and the
average wage rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of Palestinians employed in Israel also increased by 18 percent
to over 122,000, about half of them with Israeli work permits and the rest
working illegally. Over the past few months, Israel has relaxed regulations to
give work permits to thousands more Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Six out of every 10 new jobs, however, were in the domestic Palestinian
economy, which employed an average of 410,000 workers in the first six months of
1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Other indicators pointed to stagnation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was little or no improvement in private investment and exports, the
two most critical variables for sustainable private sector-led employment
growth,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   This was attributed to political uncertainty about the nature of a final
peace treaty with Israel, due by September, and to ``the still weak legal and
institutional environment, particularly from the point of view of foreign
capital'' in the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also noted a downward trend in public investment due to a drop in
contributions by donor countries. Donor countries have expressed concern about
corruption in the Palestinian Authority and the lack of transparency in its
financial administration.

<HEADLINE> Bucks, Raptors Build a Rivalry  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The NBA's next hot rivalry might just be catching fire in
the wintry climes of Wisconsin and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
	   As evidenced by their confrontation-filled two-game series over the weekend,
the Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors don't like each other much.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams combined for 106 fouls, at least three bloody injuries, one fight,
three ejections and numerous insults and knockdowns. Oh, and each team won on
its home court in two exciting, bitter games.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to be a rivalry," Toronto guard Muggsy Bogues said Saturday.
"We can't wait to see these guys again. Everybody will be looking forward to our
next game against each other (Feb. 5 at Milwaukee)."
</P>
<P>
	   The teams are separated by a half-game in the Central Division. They feature
some of the game's best young offensive talent in Vince Carter, Ray Allen, Tracy
McGrady and Glenn Robinson. It seems to be the perfect situation for an
old-fashioned rivalry to grow.
</P>
<P>
	   At the center of this mutual distaste is the U.S. Olympic Committee's
selection of Allen over Carter for a spot on the 2000 Olympic team. The Raptors
feel Carter was slighted, while the Bucks think Allen isn't getting the proper
respect.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter scored 47 points in Toronto's 115-110 win Friday at the Air Canada
Centre. Allen answered with 33 in the Bucks' 118-97 victory at Milwaukee
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   They were the main offensive shows in a violent series capped by a fight
between Milwaukee's J.R. Reid and Toronto's Antonio Davis on Saturday. Toronto's
Charles Oakley also was ejected during a prolonged argument that ended with the
teams shouting epithets at each other from their benches.
</P>
<P>
	   Oakley and Reid were suspended one game and fined $7,500 by the NBA on
Sunday, and Davis was fined $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The dislike even filtered through to the coaching staffs. Toronto coach
Butch Carter didn't like the way Milwaukee coach George Karl dealt with the
weekend's events.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter said Karl falsely accused the Raptors of dirty play Friday, and the
results showed up Saturday as the Bucks knocked Toronto around.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was underhanded, and planted a seed that was unfair," Carter said.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl said the Bucks simply defended themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a professional protocol to protect your teammates," Karl said. "We
understood that last night. We understood that tonight. There was probably some
animosity from the back-to-back situation. Our team did what we were supposed to
do."
</P>
<P>
	   The Raptors won Friday by pushing Milwaukee around. Carter bloodied Allen's
nose with an elbow, and Oakley floored him on a flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks responded with an offensive breakout Saturday. Milwaukee shot 74
percent and scored 42 points in the first quarter while holding Toronto to the
worst shooting quarter in its history (5-of-29).
</P>
<P>
	   At the center of it all was Allen, who scored on the Bucks' first three
possessions, hit his first five shots and had 16 points in the period. Allen
didn't even pretend passing was an option, taking the ball to the hole against
Carter with determination.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen wound up hitting 11-of-15 shots. Taking a cue from Toronto's play a
day earlier, Milwaukee was the aggressor against the frustrated Raptors.
</P>
<P>
	   "They pushed us around last night, and we were determined in the locker room
that it wasn't going to happen again," said Bucks forward Scott Williams, who
floored Alvin Williams on a hard screen and picked up three fouls in the first
four minutes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought the guys played with attitude. No one is going to push us around
on our court."
</P>
<P>
	   Both Allen and Carter downplayed their dispute. Still, their loveless,
awkward hug before Saturday's game was a good indicator of their true feelings.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess they thought we were out there trying to hurt people (Friday
night)," Carter said. "We were just playing basketball. I don't know where they
get off saying that."
</P>
<P>
	   "Because of everything that took place (Friday), there was a lot of
frustration," Allen said. "Some bad blood developed over the course of 24 hours.
We had to gain respect and do it by any means necessary. We had to be
aggressive."

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Oil Pipeline Bombed  </HEADLINE>
   By MOHAMED OSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- A little-known opposition group bombed an oil
pipeline that supplies Sudan's capital of Khartoum, a government spokesman said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack took place Saturday, the same day that peace talks resumed in
Kenya between the Sudanese government and southern rebels, said Amin Hassan
Omar, a top official at the Culture and Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   Omar said the attack damaged a 10-foot section of the 1,000-mile pipeline.
The blast occurred in Summit, about 85 miles southwest of the Red Sea town of
Port Sudan, near the Eritrean border. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Omar said security officials in the area found leaflets signed by a group
called the Beja Conference, which is made up of four tribes in eastern Sudan. A
spokesman for the group, Faqi Ali Mohammed, said the group had destroyed more
than 25 feet of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no peace between the opposition and the government,'' he told
Al-Jazeera television from Eritrea's capital, Asmara.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is not known to have carried out such attacks previously, although
individual members of the group have joined Sudanese opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's attack was the second on the pipeline in less than three months.
After the first attack in November, the government blamed an unidentified
neighboring country, a possible reference to Eritrea, where some exiled Sudanese
opposition groups are based.
</P>
<P>
	   In statements broadcast by Sudanese television, Hassan Mohammed,
undersecretary at the Ministry of Industry and Mining, said that a fire
resulting from the pipeline explosion had been contained and that repairs would
take about two days.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, rebels in southern Sudan said Sunday that a government aircraft
bombed a town the insurgents control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government bombed Yei yesterday, the day we officially resumed
talks,'' said Samson Kwaje a spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
``Yet these are the people we are supposed to make peace with.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kwaje said most of the bombs fell outside the town, 805 miles south of
Khartoum, and the rebels had no casualty figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian and animist rebels in the south are fighting Sudan's
Muslim-dominated government based in the north. The 16-year war and related
famine have claimed nearly 2 million lives.

<HEADLINE> Titans 19, Colts 16  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Just before the Tennessee Titans came out to warm up
for their AFC semifinal with the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, coach Jeff Fisher
pulled Eddie George aside.
</P>
<P>
	   "He asked me to relive draft day back in 1996," George said. "He told me to
remember that he drafted me because he felt I could lead this team to where we
are now. He challenged me to live up to expectations."
</P>
<P>
	   George did just that, running 68 yards for a touchdown on the third play of
the second half to lead the Titans to a 19-16 win over the Indianapolis Colts
and a trip to Jacksonville for the AFC title game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told him that when we traded down, then up, to get you in that draft, it
was for games like this,"' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was kind of special," the 1995 Heisman Trophy winner said of his coach's
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   George was kind of special, too. Not only did his TD run put the Titans
ahead for good, but he finished with 162 yards on 26 carries as Tennessee played
the game at its pace, not the run-and-gun pace the Colts would have preferred.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor did the Titans need a miracle this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense, even with star rookie Jevon Kearse producing little, held
Peyton Manning and the prolific Indianapolis offense to just three field goals
until Manning ran 15 yards for a touchdown with 1:51 left.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was too late -- Yancey Thigpen recovered an onside kick and the
Titans ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
	   George hoped to do well against an Indianapolis defense that allowed 4.2
yards per carry and was depleted by the absence of veteran linebacker Cornelius
Bennett. Still, he carried just nine times for 38 yards in a first half that
ended with the Colts ahead 9-6 on three field goals by Mike Vanderjagt to two by
Al Del Greco.
</P>
<P>
	   But early in the second half, he took a handoff from Steve McNair, cut
through a huge hole in the middle of the Indianapolis line created by a failed
blitz, and outraced the secondary for the game's first TD. Del Greco later added
two more field goals.
</P>
<P>
	   George was so clear, he even spent a little time watching TV during the run.
</P>
<P>
	   "I looked up at the video screen to see how close the pursuers were," said
George, who was caught just as he reached the goal line. "I almost got caught
looking."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans, who needed a lateral that turned into a 75-yard kickoff return
with three seconds left to beat Buffalo in a wild-card game last week, will play
in the franchise's first conference title game in 20 years. Tennessee handed
Jacksonville its only two losses this season, 20-19 in Jacksonville and 41-14 at
home three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tennessee defense, meanwhile, shut down an offense that averaged 26.4
points and was held to less than 20 points just three times during the regular
season, once in a meaningless final game.
</P>
<P>
	   "The way the game was going, we had no choice but to shut them down," said
Kearse, the defensive rookie of the year, who himself was shut down -- he had
only one assisted tackles and was credited with two passes defended.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, the offensive rookie of the year also was shut down --
the Colts' Edgerrin James, who grew up just 25 miles from Kearse in southwest
Florida, was held to just 56 yards on 20 carries and caught just one pass for
eight yards.
</P>
<P>
	   And if Kearse rarely got close to Manning, the rest of the defensive line
was helped by the double teams he drew. Although Manning wasn't sacked, Kenny
Holmes and several other defenders were constantly in his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got close once and we made eye contact," Kearse said of Manning, who was
sacked just 14 times all season while Kearse had 14.5. "I told him he could at
least let me have one sack."
</P>
<P>
	   The Tennessee secondary, led by safety Blaine Bishop, also played well.
</P>
<P>
	   Manning, who completed 62.1 percent of his passes during the regular season,
was under 50 percent Sunday, going 19-of-43 for 227 yards.'
</P>
<P>
	   Then replay finally did in the Colts, who finished 13-4, but left coach Jim
Mora winless in five playoff games, the first four with New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   Five minutes into the fourth quarter, with the Titans leading 16-9, the
Colts' Terrence Wilkins broke a punt return and finally went out of bounds at
the Tennessee 3.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a good call," Mora said. "If he was out of bounds, he was out of
bounds. Those are the rules."
</P>
<P>
	   Replay showed that Wilkins stepped out of bounds. And while Tennessee had to
burn a timeout to get its challenge heard over the din of the crowd at the RCA
Dome, it paid off -- referee Johnny Grier viewed the replay and brought the ball
back 63 yards to the Colts 33.
</P>
<P>
	   That did it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts went three-and-out, and Derrick Mason's 19-yard punt return to the
Indianapolis 42 set up Del Greco's fourth field goal. On the next series, Kearse
got into the act, tipping a pass attempt by Manning on third down.
</P>
<P>
	   And when the Colts finally scored, it was too late -- they were out of
timeouts, and the onside kick didn't come close to working..
</P>
<P>
	   "We just came up short against a very good team," Mora said. "We had trouble
making a play, particularly making big plays. It was a struggle all day, both
sides of the ball.".
</P>
<P>
	   But the Colts, who were 3-13 last season and whose 10-game improvement was
the best in NFL history, seemed satisfied with their season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a heck of a season," Manning said. "We'll try to reload a little.
I'm confident we can get right back here next season."

	   Green, making his first start in five games, fractured his right leg making
a spectacular diving catch for a 33-yard gain to the Tennessee 22 early in the
second quarter. He was taken off the field on a cart.
</P>
<P>
	   "E.G. got his first start in some time," said Indianapolis quarterback
Peyton Manning, who avoided being sacked while facing consistent pressure from
the Titans' defense. "He had a good week in practice, and we center a lot of
things around E.G. offensively. That was a big play, and the fact that E.G. got
hurt sort of changed the momentum. He just made a big catch.
</P>
<P>
	   "When that happens, you want to jog down and huddle up. ... We had to stand
around as he got taken care of."
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts got no closer to the goal on that drive and had to settle for one
of three field goals kicked by Mike Vanderjagt in a 19-16 loss to Tennessee in
the AFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I definitely missed E.G. in the second half. He's sort of a security
blanket to me," Manning said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Jim Mora refused to blame the injury for the loss.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that he got hurt was a blow because he was a starter," Mora said.
"Our offense didn't do as much today. We got outplayed by a better football
team."
</P>
<P>
	   Manning completed 19 of 43 passes for 227 yards, a sharp decline from his
regular-season performance that earned him a starting job in the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it was anything that confused me, but they did a good job,"
said Manning, who scrambled 15 yards for the only Indianapolis touchdown. "They
mixed it up well, blitzing some, playing some zone. The defensive line was
good."
</P>
<P>
	   Two calls by the officials were costly to Indianapolis, which finished 13-4
after being picked in preseason forecasts to finish at the bottom of the AFC
East.
</P>
<P>
	   One came with eight seconds left in the first half and Indianapolis at the
Tennessee 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Everyone expected Manning to spike the ball to kill the clock. Instead, he
rolled out to attempt a pass, but referee Johnny Grier had blown his whistle in
anticipation of the spike.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did it a little too well and got everybody faked out," Manning said.
"Johnny Grier admitted that he made a mistake. There's not a lot you can do
about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Another big call came in the third quarter on a fourth-and-one play at the
Tennessee 45 when offensive lineman Adam Meadows was called for a false start
after reporting as an eligible receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was kind of a play we have. We were trying to draw them offside,"
Manning said. "Adam is an eligible receiver, and he gets off the ball as a tight
end. They called us for trying to draw them offsides. ... It would have been
nice to have kept that drive alive."
</P>
<P>
	   "I was like a tight end and I can go into motion, run a reverse or anything
else in that situation," Meadows said. "One of the officials said they missed
it, but the call stood."
</P>
<P>
	   George's TD run put his team ahead to stay, and he finished with 162 yards
on 26 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were in a blitz. We tipped it a little early and he just popped it. They
called the right play at the right time," Mora said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That run and his short ones just killed us. He kept picking up two, three
and four yards, getting them into third and short and then we had often had
trouble stopping them," defensive end Mark Thomas said. "I thought I should have
had him on that long run. I'll have to see the film to see what happened."

Castro Aide Knocks Citizenship Talk
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Cuban official today derided U.S. lawmakers'
attempts to grant citizenship to 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. "Congress is
supposed to be a serious institution and not an instrument to permit what
amounts to a kidnapping of a small boy," said Ricardo Alarcon, president of the
Cuban National Assembly. The citizenship idea, he told NBC, is "absolutely
nonsense." The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled the boy must be
returned to his father in Cuba. But last week, Attorney General Janet Reno
lifted the deadline to give Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight in
federal court to keep the boy with them.

Fierce Winds Leave Northwest Powerless

	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A fierce windstorm swept through western Washington today,
killing a 19-year-old man and leaving 300,000 customers without power. The man,
Hien Nguyen of Lacey, was killed around noon when a 120-foot fir tree blew down
on his pickup truck, crushing the cab, Lt. Matt Koehler said. Blown-down trees
and limbs caused most of the power outages, utility officials said. In the

mission to the Red Planet can be saved. The three-legged lander was to have
touched down Dec. 3 for a 90-day mission near Mars' south pole to study the

U.N. Says Palestinian Economy Grew

	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Palestinian economy has grown over the past two years,
a U.N. report said Sunday, with higher wages and more people working at home and
in Israel. Investment and exports have stagnated, however, partly due to
concerns abroad about corruption and the Palestinian Authority's political
future. In 1999, more than 47,000 new jobs were created, unemployment fell, and
the average wage rose.

Titans Sack Colts 19-16

	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eddie George scored on a 68-yard run on the third play
of the second half today to lead the Tennessee Titans to a 19-16 win over the
Indianapolis Colts and a trip to Jacksonville for the AFC title game. The
defense, even with star rookie Jevon Kearse producing next to nothing, held
Peyton Manning and the prolific Indianapolis offense to just three field goals
until Manning ran 15 yards for a touchdown with 1:51 left. But that was too late
-- Yancey Thigpen recovered an onside kick and the Titans ran out the clock.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Founder To Visit N. Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Chung Ju-yung, South Korea's richest man and head
of the Hyundai group, plans to visit North Korea again in February to promote
business with the communist country, Hyundai officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung hopes to meet leader Kim Jong Il and discuss several investment
projects, including a major industrial complex on the North's west coast, said
Kim Yun-kyu, a senior Hyundai official.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyundai plans to relocate hundreds of footwear and other small-scale,
labor-intensive South Korean plants to the industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
	   Hyundai also is pushing to invest in about a dozen handicraft and other
small businesses in Chung's hometown of Tongchun on the North's east coast.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be Chung's fourth visit to North Korea since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung and his family settled in South Korea before the Korean Peninsula was
divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945. He founded
Hyundai in the early 1950s and has developed it into South Korea's largest
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unprecedented joint venture with North Korea, Hyundai launched a
cruise tour to a scenic North Korean mountain in late 1998. More than 160,000
South Koreans have visited the mountain on the tour.

<HEADLINE> Power Outages in Pacific Northwest  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WELLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A fierce windstorm swept through the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday, killing two people in Washington state and leaving hundreds of thousands
of customers without power.
</P>
<P>
	   Hien Nguyen, 19, of Lacey, was killed around noon when a 120-foot fir tree
blew down on his pickup truck, crushing the cab, Lt. Matt Koehler said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 50-year-old Seattle architect died in an avalanche at the Crystal Mountain
ski resort, about 65 miles southeast of Seattle. He and another skier had hiked
into a closed area when the avalanche struck at about 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The avalanche was storm related, state Department of Transportation
spokeswoman Clarissa Lundeen said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow that has already fallen is being weighted down by rain and wet
snow'' creating high danger of avalanches, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interstate 90, running between Seattle and Spokane, was shut down
periodically Sunday as crews set smaller avalanches to remove the danger of
large ones sweeping down onto the roadway, Lundeen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blown-down trees and limbs caused most of the power outages, utility
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather service reported sustained winds of 25 to 35 miles per hour. The
highest gusts reported by the National Weather Service were 115 mph at
midmorning at Cannon Beach, Ore. Gusts of 81 mph at Netarts, Ore., knocked a
house 12 feet off of its foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Seattle area, at least 36,000 Seattle City Light customers were
without power after high winds swept through.
</P>
<P>
	   There were about 300,000 customers without power in western Washington and
about 100,000 in the dark in western Orgeon.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds forced the precautionary closure of the floating bridge linking
Seattle and its eastern suburbs. An estimated 100,000 cars use the 520 bridge
each day. The outage left the Interstate 90 floating bridge, three miles to the
south, as the only cross-lake span.
</P>
<P>
	   Puget Sound Energy spokeswoman Kremiere Boone said that most of the people
living the Olympia, Puyallup and Enumclaw areas were without power.

<HEADLINE> Two Small Earthquakes Rattle Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Two small earthquakes rattled central Taiwan early
Monday, seismologists said. No damage or injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The first quake, with a magnitude of 4.7, struck about 25 miles northeast of
the island's third largest city, Taichung, which was hit hard by a massive
tremor on Sept. 21, the Central Weather Bureau said. Taichung is about 80 miles
south of Taipei.
</P>
<P>
	   The second tremor, which occurred minutes later, was at the same general
location as the first, the bureau said. The second quake had a magnitude of 4.3.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of aftershocks and small quakes have jolted the island
since September's 7.6-magnitude tremor hit central Taiwan, killing about 2,400
people and leaving thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   An earthquake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage, while a tremor of
magnitude 7 can cause widespread heavy destruction.

<HEADLINE> Suns 113, Nuggets 100  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB BAUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- In the greatest night of his 11 NBA seasons, Cliff Robinson
scored a career-high 50 points, the most by any player in the league this
season, and tied the Phoenix record for points in a quarter with 23 as the Suns
beat Denver 113-100 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson, sent home from the team's shootaround earlier in the day because
of the flu, broke the scoring record for the 8-year-old America West Arena. The
previous mark was 42 by Kevin Johnson of Phoenix on April 3, 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the third-highest regular-season scoring game ever for a Phoenix
player. Tom Chambers scored 60 and 56 in the 1989-90 season. Robinson's 23
first-quarter points also were an arena record.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson's 23 first-quarter points equaled the franchise record set by
Charlie Scott against Seattle on Dec. 16, 1973, and tied by Eddie Johnson
against the Los Angeles Clippers on Nov. 12, 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous arena record for a quarter was 19 by Mitch Richmond of
Sacramento on Dec. 30, 1996, and the Suns' Dan Majerle against the Los Angeles
Lakers on April 15, 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Mercer scored 25 for Denver, which lost its fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson's performance made him the 130th NBA player to top 13,000 points
for his career. He needed 32 going into the game. Robinson had 29 through two
quarters and 40 through three. He was 17-26 from the field and 13-for-15 at the
foul line. Robinson was 3-for-5 from 3-point range and had eight rebounds, four
assists and no turnovers in 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first quarter, with most of his points coming on drives to the hoop,
Robinson was 9-for-11 from the field and 4-for-5 at the foul line. He scored
Phoenix's last nine points of the quarter as the Suns took a 34-19 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson had a chance to break the franchise record but missed a free throw
with 40 seconds to play in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson's previous career high was 41 when he played for Portland against
Minnesota on Jan. 7, 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson scored five as the Suns scored the first 12 points of the fourth
quarter to blow the game open.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver coach Dan Issel was ejected when he drew his second technical foul as
the Nuggets left the court at halftime. It was the second game in a row that the
visiting team's coach was thrown out of the game in Phoenix. Portland coach Mike
Dunleavy was ejected from the Blazers' victory over the Suns on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver assistant coach Louie Dampier also got a technical as he left the
court at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Mercer scored 19 in the first half. Denver's Antonio McDyess scored 14 in 20
foul-plagued minutes.

<HEADLINE> Paul Azinger Wins Sony Open  </HEADLINE>
    By GORDON SAKAMOTO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONOLULU (AP) -- In one swoop, Paul Azinger answered the question of whether
he can win again after a bout with cancer, helped ease the pain of the death of
friend Payne Stewart and erased 14 years of frustration in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
	   Azinger won the Sony Open on Sunday with an exclamation point, pulling away
from the field with a bogey-free 5-under 65 for a seven-stroke victory over
Australian Stuart Appleby.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming a wire-to-wire winner in the PGA Tour's first full-field event
of the year, Azinger opened with rounds of 63, 65 and 68 en route to a 19-under
261 total on the Waialae course.
</P>
<P>
	   Azinger, who turned 40 on Jan. 6, won for the first time since the 1993 PGA
Championship. He was diagnosed with lymphoma in his right shoulder in December
1993 and missed most of the next season.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12-time tour winner also ended a frustrating run in Hawaii. When the
tournament was known as the Hawaiian Open, he was a three-time runner-up and had
five other top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
	   Appleby, who closed within three strokes of Azinger after nine holes, eagled
the 72nd hole for a 67.
</P>
<P>
	   John Huston (67) and Sweden's Jesper Parnevik (69) tied for third at
10-under 270. South Africa's Ernie Els was alone at 271, and Tom Lehman, Sean
Murphy and Scott Dunlap followed at 272.
</P>
<P>
	   Els, 6-under at the start of the round, birdied the first two holes to move
up, but had a quadruple-bogey on the 423-yard third hole. He recovered to shoot
a 67, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
	   Two international players who gained recognition during the Presidents Cup,
Japan's Shigeki Maruyama and Paraguay's Carlos Franco, topped a five-player
group at 275.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Nicklaus' son, Gary, who celebrated his 31st birthday Saturday,
finished at 10-over 290. Gary Nicklaus, who earned his tour card last year, had
a 12 on the 510-yard ninth hole en route to a final-round 79.

<HEADLINE> Texas Tech Coach To Protest Basket  </HEADLINE>
    By PAM EASTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- The Big 12 Conference suspended the referee who
counted a controversial final basket in Texas A&AMP;M's 88-86 victory over Texas
Tech for the rest of the season Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Big 12 Commissioner Kevin Weiberg said Saturday's score will stand, however,
after a confusing 45 minutes in which the basket was counted, not counted and
counted again to give the Aggies the win.
</P>
<P>
	   "Referee Charles Range failed to follow appropriate protocol in the postgame
situation," Weiberg said. "Officials make judgment errors and that is not in and
of itself grounds for disciplinary action. However, the failure to follow proper
protocol and game administration is inappropriate and compels further action on
the part of the conference."
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner said Range is a successful official with the league and in
the future will be allowed to officiate Big 12 games.
</P>
<P>
	   "This decision and the announcement is not intended to detract from the
accomplishments of the Texas A&AMP;M basketball team," Weiberg said. "The Aggies
played well to put themselves in a position to win the game. They are to be
congratulated for that, and the victory stands."
</P>
<P>
	   Weiberg said the league found that the other two officials, Paul Janssen and
Eddie Jackson, handled the situation properly. Weiberg did not specify what
Range failed to do.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Tech Coach James Dickey declined to comment on the conference's
action.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Dickey said it was clear to him the basket should not
have been counted.
</P>
<P>
	   "On the replay, it clearly shows the basket wasn't good," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aggies coach Melvin Watkins said the officials were hesitant about Range's
call that a putback at the buzzer by Texas A&AMP;M's Andy Leatherman off an air ball
from teammate Bernard King was good.
</P>
<P>
	   When officials first went back on the call and decided the game should go
into overtime and the scoreboard changed to reflect that, Watkins stomped off
the court. His team already was in the locker room showering and preparing to
head to the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments later, Watkins returned to the floor and yelled that the shot should
be counted.
</P>
<P>
	   When the officials again decided to count the shot, Watkins marched out of
the arena and Dickey began yelling, tossing his suit coat across the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had the indication at one point that we were going to play the overtime,"
Dickey said. "I think there was obviously some confusion and maybe one official
or two officials saw it differently than another official."
</P>
<P>
	   Janssen admitted he had some questions about Range's call that the shot was
good, but after talking it over with the other referees and checking that the
clock started on time, he seconded the call.
</P>
<P>
	   "We aren't going to get into all these extraneous things," Janssen said
Saturday night. "We conferred, Charlie counted the shot as good, and the game is
done."
</P>
<P>
	   While that determination was being made, the Red Raiders sat on their bench
for 45 minutes after the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Tech fans, outraged that the Aggies had left the court and wouldn't return
for an overtime period the scoreboard reflected, began chanting, "Hell no, we
won't go."
</P>
<P>
	   They didn't go until nearly an hour later when the game's announcer told
them Texas A&AMP;M had been declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once one team leaves the court, they can't reverse the outcome of the
game," Big 12 spokesman Bo Carter said. "There is no way they can change the
score."
</P>
<P>
	   A&AMP;M athletic director Wally Groff said the game's conclusion was among the
strangest he's seen.
</P>
<P>
	   "Usually the officials will make a call and stick with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Groff said as he watched the game from home Saturday, he thought A&AMP;M handled
itself properly by leaving after Range called the basket good.
</P>
<P>
	   "The proper attitude and the way the teams are supposed to conduct
themselves is to leave the court immediately after a controversial call like
that," he said. "We have been on the short end of that many times, too. It all
works out."
</P>
<P>
	   The last time Texas A&AMP;M won a game at Lubbock was 1994, when a last-second
basket triggered a brawl between the rivals.

	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Tom Donahoe, forced to resign Friday as the Pittsburgh
Steelers' director of football operations, talked over the weekend to at least
four NFL teams about possible front-office positions, according to NFL sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahoe has declined to talk to reporters since his resignation was
accepted, but he has fielded numerous calls from NFL teams. Among those
contacting him were the New Orleans Saints and the Miami Dolphins, and he also
is expected to talk to the expansion Houston franchise.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami is seeking a general manager now that Jimmy Johnson has stepped down
to make way for Dave Wannstedt to take over as coach. Donahoe interviewed
Wannstedt for the Steelers' coaching job in 1992 before Bill Cowher was hired,
and Donahoe is believed to have recommended Wannstedt to Steelers president Dan
Rooney.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahoe, who had worked for the Steelers since 1986 before losing a power
struggle with Cowher, also talked to the Saints several hours after the Steelers
announced his resignation Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston apparently sought permission from the Steelers to talk to Donahoe
even before he resigned, although former Washington Redskins general manager
Charley Casserly is believed to be the frontrunner there.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahoe became the third major front office figure in two years to leave the
Steelers from the group that was largely responsible for assembling the teams
that played in three AFC championship games in four years from 1994-97.
</P>
<P>
	   Former college scouting chief Tom Modrak left in 1998 to run the
Philadelphia Eagles' football operations, though it is possible he might be
interested in returning to Pittsburgh if he is offered the same job there.
Modrak has an escape clause in his Philadelphia contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Former pro scouting chief Charlie Bailey left the Steelers last year to
become the Saints' assistant general manager, and could be reunited with Donahoe
if the Saints decide to hire Donahoe.
</P>
<P>
	   Modrak and Cowher had a good relationship when the two worked together,
although Modrak's contact with Cowher during the season was limited because
Modrak frequently was away on scouting trips.
</P>
<P>
	   Pittsburgh has already begun its search for Donahoe's successor, and Cowher
will be involved. Cowher was expected to scout players at the Senior Bowl this
week, but instead will stay behind in Pittsburgh to help interview candidates
for Donahoe's vacated position.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Rooney said emphatically Friday that Cowher will not have more say
in personnel matters, the fact that Cowher is sitting in on the interviews could
be a sign that he will be more heavily involved in front office matters.
</P>
<P>
	   Cowher and Donahoe both offered to resign following a 6-10 season because
they could no longer work together, but the Steelers turned down Cowher's offer
and chose instead to accept Donahoe's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Steelers had never had a director of football operations -- Rooney
prefers not to have an executive with the title of general manager -- until
Donahoe moved into the position in 1991.

<HEADLINE> SOCOG Lays off Three Managers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Sydney Olympic organizing committee fired
three senior managers Monday in the first step toward making up a $65 million
budget shortfall.
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Watson, who joined the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games
(SOCOG) as Group General Manager, Games Support in August 1997, was the most
senior executive let go.
</P>
<P>
	Bill Swingler, SOCOG's general manager for games services, and Geoff Bentley,
the general manager for interstate football, also were fired.
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Sandy Hollway said other divisions and venue teams within SOCOG
would take on the work done by the three executives.
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking to reduce costs wherever we can and in the search for savings
obviously senior management is not exempt,'' Hollway said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG announced last month that it was going to fall $65 million short of its
sponsorship revenue target. The committee is expected to make savings of about
$32.5 million, with the balance of the shortfall being made up from a
contingency fund.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Peter Freistadt, who worked as a filmmaker and actor in
his native Czechoslovakia and in Israel, died Friday from a long-term illness.
He was 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Freistadt survived the Nazi occupation and fled the Communist regime in
1964. He moved to Israel in 1964 where he later became well-known for the epic
movies he directed, including ``Motive to Kill'' and ``Sabina and Her Men,''
both in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   He produced dozens of films in cooperation with Czech and Israeli television
networks about Jewish figures, including Franz Kafka. He acted in some of the
major Israeli films of the 1980s, including the Palestinian-Israeli prison
drama, ``Beyond the Walls'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
	   Freistadt helped found Israeli state-owned television and served on the
boards of movie, television and theater associations in the country. He also
served as the Israeli cultural attache in Prague.

	   Gene Harris
</P>
<P>
	   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Grammy-nominated jazz pianist Gene Harris, who had been
awaiting a kidney transplant, died at his home Sunday. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris was due for transplant surgery last summer because of kidney failure
caused by diabetes. His daughter planned to donate a kidney, but could not
because of illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris, who had maintained a busy schedule recording and touring both
nationally and internationally, began performing at the age of six. A native of
Benton Harbor, Mich., Harris formed the Three Sounds in 1956 and within two
years secured a record contract in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris' piano stylings made the Three Sounds one of the most popular 1960's
jazz groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris moved to Boise in 1977 where he became musical director for a hotel,
and he continued recording, eventually joining Ray Brown's Trio.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1987, Harris was nominated for a Grammy award for his album ``A Tribute
To Count Basie.'' His 1985 recording ``Gene Harris Trio Plus One'' won the
French equivalent of the Grammy.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the annual Gene Harris Jazz Festival was inaugurated at Boise State
University.
T.N. Kaul
</P>
<P>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- T.N. Kaul, former diplomat and a key architect of
India's peace agreements with China, Pakistan and the former Soviet Union, died
in northern India Sunday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   A member of the Indian Civil Service, Kaul helped mold India's foreign
policy in the immediate aftermath of independence from British colonial rule in
1947. He co-authored the Panchsheel Agreement between India and China in the
1950s, preparing the groundwork for friendship between the world's two most
populous nations.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, Kaul assisted Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in formulating the Simla
Agreement with neighboring Pakistan in which both countries agreed to resolve
their disputes through bilateral dialogue.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaul served as India's ambassador to Moscow twice and also as ambassador to
the United States.
Jack Lake
</P>
<P>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- John B. ``Jack'' Lake, who as publisher of the
St. Petersburg Times saw the newspaper grow in prominence as the city he loved
grew too, died Saturday after an apparent stroke. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Lake was a community leader as much as a newspaper leader. He helped bring
the Salvador Dali Museum to St. Petersburg and paved the way for the city to
lure a major league baseball expansion franchise, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with Jim Healey, Lake was one of the first to dream that this quiet
but growing waterfront city across the bay from Tampa should have its own big
league baseball team. He threw out the first pitch of the first minor league
game when the Devil Rays' farm system started playing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lake started his newspaper career after serving in World War II at the Eagle
Gazette, a small daily in Lancaster, Ohio. He began working in classified
advertising and stayed at the Eagle Gazette 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   After returning to active duty in the Korean War and a stint as advertising
manager at the Elizabeth Journal in New Jersey, Lake came to St. Petersburg in
1960.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Times, he rose from advertising director through the ranks until
taking over as publisher in 1971. He retired in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   His years at the paper were marked by rapid circulation growth as the
community grew. The year before Lake arrived, the Times daily circulation was
100,000. The year he left, it was 270,000.
Clifton M. ``Demi'' McClure
</P>
<P>
	   ANDERSON, S.C. (AP) -- Clifton M. ``Demi'' McClure, who was one of the first
Americans to ride a hot-air balloon to the edge of space, died Friday in
Huntsville, Ala., from complications of a stroke. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
	   A career in the Air Force led McClure into the Man High Project, a pre-NASA
program in New Mexico used to gather information about cabin conditions in high
altitudes similar to space.
</P>
<P>
	   On Oct. 8, 1958, McClure was strapped into a gondola attached to a 3
million-cubic-foot balloon and floated up to 99,700 feet. Reports published
afterward said his body temperature went as high as 106.6 degrees as the balloon
passed through a warm layer of the atmosphere that heated the gondola to 118
degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   McClure and the program were featured in a History Channel show, ``To The
Edge of Space: Project Man High'' in August. He was the third person to see the
curvature of the earth from space.
</P>
<P>
	   McClure was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in September 1960. After
retiring from active duty, he became a pilot for the South Carolina Air National
Guard, serving in Germany during the Berlin Crisis in 1962.
By Saam
</P>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- By Saam, inducted into the broadcasters' wing of the
baseball Hall of Fame after calling more than 8,000 games for the Philadelphia
Phillies and Athletics, died Sunday after a stroke. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 38 years in Philadelphia, he described 13 no-hitters, including
Jim Bunning's perfect game against the New York Mets in 1964, and Ted Williams'
final two games of 1941, when he batted over .400.
</P>
<P>
	   Saam also broadcast University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia Eagles
football games, college and professional basketball, and Ramblers hockey games.
</P>
<P>
	   Byrum F. Saam began his Philadelphia broadcasting in 1937, covering football
games for Temple and Villanova. The next year, he started announcing Phillies
and Athletics home games.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasters did not travel at the time, so he was able to announce for both
teams until the late 1940s, when Phillies owner Bob Carpenter wanted to announce
the road games too, meaning the city's two teams would have separate announcers.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of loyalty to Athletics owner Connie Mack, Saam became the A's home and
road announcer in 1950, and remained with the team until 1954, when the team
left town. He was the Phillies' announcer for the 1955 through 1975 seasons,
after which he retired.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, Saam was honored with the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Boy, Shot Leaving Church, Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A man shot his stepson as the boy was leaving church
services Sunday with his family, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cedric Crutcher, 17, died hours later at a local hospital, said Huntsville
police spokesman Wendell Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said 41-year-old Byron Bonner was waiting in the parking lot when
Crutcher left Northwest Church of Christ about noon. The two exchanged words,
and Bonner allegedly shot Crutcher several times, with one shot striking the
youth in the back of the head, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonner fled the scene but surrendered at the Jefferson County Jail in
Birmingham, about 90 miles south of Huntsville, at 9:10 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonner, who had worked at the U.S. Post Office in Madison, and Crutcher's
mother, Edna, were divorcing, Johnson said. It was not clear whether Bonson
still worked at the post office, Johnson said. Police were called to her home
earlier Sunday because Bonner was there, he said, and the woman had sought a
restraining order against Bonner.

<HEADLINE> Ref Suspended From Texas Tech Game  </HEADLINE>
    By PAM EASTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- The Big 12 Conference suspended the referee who
counted a controversial final basket in Texas A&AMP;M's 88-86 victory over Texas
Tech for the rest of the season Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Big 12 Commissioner Kevin Weiberg said Saturday's score will stand, however,
after a confusing 45 minutes in which the basket was counted, not counted and
counted again to give the Aggies the win.
</P>
<P>
	   "Referee Charles Range failed to follow appropriate protocol in the postgame
situation," Weiberg said. "Officials make judgment errors and that is not in and
of itself grounds for disciplinary action. However, the failure to follow proper
protocol and game administration is inappropriate and compels further action on
the part of the conference."
</P>
<P>
	   The Big 12 Conference requires that both coaches are present when officials
are discussing a controversial call. A&AMP;M coach Melvin Watkins said Range told
him he was going to count the basket and based on that, Watkins allowed his team
to leave the court.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once one team leaves the court, they can't reverse the outcome of the
game," Big 12 spokesman Bo Carter said Saturday. "There is no way they can
change the score."
</P>
<P>
	   Weiberg said Range is a successful official with the league and in the
future will be allowed to officiate Big 12 games.
</P>
<P>
	   "This decision and the announcement is not intended to detract from the
accomplishments of the Texas A&AMP;M basketball team," the commissioner said. "The
Aggies played well to put themselves in a position to win the game. They are to
be congratulated for that, and the victory stands."
</P>
<P>
	   Weiberg said the league found that the other two officials, Paul Janssen and
Eddie Jackson, handled the situation properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Tech coach James Dickey declined to comment on the conference's
action.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Dickey said it was clear to him the basket should not
have been counted.
</P>
<P>
	   "On the replay, it clearly shows the basket wasn't good," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Watkins said the officials were hesitant about Range's call that a putback
at the buzzer by Texas A&AMP;M's Andy Leatherman off an air ball from teammate
Bernard King was good.
</P>
<P>
	   When officials first went back on the call and decided the game should go
into overtime and the scoreboard changed to reflect that, Watkins stomped off
the court. His team already was in the locker room showering and preparing to
head to the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments later, Watkins returned to the floor and yelled that the shot should
be counted.
</P>
<P>
	   When the officials again decided to count the shot, Watkins marched out of
the arena and Dickey began yelling, tossing his suit coat across the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had the indication at one point that we were going to play the overtime,"
Dickey said. "I think there was obviously some confusion and maybe one official
or two officials saw it differently than another official."
</P>
<P>
	   Janssen admitted he had some questions about Range's call that the shot was
good, but after talking it over with the other referees and checking that the
clock started on time, he seconded the call.
</P>
<P>
	   "We aren't going to get into all these extraneous things," Janssen said
Saturday night. "We conferred, Charlie counted the shot as good, and the game is
done."
</P>
<P>
	   While that determination was being made, the Red Raiders sat on their bench
for 45 minutes after the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Tech fans, outraged that the Aggies had left the court and wouldn't return
for an overtime period the scoreboard reflected, began chanting, "Hell no, we
won't go."
</P>
<P>
	   They didn't go until nearly an hour later when the game's announcer told
them Texas A&AMP;M had been declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
	   A&AMP;M athletic director Wally Groff said the game's conclusion was among the
strangest he's seen.
</P>
<P>
	   "Usually the officials will make a call and stick with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Groff said as he watched the game from home Saturday, he thought A&AMP;M handled
itself properly by leaving after Range called the basket good.
</P>
<P>
	   "The proper attitude and the way the teams are supposed to conduct
themselves is to leave the court immediately after a controversial call like
that," he said. "We have been on the short end of that many times, too. It all
works out."
</P>
<P>
	   The last time Texas A&AMP;M won a game at Lubbock was 1994, when a last-second
basket triggered a brawl between the rivals.

Storms Kill 2 in Pacific Northwest
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A fierce windstorm swept through the Pacific Northwest
today, killing two people in Washington state and leaving hundreds of thousands
of customers without power. Hien Nguyen, 19, of Lacey, was killed around noon
when a 120-foot fir tree blew down on his pickup truck, crushing the cab, Lt.
Matt Koehler said. A 50-year-old Seattle architect died in an avalanche at the
Crystal Mountain ski resort, about 65 miles southeast of Seattle. He and another
skier had hiked into a closed area when the avalanche struck at about 1:30 p.m.
The avalanche was storm related, a state Department of Transportation

Cuba Official Rips Citizenship for Boy

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Cuban official today derided U.S. lawmakers'
attempts to grant citizenship to 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez. "Congress is
supposed to be a serious institution and not an instrument to permit what
amounts to a kidnapping of a small boy," said Ricardo Alarcon, president of the
Cuban National Assembly. The citizenship idea, he told NBC, is "absolutely
nonsense." The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled the boy must be
returned to his father in Cuba. But last week, Attorney General Janet Reno
lifted the deadline to give Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight in
federal court to keep the boy with them.

defeat, then quickly went to Lagos' campaign headquarters at a downtown hotel to
congratulate him. Economic issues dominated the campaign as voters decided

mission to the Red Planet can be saved. The three-legged lander was to have
touched down Dec. 3 for a 90-day mission near Mars' south pole to study the

<HEADLINE> Power Outages in Pacific Northwest  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WELLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A fierce windstorm swept through the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday, killing two people in Washington state and leaving hundreds of thousands
of customers without power.
</P>
<P>
	   Hien Nguyen, 19, of Lacey, was killed around noon when a 120-foot fir tree
blew down on his pickup truck, crushing the cab, Lt. Matt Koehler said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 50-year-old Seattle architect died in an avalanche at the Crystal Mountain
ski resort, about 65 miles southeast of Seattle near Mt. Rainier. He and another
skier had hiked into a closed area when the avalanche struck at about 1:30 p.m.
His identity was not released.
</P>
<P>
	   Interstate 90, running between Seattle and Spokane, was shut down
periodically Sunday as crews set smaller avalanches to remove the danger of
large ones sweeping down onto the roadway, said Clarissa Lundeen, spokeswoman
for the state Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow that has already fallen is being weighted down by rain and wet
snow'' creating high danger of avalanches, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interstate 90, running between Seattle and Spokane, was shut down
periodically Sunday as crews set smaller avalanches to remove the danger of
large ones sweeping down onto the roadway, Lundeen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blown-down trees and limbs caused most of the power outages, utility
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather service reported sustained winds of 25 to 35 miles per hour. The
highest gusts reported by the National Weather Service were 115 mph at
midmorning at Cannon Beach, Ore. Gusts of 81 mph at Netarts, Ore., knocked a
house 12 feet off of its foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Seattle area, at least 24,000 Seattle City Light customers were
without power after high winds swept through.
</P>
<P>
	   There were about 300,000 customers without power in western Washington and
about 100,000 in the dark in western Orgeon.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds forced the precautionary closure of the floating bridge linking
Seattle and its eastern suburbs. An estimated 100,000 cars use the 520 bridge
each day. The outage left the Interstate 90 floating bridge, three miles to the
south, as the only cross-lake span.
</P>
<P>
	   Puget Sound Energy spokeswoman Kremiere Boone said that most of the people
living the Olympia, Puyallup and Enumclaw areas were without power.

<HEADLINE> Dixie Dot Com Wins $200,000 Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Dixie Dot Com returned to the winner's circle a year
after fracturing a cannon bone with a 1 1/2-length victory Sunday in the
$200,000 San Pasqual Grade II Handicap at Santa Anita Park.
</P>
<P>
	Budroyale, with Garrett Gomez, finished second, 1 1/2 lengths in front of Six
Below and David Flores, in a field of six in the race for 4-year-olds and up.
</P>
<P>
	Dixie Dot Com and Patrick Valenzuela covered 1 1-16 miles on a fast track in
1:40 4-5. The 4-year-old son of Dixie Brass had the fracture during a win at the
1999 San Fernando Breeders' Cup Stakes. The injury was found four days later.
</P>
<P>
	It was Valenzuela's first graded stakes win since the 1996 Del Mar Handicap.
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, when this horse ran so well in the San Fernando, we were talking
about all the big things we had planned for him,'' Valenzuela said. ``I'm going
to be a little more conservative now until we see how he is.''
</P>
<P>
	Dixie Dot Com won $120,000 to bring his total of 13 career starts to $617,775.
The winner paid $11.20, $5 and $2.80. Favorite Budroyale, returned $3 and $2.80,
while Six Below paid $2.80 to show.
</P>
<P>
	Dixie Dot Com, carrying 118 pounds, forced the pace three deep in the first
turn, made an outside bid at the stretch and took a short lead midstretch before
inching clear. The 13-10 favorite Budroyale, with high weight of 122, fanned
wide on the first turn and stalked the pace. Six Below, under 116 pounds, held
the lead to the three-quarter marker, but lacked the needed finish.

    SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Webber had 25 points and 11 rebounds Sunday
night as the Sacramento Kings held off the Cleveland Cavaliers 113-102.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Williams added 20 points and 10 assists for the Kings, who won their
fifth straight game and nine in their last 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinging to a 94-93 lead midway through the fourth quarter, Vlade Divac
converted on a drive and Scot Pollard followed with a dunk, putting the Kings up
by five. The lead was never less than five points the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland's Shawn Kemp had 20 points and nine rebounds, but fouled out with
3:12 to play. Lamond Murray scored 18 points and Mark Bryant had 18 points and
11 rebounds.

	   Predrag Stojakovic had 16 points for the Kings, who had a 19-point lead
early in the third quarter. Nick Anderson scored 12 points and Divac had 11
points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by 19 points early in the third quarter, the Cavaliers rallied
behind the shooting of Murray. He scored nine points as Cleveland outscored the
Kings 27-18, closing to 87-80 heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavaliers cut further into Sacramento's lead in the fourth, pulling
within a point on two occasions, the last time coming on Kemp's three-point play
with 5:33 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Getting little resistance from Cleveland's suspect defense, the Kings shot
59 percent in the first half and led 69-53.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Two small earthquakes rattled central Taiwan early
Monday, seismologists said. No damage or injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The first quake, with a magnitude of 4.7, struck 25 miles northeast of the
island's third-largest city, Taichung, the Central Weather Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taichung, hit hard by a massive tremor on Sept. 21, is 80 miles south of
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
	   The epicenter of the second tremor, which occurred minutes after the first
quake, was in the same general location as the first, the bureau said. The
second earthquake had a magnitude of 4.3.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of aftershocks and small quakes have jolted the island
since September's 7.6-magnitude tremor hit central Taiwan, killing 2,400 people
and leaving thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   An earthquake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage, while a tremor of
magnitude 7 can cause widespread heavy destruction.

<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- In the greatest night of his 11 NBA seasons, Cliff Robinson
scored a career-high 50 points, the most by any player in the league this
season, and tied the Phoenix record for points in a quarter with 23 as the Suns
beat Denver 113-100 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson, sent home from the team's shootaround earlier in the day because
of the flu, broke the scoring record for the 8-year-old America West Arena. The
previous mark was 42 by Kevin Johnson of Phoenix on April 3, 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the third-highest regular-season scoring game ever for a Phoenix
player. Tom Chambers scored 60 and 56 in the 1989-90 season. Robinson's 23
first-quarter points also were an arena record.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson's 23 first-quarter points equaled the franchise record set by
Charlie Scott against Seattle on Dec. 16, 1973, and tied by Eddie Johnson
against the Los Angeles Clippers on Nov. 12, 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous arena record for a quarter was 19 by Mitch Richmond of
Sacramento on Dec. 30, 1996, and the Suns' Dan Majerle against the Los Angeles
Lakers on April 15, 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Mercer scored 25 for Denver, which lost its fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson's performance made him the 130th NBA player to top 13,000 points
for his career. He needed 32 going into the game. Robinson had 29 through two
quarters and 40 through three. He was 17-26 from the field and 13-for-15 at the
foul line. Robinson was 3-for-5 from 3-point range and had eight rebounds, four
assists and no turnovers in 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first quarter, with most of his points coming on drives to the hoop,
Robinson was 9-for-11 from the field and 4-for-5 at the foul line. He scored
Phoenix's last nine points of the quarter as the Suns took a 34-19 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson had a chance to break the franchise record but missed a free throw
with 40 seconds to play in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson's previous career high was 41 when he played for Portland against
Minnesota on Jan. 7, 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson scored five as the Suns scored the first 12 points of the fourth
quarter to blow the game open.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver coach Dan Issel was ejected when he drew his second technical foul as
the Nuggets left the court at halftime. It was the second game in a row that the
visiting team's coach was thrown out of the game in Phoenix. Portland coach Mike
Dunleavy was ejected from the Blazers' victory over the Suns on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver assistant coach Louie Dampier also got a technical as he left the
court at halftime.
