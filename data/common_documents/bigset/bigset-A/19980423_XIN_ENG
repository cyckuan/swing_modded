<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets Chilean Socialist Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, the Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, in a meeting
today with Ricardo Lagos, leader of Chile's Socialist Party and
Party for Democracy, said that China and Chile have a very good
relationship and have many common views on international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lagos' visit will serve to further deepen
exchanges and cooperation between the two countries
</P>
<P>
Li visited Chile in November 1996, and he said that the NPC has
maintained friendly contacts with the Chilean parliament and many
parties like the Socialist Party and the Party for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining bilateral exchanges and cooperation will help
promote friendly co-operative ties between the two countries in a
long-term and steady way, Li said. This will also play a positive
role in increasing mutual understanding and friendship between the
two peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also discussed the recent NPC session and the progress China
has made in its democracy and legal system.
</P>
<P>
Lagos said that his visit has helped him see in person Deng
Xiaoping's Theory and its practice in China and said he believes
that China will have even greater achievements under the new
leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chilean government and people especially value
their cooperation with China and are ready to serve as a bridge
between the Pacific region and Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government and people are highly interested in
China's progress and are also impressed very much by the
development goals and plans of the recent People's Congress, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Various parties in the Chilean parliament are taking an active
attitude toward Sino-chilean relations, he said, and his two
parties are willing to make their own effort.
</P>
<P>
Lagos is here as guest of the International Department of the
CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> Europe Strives for Close Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 22 (Xinhua) -- European Parliament President Jose
Maria Gil-Robles said here Wednesday the European Union would make
efforts to develop close ties and expand exchanges with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Gil-Robles, addressing Russia's lower house, the State Duma,
said that economic and political stability in Russia was important
for ensuring peaceful co-existence among nations world-wide.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that integration into the global economy was crucial
for Russia, Gil-Robles voiced his support for Moscow's bid to join
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been striving for admission to the WTO, the body
which acts as a monitor on goods and services trading in the world.
</P>
<P>
Gil-Robles, expressing full understanding of Russia's concern
about the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), said the two sides should not be hostile to each other.
</P>
<P>
Russia and NATO have been at odds over the group's enlargement
into eastern Europe, a move Russia has said poses a threat to
Russia's national interest.
</P>
<P>
Gil-Robles, who arrived here Monday for a visit, held separate
talks with Russia's parliamentary leaders on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Most Germans Still Reluctant to Embrace Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- With the planned advent of the
single European currency, the euro, just eight months away, a
majority of Germans are still dismayed about abandoning their
cherished German marks in favor of the untested new currency, a
German opinion poll showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll commissioned by the German ZDF television network
found that 62.4 percent of Germans opposed the euro and only 32.7
percent supported it.
</P>
<P>
The main concern shared by many Germans was still the possible
inflation risks due to the introduction of the euro, the survey
showed. Among 1,347 people questioned, 43.3 percent said they
believed that the cost of living would rise after the currency
switch.
</P>
<P>
Following a European Union road map, the euro will be launched
in January 1999. But at first it will only be used in financial
exchanges in the expected 11 euro zone countries. The actual notes
and coins will be introduced over a six-month period starting
January 1, 2002, after which the participants' present national
currencies will cease to be legal tender.
</P>
<P>
Both houses of the German parliament are due to vote later this
week on Germany's adoption of the euro. With broad support from
both the ruling and major opposition parties, an approval is
believed to be certain.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Lead G-7 Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada is posed to lead the G-7
countries in economic growth through this year and next, according
to the latest economic forecast by the Royal Bank of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Canadian growth is expected to reach 3.2 percent this year and
2.8 percent next year, the bank's economists predicted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Canadian economy's underlying momentum will
carry us through to two years of good growth," John MacCallum,
chief economist of the bank was quoted as saying by reports
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Canada's economic growth has been mostly
export-driven. But in 1998-99, it will be a "made-in-Canada"
story, the forecast said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic growth will be fueled by largely low interest rates,
strong domestic demand and a pro-investment attitude from Canadian
businesses, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Of the provinces, Alberta will post the strongest growth over
the next two years, followed by Ontario, Newfoundland and Nova
Scotia. British Columbia will have the weakest.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the bank said there are risks to its rosy expectations,
including a deepening of the Asian crisis, weaker prices of
commodities, high consumer debt and a U.S. stock market
correction.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist With Strategic View Becomes New Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has chosen
a scientist who was known for being able to examine things from a
strategic point of view and to tailor his research to the needs of
the nation as a new model for Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Xinsong, who died of a heart attack in 1997 at the age of
66 and who is known as the "father of Chinese robotics", was
chosen as an example of one who could apply the policy of
rejuvenating the nation with science and technology, which is a
major priority of China's new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who was a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering
and a leading member of a national automation project, contributed
enormously to a deep-sea robot that can work at a depth of 6,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
Li Xueyong, Vice-minister of Science and Technology, told a
meeting held to commemorate Jiang in Beijing today, that he was
not only good at scientific research and development, but also
capable of making decisions in accordance with the overall
situation. And it was Jiang, he said, who helped the rapid
development of the robotics industry in the early 1980s, and
suggested that China develop its own robots for deep-sea
exploration.
</P>
<P>
He was also deeply interested in the development of large and
middle-sized enterprises in China and developed the Computer
Integrated Manufacturing System, which has been used in factories
in different provinces and municipalities to improve their profit.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese Academy of Sciences official says that Jiang believed
that scientific research should focus on major projects connected
to the needs of the nation and that the Academy should maintain a
strong team for those projects.
</P>
<P>
Jiang contributed many suggestions on the development of
science and technology in China that still fit China's scientific
reform and development principles even now, the official said,
adding that the country needs scientists like him with strategic
views.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Send Humanitarian Charters to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
decided to send three humanitarian charters to Iraq by the end of
of this month, a U.N. source said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The source said the U.S. mission to the United Nations had
applied for permission from the United Nations Sanctions Committee
on Iraq this morning, which is expected to be approved by the
Committee very soon.
</P>
<P>
The source also said the initiative was sponsored by an
American non-governmental organization called AmeriCare and
supported by the Government of the United States, and the three
charters, via Oman, will arrive in Iraq on April 27, 28 and 29
respectively. The humanitarian supplies include medicine and
medical equipments.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been opposing any humanitarian planes to
Iraq. Its move at the present is a departure from its traditional
position of the past. The purpose of the move is unknown to the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Jobs for Demobilized Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that local governments should provide jobs for demobilized
soldiers and help them receive proper job training.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at the National Resettlement Conference
for Demobilized Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
This year, some 50,000 officers of the People's Liberation Army
and the armed police will be transferred to civilian work and the
number will grow in 1999 and 2000. This is in accordance with the
country's announcement last October to cut its armed forces by
500,000 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that reducing the size of the armed forces is an
important step in modernizing the Chinese army and that
resettlement for the demobilized soldiers has a direct bearing on
the success of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
Although the resettlement this year faces tremendous
difficulties, because it coincides with the government's
institutional restructuring and state enterprise reforms, local
governments should overcome all difficulties to see to it that
those demobilized officers are properly trained and employed,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the military should help the demobilized soldiers
understand the current situation and combine personal interest
with the need of the Party and the country and cooperate with
local governments.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the resettlement work needs to be reformed
to suit the socialist market economy and asked military and
civilian departments to begin doing research on that.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Supports Lebanon's Position on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Speaker of the National
Assembly Ahmed Abdul Aziz Al-Sadoun said here Wednesday that his
country fully supported Lebanese government's position concerning
the Israeli withdrawal offer from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadoun made the remarks upon his arrival here for a
three-day official visit at the invitation of his Lebanese
counterpart Nabih Berri, according to Lebanese official National
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon
immediately and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet formally approved on April 1 the U.N.
Resolution 425 and offered to withdraw its troops from south
Lebanon provided negotiated security arrangements are agreed by
the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria firmly rejected the offer on the
grounds that it contradicted the U.N. resolution which calls for
an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, saying that the
pullout must be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the aim of protecting its northern
settlements from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadoun, who came here from Syria, is expected to meet
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
for discussions on bilateral ties and regional affairs.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive arm of the European Union (EU), said on Wednesday it has
set up 25 study centers for issues concerning European integration.
</P>
<P>
The centers are scattered in universities of the 15 EU member
states where 54 new courses on European integration will be
taught. They will focus on the study of 202 projects, ranging from
community law and economic and political integration to the
history of the integration process.
</P>
<P>
The study centers, to be known as the Jean Monnet European
Centers of Excellence, are founded to bring greater visibility to
the universities' scientific and human resources on European
issues.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to contribute towards the development of
multi-disciplinary teaching, research and training activities and
the publication of directories on European teaching activities
within universities.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to link the EU with the outside world at
local and regional levels by promoting various types of
cooperation initiatives.
</P>
<P>
A network is in operation with a teaching faculty specializing
in such projects as the European position in the framework of the
World Trade Organization, the union's Agenda 2000, the necessary
institutional reforms and the enlargement of the EU.

<HEADLINE> UUP Leader Denounces Killing in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- David Trimble, leader of the
pro-British Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), on Wednesday denounced
the murder of a Roman Catholic that has cast a shadow over hopes
for peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC Radio, Trimble described the suspected
Protestant murderers as "corrupt and degenerate" and predicted the
path to stability would not be easy.
</P>
<P>
Adrian Lamph, 29, was shot dead on Tuesday by a lone gunman in
a yard at a municipal depot in the mainly Protestant town of
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
It was the first apparently sectarian killing since pro-Irish
Roman Catholic and pro-British Protestant parties reached an
agreement on April 10 to end the 30-year-old conflict in the
province.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility of the murder, but media
reports accused the outlawed Loyalist Volunteer Front (LVF), a
dissident militant group which killed several Catholic
nationalists in a campaign aimed at derailing the 22-month
multiparty peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he was "appalled and disgusted at what has
happened." "I have to say to the handful of corrupt and degenerate
people who are responsible for this...nothing will be achieved, no
cause will be served by this sort of action."
</P>
<P>
But he was adamant that peace efforts would bear fruit, despite
setbacks along the way.
</P>
<P>
"The hope will be fulfilled -- but it's not going to be easy,
it's not going to be a smooth road," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Overtakes UK In World League Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Ireland has
overtaken the United Kingdom in the world league table of economic
performance, according to a study released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual study of 46 countries from a Swiss-based think-tank
showed Britain slipping one place to 12th out of the 15 economies
in the first rank.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the UK's performance, which follows a climb from
19th last year, was attributed to the strength of the pound, which
harmed the country's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The study said that Ireland continued to be the "Tiger of
Europe" with the government's policy of attracting inward
investment responsible for "staggering growth" over the past few
years. Its rating has gone up from 22nd two years ago to 11th.
</P>
<P>
While Ireland has been the success story of the past few years,
other countries in Europe - including the three big economies of
Germany, France and Italy - have fared less well.
</P>
<P>
The International Institute for Management Development (IMD)
said Germany had dropped from sixth position in the mid-1990s to
14th - second to bottom of the first division.
</P>
<P>
France slipped two places to 21st, while Italy, despite some
improvement over the past 12 months, was rooted at the bottom of
the second division in 32th position.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. topped the league, with the IMD saying that only
complacency or a major stockmarket crash could threaten a
situation that is "historically exceptional".
</P>
<P>
Japan has suffered a nine-place drop to 18th that "reflects a
complete disarray of the economy", the institute said.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE Announces New Strategic Focus In Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Board of the London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE)
Wednesday proposed substantial changes to LIFFE's strategic focus
as well as to its trading platforms and corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
The Board is also reviewing how access rights to the Exchange
should be obtained and whether its shareholding structure should
be simplified.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will be published in the week beginning May 4,
according to an announcement by LIFFE.
</P>
<P>
The changes are designed to ensure that LIFFE has the
competitive strengths and the decision-making machinery necessary
to meet the rapidly changing needs of market users in the years
ahead.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE considers that the Company should adopt a profit
objective with the intention of increasing value for its
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
It further believes that LIFFE should remove impediments to
third party shareholders, but expects to remain predominantly
owned by the existing customers of the market.
</P>
<P>
The Company has commissioned further analysis to determine
whether these changes should entail the simplification of the
shareholding structure and the separation of shares and permits to
trade on the floor of the Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Jack Wigglesworth, Chairman of LIFFE, said: "The proposals are
not expected to alter materially the existing ownership of LIFFE."
</P>
<P>
However, "We need a new strategy, embracing new technology,
with a new focus, to meet the new needs of market users," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Launches New Crackdown on "Booze" Smugglers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Wednesday announced new
measures to crack down alcohol, beer and cigarettes smugglers who
swindle customs out of nearly one billion pounds (1.7 billion U.S.
dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Customs minister Dawn Primarolo said that under new proposals,
persistent offenders face the loss of their vehicles and may be
disqualified from driving.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to cracking down on tobacco and
alcohol smuggling and this tough package will send a message that
smuggling does not pay," she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under European rules, Britons are allowed to return home with
hefty allowances of spirits, wine, beer and tobacco for their own
personal use. And big tax differentials between Britain and the
continent have spawned bootlegging on a giant scale.
</P>
<P>
The huge profits on offer have attracted criminal gangs whose
activities have pushed up beer imports by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Primarolo said offenders may also have to pay compensation for
revenue evaded through smuggling, while owners of shops and
restaurants selling smuggled alcohol could lose their liquor
licenses.
</P>
<P>
British Customs offices made more than 8,700 seizures of
alcohol and tobacco last year and confiscated 2,929 vehicles used
by smugglers.

<HEADLINE> Romania Promulgates Bankruptcy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Romania's President Emil
Constantinescu Wednesday promulgated the law on winding up
troubled banks, announced the information office of the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy law was drafted with the help of Romania's
Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United
States Agency for International Development in line with
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, a bank whose liabilities exceed assets can ask a
court to rule the winding up under the new legislation. The
Central Bank will appeal to the court against a bank which fails
to make payments after special monitoring and administration
measures have been futily applied. The court will notify the
Central Bank on its decision as to beginning winding up the
troubled bank.
</P>
<P>
The law sets precise deadlines for procedures needed to declare
insolvent a bank that has posted safe, liquid and exigible amounts
in credit if this bank ceases payments for at least 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank will close the insolvent bank's accounts
immediately, and open an account called "bank under insolvency".
This account will become recipient of all the amounts of money in
the bank's accounts to that date. Any forthcoming financial
operation of the bank will unfold exclusively through this unique
account.
</P>
<P>
Winding up will be closed after the court has approved the
final report, all the funds or assets of the insolvent bank have
been distributed, and the unclaimed funds have been deposited with
the Central Bank.

<HEADLINE> Reppas: Greece Decides to Join EMU in Second Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said Wednesday that Greece had decided to join the
European Union's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2001 due to
the economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that it was very
difficult for Greece to enter the EMU in 1999 because such a move
might harm the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Although the recent rise in the Athens Stock Exchange index,
which soared Tuesday 7.32 percent to end at 2,627.90 points,
showed a positive development of the Greek economy, much an
effort was still necessary for Greece to meet the EU targets set
out by the Maastricht treaty, he added.
</P>
<P>
To quicken its pace for the entry into the EMU, Greece allowed
its national currency in March to join the European exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) and announced a series of drastic structural
measures including the part-privatilization of 11 state-run
enterprises and banks in the next 18 months.

JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police announced
Wednesday that the Jewish settler killed Sunday in a land dispute
with Palestinians near the West Bank city of Hebron was shot to
death by another Jewish settler by mistake.
</P>
<P>
An inquiry carried out by the Palestinian police showed that
the settler was killed by shots fired by one of his companions in
a bid to disperse some Palestinian shepherds, the police said.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli police insisted that Dov Driben, 29, was
murdered by the Palestinian shepherds, saying the shepherds
snatched the settlers' guns and shot them before fleeting to a
nearby Palestinian village.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces detained 11 Palestinians Tuesday night
who were suspected of being involved in the shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
Dov Driben was killed Sunday on a ranch near Hebron when three
Jewish settlers clashed with some 10 Palestinians in a dispute

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Mandate of MONUA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday recommended to extend the mandate of the
United Nations observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) for a further
period of two months until June 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council of the United Nations,
Annan said significant progress has been achieved in Angolan peace
process, although the remaining tasks under the Lusaka Protocol
were not fully completed by the March 31, 1998 deadline agreed
upon by the Angolan Government and the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said he welcomed important developments
which include the promulgation into law of the special status of
Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, the appointment of the governors and
vice-governors nominated by UNITA, the return of some UNITA senior
officials to Luanda and the termination of Radio Vorgan's
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said he is concerned at the low pace of the
implementation of the extension of State administration, which
should also have been completed by March 31.
</P>
<P>
He said the security situation is deteriorating in the country
with increased attacks against the Angolan National Police, local
government authorities and innocent civilians, and UNITA continue
to impose restrictions on United Nations activities in some of the
region still under its control.
</P>
<P>
Annan once again reminded both parties that they are
responsible for ensuring the safety and security of all United
Nations personnel in Angola.

BONN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany's electronics giant Siemens said
Wednesday that its full-year net profit for the current fiscal year
ending September 30 may not reach three billion German marks (1.7
billion U.S. dollars) as expected earlier.
</P>
<P>
A Siemens spokeswoman attributed the lowered profit expectations
mainly to the company's increased risk provisions in Asia due to the
recent financial crisis as well as a drop in computer chip prices on
the world market.
</P>
<P>
However, the company still expected its full-year turnover to rise
to between 110 billion to 115 billion marks (between 62 billion to 65
billion dollars) from last year's 107 billion marks (60 billion
dollars), the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the 1997-1998 business year, the company's
turnover climbed by 17 percent to 52.1 billion marks (29 billion
dollars). The first-half net profit was also up 10 percent to 1.19
billion marks (670 million dollars).

UNITED NATIONS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Governments and

The WWF made the appeal together with the World Conservation

The meeting, which will last from April 20 to May 1, mainly

"Putting freshwater ecosystem conservation at the center of any
action plan on freshwater is critical if freshwater resources are
to be available for people on a sustainable basis," Claude Martin,
Director-General of WWF International told a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
The WWF sees the Convention on Wetlands signed in 1971 and the

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will introduce new
computerized and forge proof national registration cards to
replace the old ones, home affairs minister Peter Machungwa said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new cards to be produced by an Israeli computer company
have special security features and contains more details than the
old ones making them difficult to forge and tamper with, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the issuance of the new cards will start soon before
the local government elections expected to be held in June.
</P>
<P>
The two-phased exercise expected to complete in the year 2000
will cost the country 11.2 million U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase the new cards will be issued only to
applicants who have lost their cards and those who have reached
the age of 16 and in the second phase all the old ones will be
replaced, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new cards are durable and will help safeguard national
security unlike in the past when aliens manipulated the old cards
and presented themselves as Zambians through fraudulently
obtained cards, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa said the government will find it easier to manage
and utilize the national registration information for the benefit
of the nation because it will be processed and stored on the
computer and not done manually as in the past.

JOHANNESBURG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Somali kidnappers of
two pilots and eight Red Cross and Red Crescent workers had
undertaken to keep their hostages in the safest possible
conditions, South African Press Association quoted Foreign
Ministry spokesman Marco Boni as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Daud (sub-clan) has indicated that they are doing
everything possible to keep the group in the safest possible
conditions," Boni said in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The Daud sub-clan in Mogadishu earlier in the day accepted
responsibility for the kidnapping a week ago. However, there was
no word on the motive for the abduction.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers were not indifferent to the safety of the
hostages, who were all in good health.
</P>
<P>
"There is also no question of ultimatums coming from the
abductors," said Boni.
</P>
<P>
South African pilot Robbie Burt, eight workers of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Red Crescent
Societies, and a Kenyan pilot were captured after their aircraft
landed at an airstrip in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Boni said the Daud sub-clan controls the area where the group
were taken captive.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the ICRC to secure the release of the ten people
continued on Wednesday. It still had no direct contact with the
kidnappers, and was negotiating through clan elders.
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is that these talks should be approached with
patience and circumspection," Boni said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lambasts U.S. for Accusation Over Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday strongly
lambasted the United States for its accusations against
Iranian-Russian nuclear cooperation, accusing Washington of
supporting Israeli nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the
accusations indicated the U.S. hostile attitude toward Iran,
adding that the United States has spared no opportunity to stop
Iran's economic development plan.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's nuclear cooperation with Russia is fully for civilian
application of nuclear energy and is taking place within the
framework of international regulations," the Iranian official news
agency IRNA quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran and Russia have been committed to
controlling the export of the nuclear energy from either country
in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Russia is helping Iran build a 1,000-megawatt nuclear power
plant in Bushehr, southern Iran. U.S. officials repeatedly accused
Tehran of seeking access to technology to produce nuclear weapons
through building nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also attacked Washington for providing financial
assistance to Israel to modernize its military arsenal.
</P>
<P>
He said that by accusing Iran of attempting to acquire weapons
of mass destruction, the U.S. has attempted to justify its
dangerous plan to arm Israel "which possesses weapons of mass
destruction and is the main threat to the security and stability
of the region."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iran always wants the Middle East free from
weapons of mass destruction, urging the international community to
pressure Israel to eliminate all its weapons of mass destruction
and force the U.S. to abandon its dangerous policy of supporting
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here said that Russian Minister of
Atomic Energy Yevgeni Adamov on Wednesday also stressed that the
nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran centers on peaceful
application of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Moscow-Tehran cooperation fully observes the NPT
and is under the supervision of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.

BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Kuwaiti Speaker of the
National Assembly Ahmed Abdul Al-Sadoun Wednesday urged the Iraqi
government to release its citizens jailed in Iraqi prisons,
Lebanese official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After talks with his Lebanese counterpart Nabih Berri,
Al-Sadoun told reporters that the issue over prisoners has been
concerning Kuwait since it was liberated from Iraqi occupation
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Iraq invaded its neighbor Kuwait and was forced to
leave it following the Gulf War led by the United States in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sadoun accused Iraq of using prisoners as "bargaining chips"
politically in dealing with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said that at first Iraq denied that it detained Kuwaiti
citizens and then admitted it under the international pressure.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Arab countries would exert pressure
on the Iraqi government and urge it to cooperate with Kuwait

countries.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported, Andreatta expressed hope
that the plan would help "raise military cooperation between the
two countries to the level of political dialogue between Rome and
Moscow."

<HEADLINE> Son of President Mitterrand Defends Father's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The son of President Francois
Mitterrand, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, Wednesday defended his
father's policy toward Rwanda prior to the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand was accused of supporting the Hutu military regime
headed by President Juvenal Habyarimana until the latter was
killed in a missile attack on his plane on April 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
"If one wants to objectively sum up the action of France in
Rwanda in this period, he is obliged to say that the president of
the republic (Mitterrand) spared no efforts to make the regime of
President Habyaramina evolve toward multiparty system and
democracy," said Jean-Christophe Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Christophe, who served as special advisor for African
affairs for his father from 1986 to 1992, was summoned by the
commission of information of the National Assembly investigating
if there was any role played by France in the 1994 genocide in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that he used to make secret missions to Africa
for his father.
</P>
<P>
"I made in 10 years only one secret trip, which had nothing to
do with Rwanda, at the request of President Mitterrand and in
agreement with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Secretariat
of State for Cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
During a previous hearing held on Tuesday, four former
government ministers of France in the last years of the Mitterrand
era, including former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, also denied
any French involvement in the genocide perpetrated by the Hutu
military regime against the Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Israel Marks Holocaust Remembrance Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people gathered
Wednesady night at Yad Vashem here for ceremonies marking the
Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony took place at Warsaw Ghetto Square in
front of Yad Washem, which is the Holocaust Memorial Hall
situated on Mount Herzl, with the participation of President Ezer
Weizman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, local dignitaries and
envoys of foreign countries based in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The holocaust occurred during World War II, in which 6
million Jews were killed by Nazis and their collaborators,
leaving bitter memories for the Jews, the holocaust survivors and
the people of the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Yad Vashem was in a particular profound grief atmosphere
Wednesday night. Many holocaust survivors coming from Israel and
other parts of the world wept while commemorating their family
members and colleagues who were killed during the holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Weizman said this year Israel will
celebrate its 50 anniversary of independence, but Israel will not
forget those who had been killed during the holocaust.
</P>
<P>
"Israel can proclaim to the whole world that holocaust will be
never allowed to happen again and the memories of the 6 million
Jews will last forever," Weizman declared.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will further strengthen its friendly
relations with the countries with which Israel has had diplomatic
ties and will try its best to improve the relations with the
countries which do not have diplomatic relations with Israel,
particularly with the neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has had friendly relations with Egypt and Jordan and I
hope Israel will speed up its peace negotiations with Syria,
Lebanon and Palestine," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and representatives of the holocaust survivors also
spoke at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
As part of the ceremony, six holocaust survivors, including
professors Yitzhak Gutman and Elazar Shafrir, kindled the
memorial flames.
</P>
<P>
Ceremonies for the holocaust remembrance day will continue on
Thursday. Sirens throughout Israel will sound at 10:00 a.m. local
time Thursday, when the country will stand for two minutes in
silent tribute to the memory of the 6 million Jewish
martyrs.

<HEADLINE> Women Organization not to Support Paula Jones Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Citing overwhelming opposition
of its national board and local chapters, the National
Organization for Women (NOW) said Wednesday it will not file legal
papers on behalf of Paula Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit
against President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
NOW President Patricia Ireland told a news conference the
women's group believes such a "highly charged political" lawsuit
should not be used as a test case for stopping sexual harassment
in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Ireland also said her group "decided not to work with the
disreputable right-wing organizations and individuals advancing
her cause, who themselves have a long-standing political interest
in undermining our movement to strengthen women's rights and
weakening the laws that protect those rights."
</P>
<P>
Ireland said, it was clear from contacts with about 500
chapters around the country that the local groups opposed filing a
friend-of-the-court brief, by margins of at least 8-to-1 and
possibly 10-to-1.
</P>
<P>
"Hard cases make bad law," Ms. Ireland said. The conservative
Rutherford Institute, which is financing legal expenses for Mrs.
Jones, and her spokeswoman Susan Carpenter McMillan is "using
this case to advance their own political agendas," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Ireland said, "Paula Jones has surrounded herself with a
phalanx of politically motivated lawyers."

<HEADLINE> France Asks Turkey to Face Facts of Massarcres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Wednesday called on Turkey to "go much further" in facing
the historical facts of massacres of Armenians committed by
Ottoman Turkish army from 1915 to 1917.
</P>
<P>
Armenians claim that from 1.2 million to 1.3 million of their
compatriots were massacred by the Turkish army under the Young
Turks government of the Ottoman Empire during World War I, but
Turkey only admits 300,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
"We have never ceased to tell the leaders of Turkey that they
should go much further...in authorizing historians to make
objective and true researches on these events," Vedrine told the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the parliaments in Russia, Greece, Lebanon, the United
States (House of Representatives) and Canada, the French National
Assembly has not adopted any resolution recognizing the massacres
of Armanians as "genocide".
</P>
<P>
But former President Francois Mitterrand once used the word
"genocide" to describe the massacres of Armenians.
</P>
<P>
France has also repeatedly condemned the military operations
against the Kurds by Turkish government forces.

<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The British parliament voted 350
to 11 on Wednesday to cut short usual procedures and rush through
the bill providing for elections to a new assembly on June 25.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be followed by a second, fuller piece of
constitutional legislation which will implement other parts of the
peaceful settlement, Northern Ireland minister Paul Murphy told
parliament after the voting.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Conservatives have expressed their support for the
peace accord and for the bill, which implements one of the key
provisions of the multi-party peace agreement brokered on April
10.
</P>
<P>
The elections to the 108-seat assembly will go ahead if the
peace deal is approved by a referendum on May 22.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland has been under direct rule from London since
its previous assembly was shut down in 1973 as the province

<HEADLINE> House Republican Leaders to Allow Vote on Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Republican leadership of
the House of Representatives Wednesday offered to allow
comprehensive campaign finance legislation to come to the floor
for a vote.
</P>
<P>
The offer came as supporters of a campaign finance system
overhaul continued to collect signatures on a petition designed to
force the issue to the floor over the leadership's objections. The
addition of two Democrats' names during the day briefly brought
the total to 204 of the 218 needed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, taking part in an Earth Day event
in West Virginia, called the offer as "great news."
</P>
<P>
"It's encouraging, but we can't do this unless there's
bipartisan support," news report quoted Clinton as telling
reporters. "I certainly hope that a bill will emerge and if it
does, we'll take it over to the Senate and see if we can pass it
there."
</P>
<P>
Last month, House Speaker Newt Gingrich maneuvered to keep
campaign finance overhaul legislation from coming to a vote that
would have curtailed the flood of money into campaigns.
</P>
<P>
But one official reportedly said it was likely that the issue
would be on the House floor within a month, and that lawmakers
would be permitted to offer virtually any proposal that was
drafted in advance.
</P>
<P>
As of mid-morning, 12 Republicans had signed their names,
meaning that if all remaining Democrats did likewise, the petition
would surpass the 218 needed. But shortly after meeting with the
speaker, five Republicans scratched their names off the petition,
enough to kill its prospects.
</P>
<P>
Many advocates of campaign finance overhaul favor legislation
to ban soft money, or large, unregulated contributions that
political parties receive from corporations, unions and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Republicans say they fear passage of such legislation unless
there are separate provisions curtailing union political activity.
</P>
<P>
Republicans raise more soft money than do Democrats, but
organized labor overwhelmingly favors Democratic candidates.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania-Japan Trade Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade with
Japan saw a downward trend in 1997 with exports decreasing by
12.7 percent from the previous year, a report issued by the Japan
External Trade Organization in Dar es Salaam said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's exports to Japan dropped to 59
million U.S. Dollars in 1997 from 67.5 million U.S. Dollars in
1996 last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Japan, however, rose to 79.5 million U.S. Dollars
from 77.4 million U.S. Dollars, a rise of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's trade deficit recorded more than 20 million U.S.
Dollars which suggests that the east African country needs to
increase its exports to Japan in order to harmonize the trade
balance between the two countries, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed last year's downward trend in the trade
to the deteriorating economic situation in Japan which led to a
decrease in the purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Among the goods exported to Japan, coffee ranked first in
terms of export volume, which stood at 32.8 million U.S. Dollars.
Coming up next were fish fillets and sesame seeds, with 10.2
million US dollars and 10.1 million U.S. Dollars in trade volume
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the crops, however, had decreased by 2.8 percent,
17 percent and 21.5 percent respectively from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tanzania exported cloves worth nearly 329,000 U.S.
Dollars, equivalent to 62.7 percent of the total world supply of
the crop to Japan. The country was followed by Malaysia, and
Madagascar had an share of 24.4 percent and 5.4 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Tanzania's exports to Japan were
mainly consisted of raw materials while imports were dominated by
manufactured goods.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Adopts New Policy on Solid Minerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of Nigeria,
Africa's leading oil producer, has approved new national policy
on solid minerals in an effort to fully tap the rich natural
resources of the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, areas relevant to viable economic
development of the sector will be clearly addressed, according to
Solid Minerals Development Minister Alhaji Kaloma Ali.
</P>
<P>
The policy was approved together with a review and revision of
the outdated mining laws of 1946 and allied regulations last
weekend when the ministry celebrated its third anniversary, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The policy, said the minister, also pays attention to the role
of the state and organized private sector, deregulation of
minerals exploitation, manpower development, incentives to
investors in mining and the need for an orderly development.
</P>
<P>
All impediments to process for entry into the country's mining
industry have been removed with the adoption of the revised
mining laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The new laws were fashioned out such as to facilitate decision
making in investment placement and to ensure smooth operations in
the mining fields and minerals trade, Ali said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the break-up of the monopoly enjoyed
previously by the Nigerian Coal Corporation in the prospecting,
mining, processing and marketing of coal in the country.
</P>
<P>
The former corporation has earlier established joint ventures
for the exploitation of gold, magnesium, kaolin and barytes.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the approval of the new policy and
laws shows the government's determination to reduce the country's
overdependence on oil so as to boost economic restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Former President Declines Meeting With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani Wednesday declined a meeting with some Majlis members
in support of him, saying it might worsen the political tension in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, chairman of Iran's State Expediency Council (SEC),
said in a statement that he did this for preserving "the interests
of the (Islamic) revolution and the Islamic government as the
highest of priorities."
</P>
<P>
The Majlis members demanded to visit Rafsanjani and show their
support for him after a conservative parliamentarian criticized
his statement on Friday in support of Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi, who was charged with embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Majlis member Ahmad Rasoulinejad threatened on Sunday that he
would release documents on embezzlement concerning Rafsanjani's
relatives if the former president continued to support
Karbaschi. He also linked Karbaschi's case with Rafsanjani's
management during his presidency from 1989-1997.
</P>
<P>
Rasoulinejad's criticism angered Rafsanjani's supporters and
some of them reportedly called on relevant authorities to expel
the parliamentarian from the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pro-government newspaper Salam on Wednesday
denied a rumor that Deputy Oil Minister Ali Hashemi, Rafsanjani's
son, has been arrested for corruption.
</P>
<P>
Rival factions run into a hot political fighting after
Karbaschi was detained on April 4 by the conservative judiciary on
corruption charges, which were rejected by the moderates as
politically motivated in an aim to weaken the government of
President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was released a week ago following a direct
intervention by Rafsanjani and the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei. However, political fighting is still continuing in the
country as the conservatives still insist on public trial on the
major, a major supporter of Khatami.

join NATO in the second wave and will be ready to back it just as
it has done so far, said Turkish National Defense Minister Ismet
Sezgin Wednesday, who is on a visit to Romania ending Friday.
</P>

bilateral trade is now about 800 million dollars, and is expected
to reach in the end of the year 1 billion, Turkey being at the
same time among the most important investors to Romania.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Arab Anti-Terrorism Pact Signed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Arab interior and justice ministers
from the 22-member Arab League (AL) signed a trail-blazing pact
here Wednesday on enhancing cooperation for fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed at the joint meetings of the Arab
interior and justice ministers councils which opened Wednesday
morning to finalize the joint anti-terrorism strategy.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid and
delegations from the AL's 22 member states witnessed the signing
of the first Arab anti-terrorism deal in the Cairo-based AL
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The pact, whose negotiations started in 1987, calls for
boosting cooperation among the signatory states to develop a
system for preventing and combating terrorist crimes.
</P>
<P>
It says that signatory states should brief each other
immediately on any terrorist crime that might take place in its
territories, including exchanging data relevant to terrorist
crimes, activists, training places and sources of funds.
</P>
<P>
Among other significant articles in the anti-terrorism pact was
that the signatories pledge to extradite those allegedly involved
in terrorist crimes through diplomatic or justice means.
</P>
<P>
The agreement opposes any possible attempts of the signatory
states to organize, finance, commit or take part in terrorist acts
in any way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pact confirms the right of the people to armed
struggle against foreign occupation and aggression.
</P>
<P>
It legitimizes the struggle to liberate occupied lands, obtain
the right to self-determination and independence and maintain
national unity according to the principles and resolutions of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz, also
chairman of the conference, termed the pact as a major achievement
on the road to joint Arab action, saying it would help realize
security and stability for the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Abdel-Meguid hailed the signing of the
agreement as a "leading significant step along the joint Arab
security march."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Interior Minister Habib Ibrahim el-Adli said the
signing of the agreement signaled that the Arab nations have
finally reached an agreement on the issue and hammered out a
complete set of anti-terrorism strategy.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, almost 1,300 people have died in terrorism-related
accidents since Muslim militants began a violent campaign against
the secular government in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The country lost 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in tourism revenues
in 1997 alone due to a series of terrorist attacks against
foreigners last year.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Interior Minister Mostefa Benmansour confirmed that
"daily and careful implementation of the articles of the agreement
by all Arab states will definitely uproot this phenomenon that
contradicts Arab values and the tolerance of Islam."
</P>
<P>
Muslim insurgency has killed an estimated 75,000 people in
Algeria since the government canceled the 1992 legislative
elections that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was on the
verge of winning.

<HEADLINE> UAE Pupils to Donate School Bags for Iraqi Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
Wednesday launched a campaign for pupils to donate 25,000 school
bags for Iraqi children whose country suffers badly from the
seven-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the start of the campaign, the Red Crescent Society
of the United Arab Emirate (UAE) called on each UAE pupil to
donate 20 dirhams (5.45 U.S. dollars), the cost of one school bag
together with some school tools and copybooks.
</P>
<P>
The school bags are to be sent to Iraq by the end of the
current school year and to be distributed at the beginning of the
coming school year.
</P>
<P>
Some Iraqi artists will hold an exhibition here from May 12 to
18. Some 120 portraits will be exhibited and put for sale. Half of
the proceeds will go to the campaign fund.
</P>
<P>
This campaign is actually complementary to that of collecting
foodstuffs and medicine launched by the UAE Red Crescent Society
over two years ago to help Iraqi children and women.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania-Japan Trade Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade with
Japan saw a downward trend in 1997 with exports decreasing by
12.7 percent from the previous year, a report issued by the Japan
External Trade Organization in Dar es Salaam said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's exports to Japan dropped to 59
million U.S. Dollars in 1997 from 67.5 million U.S. Dollars in
1996 last year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Japan, however, rose to 79.5 million U.S. Dollars
from 77.4 million U.S. Dollars, a rise of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's trade deficit recorded more than 20 million U.S.
Dollars which suggests that the east African country needs to
increase its exports to Japan in order to harmonize the trade
balance between the two countries, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed last year's downward trend in the trade
to the deteriorating economic situation in Japan which led to a
decrease in the purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Among the goods exported to Japan, coffee ranked first in
terms of export volume, which stood at 32.8 million U.S. Dollars.
Coming up next were fish fillets and sesame seeds, with 10.2
million US dollars and 10.1 million U.S. Dollars in trade volume
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the crops, however, had decreased by 2.8 percent,
17 percent and 21.5 percent respectively from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tanzania exported cloves worth nearly 329,000 U.S.
Dollars, equivalent to 62.7 percent of the total world supply of
the crop to Japan. The country was followed by Malaysia, and
Madagascar had an share of 24.4 percent and 5.4 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Tanzania's exports to Japan were
mainly consisted of raw materials while imports were dominated by
manufactured goods.

<P>
A total of 260 deputies of the parliament voted for the

</P>
<P>
The president made the pledge at a manufacturer association's

He said although there are some factories engaged in primary
products processing, the country will benefit more if the primary
products could be further processed to final products.

<P>
To encourage investment in the country, he added, the Uganda
Electricity Board has been urged to reduce electricity costs.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Adopts New Policy on Solid Minerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of Nigeria,
Africa's leading oil producer, has approved new national policy
on solid minerals in an effort to fully tap the rich natural
resources of the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, areas relevant to viable economic
development of the sector will be clearly addressed, according to
Solid Minerals Development Minister Alhaji Kaloma Ali.
</P>
<P>
The policy was approved together with a review and revision of
the outdated mining laws of 1946 and allied regulations last
weekend when the ministry celebrated its third anniversary, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The policy, said the minister, also pays attention to the role
of the state and organized private sector, deregulation of
minerals exploitation, manpower development, incentives to
investors in mining and the need for an orderly development.
</P>
<P>
All impediments to process for entry into the country's mining
industry have been removed with the adoption of the revised
mining laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The new laws were fashioned out such as to facilitate decision
making in investment placement and to ensure smooth operations in
the mining fields and minerals trade, Ali said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the break-up of the monopoly enjoyed
previously by the Nigerian Coal Corporation in the prospecting,
mining, processing and marketing of coal in the country.
</P>
<P>
The former corporation has earlier established joint ventures
for the exploitation of gold, magnesium, kaolin and barytes.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the approval of the new policy and
laws shows the government's determination to reduce the country's
overdependence on oil so as to boost economic restrucb%

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Malaysian-Backed Firm to Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has affirmed its commitment to all legally binding agreements
with a Malaysian-backed power company but maintained that it will
not agree on the extraordinarily high power tariffs.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the State House Wednesday said the
implementation of the International Power Tanzania Limited (IPTL)
project will make Tanzania increase the tariffs by nearly 50
percent at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The country already has the highest costs of electricity in
the east Africa region.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, IPTL, a private Malaysia-Tanzania joint venture, won
a contract to build a 100 megawatt thermal power plant station
worth 150 million U.S. Dollars in the northern outskirts of Dar
es Salaam. The construction of power station, lasting 12 months,
is expected to end by August.
</P>
<P>
But the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
(WB) later said the project will be an unacceptable burden on
Tanzania's fragile economy because of the proposed wholesale
tariff of 21 cents per kilowatt hour is too high.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the prices of electricity are likely to be
even higher in 1999 and in the subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
It further said that the government therefore called on IPTL
to meet the obligations in negotiating for power tariffs on good
faith to ensure that they are based on "actual, reasonable and
affordable rates."
</P>
<P>
The statement said this could be achieved by working out the
capital and operational costs of IPTL, and give fair return to
the investors, and at the same time leave tariff affordable by
the state power company TANESCO, the national economy and the
people.
</P>
<P>
Last week, after three days of fruitless talks between IPTL,
the Energy Ministry and TANESCO, the government angrily ordered a
seven-member Malaysian delegation representing IPTL to leave the
country immediately.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources explained the reason for the dispute was
that TANESCO had defaulted to buy electricity from IPTL.
</P>
<P>
Denying it was a deportation, the statement said, "The
government and TANESCO assert their rights under the agreements
they signed while leaving the door open to resolve all disputes
with IPTL through reasoned negotiations."
</P>
<P>
It stressed that when embarking on the negotiations, IPTL
should recognize that the government represents a sovereign
state, free to select internal and external experts, advisors and
partners in order to promote and protect the country's interests,
and is accountable to its citizens.

LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Dolly the sheep, the world's first
clone of an adult mammal, has made history again to become a

The institute said that Dolly gave birth to its first offspring

</P>
<P>
Dolly shocked the world a year ago when Roslin scientists
announced that it had been created from a single cell of an adult
ewe's udder.
</P>
<P>
Dolly's arrival has created worldwide fears about human
cloning, since it is the first time that an animal was cloned from
the cells of an adult mammal, which raises the prospect that the
same technique may be one day applied to humans.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans filing
first-time claims for unemployment benefits went up to an
eight-week high last week, the Labor Department reported here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment claims increased by 29,000 to a seasonally
adjusted 317,000 last week after having declined 24,000 to a
nine-month low of 288,000 the week before. The increase was the
largest since early August.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts believed some applicants probably delayed
filing claims as a result of the Spring holidays. And even with
the big growth, claims remained at a level signaling a healthy
labor market.
</P>
<P>
A four-week moving average of benefit claims went up to 306,750
last week from 306,000 the week before. The average has remained
in a narrow range between 303,000 and 312,000 for the past 11
weeks.

<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Deng Xiaoping Theory will broaden
the development road of China and point out the correct way for
the nation's revitalization, says a signed article carried by
today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory has developed from the fact that China is
in the primary stage of socialism, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The theory has objectively and profoundly analyzed the
features, the basic conditions, the principal contradiction and
the fundamental task in the primary stage of modern China. After a
thorough understanding of the nation, Deng, the late Chinese
leader, put up a complete set of theories on building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Chinese people have in the
past two decades achieved great successes, it says.
</P>
<P>
The nation should proceed in doing everything from the actual
conditions of the primary stage of socialism, and not from this or
that kind of foreign models, nor from some certain Marxist theses,
it says.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory has incisively expounded the essence and
the development law of socialism, the article says.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Gains Support on Kiriyenko Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
announced on Thursday that both leaders of the parliament, Yegor
Stroyev and Gennady Seleznyov, had given tentative support to his
nominee for prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin described an one-hour meeting with the leaders on
Thursday morning as, "the last or most decisive roundtable, but
not the last or most decisive battle", the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, which was reportedly held in a warm and
constructive atmosphere, Federal Council Speaker Stroyev told a
news briefing that the upper house had adopted an address to the
State Duma to find a calm solution.
</P>
<P>
He said: "At the moment, the stake is not on Kiriyenko, but on
the future of Russia and of the Federal Assembly. Every deputy is
contemplating this."
</P>
<P>
According to the presidential press service, Yeltsin will
address a letter to the State Duma, or the lower house of the
parliament, to ask for an approval of Kiriyenko's nomination. But
the president had no plan to visit the Duma Friday, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, on Thursday, also had a 20-minute telephone
conversation with Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party
faction in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
He told Zyuganov to "think not of your party and personality,
but about the state, about stability in the country."
</P>
<P>
Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznyov told the press after a plenary
session of the Communist Party Central Committee Thursday that
most communists in Friday's vote favored "preserving the Duma"
while confirming Kiriyenko as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also held discussions with Kiriyenko Thursday, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma will vote for the last time on the president's nominee
for the premiership Friday.
</P>
<P>
It had rejected the nomination twice. If it fails to approve
Kiriyenko as prime minister on the third vote, it would be
dissolved by the president under the Russian Constitution.

Deng Xiaoping Theory has helped the people know what socialism
is and how to build it, it says.
</P>
<P>
One of the fundamental reasons for the nation's failures in
building socialism prior to the Third Plenary Session of the
Eleventh CPC Central Committee in 1978 is that some of its tasks and
policies overstepped the primary stage of socialism, the article
states.
</P>

Only following Deng Xiaoping Theory can China bring about a
great rejuvenation, it states.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping Theory is Marxism of present-day China,
representing a new development stage of Marxism, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The theory has upheld the principles of emancipating the mind and
seeking truth from facts, while inheriting and developing Marxism.
</P>
<P>
In China today, it is Deng Xiaoping Theory which integrates
Marxism with the practice of present-day China and only this
theory can settle the issues concerning the future and destiny of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the theory, persisting in observing the world in
the broad perspective of Marxism, has made new, scientific
judgments on the basis of correctly analyzing the features of the
times and the overall international situation.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Deng Xiaoping Theory constitutes a new, scientific
system of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, it says.

<HEADLINE> Canada Refuses to Patent Harvard Mouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada has turned down Harvard
University's attempt to patent a type of high-tech mouse that gets
cancer easily.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Court of Canada ruled here Wednesday that the
cancer-prone mouse is not "an invention" under Canadian law.
</P>
<P>
The mouse was genetically engineered by Harvard to help in
cancer research. It has already patented in the United Stated.
</P>
<P>
The patent gives Harvard the sole right to create any mice with
these genes, breed them, own them and decide who may use them.
</P>
<P>
When Harvard asked Canadian patent bureau to follow suit, it
was refused by Canadian officials. So Harvard appealed to the
Federal Court.
</P>
<P>
In delivering his ruling, Federal Judge Marc Nadon notes that
Harvard invented a method of injecting mouse cells with a
cancer-prone gene, "but they have not invented the mouse."
</P>
<P>
"A complex life form does not fit within the current parameters
of the Patent Act without stretching the meaning of the words to
the breaking point, which I am not prepared to do," he writes.
</P>
<P>
Harvard's David Morrow said he had sent a copy of the judgement
to the university, which hasn't had time to react.
</P>
<P>
Environment groups here welcomed the ruling, saying that it
helps to prevent the concentration of too much control over
animals and medical research in the hands of a small number of
corporations.
</P>
<P>
But biotech companies counters that patents such as this will
protect their investment in expensive research from their rivals.
</P>
<P>
So far, Canada has granted patents to only single-life forms such
as a yeast culture, but not to mammals.

<HEADLINE> Prices of Iranian Staple Food Sharply Raised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The prices of Iran's traditional
staple bread "Nan" have risen by 20-50 percent as the government
moved to check the colossal and widespread waste of food.
</P>
<P>
The Salam daily reported Thursday that the price rise would
help remedy people's ignorance of the heavy government subsidies
that have kept Nan affordable to low-income and poor families.
</P>
<P>
After the price hike, a piece of Nan weighing 170 grams is sold
for 60 rials (about one U.S. cent).
</P>
<P>
The authorities have complained that Iranians waste 500 million
U.S. dollars of Nan every year.
</P>
<P>
According to Salam, even after the price hikes the government
still has to pay more each year for Nan to beat the country's
two-digit inflation.
</P>
<P>
Salam said government subsidies to Nan were expected to reach
5,120 billion rials (about 1.7 billion dollars) during the current
Iranian calendar year (starting March 21), up 17 percent from that
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the government's price support, Nan has become all
along cheaper in terms of an ordinary Iranian's purchase power.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. dollar can buy nearly 100 pieces of Nan in comparison to
the then rate of one against 15 two decades ago, while an ordinary
Iranian salary earner's payment still remains within the range
between 80 to 100 U.S. dollars during the period.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Majlis (parliament) on Tuesday held a closed-door
session with the participation of two cabinet ministers to discuss
Nan wastage in the country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also shed light on serious economic hardship in
Iran, which is expected to face a 4 billion-dollar shortfall in
revenues due to a slump in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Radio reported Wednesday that Iran may be forced to
redrafted its budget due to the oil price crisis caused by
oversupply on the international crude markets and slackened demand
around the globe.

<HEADLINE> Report: French Damage Plan to Arrest Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- France damaged a plan by the
U.S.-led allied forces in Bosnia to arrest the former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic late last summer, U.S. newspapers reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and allied forces had to shelve the plans after
Washington discovered that a senior French military officer had
held secret meetings with Karadzic, The Washington Post quoted
senior U.S. and diplomatic officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The series of clandestine meetings convinced U.S. officials
that key details of the arrest plans might have been leaked
directly to the fugitive Serb leader by the officer, a French Army
major named Herve Gourmillon," said the post.
</P>
<P>
A similar report was also made by The New York Times. The
secret meetings between Gourmillon and Karadzic deeply troubled
the Americans and other NATO allies and undercut trust in the
French military, it reported.
</P>
<P>
The post said that the French has acknowledged the meetings but
have said that the officers acted on his own. Gourmillon was
reassigned to Paris and suffered no punishment for his actions.
</P>
<P>
The times quoted officials as saying that the west is still
planning to arrest Karadzic despite the wariness about the French
military.
</P>
<P>
They pointed to recent exercises where NATO-led troops occupied
police headquarters and other buildings in Pale, measures which
have helped drive Karadzic underground, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
"But officials also cautioned that a raid to capture Dr.
Karadzic is not imminent," it added.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Reaffirms SAR Govt Support to Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) reaffirmed
here on Thursday his government's full support to the SAR's
long-term sports development by repeating his promise of financial
backing.
</P>
<P>
He recalled the promise he made early last year when he was
running for the election of SAR's Chief Executive. Tung promised
strong financial support from the SAR government when he spoke at
a function held by the Hong Kong Sports Development Board.
</P>
<P>
But the SAR Chief did not mean to give money deliberately. "I
hope the money are wisely used," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung was speaking at a cocktail party Thursday evening given by
the Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (ASF&AMP;OC) of
Hong Kong, China in honor of the former President A.O. de Sales,
who had served as ASF&AMP;OC chief for the past 44 years.
</P>
<P>
"We believe sports can only thrive in dignity and independence
with material backing from the government," said Timothy Fok,
President of the ASF&AMP;OC.
</P>
<P>
"With a larger public subsidy, out athletes and coaches can
concentrate on their pursuits, free from financial worries. With
a strong sports culture, our people will be strengthened in body,
spirit, virtue and unity," he added.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected local sports chief also praised local sports
association leaders for their "sacrifice out of passion for
sports."
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the cocktail party were SAR Government
officials, local sports association leaders, and a delegation from
 the International Olympic Committee (IOC), led by Kim Un Yong,
South Korea's IOC vice-president. Kim was an envoy for IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch. Among the delegates were IOC
Executive Board member He Zhenliang from China and IOC member Wu
Ching-Kuo from Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the party was Ma Yuzhen, Commissioner of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR.

<HEADLINE> France Recognizes Link Between Officer with Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday recognized that
there could have existed an abnormal relationship between a French
military officer serving in the NATO force in Bosnia and the
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, wanted for war crime
charges.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry said that the relations between
Commander Herve Gourmelon and Karadzic "could have appeared
contestable".
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry made the statement in response to an
accusation by the United States officials that Gourmelon tipped
off to Karadzic the plan by NATO force to arrest him a couple of
times in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The American daily Washington Post Thursday quoted U.S.
officials as saying that Gourmelon met Karadzic several times and
that a U.S. plan to arrest the Serb leader was cancelled because
of fear that Karadzic was tipped off beforehand.
</P>
<P>
The accusation by the United States could confirm an earlier
accusation by the General Prosecutor of the International Tribunal
for judging war crimes in former Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour, that
France refused to cooperate with the tribunal to arrest Serb war
crime suspects.
</P>
<P>
However, France said that it had fully cooperated with the
tribunal in arresting a number of other Serb criminals hiding the
zone controlled by French troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, a French official kept different contacts, as
the orders he received made it possible," said the French Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the conditions for carrying out these relations
could have appeared contestable, this official was immediately
received a new assignment in France," it added.
</P>
<P>
Gourmelon, who used to serve as NATO spokesman in Sarajevo, was
recalled to France for "family reasons" in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Invites Zimbabwean Investors to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Thursday urged Zimbabwean business circles to
invest in his country which offers a lot of opportunities for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who arrived on Wednesday in Harare for a four-day state
visit to Zimbabwe, said Tanzania's economy had over the years
been transformed from a public-enterprise-driven economy to one
driven by the private sector with the government playing a
facilitating role.
</P>
<P>
He told Zimbabwean businessmen and company executives at a
breakfast meeting in Harare that his government had so far
offloaded 174 parastatals out of a total of 300 in its bid to
make the private sector the engine of economic growth, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said local businessmen could take advantage of his
government's privatisation program to invest in the country
through acquiring stakes in the remaining 126 state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The privatisation process is done by public tender where we
advertise for bids and the highest bidder is assured of winning
the tender," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A number of South African companies have acquired some of the
parastatals prompting people in Tanzania to complain that we are
becoming an extension of South Africa, so I urge you to also come
and invest in these companies," Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Tanzanians were being given the opportunity to
buy the public enterprises, Mkapa said, at the moment most of
them did not have the capital.
</P>
<P>
But the government was retaining certain percentages of stakes
in strategic companies and warehousing the shares for them to buy
later.
</P>
<P>
Trade and investment opportunities between Tanzania and
Zimbabwe exist in food processing, agriculture, construction,
horticulture, mining, textile and clothing, pharmaceutical and
service sectors.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Expects Better Telecommunication Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya needs some 5.4 billion
U.S. Dollars to improve telecommunication services nationwide in
an effort to industrialize itself by 2020, experts said at the
first-ever Telecom East Africa Exhibition opening Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya plans to raise penetration from the present 0.16 lines
per 100 people to one line per 100 people in rural areas and from
four lines to 20 lines per 100 people in urban areas by 2015,
said Jan Mutai, managing director of the Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC).
</P>
<P>
"This works out to be an additional 300,000 lines for rural
areas and 2.4 million lines for urban areas," he said at a senior
seminar sidelined with the three-day show.
</P>
<P>
"The availability of an efficient and accessible
info-communication infrastructure is absolutely vital if the
country (Kenya) is to effectively compete in the emerging
information age and attain the status of a newly industrialized
country by the year 2020," said Mutai.
</P>
<P>
According to Mutai, demand for telecommunication services in
the country has consistently outstripped supply, leaving as many
as 80,000 Kenyans on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's tele-density now is less than one as compared to 9.2
lines per 100 people for South Africa while quality of service,
as measured by the number of faults per 100 main lines is above
100 as against 55 for the rest of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expected that the liberalization of the sector
set for later this year "would encourage inflow of private sector
capital to facilitate rapid roll-out of new telephone lines and
provide access to a telephone to all Kenyans."
</P>
<P>
Under two draft bills to be tabled in parliament earlier in
May, KPTC will be separated into Postal Corporation of Kenya and
Telkom Kenya Ltd. and the two new bodies will go public, sources
from the KPTC said at the show.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and private players will also be allowed to compete on
Kenya's telecommunication market then, said the sources, adding
that the nation's telecommunication services, whose efficiency
has been widely complained for years, would thus be greatly
improved.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 exhibitors from Kenya, South Africa and Canada
participated in the show. They are suppliers of
telecommunication equipment, satellite and broadcast equipment,
networks, mobile cellular equipment, as well as service
providers.
</P>
<P>
The event serves as "a forum of information exchange to the
east Africans in order to effectively participate in the global
information and telecommunications market," said William Ntimama,
Kenyan Minister for Transport and Communications at the opening
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavian Soldiers in Fire-fight With Kosovo Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian armed forces
exchanged fire Wednesday night with more than 200 ethnic Albanian
militants near the border village of Kosara, a Yugoslavian
military source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conflict flared when Yugoslavian soldiers tried to bar the
militants' entry into Yugoslavia from neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Both sides suffered casualties, said the source, but he didn't
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The militants were believed to be ethnic Albanians from the
southern Serbian province of Kosovo, and had undergone military
training in a clandestine armed base in northern Albania, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Kosovo escalated since late February when conflict
erupted between Serb police and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians who were
seeking independence from Yugoslavia and integration into Albania.
</P>
<P>
Albania wanted Yugoslavian authorities to grant meaningful
autonomy to the Kosovo Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
population in the province, and had hoped for the crisis to be
resolved peacefully.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Luo Gan, the secretary of the
Central Political Science and Law Committee, called for greater
effort to be made in educating and disciplining people working in
judicial and law enforcement departments.
</P>
<P>
At a televised phone meeting today, Luo said although the
majority of people working in judicial and public security
departments are good, a few have been corrupt or have broken the
law in one way or another, seriously damaging the prestige and
image of the whole team, the Party, and the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the education and rectification work should begin with
self-examination and study of regulations on corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Central Political Science and Law Committee already clearly
prohibits bribes, refusing to help people asking for help, beating
and cursing people, getting involved in the entertainment
business, and offering protection for illegal businesses among
political and law department staff members.
</P>
<P>
Luo stressed that violations of laws and regulations by
judicial and law enforcement workers must be thoroughly
investigated and punished, and the public must be given a clear
explanation about the cases.
</P>
<P>
Those who are not qualified must be retrained or dismissed
while the concerned departments must not cover up or provide
shelter for the law breakers, Luo said.

<HEADLINE> Release of Kidnapped ICRC Staff Still Unresolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The fate of the ten kidnapped
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) staff still
remains unresolved Thursday, as it enters the ninth day since
they were taken into hostage.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the abducted were for the first time
visited by officials from the Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS)
and members of the ICRC in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The SRCS and ICRC officials who spent about 15 minutes with
the hostages said they found them fine and well treated. The
officials told the abducted that they will be released later
Thursday or Friday at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The officials are currently holding a meeting with the
negotiators who seem to have concluded their attempt in unifying
the militiamen holding the ICRC staff who misunderstood over the
way and modalities of the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, it is known that the abductors will be offered some
money (between 60,000 and 150,000 US Dollars) under what is
termed as contribution from the clan business community, and no
ransom will be given so as to avoid other dangers from the
militiamen who might try to use the abduction of the
international expatriates as a revenue making business.
</P>
<P>
The latest information concerning the release efforts says all
the concerned parties seem to have understood each other and that
a conclusion is to be reached later Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to members who attended the meeting, this time it is
even in a better situation which is different from the previous
hopes given to the public.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, since the danger is everywhere in the chaotic
Somalia, the area where the ICRC hostages are being kept is not
exceptional.  Early Thursday morning, a Russian made B-10
anti-tank gun discharged accidentally right beside the building
where the ten ICRC members are kept.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said the discharged round came from one of the
battle wagons responsible for the security of the hostages, while
the technical vehicle was patrolling the area.
</P>
<P>
The heavy round of the B-10 hit a large tree before it went
through a clinic nearby. Fortunately, no one was killed or
wounded because of the early hour, but it has terrorized the
people in the area including the ICRC hostages.
</P>
<P>
This abduction not only affects the humanitarian situation in
the country, but also hampers the reconciliation efforts
throughout the country as well as the on-going plan of the
establishment of Mogadishu's administration, which was scheduled
to be announced on the 16th of this month before the abduction
stood in its way.

<HEADLINE> More Deaths Reported In Collapsed Building In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of eight people who were
trapped in a building that collapsed in Changsha, the capital of
central China's Hunan Province, have been found dead, according to
local sources.
</P>
<P>
By 2:00 p.m.today, resue workers had dug out the last of the
victims from the rubble and announced that none of them survived
the accident. The victims were mostly female students from a
technical school who worked as interns in a garment company in the
building.
</P>
<P>
The upper three stories of the six-story building in the
downtown area collapsed without warning at around 5:00 p.m. on
Tuesday, trapping a dozen people, one of whom was confirmed dead
immediately afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers saved six people on Tuesday and tunneled about
10 meters through the debris to pass water and food to the others
who were trapped in the rubble. The rescue proved very difficult
because of the narrow and cramped spaces.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation has led investigators to believe
that the collapse was caused by the addition of one story to the
original five-story structure, sources say.

<HEADLINE> WB to Raise 25m Dollars to Boost Pak Fruit Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will create a
Private Sector Development Fund with an initial amount of 25
million U.S. dollars to boost Pakistan's export of fruits,
vegetables and horticulture.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Thursday by Consultant of the World Bank
A.R. Siddiqui while talking to members of the Karachi Chambers of
Commerce and Industry in the southern port city, according to the
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A research study under the Agricultural Sector Investment
Project had been prepared which will be submitted to the World
Bank soon suggesting ways and means to prevent post-harvest losses
of fruits and vegetables, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 25 to 30 percent of fruits, vegetables and
horticulture are being wasted due to improper plucking and absence
of road network in the cultivation area.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be provided to the private sector and the World
Bank will also find out foreign companies to set up joint ventures
in Pakistan for processing of fruits and vegetables, he said.

was picked up to the training camp on Thursday by Tunisian head
coach Henri Kasperczak for the World Cup finals this summer in

To tune up for the World Cup finals, Kasperczak has inked an
intensive program to be in effect from April 27 for six
international friendlys, and those players in overseas clubs will

TOKYO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao Thursday met with Kazushige Hozumi, a Japanese citizen
whose life was saved by the Chinese people 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hozumi, who visited China in 1984 at the invitation of the
Chinese government under a youth exchange program, suffered
gastric bleeding and went into a coma in Nanjing, a city in east
China.
</P>
<P>
Because the bleeding was very severe, Hozumi's life was
seriously endangered. He needed an immediate operation.
</P>
<P>
Hu, then first secretary of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Youth League, organized a successful operation
in the absence of Hozumi's relatives.
</P>
<P>
Hu has been concerned about Hozumi's health since the operation
and asked the Chinese Embassy to arrange a meeting with Hozumi
during his visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hozumi, who is now in good health, said he was very happy to
meet Hu and expressed his thanks to the Chinese vice-president and
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Hozumi has devoted himself to the promotion of Sino-Japanese
friendship since he returned to Japan. He told Hu that he would
continue to dedicate himself to Sino-Japanese friendly ties to
express his gratitude to the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Promotion of Tehran-Tokyo Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Vice Speaker Hassan Rowhani of the
Iranian Majlis (Parliament) Thursday called for promoting
Tehran-Tokyo ties in political, economic and cultural fields,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with visiting Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura, Rowhani said that Iran's foreign policy is based
on the principle of removing obstacles to its relations with other
countries, citing Iranian-European relations as "the best
example."
</P>
<P>
Iran and the European Union (EU) warmed up their relations
after reaching a compromise last November over a verdict of a
Berlin court accusing Tehran of killing four Iranian Kurdish rebel
leaders in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani noted that the establishment of parliamentary
friendship groups would help promote Tehran-Tokyo relations in
all fields, particularly in parliamentary affairs.
</P>
<P>
He assured the Japanese official that Iran has no intention to
seek weapons of mass destruction and is willing to see the entire
region free from such weapons.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani expressed hope that the regional countries would
pressure Israel into destroying such kind of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Komura voiced satisfaction with the "friendly relations"
between Japan and Iran, saying that Tokyo is willing to open a new
chapter in the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Referring to dialogs among different civilizations proposed by
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, he said the Japanese
government regards the proposal as "very positive for the entire
region and the whole world."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese official arrived here on Wednesday for a four-day
visit, during which he is to deliver a message from Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to Khatami.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's State Development
Planning Commission Minister Zeng Peiyan, in a meeting with
Portuguese Minister of Economics Joaquim Pina Moura here today,
said that investment by both countries has already begun and China
would like to know more about Portugal economy and its investment
policy to explore possibilities for further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's overseas investment is still in a primary stage, Zeng
said, and mainly focuses on resources that are in short supply in
China, and if conditions permit, China will consider investing in
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic and trade co-operation is expected to expand
after Macao's return in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moura said that China and Portugal can increase their
cooperation in investment and trade, and Macao can serve as a link
between the two.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government supports China's early entry to the
World Trade Organization, he said, and believes that this is
helpful for the world trade balance.

better off we can go (and invest) there."

<HEADLINE> Construction, Tourism Lifting Cambodian GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 23 (Xinhua) -- An increase in construction,
coupled with a slow recovery in tourism, could boost Cambodia's
gross domestic product by 3.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Keat Chhon told a book launching ceremony that
growth in construction and manufacturing is helping promote GDP
growth, which increased only two percent last year.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects the tourism industry to continue its slow
recovery this year, after the number of visitors plummeted last
year because the Asian economic meltdown coincided with factional
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
An economic crisis occurred in Thailand and then swept through
South-east Asia.
</P>
<P>
Last July saw the former First Prime Minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh ousted by his co-premier, Hun Sen, in the wake of a
military conflict, which scared away visitors bringing tourism to
a halt.
</P>
<P>
Though optimistic about economic prospects, Keat Chhon warned
growth could be reduced due to problems in collecting logging and
customs revenues.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from logging funneled into the treasury are still far
below the Finance Ministry's projections, he said.
</P>
<P>
The treasury has collected only 370,000 U.S. dollars from
logging this year, as opposed to the projected 3.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund last year decided to leave its
office vacant in Phnom Penh. The body was frustrated by tax
exemptions for logging companies and the government's inability to
channel timber revenues to the national budget.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Writer Says More Popular Science Books In Chinese Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- An author of popular science
books in China said today that translators need to work on more
foreign books and articles on popular science.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Daoyi, the executive vice-chairman of the Chinese Science
Writers' Association (CSWA) board of directors, says that a large
number of books on popular science were translated from the late
1970s to the 1980s, but that the number has been dropping in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that translations should be just as important as the
writing of popular science because many countries have published
better materials than China has.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 members of CSWA gathered in Beijing today to
discuss its plan for this year, which includes a popular science
translation contest and a collection of the world's popular
science classics.
</P>
<P>
CSWA is a non-government organization for popular science
writers, translators and critics. It has sponsored quite a few
popular science writing contests and held exhibitions of science
and fine arts in its twenty years. It has also been involved in
judging national scientific achievement awards.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Loses in Monte Carlo Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras suffered an early
defeat in the third round of the 2.2 million U.S. dollars Monte
Carlo Open tennis tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras lost to Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-1, 6-1 in 66
minutes, but could still took over the No. 1 ranking this week
from Chilean Marcelo Rios who missed the event due to injury.
</P>
<P>
Plagued by unforced errors, Sampras looked little like the
player who beat Andre Agassi the day before, dropping six straight
games in the first set and lost his serve five of seven times in
the match against Santoro.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Sampras held his first serve before lost six
straight games in a row as Santoro kept Sampras off-balance with
angled shots.
</P>
<P>
Santoro broke Sampras again for 3-1 and never looked back in
the second set until the final game where Sampras failed to
convert two break points.
</P>
<P>
On clay court, Santoro enjoyed upperhands against Sampras and
other big names, by beating Sampras at the Italian Open in 1991
and 1995, eliminating Thomas Muster and Sergi Bruguera at Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive tournament that Sampras has lost
before the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Petr Korda, with a slight chance to overtake Sampras for the
No. 1 ranking, played Albert Costa in another third-round match.
</P>
<P>
Marcelo Rios, currently No. 1, will drop out of the top spot
after missing this tournament that he won last year.

<HEADLINE> hke042367 -Patrick Gets Stay on Australian Federal Court Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia's High Court late
Thursday night granted stevedoring company's Patrick a stay in
Melbourne on Australia's Federal Court orders to reinstate the
1,400 Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) workers it sacked.
</P>
<P>
High Court Justice Ken Hayne froze the reinstatement of the
workers ahead of a formal application by Patrick for a stay on
Friday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday night, a Full Bench of Australia's Federal
Court ruled an order in Melbourne reinstating 1,400 sacked Patrick
company's dock workers should be upheld, a move put the Australian
government and the company in a difficult position, but welcomed
by the union as a victory.
</P>
<P>
The victory was short-lived as Patrick, the nation's second
largest stevedoring company, sought the stay from the High Court,
the supreme court in Australia, pending a hearing for special
leave to appeal the Federal Court's orders.
</P>
<P>
MUA Sydney Branch Secretary Robert Coombs described the High
Court's stay ruling as a "delaying tactic" by Patrick.
</P>
<P>
He said the union was seeking legal advice on the decision to
determine its next move.
</P>
<P>
The legal battles were triggered by the April 7 mass sacking of
1,400 unionized workers by Patrick with the support of the
Australian government in a bid to break MUA's monopoly on the
nation's major ports.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has indicated time and again that it
was determined to push ahead its waterfront reform.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made Thursday afternoon, Australian Prime Minister
John Howard reaffirmed his government's determination to reform
the Australian waterfront would remain undiminished, irrespective
of any court outcome.
</P>
<P>
Howard said court decisions "will come and go" but at the end
of the day it was the government's policy changes that would
deliver a more economic, reformed, productive and more competitive
Australian waterfront.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan And Mainland Organizations Discuss Visit To Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The executive vice-president of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
Tang Shubei, said here today that the chairman of the Taiwan
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Koo Chen-fu, is welcome here to
take part in activities or symposiums the two organizations hold.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ARATS and SEF discussions today is helpful for
Mr. Koo's visit.
</P>
<P>
Tang and the secretary general of ARATS, Zhang Jincheng, met
this afternoon with an SEF group led by SEF's deputy-secretary
general, Jan Jyh-horng. SEF expressed the hope that mr. Koo
Chen-fu could visit the mainland within this year.
</P>
<P>
This is later than what is expected by the ARATS. However, the
timing is no problem for ARATS, Tang said. So long as the two
sides make proper arrangements, ARATS could invite mr. Koo anytime.
</P>
<P>
"We have already made sound preparations and hope the Taiwan
side could put forward more specific opinions," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that meeting, Li Yafei, deputy-secretary general of
ARATS, exchanged views with Jan Jyh-horng on mr. Koo's visit to
the mainland. ARATS officials also listened to specific
suggestions from SEF on exchanges between the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
In order to help cross-straits relations, ARATS has sent four
letters to the SEF this year, suggesting that the two
organizations hold procedural talks on political negotiations, and
then make arrangement to resume talks on economic and other
affairs.
</P>
<P>
ARATS said it hopes the two organizations will increase
exchanges before the talks begin.
</P>
<P>
Jan and his party are scheduled to leave for Taiwan on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Medical Insurance Provider Expands Market in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A Britain-based international
medical insurance provider said here Thursday that there is a
strong business potential in Asia despite the recent financial
turmoil in this region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to leading Hong Kong insurance brokers and the media
at a reception to celebrate the establishment of the Hong Kong
office of the Goodhealth Worldwide, Martin Garcia, director of the
 Hong Kong office, said that increasing corporate and consumer
awareness in Asia of the value of worldwide medical insurance
cover is creating opportunities for insurers.
</P>
<P>
Goodhealth Worldwide Ltd. based in Sussex, England, was created
 in January 1995 to provide tailored medical insurance services
catering to the specialized needs of people living, working or
traveling outside their normal country of residence.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, Goodhealth opened an office in Hong Kong as
the company's headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region to provide
comprehensive medical insurance services for this region.
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that Asia is home to many expatriates, as well as
an increasing number of Asian professionals who are traveling,
living and working outside of their home bases.
</P>
<P>
These individuals require policies that provide comprehensive
benefits not just at home, but around the world, Carcia said.
</P>
<P>
International healthcare cover is a necessity for those who
travel frequently, if one is to avoid astronomical hospital bills,
 or the risk of being refused treatment altogether.
</P>
<P>
Goodhealth is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Europea Insurance
Management Holdings (IMH) Ltd., a Britain-based insurance broking
firm.
</P>
<P>
At the same reception, Chris Farley-West, Chairman of Europea
IMH Ltd., noted that as the business and financial center of
Asia, Hong Kong makes an excellent base for Goodhealth's
operations in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Goodhealth's Falcon Health Plan offers refund of
medical costs, including in-patient, out-patient, evacuation,
drugs, dressings, and nursing fees, of up to 500,000 pounds (about
 825,000 U.S. dollars) every year. Options include cover for
dental and pregnancy costs.
</P>
<P>
Falcon Plan policyholders can opt to receive treatment in any
country of their choice, even for non-emergency elective
procedures. A 24-hour, multilingual help line is available for
maximum peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
Goodhealth's Falcon Plan is currently available through agents
in Hong Kong, China's mainland, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Nepal and Brunei.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's Great Hural (the
parliament) Thursday elected Tsakhya Elbegdorj as the country's
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's Information Section told Xinhua that
Elbegdorj, vice chairman of the Great Hural, was elected with 61
votes for and six against.
</P>
<P>
The vote was called after the entire cabinet, led by the then
prime minister, Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan, offered to
resign. President Nachagynon Bagabandy on Monday agreed to the en
masse resignation.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural approved the resignation on Tuesday with 59
votes for and one against.
</P>
<P>
Elbegdorj, a 35-year-old former journalist, has until next
Tuesday to appoint a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the national television Wednesday evening,
Elbegdorj said his new government will endeavor to maintain the
continuity of the nation's opening-up foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Elbegdorj was elected president of the National Democratic
Party (NDP) in April, 1996. The NDP is the largest party in the
ruling Democratic Union Coalition, which came to power in
1996.

<HEADLINE> French Open Champions Toppled in Monte Carlo Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- French Open former and reigning
champions both crushed out of the Monte Carlo Open men's tennis
tournament in the third round on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil was beaten 7-6
(8-6), 6-1 by Frenchman Cedric Pioline, while former French Open
title holder Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov suffered his defeat
against Carlo Moya of Spain 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The defeats were hardly surprising as neither the eight-seeded
Brazilian nor the fourth-seeded Russian ever did well in Monte
Carlo while Pioline reached the final in 1993 and Moya the
semifinals last year.
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel any pressure with the French Open only a month
away. I'm improving with each week and remember that last year I
lost in the first round here," Kuerten said.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian showed glimpses of the form which helped him to
win at Roland Garros last year. In the first set with five breaks,
Kuerten even had a 5-3 lead in the tiebreak before losing 6-8.
</P>
<P>
"I could have taken the first set and it would have been very
different," said Kuerten.

<HEADLINE> Reasons Behind Recent Ban on Direct Sales in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, the leading
national newspaper, carried an article today reviewing the
short-lived history of direct sales in China.
</P>
<P>
The State Council earlier this week issued a circular demanding
the halt of all direct sales activities before October 31, thus
ending a 10-year-old direct sales practice in China.
</P>
<P>
Direct sales has spread at an alarming speed in China after it
was first introduced into the country at the end of the 1980s. By
the end of 1995, 163 firms had begun practicing direct sales in
more than 30 major Chinese cities, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of a lack of legal regulations, many business
people and enterprises have waged excessive and false publicity
campaigns and lured consumers into buying excessively high-priced
commodities through direct sales.
</P>
<P>
For example, a Taiwanese jewelry firm registered in Harbin in
northeast China stipulated that only those who bought at least
10,000 yuan (1,204 U.S. dollars) worth of its jewelry can become
its direct sellers. Actually, the jewelry was worth only 3,000 to
4,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lured by an illusion of staggering profit, 1,600 people
registered as direct sellers for the Taiwanese firm. However, only
933 of them received bonuses and recouped their investment in the
end.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, most of the direct sales firms have
relied on offering prices many times higher than the market price,
and many of the products directly sold proved to be fake or
substandard.
</P>
<P>
What is worse, a number of people have made use of direct sales
to engage in superstition as well as reactionary and underworld
gang activities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government in recent years has launched three
special fights against direct sales activities. However,
the crackdowns have failed to address the fundamental problem.
</P>
<P>
"Due to immature market conditions, inadequate legislation and
immature consumer psychology, direct sales have proved
unsuitable for China and thus must be resolutely banned," the
article states.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Sets 7 Percent Growth in Fifth Five-year Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's fifth five-year plan
(1997-2002) has fixed an annual average growth rate of 7 percent
for the country's economy, State Minister for Planning, Science
and Technology Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan has projected the growth rate at 6 percent in the
first year of the five-year period and 8.3 percent in the last
year, Alamgir told reporters, unveiling the government's ambitious
plan, approved by the cabinet early last month.
</P>
<P>
To this end, some 1,960 billion taka (about 42.6 billion U.S.
dollars) will be invested both in the public and private sectors,
with 44 percent going to the public sector and the rest to the
private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-eight percent of the investment will come from domestic
sources, the state minister added.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income during the five-year period will
increase at a rate of 5.5 percent annually, against the average
population growth rate of 1.37 percent a year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We have to achieve the average growth rate of 7 percent
through boosting growth in the agricultural, industrial and social
sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 16.46 percent of the total investment has been earmarked
for agriculture, 15.85 percent for industry, 13.5 percent for
transport and communication, and 13 percent for the energy sector,
according to Alamgir.
</P>
<P>
And the allocation for education and health has been fixed at
22 percent, against the 10.7 percent in the fourth five year plan.

GUANGZHOU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The French supermarket chain
Carrefour plans to increase its purchases in China and hopes the
nation will eventually account for half of its purchase volume in
Asia, according to Herve Clech, who is in charge of the company's
business in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Clech made the comments today at the ongoing 83rd China Export
Commodities Trade Fair in Guangzhou.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Representative from Swedish-based ICA, Wal Mart from the United
States, T&AMP;T Supermarkets and some twenty additional supermarket
chain companies are attending the fair.
</P>
<P>
The fair represents the first time China's foreign trade
companies have enjoyed such a wide exposure to foreign supermarket
chain companies. Said contacts formerly centered on overseas
intermediaries and agencies attending the fair.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (Moftec) expressed satisfaction with the participation
of Carrefour and its counterparts, and noted that China will
encourage its foreign trade companies to strengthen business
relations with foreign supermarket chain companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 23 (Xinhua)-- Emperor Akihito of Japan had a
cordial and friendly conversation with visiting Chinese
Vice-President Hu Jintao at the Imperial Palace here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hu told the Emperor that he has exchanged views with Japanese
government leaders, and people from various sectors, on developing
a good-neighborly Sino-Japanese relationship towards the next
century, and has reached consensus on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Extending his welcome to Hu's Japan tour, Emperor Akihito said
Hu's visit had been fruitful following his meetings with Japanese
people from all walks of life. He hoped the development of
Sino-Japanese ties would continue.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that great strides have been taken in developing
bilateral relations and that Sino-Japanese ties have entered a
period of inheriting the past and ushering in the future.
</P>
<P>
The enhancement of Sino-Japanese relations are of major
significance both to the interests of the two peoples and to
peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region and
the entire world, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said China and Japan should take lessons from history and
work together to foster long-term, stable, good-neighborly and
cooperative ties oriented towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Noting the planned visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin this
fall, Hu said it will be the first visit to Japan by a Chinese
president and will surely push forward bilateral friendly and
cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
The Emperor recalled his China visit in 1992 which, he said,
had left him with a beautiful impression. He told Hu that he is
looking forward to meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin this
autumn in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Guo'an Wins Delayed Match in Chinese League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Guo'an exploited its home
advantage to beat Shandong Luneng 3-1 in a delayed match of the
Chinese first division soccer league here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
After the victory, Guo'an climbed to the fourth place in the
14-team league on nine points, just one point shy of third-placer
Qingdao Hainiu as Guo'an still played one less match due to its
early outing in the Asian Cup Winners' Cup tournament wherein it
finished third.
</P>
<P>
Against strong winds after the morning rain, the Guo'an eleven
enjoyed apparent advantage in the pitch with the free kicks on the
brink of the penalty box in particular.
</P>
<P>
With 19 minutes into the game, Nan Fang sneaked through two
defenders to slam home the opener from a header off Spanish import
Olivas Rubio Andres who jumped high enough to connect a right-wing
free kick.
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes later, the Spaniard dived in the box but failed to
find the target as his header flew inches off the right post.
</P>
<P>
Within a minute after the break, the visiting squad awarded an
owl goal to the home side in a goal-mouth scramble.
</P>
<P>
From a perfect pass off Andres, Li Hongzheng found the ball
first with his right foot which bounced back from the post before
it went into the net off the body of a Luneng defender.
</P>
<P>
After it failed to convert any of the five corner kicks into
goal in the first half, Luneng resorted to the tactics of counter
attack after the break.
</P>
<P>
In the 54th minute, Song Yumin was found unspotted in a swift
counter attack but his close-range low shot was blocked by Guo'an
goalie Yao Jian.
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes later, Xing Rui eventually scored for Luneng from
a free kick in front of the penalty box which flew over the wall
of defenders and sneaked into the net just below the bar.
</P>
<P>
In the 77th minute, Wang Shaolei dampened any hope of Luneng
for a win, netting in an instant free kick before the defenders
even positioned themselves on time.

<HEADLINE> The Two Koreas Exchange Weather Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Korea (ROK) and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Thursday exchanged
their first direct telegrams on weather-related information since
the Korean War in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The ROK Meteorological Administration said it sent a telegram,
in the name of Seoul Kimpo Airport Office, to Pyongyang's Sunan
Airport at 11 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The telegram, written in English, appealed for the exchange of
weather information for various purposes, including ensuring
flight safety over DPRK territory.
</P>
<P>
It said the South and North sides should cooperate to reduce
weather-induced mishaps through exchanges of information and joint
research.
</P>
<P>
A reply telegram from the DPRK, sent around noon, said the
north side had received Seoul's telegram and wanted to know
whether there were any problems for flight operations.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK Thursday opened its sky for international flights,
including the ROK's national airliners.
</P>
<P>
The Southern administration said it will continue to provide
the DPRK with weather reports and warnings.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Cleared Off Slay Plot Against Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Justice Thursday cleared Vice President Joseph Estrada off the
allegations that he planned in 1992 the assassination of President
Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
A five-man panel headed by Justice Undersecretary Jesus
Zozobrado said there were no sufficient evidences to charge
Estrada even if the allegations "are probably true".
</P>
<P>
Zozobrado said, even if the allegations of senior police
officer Reynaldo Berroya were true, they could not be made as a
basis for the filing of criminal complaint against Estrada.
</P>
<P>
"There were no evidences that Estrada had done any overt acts
to pursue the proposal, such as setting up money, buying of guns,
and organizing people for the purpose", Zozobrado said.
</P>
<P>
He added that another vital witness has already been dead, so
there could be no one to corroborate Berroya's allegations.
</P>
<P>
Berroya said earlier last month that Estrada planned to kill
Ramos in 1992 and smuggled some firearms into the country for the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, presidential candidate of the opposition who has been
leading all surveys, said the charges were part of the ruling
party's black propaganda to stop him from winning the May 11
elections.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Says It Can't Meet UN Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) said here Thursday that it can't
meet the United Nations deadline for reestablishing state organs
in areas still under its control.
</P>
<P>
Alcides Sakala, UNITA Secretary in charge of external
relations, said that the Angolan opposition movement can't meet
the deadline set by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan because
"necessary conditions are still lacking".
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Angola state radio, Sakala said that
conditions were still not ripe to meet the deadline set by the
U.N. Secretary-General and UNITA is still negotiating with the
Angolan government on issues concerning the reestablishment of
state authorities.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the Angolan peace process submitted to the
U.N. Security Council recently, Annan said that state authorities
should be reestablished by the end of April in Bailundo,
currently headquarters of UNITA, Andulo and other "sensitive
areas" controlled by the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also asked UNITA to accomplish before the end
of this month all the suspending tasks stipulated in the 1994
Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA leader, however, stressed that what is important is
not to race against time but to go on with the negotiations so
that the remaining problems can be resolved at an appropriate
time.
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable agreed on March 6 by the Angolan
government and UNITA, the reestablishment of local governments in
Bailundo and Andulo should be completed by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
But the goal was not reached due to the delay by UNITA. The
peace process is now in a dilemma as the negotiations between the
two warring sides have born no fruits.
</P>
<P>
However, as was noted in Annan's report, 269 of the 335 cities
and towns controlled by UNITA across the southern African country
prior to the signing of the Lusaka Peace Protocol in 1994 have
already been returned to the Angolan government.

<HEADLINE> Stable Prices Seen in Next Two Months in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Stable prices for basic
commodities are projected in the next two months in the
Philippines given the lower oil prices in the local and world
markets, a senior official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the president, Trade and Industry
Undersecretary Melito Salazar said the prices continue to be kept
at stable levels with "hardly any major fluctuations because of
adequacy in supply and rigid price monitoring activities done by
the local governments and concerned national government agencies."
</P>
<P>
The demand for agricultural and basic commodities would also
help maintain prices at generally stable levels, Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the price monitoring report of his department for
the third week of April showed general price stability of selected
basic commodities in specific urban centers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"Prices of canned fish, milk, coffee, laundry soap, detergent
bars, common nail wire, cement, and steel bars are generally in
adequate supply," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said the monitoring activities by government agencies
could greatly help the government achieve its single-digit
inflation target by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate for March fell to 7.3 percent from
February's 7.4 percent, but it was much higher than last year's
average of 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts said that food supplies were far from
enough in the drought-stricken southern Mindanao. It was reported
that at least 3.7 million people there have been affected by the
El Nino-induced drought and 64 of them had died in famine.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The relationship between China
and Latin America will undoubtedly be even better in the next
century, according to Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during today's meeting with Ricardo
Lagos, leader of Chile's Socialist Party and Party for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party,
said that China values its relationships with Latin American
countries and pointed to the comparatively long history of
political, economic and cultural contacts.

<P>
"China hopes to increase political dialog with all countries
in Latin America in order to promote understanding and trust,
bolster cultural exchanges and economic cooperation, and develop a
friendly and cooperative relationship based on long-term
stability, equality and mutual benefit," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out China and Chile are developing countries
located in the Pacific Region and noted that both have enjoyed
rapid economic development for more than 10 years
</P>
<P>
The two countries should take advantage of enhanced conditions
for cooperation and exchanges, and should seize the excellent
opportunity to fully develop bilateral relations, according to
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Lagos said that Chile was one of the first South American
countries to establish diplomatic ties with China and has closely
followed the nation's development and changes.
</P>
<P>
He said he was highly impressed with the vitality of the
Chinese economy and agreed that the Asia-Pacific Region is the
most economically vigorous region in the world. He said Chile is
fully prepared to enhance cooperation with China and help promote
the region's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Lagos is on his first visit to China at the invitation of the
International Department of the CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> Multimedia Market Displays Vast Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China has yet to tap the vast
potential of huge multimedia market.
</P>
<P>
The Multimedia '98 Exhibition opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Fourth International Exhibition on Multimedia
Technology and Applications, the largest of its kind ever held in
China, has attracted more than 150 domestic and overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition shows the progress of China's multimedia
industry, including Chinese software which has won international
prizes and creative multimedia tools developed domestically.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the sponsoring State Economic and Trade
Commission pointed to the rapid growth of China's multimedia
market since the introduction of related technology in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Multimedia has emerged as a common component for China's
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to surpass Japan and become the world's
second largest PC market within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has placed priority on the development
of a series of multimedia projects, including technology,
platforms, applications and multimedia environments.
</P>
<P>
Relevant officials note that China has not as yet reached an
accelerated pace in developing its own multimedia technology and
products.
</P>
<P>
However, most major international multimedia companies have
entered the Chinese market as evidenced by the number on
multinationals participating in the exhibition, including IBM, DEC
and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which will run through Monday, will feature
forums on the development strategy for China's multimedia market
and relevant technology.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Hospitals Set to Adopt New Symbol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's hospitals, clinics and
applicable medical institutions are preparing to adopt a white
cross superimposed on a clover leaf design composed of four red
hearts as an identification symbol, according to the Ministry of
Health (MOH).
</P>
<P>
The symbol should be strategically placed in highly visible
locations in hospital buildings, according to an MOH circular
released today.
</P>
<P>
"The four red hearts symbolize love, patience, care and the
sense of responsibility of medical professionals. The symbol will
clearly designate a medical service center," according to the
circular.
</P>
<P>
Symbols for medical emergency centers and departments should be
illuminated at night, and can be painted on ambulances and other
hospital facilities.
</P>
<P>
Military hospitals which provide medical services to civilians
will to display the symbol, according to the circular, which was
jointly issued by the MOH and the Health Department of General
Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The ministry introduced the new symbol in an attempt to halt
the illegal use of the internationally recognized Red Cross logo
displayed by some medical institutions which are not members of
the Red Cross Society, according to MOH official Li Dachuan.
</P>
<P>
The Law on the Red Cross Society and Methods Concerning the Use
of the Red Cross Symbol limits the use of the symbol to members of
the society.
</P>
<P>
"However, the fact that many medical institutions have simply
ignored the law and displayed the symbol has confused people,"
said Li.
</P>
<P>
"The unified use of the symbol is designed to make it more
convenient for people to locate medical care facilities,"
according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The ministry adopted a blue cross for medical institutions
early last year, but soon thereafter discontinued use of the
symbol which was registered by the veterinary sector.
</P>
<P>
A green cross currently serves as the unified symbol for the
nation's drug stores.

<HEADLINE> Australian Sacked Dock Workers Wins Critical Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- An Australian federal court
Thursday night ruled that an order in Melbourne reinstating 1,400
sacked Patrick company's dock workers should be upheld.
</P>
<P>
The decision, read by presiding Judge Murray Wilcox, was
broadcast live on Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV and
radio.
</P>
<P>
An ecstatic roar from the 2,000 dock workers gathered at the
picket at Melbourne's East Swanson Dock greeted the decision.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen that whether the government and the
company will accept the latest ruling and how long the 14-day-old
nationwide dispute would drag on.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has indicated time and again that it
is determined to push ahead its waterfront reform, referring to
its plan to improve the productivity on the nation's ports by
breaking Maritime Union of Australia's monopoly over the nation's
major ports.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made Thursday afternoon well before the latest
ruling, Australian Prime Minister John Howard reaffirmed that his
government's determination to reform the Australian waterfront
would remain undiminished, irrespective of any court outcome.
</P>
<P>
Howard said court decisions "will come and go" but at the end
of the day it was the government's policy changes that would
deliver a more economic, reformed, productive and more competitive
Australian waterfront.
</P>
<P>
"The resolute belief of my government is that it is essential
we go into the 21st century with a modern, competitive waterfront,
irrespective of any particular decision in certain cases," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the comments earlier Thursday at Sydney
airport before leaving for Thailand for meetings with Thai
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Federal Court justice Tony North on Tuesday made the order to
give the dock workers their jobs back ahead of a trial on claims
that Patrick conspired unlawfully to sack them.
</P>
<P>
Patrick later appealed against the order to full bench of the
Federal Court, which rejected the appeal Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
John Edwards, an economist, predicted in a commentary on
financial markets Thursday afternoon that whatever the decision of
the court would be, the disruption to Australian trade from the
dispute could continue for some time to come.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Maintain Steady in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer price inflation in
Hong Kong continued to be moderate in March, according to the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for March released here today.
</P>
<P>
The figures, released by the Census and Statistics Department,
showed the year-on-year increase in the Composite CPI in March was
4.8 percent, following a 5.4 percent increase in January and 4.7
percent increase in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Composite CPI is compiled on the basis of the combined
expenditure pattern of households covered by three sub-indices.
CPI(A) covers about 50 percent of households with a monthly
expenditure of between 2,500 and 9,999 HK dollars. CPI(B) covers
about 30 of households with a monthly expenditure of between
10,000 and 17,499 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Comparing March with February, the Composite CPI increased by
0.3 percent. The corresponding increases for the CPI(A) and CPI(B)
were 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of 1998, the increase in the Composite
CPI averaged at 5.0 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
For the 12-month ended March 1998, the Composite CPI was, on
average, higher by 5.6 percent than the preceding 12-month period.
</P>
<P>
The higher year-on-year rates of increase in the Composite CPI,
CPI(A) and CPI(B) in March than in February were mainly due to a
high base of comparison in February 1997 in respect of some fresh
food items and miscellaneous services. The increase in the charges
for electricity in March 1998 also contributed, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by component, higher year-on-year rates of price
increase than the overall average in March were recorded for
housing, alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Those components with lower year-on-year rates of price
increase than the overall average in March were fuel and light,
miscellaneous services and goods, clothing and footwear, and food.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Approves Accord With Leftist Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
on Thursday approved the Agreement on Human Rights and
International Humanitarian Law recently initialed between the
government and the leftist rebel group, the National Democratic
Front (NDF).
</P>
<P>
The approval, announced by Executive Secretary Alexander
Aguirre, is seen to pave the way for a joint ceasefire agreement
for the duration of the on-going peace talks between the
government and the NDF, led by the Communist Party of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be implemented upon the declaration of a
mutual or joint suspension of armed hostilities for the duration
of the on-going peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre has relayed the qualified approval of the agreement to
NDF chairman Luis Jalandoni.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that the Department of Foreign Affairs is
expediting the passport of NDF leader Jose Ma. Sison for the
latter's return to the Philippines after more than 10 years of
self-exile in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Sison is expected to arrive in Manila before the end of this
month to witness the formal signing of the human rights agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice has issued a certification that Sison
has no pending criminal cases in courts for the speedy release of
his passport.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre again denied earlier NDF allegations that at present
there are still political prisoners in jail in the country.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such political prisoners, per se," he said,
"because all political prisoners have been released already."
</P>
<P>
The NDF has required the government to release about 143
political prisoners still in detention.
</P>
<P>
To build confidence with the NDF, Aguirre said the government
is conducting a review on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the NDF, has
been waging a guerrilla warfare for the past 29 years.

News, PDF, previously known as Aid-to-Pakistan Consortium, is
scheduled to meet in Islamabad from May 12 to 13.
</P>
<P>
A high level review mission of the International Monetary Fund
is also expected to take part in the two-day PDF session.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's aid request for the 1997-98 fiscal year was 2.2 68
billion dollars, comprising 2.066 billion dollars as project
assistance and 202 million dollars as quick disbursing commodity
aid.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted official sources as saying that the scheduled
session by PDF in May will be a non-pledging one. Main feature of
the proposed meeting will be the participation of private sector
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The main items on the agenda of the meeting include good
governance, social sector development, particularly education and
energy sector developments.
</P>
<P>
The report said that given the increasingly constrained
international environment for official development assistance
after the cold war, its share of external funding is expected to
continue to decline gradually.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign financing of the balance of payments will have to
come from private commercial sources.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the perceived higher country risk, the reduced
credibility of economic policy in the light of the past experience
and the recent economic crisis in the region have adversely
affected Pakistan's access to international capital market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is to reopen
its decentralized cooperation system in the Mediterranean region,
a move to advance Euro-Mediterranean relations.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the E.U.,
decided Thursday to re-launch the program, known as the Med
Programs, to facilitate cooperation between representatives of
civil societies, an important element in Euro-Mediterranean
relations.
</P>
<P>
Focus will be on improving urban living conditions,
coordinating exchanges of experiences and know-how among
universities in the Mediterranean region, and developing networks
among the mass media.
</P>
<P>
A technical assistance office will be set up to examine the
implementation of the new program.
</P>
<P>
The programs were suspended in 1996 for checking and improving
the management systems, and for an in-depth technical and
financial evaluation by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation was re-launched with new management systems and
control measures in place following the recommendations of the
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1995, more than 470 networks were created,
bringing together about 2,000 partners from civil organizations
through these programs.

<HEADLINE> WTO to Launch Tourism Development Plan for India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Tourism Organization
(WTO) is to launch a tourism development plan for India focusing
on regional planning for areas identified by the Indian
government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 36th meeting of the WTO commission for South
Asia and pan Asia/Pacific technical seminars in Kochi city of
Kerala State in the far southwestern India on Thursday, WTO Deputy
Secretary General Dawid J. De Villiers said that the plan to be
launched this year aimed at furthering human resource development
for the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
India's potential in tourism was yet to be fully realized. in
1997, 2.37 million foreign tourists came to India, a growth of 3.8
percent over 1996. Similarly, tourist receipts exceeded 3.1
billion U.S. dollars, a growth of 6.5 percent over 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Union Minister for Tourism Madan Lal Khurana said that
both the private and public sectors should cooperate to create
tourism infrastructure in India. One of the major pitfalls in the
country's tourism policy had been non-recognition of the
importance of public participation in tourism development.
</P>
<P>
In order to bridge critical infrastructural gaps like roads,
drainage and water supply systems in the identified tourist
centers, it was proposed to set up a tourism development fund, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government would come out with a new pragmatic tourism
policy aimed at putting India on the global tourism map and a
policy to this end would be finalized within the next two months,
he further said.

<HEADLINE> Observatory Planned for Yunnan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) plans to build a new astronomical observatory in Gaomeigu,
Lijiang Prefecture in southwest China's Yunnan Province, an area
considered to be the best location in south China for astronomical
observation.
</P>
<P>
The observatory will be built on Nantiejia Mountain in
northwest Yunnan. The facility, which will be located at an
elevation of 3,000 meters above the sea level, will enjoy clear
dark nights free of the lighting, pollution and dust
characteristic of cities, according to Wang Shouguan, a CAS
academician and member of the academy's site appraisal committee.
</P>
<P>
He said to definite of "seeing", a term astronomers use to
describe the clarity and steadiness of the atmosphere, clearly
ranks Gaomeigu as the best of five potential sites in the province.
</P>
<P>
Gaomeigu also offers better conditions for transportation and
other construction activities, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
CAS plans to install a two-meter telescope in the new
observatory, with the possibility for larger telescopes if
observation proves fruitful.
</P>
<P>
China recruited a large number of scientists to select
locations for new observatories in the 1960s, with CAS scientists
focusing their attention on Yunnan and finally selecting Gaomeigu
as an ideal location in 1992.
</P>
<P>
An observatory in a southern province will provide more chances
for astronomical observation in general since China is in the
Northern Hemisphere, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The fact that observatories in Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai,
Xi'an and Kunming must deal with light and air pollution in
surrounding areas prompted Chinese astronomers to search for
better locations, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing Zijinshan Observatory's satellite station in
northwest China's Qinghai Province offers excellent "seeing"
quality.
</P>
<P>
The largest optical telescope in China is the 2.16-meter
telescope in the Xinglong Station operated by the Beijing
Astronomical Observatory.

ISLAMABAD, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain left the southern port city of Karachi Thursday
for Dhaka, Bangladesh, to attend the first Information Conference
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference will cement further the existing
goodwill and friendly relations among SAARC countries, said
Hussain prior to his departure, according to a report by the
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, information ministers from SAARC member
countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives,
Nepal, India and Pakistan will study in depth ways and means to
improve relations through information and media development,
Hussain said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that one sure way to strengthen the
relations is to have more and more trade and economic relations
among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
Economic activities among the SAARC countries should be
accelerated, he said, adding that there exists great scope in
improving trade and commerce relations on the basis of mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Hussain also said that he will call on Prime
Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina during his stay in Dhaka and

<HEADLINE> UNITA Says It Can't Meet UN Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) said here Thursday that it can't
meet the United Nations deadline for reestablishing state organs
in areas still under its control.
</P>
<P>
Alcides Sakala, UNITA Secretary in charge of external
relations, said that the Angolan opposition movement can't meet
the deadline set by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan because
"necessary conditions are still lacking".
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Angola state radio, Sakala said that
conditions were still not ripe to meet the deadline set by the
U.N. Secretary-General and UNITA is still negotiating with the
Angolan government on issues concerning the reestablishment of
state authorities.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the Angolan peace process submitted to the
U.N. Security Council recently, Annan said that state authorities
should be reestablished by the end of April in Bailundo,
currently headquarters of UNITA, Andulo and other "sensitive
areas" controlled by the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also asked UNITA to accomplish before the end
of this month all the suspending tasks stipulated in the 1994
Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA leader, however, stressed that what is important is
not to race against time but to go on with the negotiations so
that the remaining problems can be resolved at an appropriate
time.
</P>
<P>
According to the timetable agreed on March 6 by the Angolan
government and UNITA, the reestablishment of local governments in
Bailundo and Andulo should be completed by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
But the goal was not reached due to the delay by UNITA. The
peace process is now in a dilemma as the negotiations between the
two warring sides have born no fruits.
</P>
<P>
However, as was noted in Annan's report, 269 of the 335 cities
and towns controlled by UNITA across the southern African country
had already been returned to the Angolan government prior to the
signing of the Lusaka Peace Protocol in 1994.

<HEADLINE> PNG's PM Offers to Meet Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate Thursday offered to meet the disaffected
leader of Bougainville's secessionist rebels, Francis Ona, in a
bid to ensure the signing of a permanent ceasefire on the
war-ravaged island, Australian media reported.
</P>
<P>
In a blow to the current peace process, Ona last week demanded
an indefinite postponement of the ceasefire due to be signed by
the warring parties at Arawa in central Bougainville next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made by all sides to involve Ona in bringing
peace to the Pacific island which has suffered a decade of
bloodshed under the secessionist rebellion.
</P>
<P>
In a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister said Thursday
that Ona was still the chief of Bougainville and added that there
were reports that the rebel chief wanted to meet him.
</P>
<P>
"The invitation is there... If he wants to meet with me I'd
love to meet with him," Skate was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said he remained confident that the
ceasefire agreement would still be signed next week.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of four Bougainvillean MPs in the PNG national
government is due to meet Ona on Monday in an 11th hour bid to
convince him to join the peace process, the wire service said.
</P>
<P>
The island rebels' struggle to gain independence from Papua New
Guinea has led to an estimated 15,000 deaths.

<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China highly values its
traditional friendship with Zambia and is willing to work with that
country to bring the existing friendly, all-round cooperative
relations well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the remarks today
in a meeting with his Zambian counterpart, Kelly Walubita, who is
on his first visit to China after taking office in December.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Zambian peoples have had traditional and
profound friendship, Tang said, adding that the Sino-Zambian
relation has remained good in the last 34 years since the
establishment of diplomatic relations although the global and
domestic situations have undergone remarkable changes.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, frequent high-level visits ensured the
development of cooperation in wide-ranging areas between the two
countries, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is satisfied with the stable development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang said he appreciates the Zambian government's adherence to
the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Walubita conveyed the greetings of Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. He also extended his
appreciation for China's achievements in economic construction and
its positive role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He thanked China for its longtime support and help to Zambia,
and described China as an "all-weather" friend of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian foreign minister reiterated his country's
observation of the "one China" policy and recognition of the
government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal
government of China, including Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Walubita arrived here Wednesday for a six-day official visit as
Tang's guest. He is expected to meet Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Besides Beijing, Walubita and his party will visit Nanchang,

<HEADLINE> Nhiek Bun Chhay Denies Relations With Khmer Rouge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 23 (Xinhua) -- General Nhiek Bun Chhay of
Cambodia Thursday denied any relations with the Khmer Rouge in
Anlong Veng.
</P>
<P>
Nhiek Bun Chhay, who is leading the forces loyal to Prince
Ranariddh, made the remarks in a three-point statement signed by
him in O'smach, an area near the Thai border controlled by the
Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF).
</P>
<P>
Rejecting rumors that he had relations with the Khmer Rouge, he
said, some Khmer Rouge units in Anlong Veng came over to surrender
to the RCAF.
</P>
<P>
But for the time being he had not made any decision on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the VOA April 22 report that picked up news
from the Thai TV saying the Khmer Rouge forces had merged with his
and had appointed Ta Mok as his advisor.
</P>
<P>
The truth was that he could only welcome the Khmer Rouge
defectors once they cut all their links with their leaders who
committed genocide, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he himself and all the other high ranking
commanders were part of the RCAF. Therefore, to avoid any further
accusation of having link with the Khmer Rouge, he proposed that
the United Nations send observers to verify and monitor the
situation on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Nhiek Bun Chhay, former deputy chief of RCAF general staff,
along with Prince Ranariddh, was tried by the Phnom Penh Military

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Hong Kong Youths To Be on Study Tours to Inland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 4,000 young people
will benefit from a "study tour" program to visit China's inland
areas, according to the Commission on Youth of Hong Kong here
today.
</P>
<P>
The first group of tours began earlier this month. There will
be many more in the summer and the program will be completed
before January 15, 1999, according to a spokesman for the
commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission has recently approved 82 applications for
sponsorship under the Community Participation Scheme for
Organizing Study Tours to inland areas. The total amount of
sponsorship is 6 million H.K. Dollars, equally funded between the
government and a local charities fund.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the commission said it has received more than
200 applications for fund to organize these study tours. The
total amount exceeded 30 million H.K. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is very encouraging. It shows that many organizations are
keen to organize activities that are beneficial to the
development of youths," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that these study tours will help enhance local
youths' understanding of China. They will know more about Chinese
history and culture, and the political, economic, social system,
and the people's livelihood in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Successful applicants are required to submit a report to the
commission after the tours.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Reports 28 Percent Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 22 (Xinhua)-- Microsoft Corp., the world's
largest maker of personal computer software, reported Wednesday
that its fiscal third-quarter profits rose 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Greg Maffei, chief financial officer of the company, said
Microsoft earned 1.34 billion dollars in the January-March
quarter, compared 1.04 billion dollars during the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 18 percent to 3.77 billion dollars from 3.21
billion dollars, he added, saying the company was pleased that
consumer demand remained high for its products.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said its profit margins rose in the quarter due to
relatively lower marketing expenses and a decline in research and
development costs.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from computer manufacturers that pre-install Microsoft
products on new computers rose to 1.23 billion dollars, an increase
of 28 percent over the year-earlier period, due to rising personal
computer sales and increased penetration of the costlier Windows
NT system.
</P>
<P>
"But it is critical to note that our growth has slowed for each
of the last four quarters, and we are likely to experience slower
growth for the balance of calendar 1998," Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect at least a modest boost from the release of the
Windows 98 operating system scheduled on June 25, and a major wave
of buying after the company releases its high-end Windows NT 5.0
operating system late this year or early 1999.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft operating systems run on more than 90 percent of
personal computers worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Killing of Shiite Leader in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry on
Thursday summoned Iraqi charge d'affaires Salah Noori Samarmad
here to protest the killing of a famous Shiite Muslim leader in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tehran Radio, the ministry's director general
for Persian Gulf affairs demanded Iraqi government give necessary
explanation for the murder of Ayatollah Ali Mohammad Ibrahem
al-Boroujerdi in the Shiite holy city of Najaf in southern Iraq
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ayatollah Boroujerdi, the prayer leader at the shrine of Imam
Ali, who is respected by Shiites as the first successor of Islamic
Prophet Mohammed, was beaten to death by a group of unidentified
people, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
But an Iraqi announcement earlier said the Iranian sheikh was
shot to death when he was heading for home after praying at the
holy shrine of Imam Ali.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the murderer escaped from the scene, and
accused "foreign intelligence" of being behind the assassination
because of the "religious belief and moderate attitude" of the
influential figure.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry urged Iraqi government to arrest
and punish those responsible for killing.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi envoy expressed regret over the incident, promising
to inform his government of Iran's views and stance towards the
killing.

<HEADLINE> Asia Pacific Leather Fair Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A 10-day-long Asia Pacific
Leather Fair which introduces new dimensions to the global leather
industry opened at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first of its kind held in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), attracting more than 4,300
companies from 65 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The fair, occupying a total exhibition space of 85,000 square
meters, stages two consecutive shows, one about the raw materials
and manufacturing show from April 23 to 26, and the other about
the spring show of fashion and finished products from April 30 to
May 2.
</P>
<P>
The two shows will present the most important innovators and
suppliers of leather manufacturing, technology and leather fashion
finished products in a new sectorized layout.
</P>
<P>
A total of 549 exhibitors from China are joining in the fair,
of which 417 are Hong Kong exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
Michael Duck, general manager of the Miller Freeman Asia Ltd.,
said at a press conference: "we are not just bringing to you a
bigger show. It is also important that we are holding the first
Asia Pacific Leather Fair in the new HKSAR of China after the
hand-over last July."
</P>
<P>
Though the entire region was affected in some way by the
economic and financial crisis last October, Hong Kong remains to
be the perfect regional venue for Asia Pacific Leather Fair, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the international confidence in Hong Kong is evident
also by the recent remarks by the International Monetary Fund
which described Hong Kong as the "Pillar of Stability" in the
midst of the region's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
China's declaration of support to the HKSAR in many
international events further assures HK's continued success, he
added.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, a leather seminar on opportunities for
international companies in China's leather market is scheduled to
be held here on April 24.

Muganwa said: "We have now signed an amendment to the sale
agreement that we signed last year with Westmont."

<HEADLINE> HK Financial System Works Well, Review Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A review of Hong Kong financial
market demonstrated that the linked exchange rate mechanism has
been functioning well, the financial system has been sound and the
securities and futures markets have been operating orderly, a
leading Hong Kong financial official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The administration has taken a thorough look at the operation
of the currency defense mechanism as well as the operation of the
financial markets in wake of speculators' attack against Hong Kong
dollar last October, which brought about a plunge in stock and
property prices.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference concerning a report on the review,
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said, the local financial
community, academics both in and beyond Hong Kong as well as
experts from the International Monetary Fund were consulted during
the review period.
</P>
<P>
And the review has been premised on two fundamental principles.
</P>
<P>
"First, consistent with the mandate in the Basic Law, and
bearing in mind the long-term interest of Hong Kong as an open and
externally-oriented economy, we must maintain and enhance the
status of Hong Kong as an international financial
center. Secondly, consistent with the objective of maintaining the
stability of the Hong Kong dollar, the linked exchange rate
system which has served Hong Kong well must be preserved," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that, despite the pain that has been
inflicted on the economy by the interest rate hike and asset price
adjustments, "the defense mechanism for the currency has very
effectively preserved the stability of the exchange rate and the
monetary system."
</P>
<P>
"The prudential regulatory framework for both the banking and
the securities sectors which we have carefully built up over the
years have formed effective buffers against the recent shocks," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's performance during the regional financial turmoil
should be granted an "A" mark, the official observed.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the government has identified a number
of areas where improvements can be made. "Some of the measures,
such as fixed-rate mortgages offering an additional financing
option for home buyers, have already been put in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report made a few recommendations concerning the stock
market, the futures and derivative markets, market surveillance
and risk management, market transparency, and investor protection
and education. For example, drawing a lesson from the failure of C
A Pacific, it recommended that broker-related finance companies
be subject to regulation by the Securities and Futures
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Financial Services Rafael Hui, Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Joseph Yam and Chairman of the
Securities and Futures Commission Anthony Neoh joined Tsang in
attending the press conference.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Shut Makeshift Cholera Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican health authority has
decided to close the Makeshift tents for cholera patients in
Maputo City and Maputo Province as the epidemic situation becomes
stable.
</P>
<P>
The tents were set up to house patients as there were no more
beds in the Central Hospital of Maputo to treat cholera patients
but those in other areas, particularly in the central provinces
of Zambezia and Sofala will remain open, the Noticias newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources from the health administration
authority as saying that new cholera patients can go to the
Central Hospital of Maputo for treatment at present.
</P>
<P>
Until early this year, the Central Hospital of Maputo had been
the only hospital accepting cholera sufferers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As cholera broke out last August, there were so many patients
suffering from the epidemic that many tents had been set up as
makeshift clinics in the suburbs of the capital city and in the
province of Maputo in a bid to ease the pressure on the Central
Hospital of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the medical staff working in these
clinics would return to their former posts and the students
invited to help would go back to the nurse schools to go on with
their study.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director Assistant of the National Health
Administration Avertino Barreto reminded that cholera should not
be treated slightly in other areas, especially in the two
provinces of Zambezia and Sofala.
</P>
<P>
He said that 721 and 352 cholera cases occurred last week in
Zambezia and Sofala respectively, including 25 deaths in the
former.
</P>
<P>
Barreto warned the communities against a comeback of cholera
and asked them to pay attention to personal hygiene and the
sanitation of their surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
So far, cholera has hit seven of the 10 provinces in
Mozambique. About 30,000 people have contracted the disease,
resulting in 720 dead.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mozambican Treasury Ministry had again
appropriated 30 billion Meticais (some three million U.S.
Dollars) to help prevent and wipe out cholera and other epidemic
diseases in the country.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Qian Qichen Meets Portuguese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama met today and pointed to
the success of this week's visit by a Portuguese delegation
led by Prime Minister Antonio Guterres.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio's visit to
China in February last year promoted the development of
Sino-Portuguese ties. He also noted the continuing sound momentum
in the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that Foreign Minister Gama is visiting China
after last year's visit by President Sampaio," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Developing long-term stable, friendly and cooperative ties
based on mutual respect, equality and benefits not only conforms
to the fundamental interests of the two countries, but will also
promote the formation of a new European-Asian partnership.
</P>
<P>
Gama said the Portuguese media has praised the Prime Minister's
China tour, and noted that the visit will create a favorable
atmosphere for the further development of bilateral relations and
solving the Macao issue.
</P>
<P>
Qian briefed the visiting delegation on Chinese government
principles and policies concerning the resumption of China's
sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
He said China will pursue the principles of "one country, two
systems," "Macao people governing Macao," and a high degree of
autonomy in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Qian reaffirmed that the Chinese government will as always
abide by the Sino-Portuguese Joint Statement and will ensure the
smooth transition and handover of power in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have cooperated in accordance with the Joint
Statement and have effectively solved a number of problems, said
Qian, adding that the two sides should expand cooperation and
resolve all major issues concerning the handover in order to realize
the smooth transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
This will benefit efforts to maintain stability and development
in Macao and will also conform to the common interests of the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Gama said his government has adopted measures to ensure the
smooth transition and expressed hope that the joint liaison group
will accelerate its work in order to make progress in handling
all major issues related to the handover.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Criticized for Remarks on Bankrolling Southeast Asia  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan authorities have political
motives in their attempt to link themselves with the central
government to help Southeast Asian countries overcome their
financial difficulties and boost their economies, according to a
commentator's article today.
</P>
<P>
Through such a scheme, the article signed by Chen Binhua notes,
Taiwan is trying to take advantage of the temporary economic
difficulties of the countries in a bid to seek political benefits
and create recognition of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The central government does not object to Taiwan's
non-governmental economic and trade exchanges with Southeast Asian
countries. Taiwan has close ties with those countries. However,
Taiwan has been acting in the way of hitting a person when he is
down in the middle of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has a huge foreign trade surplus, and its foreign
exchange reserves rank it third in the world. But the Taiwan
authorities have devaluated its currency, which affected the Hong
Kong stock market.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Chinese government has been paying attention to
good-neighbor relations with Southeast Asian countries, and has
provided timely and strong assistance to some countries which
suffered from the financial disturbance.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, the Chinese government is striving not
to devalue the Renminbi in order to prevent even bigger financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taiwan authorities, who hold the unshirkable
responsibility for worsening the financial crisis, want to be seen
as a savior. If it really cared for the difficulty of those
countries, the Taiwan authorities would not devaluate its currency.

<HEADLINE> Bad Year Seen for Banking in Kenya: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan banks face a difficult
year in 1998, with profits undermined by a growing mountain of
non-performing loans, the East African Standard Thursday quoted
analysts as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The honeymoon is over for banks in this country," said Amish
Gupta, associate director of Shah, Munge &AMP; Partners, "Profits
will be flat."
</P>
<P>
Asset quality deteriorated last year with the proportion of
non-performing loans to total advances increasing by three
percentage points to 21 percent, the Central Bank of Kenya said
in its March month review.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans totaled 43.8 billion Shillings (735
million U.S. Dollars) at the end of December from an overall 209
billion Shillings in loans and advances, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate non-performing loans represent 8.6 percent
of Kenya's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
"It is striking that the Kenyan banking system's level of
non-performing loans and advances is on the rise," said Gupta.
</P>
<P>
"It is deteriorating precariously close to other emerging
markets that have already undergone serious banking crises which
were very expensive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Latest data from Standard Chartered Bank show non-performing
loans shot up to 458 million Shillings in 1997 from 47.2 million
Shillings in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank of Kenya results for the same period show bad
debts rose to 222 million Shillings from 72 million Shillings in
1996. Barclays noted that 1997 was an exceptionally bad year for
non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
"We made a net specific provision... to take account mainly of
four large lendings whose recovery became doubtful," Samuel
Ambundo, the bank's chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He said this despite interest rates of 30-to-40 percent,
caused by high government borrowing through treasury bills. The
high rates are in turn the main reason for the bad loans problem,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Poor supervision of lending is another factor behind defaults.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government fired three directors, the general
manager and the executive chairman of Kenya Commercial Bank, the
country's largest bank, after newspapers reported the directors
and general manager had allowed irregular and unsecured loans.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say commercial banks will struggle to recover the bad
debts currently on their books. But non-performing loans are
unlikely to increase much further because banks are not lending
much money privately.
</P>
<P>
With interest rates on three-month treasury bills around 27
percent, analysts say banks have found it more profitable to lend
to the government in the last nine months, at the expense of
ordinary Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae warned Wednesday that
the country's economic situation was becoming uncontrollable.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Criticized for Remarks on Bankrolling Southeast Asia  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the Taiwan authorities have said time and again that
it does not have any political goal advocating joint efforts with
the mainland, an editorial carried by the Central Daily News of
Taiwan expressed the hope that the mainland should make two
breakthroughs: not to force the Renminbi to retain its value and
not adhere to the traditional concept on sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the advocacy clearly shows that the Taiwan
authorities aim to split the motherland, and does not really
intend to relieve the difficulties of Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The central government has been adhering to the eight-point
proposal set forth by President Jiang Zemin on developing the
relations across the Taiwan Straits and promoting the
reunification of the motherland. And it has been showing sincerity
and flexibility to improve relations.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Taiwan authorities not only obstinately hold
out-of-date views, but also raise new issues hindering the proper
development of cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
The masses of compatriots in Taiwan, especial the figures in
the industrial and business circles, have been calling for direct
shipping, mail and business links between the two sides, only to
be met by indolence on the part of Taiwan authorities. But, on the
other hand, it pretends to be active in assisting Southeast Asian
countries along with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The advocacy of joining hands with the mainland has inevitably
met objections from the central government. In fact, the Central
Daily News pointed out in an editorial that the mainland would not
accept such an advocacy.
</P>
<P>
What the Taiwan authorities do is aimed at making up for its
bad image in delaying cross-Straits political talks and cashing in
on the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
As the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) recently invited the deputy secretary general of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan to the mainland to
exchange views on the proposed mainland tour of SEF Chairman Koo
Chen-fu, the relations across the straits has been inclining to
ease. This has drawn an extensive welcome from the people of
Chinese origin around the world as well as from the international
community, the article says. Moreover, it adds, "We hope that the
Taiwan authorities take positive measures in response to the
mainland's call for political talks instead of going in for
unrealistic "substantial diplomacy."

unidentified gunman, Iraq's Ministry of Awqaf and Religious
Affairs announced.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mohammad Ibrahem al-Brujerdi was shot to death Wednesday

</P>
<P>
Another two men accompanying him were injured, said the

sheikhs in a religion academy in Najaf city, where the holy shrine

<HEADLINE> Philippine Light Rail Workers Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 workers of the
Philippines' Light Rail Transit Trains (LRT) launched a strike
over wage issues Thursday, stranding hundreds of commuters in
metro Manila and nearby suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The LRT is supposed to begin regular operation at 5:00 a.m.,
but because of the strike called by the LRT labor union, the
trains did not operate Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sammy Malones, spokesman of the LRT's striking workers, said
they blocked all gates of LRT's stations in the whole metro Manila
to protest against the employers' non-compliance with the
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
The striking workers are demanding for a 3,500-peso
across-the-board increase in salaries for this year and 3,000
pesos for 1999. They are also seeking a general increase in other
benefits and improvement of working conditions.
</P>
<P>
But Malones said their employers only approved a salary
increase of 1,000 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Moises Tolentino, LRT general manager, said the management will
file a petition for injunction with the labor department to order
the workers to go back to work and declare that the strike is
illegal.
</P>
<P>
If the labor department will order the break-up of the strike,
"the LRT is ready to operate the trains even if the strikers
continue their action outside our premises," Tolentino said.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Construction of Yangtze Transport Routes (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Yangtze, which meanders 6,300 km. through east China,
has grown into a major water transportation channel featuring
numerous high capacity ports. Completion of the massive Three
Gorges Project will enable vessels rated at 10,000 tons to reach
Chongqing in the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Water transportation offers a number advantages over other
forms of transport, including high capacity, low costs and low
energy consumption as well as no demand for the use arable
land. Experts point out that full development of the Yangtze's
cargo transport capacity would equal the total volume for 14
parallel railway lines.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu-Shanghai air route via Chongqing, Wuhan and Nanjing
is one of the busiest routes in the country.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of the route continues to grow along with
construction of Chengdu's Shuangliu Airport, the Tianhe Airport in
Wuhan, Lukou Airport in Nanjing and Pudong Airport in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze passes through economically disadvantaged
southwestern and central regions which the central government has
listed for key development projects, as well as the developed
Yangtze River Delta in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the transport routes will enable the areas
share natural and technological resources, in addition to making
full use of their unique advantages, expanding tourism and creating
conditions for the continuance of China's high economic growth
rate, according to economists.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Concerned with Turkey-Jordan Military Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The rapidly growing military ties
between Turkey and Jordan have prompted serious concern among some
Arab countries, the Daily News reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senior Arab diplomats in Ankara were quoted by the paper as
saying that Arab countries are closely watching the continuing
development of military cooperation between Turkey and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
An Arab ambassador, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that Turkey, together with Israel, are trying to win over Jordan
and include it into their military alliance.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to pull Jordan into these arrangements," he
told the paper. Turkey and Israel have concluded two deals to
enhance military cooperation in defiance of outcry from the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who signed peace with Israel in 1994, is feared by some
Arab countries of being lured into the Turkey-Israel fold, which
is considered a threat to the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan sent a high-ranking observer to a joint naval maneuver
of Turkey, Israel and the United States in January in eastern
Mediterranean. Arab countries were opposed to the war games.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Embassy officials in Ankara declined to comment on
the reported Arab concern.
</P>
<P>
Local reports have said that Jordan and Turkey exchanged troops
early this week for joint training aimed at enhancing coordinated
capabilities of the two armies.

<P>
HANOI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai issued an order to accelerate the renovation of state-run
businesses on april 21, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to improve the national economic situation, Khai asked
government offices and state-run corporations to restructure,
strengthen and reorganize various state businesses. At
present, only 30 percent of them are making profit.
</P>
<P>
Khai said, "Those which are profitable will be given favourable
conditions for further growth. Those that experienced funding
difficulties will be given more finance."
</P>
<P>
In recent year, the Vietnamese government has produced a number
of policies and regulations to improve state-run businesses and
enhance their operation efficiency.
</P>
<P>
However, signs of slowdown could still be seen in state-run
businesses which stop them from achieving their main economic
targets.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Turkey Deal on Anti-Missile System Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel has denied reports that
it signed a memorandum of understanding with Turkey on jointly
developing an anti-ballistic missile defense system, the Jerusalem
Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Israeli government officials as saying that
the two countries did discuss the possibility of cooperation on
developing the defense system during an annual defense meeting
held in Ankara last month.
</P>
<P>
But they said no agreement was signed at the meeting. Turkey
prefers to wait until the Israeli prototype Arrow system, which
is making significant progress, is completed and deployed, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier press reports said that the two sides inked a deal in
March to study the feasibility of developing a Turkish defense
program modeled after the Arrow anti-missile system, which has
been largely financed by Washington since 1988.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen reportedly discussed
the Israeli-Turkish collaboration with his Israeli counterpart
Yitzhak Mordechai during his lastest visit here last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has been closely following the Arrow program while
expressing interests in obtaining technology for intercepting
ballistic missiles, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is reportedly feeling growing pressure of ballistic
missiles from neighboring Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Turkish military ties have been developing rapidly
since they signed a defense cooperation pact in early 1996, which
has provoked widespread criticism from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The pact allowed Israeli fighter pilots to fly training planes
in Turkish air space, as Israel agreed to help upgrade Turkey's
fighters.
</P>
<P>
During the annual defense meeting in March, the two sides
discussed ways of boosting military cooperation, including the
possibility of jointly manufacturing a main battle tank for Turkey
and Israeli sale of airborne early warning systems.

for financial assistance, the Punch paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give the figure expected to be in need for the
planned census.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Population Fund has earlier pledged support
for the exercise, by training personnel and supplying equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1991 census, Nigeria had a population of 88.5
million, the 10th largest in the world at that time. This
accounted for 19.2 percent of the total sub-Saharan population,
with a density of 95.8 persons per sq km.
</P>
<P>
The figures remained valid, the chairman said, adding that it
was not correct that some international agencies projected
Nigeria's population had risen to 120 million.
</P>
<P>
Going by the 1991 census figure, the current population should
be between 107 and 108 million in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's population growth rate now is 2.83 percent annually,
according to him.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Press Expands Coverage on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese press has
significantly expanded its coverage of environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by a nongovernmental environmental
organization shows that China's 76 major newspapers carried an
average of some 300 reports on the environment during 1997, an
increase of 40 reports on 1996 and double the figure for 1995.
</P>
<P>
The reports covered wide-ranging areas from concerns over local
neighborhood pollution to broad ecological issues such as the
world's oceans, endangered species and the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Zang Yuxiang, deputy-director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration's Pollution Control Department, said
that press coverage has promoted China's environmental protection
drive and has led to solutions for a number of difficult problems,
including pollution along the Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens have also recognized the power of the press in
terms of environmental issues. "Reports on the environment have
been carried in newspapers and on radio and TV on almost a daily
basis in recent years," according to Beijing resident Zhao Gengyi.
</P>
<P>
China Central TV (CCTV) is currently televising a series of
programs on interrupted water flow in some sections of the Yellow
River. A number of Beijing newspapers dedicated extensive coverage
to the "dust storm" which blew through the capital last
week. Today's edition of Beijing Youth Daily front-paged three
environmental stories and four photos covering animal protection,
air and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
The press is also focusing on air quality, with numerous
related reports carried by both the regional and national
media. Twenty-four cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing,
announce weekly air quality reports via newspapers, radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
Many Shanghainese consider air quality as an important index
when choosing where to live, with the trend attracting increasing
attention from Beijing citizens.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Monitoring Center publishes weekly
reports on the air quality in 20-plus cities in a number of
national newspapers including the China Daily, Economic Daily and
Legal Daily.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated
Majlis (parliament) has adopted a new law banning medical care
practitioners from servicing people of the other sex.
</P>
<P>
The Jomhuri Islami (Islamic Republic) newspaper reported on
Thursday that the law passed by the Majlis on Wednesday
stipulates that only men can provide medical services to men and
only women can treat other women.
</P>
<P>
This law is in accordance with strict Islamic regulations,
which forbid any physical contact between men and women who are
not related or married, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The law demands all private and public medical institutions,
including hospitals, clinics, laboratories, etc. to respect
Islamic regulations.
</P>
<P>
In any special case which needs medical personnel from other
sex, the law says, a third person from the same sex of the patient
or his or her relative should be present.
</P>
<P>
Any one violating the law will face severe punishments
including fine and closure of medical institution, the daily
said.

<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has Blasted organizers of the World Council of Churches
(WCC) for allowing gays and lesbians to participate in their
conference to be held in Harare from December 3 to 14.
</P>
<P>
In a charged speech during the funeral of the late Herald
Editor Charles Chikerema, President Mugabe said animals in the
jungle were better than gays and lesbians, "because at least they
know that this is a man or a woman."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that homosexualism was not part of Zimbabwean
culture and was not Christianity either, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president also castigated the independent media for
playing in the white's hands.
</P>
<P>
"In Britain, you will never find a paper that speaks badly
against that country. Why then in Zimbabwe do we not adopt a
common ideology," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He praised Chikerema for having worked diligently over the
years in supporting the ideology of the Zimbabwean government.
Chikerema died on Tuesday afternoon at the age of 59.

<HEADLINE> China's Water Resources To Enter International Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's water-resource sector has
great potential to grab a larger share of international markets.
</P>
<P>
China should make full use of its technological and equipment
superiority in the sector, said Zhu Dengquan, vice-minister of
Water Resources in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has five units engaged in developing
international cooperation with overseas investors in
water-resource development. Twelve water-resource companies have
rights to manage import and export businesses by themselves.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China had signed more than 500 cooperative
contracts with overseas partners in water-resource development
involving a combined contractual investment of 1.9 billion
U.S. dollars, according to a report provided by the International
Cooperation Department of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
And project contracts are in the majority, with contractual
funds reaching 1.6 billion U.S. dollars. The value of contract
labor for technical expertise in the water-resource sector was 110
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that China owns world-level advanced
technologies for building dikes and dams. The technologies for
building small-size hydro-power stations and studying silt are
generally acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), China has
succeeded in developing more than 30 items of exported
technologies in the sector, of which several have entered
international markets.
</P>
<P>
China has exported more than 10 water-resource technologies
such as technologies for building small-size hydropower stations
and planting thorn bushes to 32 countries and regions, including
the United States, Japan, Brazil, Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has also exported water-resource equipment such
as small-size hydraulic turbines and hydrologic forecast monitors
to 11 countries, involving a total of 29.7 million U.S. dollars in
contractual funds.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has launched water-resource projects in
Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and North America, valued
at 530 million U.S. dollars of contractual investment.
</P>
<P>
China began such overseas projects in the 1960s, Liu Zhiguang,
a high-ranking ministry official, said, adding that China has
established water-resource cooperative links with more than 60
countries and regions. It has also set up 26 water-resource
offices overseas.
</P>
<P>
However, he said China should make great strides in improving
international cooperation in water-resource development.

<HEADLINE> US Expert's New Approach to Hyacinth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A visiting U.S. Professor
suggested a new approach to deal with water hyacinth, the New
Vision reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Barry Costa-Pierce, a professor in California University and
fellow of the American Institute of Fishery Research, said his
conception is a "cage culture."
</P>
<P>
His conception accepted the weed as a blessing but not a curse
as others considered, Costa said.
</P>
<P>
"My vision is one of community development," he said, adding
that the weed can be developed into feed in an industrial scale.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborated.
</P>
<P>
The rampantly growing weed is imposing a serious environmental
problem to Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania as it suffocates water
organisms in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Most experts suggested to spray chemicals to eradicate the
weed.
</P>
<P>
But local environmentalists argued that the chemicals may
cause other environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
After all, the weed has little possibility of being completely
eradicated, the professor noted.
</P>
<P>
Costa had worked in Malawi and Indonesia before as an
aqua-cultural specialist.
</P>
<P>
The specialist will meet local experts in the National
Environment Management Authority and Makerere University, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Costa also suggested Uganda should develop "cage culture"
industry in local waters to produce Nile Tilapia.
</P>
<P>
Nile Tilapia is one of the staple fishes in the country. But
it failed to find its way into the markets in Europe, the main
market for Ugandan fish products.
</P>
<P>
There is a very large market in the United States for Uganda's
Tilapia, Costa said.

<HEADLINE> 1.3M Kenyan Children Denied Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.3 million eligible
children are out of school in Kenya due to poverty, inadequate
financial resources and other socio-economic problems, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said in Durban,
South Africa Wednesday that the figure is likely to increase to
4.4 million by the turn of the century as the school dropout rate
continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
"In view of this, current government efforts are geared toward
enhancing access and equity at all levels," he said at a
week-long U.N.-sponsored caucus which brings together African
education ministers.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka said the focus was now on closing gender gaps in the
provision of education by initiating concrete intervention
measures to improve the enrolment of girls and sustain their
participation in the school system.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government had introduced bursaries and subsidies
to assist children from poor families especially girls, to get
access to education, he said.
</P>
<P>
Plans were underway to increase the number of women teachers,
particularly in science and technology, to popularize the
subjects among female learners, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern over the crises affecting higher
education in Africa, saying the institutions suffered low
financial support, lack of learning and teaching facilities and
high student enrolment.

<HEADLINE> Infectious Disease Cases Rising in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health has
reported a rise in the incidence of infectious diseases, saying
that hepatitis, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)
and AIDS are afflicting more Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Viruses infected about 192 of every 100,000 Chinese last year,
compared with 167 of every 100,000 people in 1996, the ministry
announced today in a statistical report.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of hepatitis, gonorrhea and measles rose over
1996 while that of dysentery and typhoid fever declined.
</P>
<P>
However, the mortality rate as a result of infectious diseases
was fairly low compared with non-infectious diseases such as
cancer and heart attacks, the report said. About 33 of every 10
million people died of infectious diseases last year.
</P>
<P>
"China has built a nationwide network which can effectively
monitor, report and control infectious diseases. A national
immunization project for children also helped control polio,
diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Health officials admit that some infectious diseases which had
been well-controlled in China are forming new epidemics such as
tuberculosis and STDs.
</P>
<P>
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been emerging as
a new public health problem in China as a result of drug abuse and
the STD epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of AIDS, which affected one of every 10 million
Chinese last year, was thought far less than a true number
"because lots of cases were hidden," according to some AIDS
experts.
</P>
<P>
These experts believe China has had at least 150,000 to 200,000
people infected by the AIDS virus, despite the 8,303 cases that
were reported by the Ministry of Health last year.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Rampant in Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS pandemic has reached
"crisis proportions" in Malawi and half of skilled workers in the
country may die of the disease within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Thursday quoted a report on an AIDS
assessment study released last week in Malawi as saying that more
than 50 percent of skilled workers in Malawi may die of AIDS
within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
This has aroused fears in both official and public circles
that the country will lose much of its needed skilled personnel.
</P>
<P>
"For Malawians, the risk of HIV infection can be almost
entirely attributed to unprotected intercourse with an infected
partner," says the World Bank funded report.
</P>
<P>
However, the majority of sexually active Malawians -- the most
vulnerable group, scorn the use of condoms, says the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that base-line data about truck drivers indicate that
multiple partners are common and condom use is below 50 percent.
And the military is hesitant to monitor HIV prevalence for
security reasons, but in 1991, about 62 percent of blood donors
from the armed forces were HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
Random interviews conducted in the country's urban areas
indicate that many people in the sexually active group have a
negative attitude regarding condom use.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that AIDS deaths will be the single
largest determinant of life expectancy in Malawi and that a
projected life expectancy of 57.4 years by 2010 is expected to
decrease by more than 13 years due to AIDS alone.
</P>
<P>
Other statistics indicate that the clinical burden of AIDS
will increase markedly and the epidemic may peak at about 70,000
cases per year during the middle of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Further, states the assessment, current HIV/AIDS prevalence
levels cause grave concern for the future development of Malawi.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of Industry
and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira has praised the quality and
diversity of products being shown by local exhibitors at this
year's Zimbabwe international trade fair.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a press conference Wednesday after
touring a number of local stands at the fair which began Tuesday
and will officially open Friday in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city.
</P>
<P>
''I am happy to say that I was impressed by the quality and
diversity of exhibits. Most of the products by local companies
are locally manufactured,'' the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, he was concerned that local manufacturers continued
to rely heavily on imported raw materials to produce their goods.
He urged the manufacturers to use local resources and add more
value to their products.
</P>
<P>
The minister was also pleased with the level of foreign
participation at the fair. A total of 35 countries are exhibiting
at the fair including five new ones, namely Argentina, Singapore,
Syria, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. A big
group of companies from Italy, the U.S. and Germany are
displaying their products at the fair.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Province Reverses Economic Downward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province, the
country's largest economic zone, has reversed a downward trend in
economic growth, according to acting governor Wang Xiaofeng.
</P>
<P>
The last five years marked the greatest fluctuation in the
economic growth of Hainan, which was part of Guangdong Province
before being turned into a province and special economic zone 10
years ago, Wang said today at a meeting of the provincial People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by a red-hot real estate market, Hainan reported
extraordinary economic growth between 1992 and 1994, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
However, Hainan's economic growth rate was lower than the
national average for the next three years as the central
authorities increased macro-economic control.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic growth rate was 4.8 percent in 1996 and 6.7
percent in 1997, and this indicates that our economy has bottomed
out and begun to pick up again," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Hainan's industrial incremental
value rose from 2.04 billion yuan in 1992 to 5.13 billion yuan in
1997, up an average of 11.3 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's gross domestic product is expected to grow an average
of more than 8 percent in the next five years, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Hainan will continue to follow its industrial
revitalization plan and has set its industrial growth rate at 12
percent for the next five years. The rate is about 4-to-5 percent
higher than that for agriculture and the service industry.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth accomplishment of its industrial goals,
Hainan will beef up its effort to develop industries such as
chemicals, building materials, foodstuffs, medicine, electronics,
machinery and information, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Hainan will also continue to follow a policy of opening-up,
with particular emphasis placed on expanding its commodity and
service trade, improving the investment environment, and building
several export-oriented industrial development zones, he added.

<HEADLINE> Graft, High Rates in Kenya Worry British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Minister of State for
Trade and Industry Barbara Roche said British business people
were concerned about corruption and high interest rate in Kenya's
money market.
</P>
<P>
Although British investors were keen to invest in Kenya, they
were also concerned about insecurity and the recession in the
economy, she said after meeting with Kenyan Minister for
Industrial Development Francis Masakhalia Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Britain's investment in Kenya fell to 23 million Pounds
between 1996-1997, from 50 million Pounds in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Roche said Kenya has great potential especially in the area of
small scale enterprises, but the atmosphere at the moment was
unfriendly, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the crime and high interest rates, investors were
also concerned about the tattered infrastructure in this east
African country, she noted.
</P>
<P>
British investors, Roche added, want all the problems that
could hamper the success of their businesses addressed as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The British government was also interested in the
liberalization process being undertaken by the Kenyan government,
she said.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Masakhalia said the Kenyan government was committed
to revamping the economy and appealed to trading partners like
Britain for support.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and Britain enjoy cordial relationship but the trade

Pounds) from Britain and exported goods worth 15 billion
Shillings (150.3 million Pounds) to the country last year.

TIANJIN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade volume for the

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Calls For Closer Sino-Japanese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao said here Thursday that his current visit is aimed at
bringing a closer Sino-Japanese relationship forward into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception hosted in his honor by seven Japanese
organizations for promoting Japan-China friendship, Hu said that
the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations 26 years ago and the
Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty signed 20 years ago have
laid a solid foundation for the two nations to maintain and
advance friendship.
</P>
<P>
Hu said for many years the two countries and their peoples have
worked hard to promote cooperation in economy, trade, science and
technology and culture and have scored marked achievements.
</P>
<P>
He said that both China and Japan as important countries in
Asia and the world should consider in real earnest the question of
developing their good-neighborly ties so as to build lasting
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the Chinese people, once subject to grave humiliation
by foreign aggressors, cherish very much their hard-won national
independence.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable progress in various fields since it
adopted the policy of reform and opening-up 20 years ago.
However, Hu said, China has still to battle a hard battle to
achieve comprehensive modernization.
</P>
<P>
Hu said China will continue to follow the path designated by
the late leader Deng Xiaoping and endeavor to push forward its
drive of reform, opening-up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's independent foreign policy of peace, Hu
said that China will continue to build and develop friendly and
cooperative ties with all other nations on the basis of Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence, and strive for a peaceful and
stable international environment, particularly a favorable
environment.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that China will never seek hegemonism even after it
becomes a developed nation in the future. He said China will
always stand as a strong force in maintaining regional and global
peace and stability, a solemn commitment of the Chinese
people to the world.
</P>
<P>
Japan opted for the road of peaceful development after the end
of World War II, and its international status has obviously
improved with remarkable economic achievements, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China hopes Japan would learn lessons from
history, continue to be on the road of peaceful development and
play a more positive role in promoting international economic
cooperation and maintaining world peace.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Japanese relations constitute an important part of the
present international relations, Hu noted. As two important
members of the international community, China and Japan shoulder
great responsibility for strengthening international cooperation,
promoting joint development, maintaining peace and stability in
Asia and the world as a whole, and pushing for the establishment
of a just and rational international political and economic order,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The state of Sino-Japanese relations in the 21st century will
have impact not only on the fundamental interests of the two
countries and their peoples, but also on the healthy development
of the overall international relations, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government have
always been handling Sino-Japanese ties from a realistic,
long-term point of view, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan should adhere to the principles and spirit set
in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and Sino-Japanese Peace and
Friendship Treaty, boost dialogue, deepen mutual understanding,
respect each other and not interfere in each other's internal
affairs, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the two countries should seek more common ground
while reserving differences, handle differences properly, promote
mutually beneficial economic cooperation and establish lasting
friendly ties for the future.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Sino-Japanese relationship should become an
example of good-neighborliness for countries with different social
and political systems.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries should be partners of
development on the basis of equality and mutual benefits in
economy, be friends who learn from each other in culture, science
and technology, and be positive forces which maintain world peace
and promote common development of the world.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed his belief that Sino-Japanese ties will have a
better future in the next century as more and more of the
younger generation in the two countries will devote themselves to
promoting friendly bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> FAO Regional Ministerial Meeting Starts in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A two-day ministerial meeting of
the 24th Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional
Conference for Asia and the Pacific commenced here Thursday
following a three-day senior officials meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting is scheduled to further discuss food
security, follow-ups to the World Food Summit, and management and
conservation of fisheries resources.
</P>
<P>
First Secretary of Myanmar State Peace and development Council
lieutenant-general Khin Nyunt made an inaugural speech at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conference will be a success and able to
provide meaningful inputs to the food security of not only this
region but also the world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Myanmar and many other countries in the region
need a favorable economic environment.
</P>
<P>
He said for developing countries, a favorable economic
environment would mean a respite from the external debt burden and
debts overhung, remunerative prices for their agricultural
products, greater investment and aid to the agricultural sector,
enhanced assistance from organizations like the FAO in fishery,
forestry and agriculture, greater cooperation between the
countries of the region and the agencies and organizations of the
United Nations and the FAO.
</P>
<P>
The just-ended senior officials meeting of the conference
called for urgent actions to promote fisheries and sustainable
development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that greater attention should be paid to
fisheries management and international cooperation and
coordination strengthened in fisheries conservation and management
in the region.

<HEADLINE> Machinery, Electric Product Exports to Hit 67 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's exports of machinery and
electric products will hit 67 billion U.S. dollars this year,
up 10 percent over last year, according to industry officials.
</P>
<P>
Industry exports have maintained their momentum despite
pressures from the Southeast Asian financial crisis, according to
Tang Zhongwen, chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce for
Import and Export of Machinery and Electronics Products.
</P>
<P>
The industry's exports were valued at 8.75 billion U.S. dollars
from January to February, up 2.22 billion US dollars for a 33.2
percent increase over the same period last year. Statistics show
that the industry's export growth to the European Union (EU) was
65 percent; Latin America, 56 percent; and Africa, 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has had a negative impact on
exports, but the industry's sales to Southeast Asian countries
only accounts for 8 percent of China's total exports of machinery
and electric products. Industry growth to the EU and other areas
has offset the impact of the Asian financial crisis, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
However, industry exports still face a severe challenge from the
Republic of Korea (ROK) and other countries.
</P>
<P>
ROK increased its exports because of the devaluation of its
currency and support by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
intensifying competition with China in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ROK's import demand decreased sharply because of its
economic difficulties. Statistics show that China's exports of
machinery and electric products dropped 22.4 percent in the
January-February period.
</P>
<P>
To meet the industry's goal of a 10 percent increase this
year, the mix of exports will turn to technology-intensive
products with high added value from labor-intensive, primary
processing of products.
</P>
<P>
China also expects to develop existing markets, including the
EU, and plans to carry out a strategy of developing well-known and
quality products and further exploring markets in Africa and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
The machinery and electric industry has led China in exports
for three consecutive years. Exports reached 59.32 billion
U.S. dollars last year, accounting for 32.5 percent of China's
total exports.

<HEADLINE> Hu: Trade, Important Pillar in Sino-Japanese Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 23 (Xinhua)-- Bilateral trade ties are an
important pillar for enhancing Sino-Japanese friendly relations,
visiting Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hu made this remark during a meeting with Yoshio Sakurauchi,
President of Japan's Association for International Trade Promotion.

two countries to bring the friendly ties into the next century, Hu

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sets Allocation to Tackle Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government has
agreed to allocate 30 million ringgit (8.108 million U.S. dollars)
to deal with the millennium bug problem in the government sector
despite the economic downturn, Energy, Telecommunications and
Posts Minister Leo Moggie said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Several measures have been taken by the government to tackle
the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem, including the establishment of a
national Y2K hearing committee which consists of umbrella agencies
from both the public and private sectors, he said at the national
workshop on "Y2K Problem."
</P>
<P>
He said the committee would have its first meeting Friday at
his ministry to plan, coordinate and report back to the government
on the measures that have been taken by all sections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Y2K website was also launched Thursday and would
be the convergent point for solution providers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
"A Y2K project team has been established to guide, facilitate
and monitor actions taken by the government sector and to maintain
the website," Moggie said, adding the project team, which would
also maintain a registry of Y2K-compliance companies, was expected
to start operation on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Moggie said that the government had also taken further
initiatives by adopting the "Shell Year 2000 Survival Action Guide
and IBM Adjustment 2000" as measures to help companies assess and
identify the extent of the problem which they could face through
the Y2K website.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is also focusing on creating awareness,
providing guidance and avenues for consultation on the millennium
bug problem and coordinating action plans which need to be taken
by private sector agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem is expected to occur because programs and
electronic devices or computer chips, for example, use the digits
"00" to represent the year 2000, the same number that represents
the year 1900 in the two-digit system.

<HEADLINE> New Technique To Help Curb White Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- An assembly line to produce
biodegradeable food containers using corn as the raw material will
be built in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang Luhuan Biodegrading Technique Development
Corp. announced its plans at the ongoing Agro Expo China '98 in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shenyang firm, the containers degrade 60 days
after being discarded. They can also be used as fertilizer or as
fodder for cattle.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the new technique from Germany will play an
important role in curbing China's white pollution.
</P>
<P>
Food containers made of plastic foam, which take a long time to
disintegrate, are the main cause of white pollution.
</P>
<P>
China now produces more than six million tons of plastic
products and discards one million tons as waste every year. Only
300,000 tons were recycled.
</P>
<P>
Facing a serious pollution problem, China's large cities --
such as Dalian, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou -- have
announced a ban on the use of plastic bags or plastic-foam food
containers.
</P>
<P>
China's experts and plastic producers have tried their best to
find a new and environmentally friendly replacement. In addition
to paper food containers, Shanghai is now producing food
containers with vegetable fiber such as rice straw, wheat straw
and sugar-cane residue.
</P>
<P>
China's markets need 10 billion food containers every year, and
the output of environmentally friendly ones is only 1.5 billion,
according to a survey by the previous Ministry of Light Industry.

<HEADLINE> Food Yield Fall Hampers Kenya's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is worried
about the continued decline in agriculture, a critical factor to
this east African country's industrialization process, the East
African Standard reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi Wednesday cited a slump
in coffee and tea production as further proof that the situation
needs immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture's growth played a major role if Kenya is to
industrialize, he said, calling for urgent remedial measures to
reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government should act fast and put agricultural
sector on a faster growth path, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is an agricultural country and agricultural growth
should be realized to trigger off the industrialization," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We should revamp virtually all the agricultural sub-sectors
such as coffee, cereal, dairy, cotton, pyrethrum, tea, sugar
cane, horticultural exports and others which have recorded a
decreased output in the recent past," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture makes up directly approximately 25 percent of the
gross domestic product in Kenya which has targeted to have itself
industrialized before 2020.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has ordered a study
on storing vaccines, antidotes and antibiotics to deal with any
chemical and biological warfare against U.S. cities, Attorney
General Janet Reno said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Those medications would be strategically placed throughout the
country under a procedure that would maintain the shelf life of
stockpiles and would facilitate their prompt availability in the
event of a major chemical or biological incident," Reno told a
Senate hearing. The administration was considering launching a
research and development program with industry and academic
experts to deal with new, genetically altered pathogens, or
bio-engineered germs, she added. (U.S.-Biochemical Attack)

<HEADLINE> Large Painting by Fu Baoshi to Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A large landscape painting by Fu
Baoshi (1904-1965), whose previous work garnered the highest bid
in history for a modern Chinese painting, will be auctioned in
Beijing in early May.
</P>
<P>
The painting, the largest work thus far offered in a Chinese
auction, measures 3.26 meters by 2.43 meters. The work depicts
Mount Zijin and Xuanwu Lake, the symbols of Nanjing which was the
seat of the central government under the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The painting, entitled "The Tiger Girt with Dragon
Outshines Days Gone By", was named in honor of a line of
poetry Chairman Mao Zedong penned to mark his army's successful
1948 effort to take Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Fu completed the work in 1960 as an expression of his idea of
"outshining days gone by", according to his son Fu Ershi.
</P>
<P>
Fu Baoshi perceived "outshining" as heavy smoke pouring
from chimneys, or the Chinese concept of modernization in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
The chimneys outshine a distant backdrop of green mountain and
a lake surrounded by willows, according to local collectors.
</P>
<P>
The painting is expected to sell for between 4-5 million yuan,
a price much lower than the record lot entitled Ode of the
Beauties went for 10.78 million yuan. Last Autumn's auction was
handled by the China Guardian Auction Co. Limited.
</P>
<P>
The large painting is part of 2,800 piece lot valued at an
estimated 80 million yuan. Guardian will hold this year's Spring
Sale from May 5-11.
</P>
<P>
The six categories of lots will be: Chinese paintings, oil
paintings, sculptures, curios, jewellery, and stamps and coins.
</P>
<P>
Guardian was China's first auctioneer of art objects and will
celebrate its 5th anniversary on May 18. In the past five years,
it has held eight sales with over 10,000 pieces of art, with 450
million yuan in sales.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Vajpayee Government Faces Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Since the swearing-in ceremony
here on March 19, two Union cabinet ministers of the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP)-led government have resigned or been sacked due
to corruption cases and more tainted ministers are expected to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Corruption cases and infighting among the BJP coalition
partners have become big hurdles and challenges for the fledgling
Vajpayee government to deal with.
</P>
<P>
A city court in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu in southern
India, framed charges against Union Surface Transport Minister R.
Muthiah and his whole family members on April 7 after finding
prima facie evidence against them in a case pertaining to
accumulation of disproportionate assets worth 4.57 million rupees
(0.119 million U.S. dollars). Muthiah resigned the following day.
</P>
<P>
Union Telecommunication Minister Buta Singh was sacked by Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on April 20 due to his involvement
in bribery case of MPs in 1993 to save the minority Congress
government headed by P. V. Narasimha Rao as well as the pressure
from BJP's major ally All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
(AIADMK).
</P>
<P>
In her letter to Vajpayee on April 18, AIADMK supremo
Jayalalitha asked the prime minister to drop tainted
Telecommunication Minister Buta Singh, Urban Development Minister
Ram Jethmalani and Commerce Minister Ramkrishna Hedge, who have
time and again criticized her during the infighting among the
BJP's coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Buta Singh has further sharpened the
differences and disputes among the partners. In his press
conference shortly after he was sacked from the cabinet on April
20, Buta Singh accused the prime minister of betraying him and
protecting other tainted persons. He said he decided to withdraw
his support to the BJP government and form a new party.
</P>
<P>
Ram Jethmalani has not made public his reply letter to the
prime minister for the comment on Jayalalitha's demand for his
resignation so far. Ramkrishna Hedge Wednesday said that he
favored the BJP-led government at the center seeking a fresh
mandate from the people instead of succumbing to the blackmail
tactics by the AIADMK.
</P>
<P>
On Jayalalitha's demand for his resignation, Hedge said, "The
charges have been repeated one million times. I have never been
asked to resign in my life. If necessary, I will resign myself."
</P>
<P>
In order to solve differences among BJP allies, some members
have proposed to set up a coordination committee holding regular
meetings to discuss various problems and disputed issues. The
AIADMK leader is opposed to setting up of such coordination
committee, which plans to hold its first meeting here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule announced by official sources, the
BJP-led government will table regular budget for 1998-99 and
several important bills to Parliament when it is convened in the
last week of May. The government is expected to face another acid
test during the forthcoming Parliament session.

<HEADLINE> Economics, Coop Dominate Mkapa's Visit to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Economic progress, cooperation
and building a free and prosperous Africa are the dominant themes
being developed in the state visit of President Benjamin Mkapa of
Tanzania, ''the Herald'' daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The comments were made after Mkapa arrived in Harare Wednesday
on his four-day state visit to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and their
delegations spent most of the first day of the visit in
discussing matters of mutual concern, with economics at the
forefront, said the report.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to widen the scope of relations on the economic
front.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told journalists that his talks with Mkapa also focused
on regional peace and stability and economic integration within
the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
''We also discussed the Great Lakes, and Comoros issue on how
to bring the two sides together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made a special appeal for assistance as Tanzania faces
the loss of about a quarter of the harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino phenomenon is wreaking havoc in Tanzania and the
country will have to rely on the goodwill of regional neighbors
and the international community at large to meet a food deficit.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told Mugabe that his country was facing a crisis and
would be looking outside its borders for assistance to feed
thousands of people who were facing starvation.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said food aid to Tanzania would form part of a bulk
bilateral cooperation arrangement to be agreed by the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The themes of economic cooperation, and the building up of
Africa using this cooperation, dominated the addresses the two
presidents made Wednesday night at a state banquet hosted by
Mugabe for Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
They stressed as development challenges were faced, political
stability, national unity and concord, regional peace and
security had to be maintained.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Opens Special Courts to Recover Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has opened two special
courts to revive its financial sector which has been seriously hit
by bank loan defaulters, English newspapers here reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Based in Dhaka and Chittagong respectively, the Bankruptcy
Court and Financial Court started functioning after a ceremony
held in Dhaka on Wednesday and attended by Bangladeshi Law
Minister Abdul Matin Khasru and Bangladesh Bank (central bank)
Governor Lutfar Rahman Sarkar.
</P>
<P>
The Bankruptcy Court is the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 nearly 64,000 cases have been filed with the
financial loan courts, of which 15,637 had been disposed of, the
central bank governor said at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that there are 48,363 cases still pending with the
financial loan courts while 1,000 new cases are being filed every
three months.
</P>
<P>
By December 1997, defaulted loans had amounted to 136.18
billion taka (about 2.96 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 35
percent of the total loans of 402.63 billion taka (about 8.75
billion dollars), he stated.
</P>
<P>
It becomes impossible to recover the overdue loans due to the
loopholes in the law and lack of law enforcement, Sarkar added.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the two courts would be able to realize the
overdue loans through speedy trials.
</P>
<P>
"Stern action will be taken against the bank loan defaulters to
revive the banking sector," the law minister said, adding, "We
must be harsh against the willful defaulters as people of the
country are being deprived of proper banking services."
</P>
<P>
A number of bank and government officials were also involved in
the default culture, he said. "They should be singled out as the
nation wants to get rid of them."
</P>
<P>
Though the percentage of corrupt officials is "microscopic," it
is due to them that "the banking sector has been mismanaged," he
said. The nation's existence would be in "difficulty" "if the
situation continues to prevail," he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A virus flu has hit Sri Lanka
hard and the country's hospitals are overflowing with patients
suffering from it, according to Medical research Institute (MRI)
sources here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients at the Colombo National Hospital and Sri
Jayawardenapura Hospital in Colombo has increased from 200 to 700
every day. Many area hospitals in the country are full of patients
and 17 children have died in the past few days, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The virus has affected both adults and children alike.
</P>
<P>
However, the medical authorities have been unable to identify
the virus. The MRI has started investigations into the epidemic
and will try to find out how this virus spreads, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors are of the opinion that the virus may be a
combination of two or more varieties.
</P>
<P>
According to hospital sources, the symptoms of the virus flu
are high fever, cough, vomiting, stomachache and liver problems.
</P>
<P>
However, some doctors believe that the virus is actually a
common influenza but people seek medical treatment fearing it is
deadly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks to Exempt Montenegro From Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
promised to try to shield Montenegro from any further sanctions
against Yugoslavia for its defiance of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"We will be sensitive to the needs of Montenegro," Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright told reporters before talks with Milo
Djukanovic, president of Montenegro which is part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Albright praised Djukanovic for "an ability to see the
possibility for political dialogue and a different sense of
direction for the people" in the region.
</P>
<P>
Washington was already giving Montenegro aid worth 5.9
million U.S. dollars, said Albright, adding that expanded aid
programs would be included in talks with Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Djukanovic, who defeated a Milosevic protege,
Momir Bulatovic, in elections last October, told reporters he
neither wants independence for Kosovo, nor favors the status quo
in the province.
</P>
<P>
"A dialogue must start in Kosovo, and it is our opinion that
this dialogue must involve the presence of a third party," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in February when conflict erupted between
Yugoslavian authorities and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians who wanted
independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia stripped Kosovo of its autonomy 1990, angering
Albanians who make up 90 percent of the population in the
province, and strongly opposed any external meddling in the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
Major powers have already imposed some sanctions on Yugoslavia
due to its strong-arm approach to the ethnic Albanians, and have
given Belgrade until Saturday to start talks with the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Next week, diplomats from the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Russia and Italy are meeting in Rome to consider whether
to apply pressure on Belgrade on behalf of Kosovo's Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Djukanovic also ruled out the possibility that Montenegro seeks
independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the citizens of Montenegro wish to live in a
federation with Serbia," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Greek President Constantine
Karamanlis died earlier Thursday of natural causes. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
Karamanlis, who was hospitalized with a lung infection on April
7, suffered a sudden relapse and died without recovering
consciousness at 1:40 A.M. local time, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Karamanlis, who founded Greece's New Democracy Party (ND),
served as the country's prime minister four times and was twice
head of state.
</P>
<P>
He ordered a referendum in 1974 in which most people voted for
the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a
presidential republic in its stead.
</P>
<P>
Karamanlis, who was born in 1907 in Proti near Serres, northern
Greece, was elected to the Greek Parliament for the first time in
1935 as an MP for the Peoples Party from the Serres region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Thursday, Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis praised Karamanlis for the leading role he had played in
Greece's bloodless transition from dictatorship to democracy and
the tireless efforts he had made in guiding Greece to the European
Union.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay's Colorado Party Demands Election Postponement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2,000 public
employees demonstrated in Paraguay's capital city of Asuncion on
Wednesday demanding that presidential elections scheduled for May
10 be postponed, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators -- all supporters of the Colorado Party --
demanded elections be postponed for 45 days, and threatened to go
on strike if the country's electoral court did not approve the
request.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Vicente Sarubbi and Minister of Defense
Hugo Estigarribia also participated in the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Only four days ago, the electoral court named Raul Cubas,
Colorado vice presidential candidate, to replace former general
Lino Oviedo as presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo, who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for
an attempted military coup in 1996, was banned from taking part in
the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Colorado Party has been pressing for a postponement of the
elections saying that the party's new presidential candidate needs
more time to prepare for the poll.
</P>
<P>
According to private surveys, Cubas, 54, is lagging 15
percentage points behind the opposition candidate.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has ordered a study on storing vaccines, antidotes and antibiotics
to deal with any chemical and biological warfare against U.S.
cities, Attorney General Janet Reno said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Those medications would be strategically placed throughout the
country under a procedure that would maintain the shelf life of
stockpiles and would facilitate their prompt availability in the
event of a major chemical or biological incident," Reno told a
Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
She said the administration was considering launching a
research and development program with industry and academic
experts to deal with new, genetically altered pathogens, or
bio-engineered germs.
</P>
<P>
The administration was also considering relocating the nation's
laboratories in a strategic way so that they could quickly
identify any chemical or biological warfare agent, she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the potential consequences of chemical or
biological attacks could be "even more catastrophic" than the
terrorist attacks against the United States in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
She mentioned the bombings of New York's World Trade Center in
1993, Oklahoma City's federal building in 1995, and Saudi Arabia's
Khobar Towers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
She said the administration would work closely with the Energy
Department's national laboratories, academic experts and private
industry to address the threat.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs Big Money for Health Care After Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's East Kalimantan needs
7.2 billion rupiah (about 930,000 U.S. dollars) to provide
medicines, infusions and radiological equipment to handle health
problems caused by forest fires in the province, a local official
said.
</P>
<P>
Data collected by provincial inventory teams showed that East
Kalimantan needs such a big amount to help people suffering from
respiratory problems, pneumonia, eye irritation and diarrhea, HA.
Waris Husien, an official of social affairs, said on Wednesday in
the provincial capital of Samarinda, according to reports reaching
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires have since January swept through about 400,000
hectares of area in East Kalimantan, causing a financial loss of
about 7.5 trillion rupiah (938 million dollars) and health
problems to the people there.
</P>
<P>
At least 4,000 people in the province are now suffering from
respiratory problems, 3,000 from diarrhea, 10 of whom already died
-- and thousands of others from pneumonia and eye irritation.
</P>
<P>
East Kalimantan is predicted to experience the worst
forest/land fires in 15 years. In 1982/83 the province was
estimated to suffer the biggest damage in the world from
forest/land fires by losing 3.6 million hectares, official sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Fires still break out in some parts of the province, especially
around the Bukit Soeharto conservation area and Kutai National
Park. About 538 hot spots have been spread out in Samarinda,
Balikpapan and Kutai.

<HEADLINE> China Revises Amounts for Legal Determinations of Larceny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China recently increased the
amount required for a legal determination of larceny from at least
300 yuan (27 U.S. dollars) to 500 yuan (about 60 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a document issued jointly by the Supreme People's Court, the
Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public
Security, this readjustment was explained as fitting the change in
China's economic and social conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to this document, the starting point qualifying "a
relatively large amount of stealing" is 500-to-2,000 yuan (60 to
250 U.S. dollars); for "a huge amount of stealing," it is
5,000-to-20,000 yuan (600 to 2,500 U.S. dollars); for "an
extremely large amount of stealing," it is 30,000 to 100,000 yuan
(3,750 to 12,500 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The document states that -- within the listed ranges of
starting points -- each province, autonomous region and
municipality can set its own detailed standard for larceny.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, the amount stolen is an important
factor for establishing the penalty.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Procuratorate recently issued a notice
asking procuratorates at all levels to make a serious
self-examination to avoid abuses of power and to execute the law
more strictly.

NANJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Nantong, a coastal city in east
China's Jiangsu Province, earned more than 1.2 billion US dollars
from exporting agricultural and side-line produce in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The province's success should be attributed to rapid progress
in the city's comprehensive development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city established a group of production
centers for cotton and vegetables, raising lean-type pigs and
developing aquatic products, which are exported to almost 100
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the city have also made a greater effort to improve
low- and medium-yielding fields as well as growing vegetables and
trees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they have made full use of tidal flats and developed
10 export-oriented producing centers which are engaged in
producing organic food products.
</P>
<P>
To increase exports of farm produce, the city has attracted
funds from the Netherland, Japan and the Taiwan region.

<HEADLINE> ADB Says Asian Financial Crisis Affecting World Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Asian economies will experience
further slowdowns in growth rates in 1998 due to the financial
turmoil, while the outlook for the global economy this year will
depend on a satisfactory response to the crisis, the Asian
Development Bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook--1998" released here, the
Manila-based bank said the Asian financial crisis would cause a
slowdown in world growth by about one percentage point in 1998,
and in trade by about half a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
In Asia last year, the report said, the crisis contributed to a
further slowdown in the growth rate to 6.1 percent, and the rate
is projected to be about 4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of the People's Republic of China and its
currency will become the anchor for regional economic stability in
1998," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that despite the Asian financial crisis that
began in last July, the growth of the world economy was strong at
3.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was not only a higher rate than in 1996, but also exceeded
the average for the preceding five years by 0.9 percentage point,
it said.
</P>
<P>
"Continued solid growth in the United Kingdom and the United
States underpinned this favorable economic performance, which was
aided by a strong recovery in Canada and a gradual revival of
economic activity in continental Europe," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The world trade grew exceptionally rapidly in 1994 and 1995,
slowed down in 1996, but rebounded in 1997 to 9 percent because of
a recovery in trade among the countries of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
While the industrial economies experienced uninterrupted growth
with modest inflation, the bank said, several Southeast Asian
economies went through an unprecedented, cataclysmic financial
crisis last year.
</P>
<P>
"Unless these countries manage to resolve the crisis, its
adverse effects will spill over not only to other Asian economies,
but also to other regions, undermining the industrial economies'
current robust performance," it warned.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said, dealing with such crisis successfully
is beyond the capacity of any individual country, and requires a
coordinated effort that involves the major industrial economies
and the international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the Asian financial crisis is already affecting
private debt repayments to the industrial economies, as Asian
companies and plant projects canceled or postponed a number of
payments due in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Export growth in industrial countries will fall in 1998, partly
because of the collapse of purchasing power in the Southeast Asian
economies, and partly because of increased competitiveness from
Asian exports, especially from South Korea, as a result of the
large currency depreciations in the region, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said that a substantial redirection of trade flows is
likely to occur in 1998, and thus the trade deficit with Asia is
expected to narrow from about 42 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 to
less than 10 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the crisis on the growth rate of industrial
countries, the bank said the output of the 29 OECD economies grew
by 3 percent last year, the highest rate since 1989, but the Asian
crisis will cause a fall of 0.6 percentage points in output and
0.5 percent in export growth in the OECD countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the Asian crisis will also affect
economic growth in Africa and Latin America this year.
</P>
<P>
"The recent financial crisis in Asia will have repercussions
for Africa's growth in 1998, especially as those Asian countries
have become some of Africa's fastest growing trading partners," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said East and Southeast Asian currency depreciations
are projected to have an impact on the Latin American region,
which is likely to lose export competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> ADB Warns of Risks, Uncertainties for World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
warned Thursday that failure to address the Asian financial crisis
will not only exacerbate Southeast Asia and South Korea's economic
problems, but will also further undermine the growth momentum in
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In a report, "Asian Development Outlook--1998," which was
released here, the ADB said the on-going financial crisis in
Southeast Asia and South Korea has left these economies in
disarray and "the most important policy challenge for the world
economic community is to devise a satisfactory response.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the bank said, the crisis is already projected to slow
the growth of the United States, the European Union and the OECD
(Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development) countries
by 1 percentage point and of Japan by 1.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
A full commitment to economic and policy reform is a
prerequisite for early recovery and sustained future growth of the
afflicted Asian economies, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The measures these governments, particularly those of
Indonesia and (South) Korea, take in 1998 to deal with the private
sector's maturing large external debt will inevitably determine
these economies performance," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said risks exist not only with respect to the East and
Southeast Asian economies, but also with respect to other Asian
countries that are not directly affected by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
These economies, such as those in South Asia and the Central
Asian republics, are at various stages of economic reform process,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Uncertainties remain about the level of commitment and
implementation and about the speed with which these economies will
respond to the reform program," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the stability of the Chinese renminbi and the
Hong Kong dollar will remain "an important factor in the region's
economic stability."
</P>
<P>
Uncertainties also exist with respect to further liberalization
of the world trading environment, which is an important
determinant of the dynamics of the global economy, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of difficulties facing Asian currency and financial
markets, the bank said, the World Trade Organization agenda to
liberalize trade in financial services will pose a challenge in
1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is a double-edged sword. It has brought with it
many economic benefits in the form of increased competition and
more efficient allocation of resources," it said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, however, the resulting high mobility of
short-term capital can quickly cause major financial problems for
any country that international markets perceive as having major
policy shortcomings," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB also said that an important "exogenous" source of
uncertainty is climatic, as this year's economic performance of
Southeast Asian countries will amply testify.
</P>
<P>
Although structural changes of the past three decades have
reduced the importance of agriculture as a source of income, it
continues to be an important determinant of growth in many Asian
developing economies.

<HEADLINE> ADB Assesses Economic Impact of Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Thursday that a modest economic recovery in Southeast Asia
from the current financial crisis is expected in 1999, but
recovery to pre-crisis economic growth rates and per capita income
levels will take a number of years.
</P>
<P>
The situation could deteriorate further if the current currency
and stock market crisis widens, or spills over into a full-fledged
banking crisis with a run on banks, the bank said in its "Asian
Development Outlook-1998" which was released here.
</P>
<P>
The "most discernible impact" of the financial crisis has been
a sharp decline in private capital inflows to Southeast Asian
countries, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
As investors' confidence was shattered by the crisis which
began last July, Southeast Asian countries suffered net private
capital outflows of 12 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, compared to
net inflows of 93 billion dollars in 1996, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, maturing short-term debts in several
Southeast Asian economies were not rolled over, it said.
</P>
<P>
"This resulted in an estimated outflow through commercial banks
of 21 billion dollars, as compared with inflows of about 56
billion dollars in 1996," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said the affected countries' reserves fell sharply
despite official assistance and a narrowing of their combined
current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the crisis on the financial sectors of Southeast
Asian countries has been also enormous, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
Although data on financial distress are still very tentative,
the bank said, they indicate serious problems with respect to
non-performing loans and capital adequacy of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans varies among
the affected countries, ranging from 10 percent in the Philippines
to 35 percent in Indonesia, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said the financial crisis has also posed
a serious liquidity problem for enterprises in the affected
countries, constraining the ability of enterprises to take full
advantage of the depreciation in the currency values.
</P>
<P>
"Without a major improvement in the credit situation,
enterprises will not be able to fill export orders, and the
possibility of an export boom leading these countries out of the
crisis will be remote," it said.
</P>
<P>
Given that the Asian crisis was not an outcome of
macro-economic imbalances, but was caused principally by
structural weaknesses in the financial and corporate sectors,
problems will take time to redress, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it said, if the governments concerned implement
the appropriate policies and reform institutions, the impact of
the economic crisis is likely to be "moderate, and at worst,
medium rather than long term.
</P>
<P>
Despite the crisis, the bank said, the longer term outlook for
the region is far from bleak.
</P>
<P>
The capacity for resource mobilization, the reasonable good
infrastructure, the favorable demographics, the open trading
system and the general commitment to macro-economic prudence
should stimulate economic growth, which should resume once
appropriate adjustment policies are implemented and take effect,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Assessing the impact of the crisis on the world economy, the
bank said the crisis will reduce real gross domestic product in
OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development)
countries by around 0.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
For the world as a whole, the reduction in GDP will be around
1.1 percent, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Asia to See Further Economic Slowdown in 1998: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of the Asian
developing economies slowed down further to 6.1 percent in 1997
from 7.5 percent in 1996 because of a financial crisis, and the
rate is projected to be about 4 percent in 1998, with some
recovery in 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook--1998" released here, the
bank said that except for the Central Asian republics, gross
domestic product (GDP) in all sub-regions of Asia declined last
year, including the Pacific islands which experienced negative
growth.
</P>
<P>
"However, the most conspicuous slowdown was in Southeast Asia,
where the growth remained positive but declined to almost half of
the level achieved in 1996," it said.
</P>
<P>
As the financial crisis that is affecting Southeast Asia
dominated the last half of 1997, the growth rate of the sub-region
fell from 7.1 percent in 1996 to less than 4 percent in 1997, the
lowest figure in two decades, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the economic outlook for the sub-region in 1998 is
"extremely uncertain" and will depend largely on the extent to
which governments can implement the various rescue packages of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"Projections indicate that Southeast Asia (except Singapore,
which is divided into the category of the newly industrialized
economies) can expect negative growth of 0.4 percent in 1998," the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The huge private sector debt burden in Indonesia and Thailand
in particular will have a major impact on the economic performance
of Southeast Asia in 1998 and 1999," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank predicted a negative 3 percent GDP growth
rate both for Thailand and Indonesia in 1998, and a 1 percent
growth rate for them in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank also estimated that the Philippines' GDP will grow by
2.4 percent in 1998 and 4 percent in 1999, Malaysia by 3.5 percent
in 1998 and 4.5 percent in 1999, and Singapore by 3 percent in
1998 and 4.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
As a result of depreciation and the rapid increase in import
prices, inflation in Southeast Asia is expected to rise from 5.6
percent in 1997 to 12.9 percent in 1998, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is projected to be particularly hard hit, with an
inflation rate of about 20 percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
But, it said, current account imbalances in Southeast Asia are
likely to improve in 1998, partly because of the slower growth,
and partly because of the improved competitiveness of exports due
to currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
The sub-region's deficits are projected to improve to 6.1
billion dollars in 1998 and 900 million dollars in 1999, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the economic performance in other sub-regions, the
bank said China as well as the newly industrialized economies
(NIES) -- Hongkong, China; South Korea; Singapore; Taipei, China
-- also experienced some slowdown in growth in 1997 but still
remained high at 6 percent and above.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the NIES in 1998 will be influenced by the
Asian crisis and GDP is forecast to grow by only 2.2 percent, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Asian crisis has not affected the Chinese economy
severely to date, the bank said, it is projected to undermine
economic performance slightly in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Growth in each of these years is projected to be about 7
percent. This will be partly the result of a weakening in demand
from those Asian developing countries that currently account for
about one third of the People's Republic of China's total
exports," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said the growth rate for South Asian economies in
1997 declined to less than 5 percent from 6.8 percent per year
between 1994 and 1996, but will grow at an average rate of 6.4
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is expected to grow at 5.1 percent, two percentage
points faster than in 1997, and Sri Lanka by 5.6 percent, as
opposed to 6.3 percent in 1997, it said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Defends IMF Programs for Crisis-Affected Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Key element required for rapid
recovery of Southeast Asian countries and South Korea is not the
traditional austerity measures, but structural reforms, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an economic outlook released here, the bank defended the
reform programs led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
these countries, saying that they are "much more broadly based
than traditional austerity programs to ensure macro-economic
balances."
</P>
<P>
Since the Asian financial crisis began last July, South Korea,
Thailand and Indonesia have sought IMF bailout, and started the
implementation of IMF reform programs.
</P>
<P>
"They (IMF programs) are designed to bring about structural
reforms that will strengthen financial systems, increase
transparency in both the public and private sectors, and open
markets, thereby restoring investors' confidence," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the bank said, non-viable financial institutions,
including banks, are being closed down, while other weak, but
viable, institutions are required to produce restructuring plans.
</P>
<P>
Other proposed structural changes include strengthening
financial sector regulations and supervision, it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that to reverse the sharp slide in currency
values, the IMF programs also suggest steep increases in interest
rates and tight monetary policies to stem the outflow of capital.
</P>
<P>
On the social cost of the IMF programs, the bank said: "No
doubt, the impact of these reforms will be painful."
</P>
<P>
"However, the economic slowdown would have been much more
dramatic and the costs to the general population would have been
much more higher without the IMF-led assistance packages," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that managing a recovery is just as difficult and
demanding as managing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Successful implementation of any policy reform or structural
adjustment depends on government commitment, political support and
institutional capability, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank called on governments to be "single-minded" about
reform programs and about implementing them.

<HEADLINE> ADB Sums up Lessons From Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Thursday that responsible fiscal management, prudent monetary
policy and greater exchange rate flexibility are important
elements that could help prevent a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The recent experience of Southeast and East Asia indicate that
private capital flows can be an important source of development
finance, but if this flow is poorly managed, it can be extremely
destabilizing, the bank said in its "Asian Development
Outlook--1998" which was released here.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the important lesson that emerges is that responsible
fiscal management, prudent monetary policy, and greater exchange
rate flexibility are important elements of a strategy to redress
these adverse effects of surges in private capital flow," the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, before opening up the capital account,
institutional reforms are needed to improve the soundness of
economies' financial sectors to ensure that capital flows are well
managed.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the critical role of the banking system in allocating
capital, the bank said the health of the system largely determines
whether a country will be able to exploit the benefits of
financial integration and avoid its pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
"While many Asian developing economies have partially
liberalized and deregulated their financial sectors since the
early 1990s, their banking sectors are still weak and fragile," it
said.
</P>
<P>
To address the issue of the poor health of their banking
sectors, the bank called on these countries to reform
institutional structures, improve such areas as regulation,
supervision, and accounting, and upgrade the overall governance of
the sector to avoid the various financial sector frailties that
can lead to a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the countries which have not been affected by the
crisis should also take measures to develop well-functioning
capital markets to reduce the risks of potential instability in an
integrated world.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, actions are required in three major
areas:
</P>
<P>
-- Market infrastructure, which comprises the systems and
institutions required for trade and custody of security;
</P>
<P>
-- Corporate governance, including protection of property
rights, especially those of minority shareholders;
</P>
<P>
-- Disclosure of market and company information and control of
abusive market practices.
</P>
<P>
Reforms of business laws, such as bankruptcy procedures, are
also required, the bank added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to globalization, the bank said the financial crisis
has generated skepticism in many quarters about the benefits of
globalization, especially of financial integration with the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
As with trade in goods and services, capital flows between
countries generally benefit both sending and receiving countries,
it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, to benefit from globalization, the countries
need to prepare themselves for it, so that they can avoid its
adverse effects, including the volatility it may sometimes
generate.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is a double-edged sword. It rewards good
policies and punishes bad ones," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the difficulties the affected economies have
experienced are not grounds for inaction or for adopting measures
that will retard the liberalization process, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The benefits of globalization are too large to ignore," the
bank said.

<HEADLINE> Mountain City Seeking Approval for Rare Plant Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOUu, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Fu'an, a mountain city
in east China's Fujian Province, has finished preparing a
report as part of an application to set up a rare-plant
reserve.
</P>
<P>
"The report was prepared several months ago," said Lan Ruchun,
Fu'an's mayor. "We hope this will help to protect the alosphia
spinulosa, a rare plant under top state protection found in
mountains within our administrative border."
</P>
<P>
An official with the Fujian Provincial Forestry Department said
he was "very excited that a country-level city like Fu'an can take
such an initiative to protect nature even before its economic
take-off."
</P>
<P>
If the forestry department approves Fu'an's application, it will
then go to the provincial government, which has the final say in
the approval process.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Dingyuan, a senior engineer with the local
forestry department, alosphia spinulosa is an endangered species
which once co-existed with the now-extinct dinosaur. Now it is
one of the eight types of plants under top state protection.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 alosphia spinulosa were recently discovered in
two mountain valleys near Guaxi Village, Xitan Township of Fu'an.
The tallest one is about 7 meters high, exceeding the record 6
meters indicated by the China Red Paper Book for Endangered Plants.
</P>
<P>
An expert from Fujian Normal University said that, based on
current materials, the distribution area of alosphia spinulosa in
Fu'an may be the world's largest and the best in higher latitudes.
</P>
<P>
"We first planned to construct a hydro-power station in the
area, but when the alosphia spinulosa was discovered we
immediately decided to stop plans for building the hydropower
station and set up a reserve there instead," said Xu Guichun,
secretary of the Fu'an City Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
He said that measures have been taken to protect alosphia
spinulosa and their environment as well as to raise the
conservation awareness of local villagers even before the
provincial reserve is approved.

<HEADLINE> Human Resources Development Crucial for Future Growth: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The effective utilization of human
resources will play a crucial role in Asia's fast economic growth
in the next century, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook-1998" which was released
here, the bank addressed the important issue of the role of human
resources in Asia's future development.
</P>
<P>
"Developing Asia enters the new millennium with the potential
advantage conferred by a rapidly growing population and labor
forces." it said.
</P>
<P>
"However, this growth is by itself is not enough. To take full
advantage of the opportunities requires a major investment in
human resources and technological capability," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Given the wide disparities in the levels of economic
development in developing Asia, the bank said, no single strategy
is applicable across the region.
</P>
<P>
But with the rapid pace of globalization and increasing
international competition, all the Asian developing economies will
need to face their specific problems of human resource development
sooner rather than later, it said.
</P>
<P>
"While the challenges are pressing, the rewards are high," the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that an increase in the labor force is not by itself a
prerequisite for economic growth as it could merely result in
higher unemployment and greater poverty.
</P>
<P>
What is crucial is how this resources is enhanced, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the key elements behind the (Asian) economic miracle,
and one that the relatively less developed Asian countries ignore
at their peril, has been the effective use and development of that
most fundamental of all resources, the people," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the bank said, governments have a crucial role to
play in this area.
</P>
<P>
In many countries governments directly fund a large proportion
of spending on health and education, but despite the importance of
such expenditure, it is still often inadequate, it said.
</P>
<P>
"This is partly because the benefits from increased expenditure
on health, education, and training, although crucial for sustained
economic development, take a long time to materialize," the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, they are not as immediately discernible as
expenditures on more tangible investments, such as building a new
factory or dam or improving infrastructure," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said governments in lowest income Asian countries
should allocate more public resources to primary and lower
secondary education.
</P>
<P>
This would enhance internal efficiency, as the social returns
to primary and lower secondary education tend to be much higher
than those to higher education in these economies, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the rapid growth rates some Southeast Asian
economies achieved in the past were no doubt partly influenced by
demographic factors and by an outward-oriented policy environment.
</P>
<P>
By using abundant cheap labor, these economies were able to
specialize in exports of labor-intensive products, it said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the era of rapid growth through the pursuit of
traditional, labor-intensive, low value-added production and
exports may be over, because of the adoption by other Asian
development economies," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the lessons from the current economic crisis are
not limited to the need for prudential regulations to govern
private financial institutions and for more general reforms of the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
All the Asian developing economies can learn important human
resources lessons from the current crisis, including those
economies that are not facing the full brunt of the crisis, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Chuan, Mahathir Supports Local Currency Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
and his Malaysian counterpart, Mahathir Mohamad, have voiced their
support for efforts to facilitate trade by using local currencies
among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Chuan and Mahathir met Wednesday night in Songkhla, southern
Thailand, and agreed that their finance ministers should carry out
the task, said Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi, who
accompanied Mahathir on his one-day visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Both Thailand and Malaysia are seeking to push the proposal to
conduct trade in local currencies instead of the U.S. dollar,
Badawi was quoted as saying by major Thai newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir proposed last year that ASEAN countries conduct trade
in their respective currencies to reduce dependence on the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"In order to implement that, there must be some mechanism to
settle this," Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan and Mahathir discussed a wide range of issues after
witnessing the signing of agreements for jointly exploiting gas
reserves in a joint development area lying in once-disputed
waters.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to promote border trade between the
two countries, according to Thailand's Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan.
</P>
<P>
He said Mahathir agreed in principle to lift the ceiling on the
transit of perishable goods from Thailand to Singapore. Under a
1978 accord, Malaysia set a ceiling of 30,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In return, Chuan agreed in principle to allow the transit of
Malaysian goods destined for Indochina, Surin said, adding that
both decisions would have to be formalized by memoranda of
understanding.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also agreed on the demarcation of a
disputed border area at Pedang Besar. Chuan proposed the extension
of opening hours for the Betong-Perak, Golok-Kelantan and
Sadao-Perak border points, according to the reports. It is unknown
whether Mahathir accepted the proposal.

PRAGUE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic is reported to
have the largest number of telephones per capita in Central and
East European countries.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the Telecommunications Bureau showed there were
3.37 million telephones in the country by the end of 1997, or 31.7
telephones for every 100 people. Hungary came second with 28.6,
followed by Slovak and Poland.

According to the bureau, by the year 2000, every 100 Czechs
will have 44.8 telephones and over 90 percent of the telephones
will be program-controlled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mobile phones had numbered 700,000 by the end of
March, doubling the figure at the end of last year. The number of
mobile phones is expected to rise to 1.1 million by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Economic Review: Robust Domestic Demand Crucial for China's Economic Growth Target (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China has witnessed a slowdown in
economic growth over the past three months and has reached a
crossroads which will either be characterized by a
rebounding GDP, or by the further stagnation of robust
demand for both investments and consumption, according to Beijing
economists,
</P>
<P>
Estimates place the year-on-year GDP growth for the first
quarter of this year at 7.2 percent, some 0.8 percent lower than
the central government's target for the year. The robust economy
China has enjoyed for the past eight-odd years now faces the
threat of stagnation in the absence of efforts to stimulate demand
for investments and consumption.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hanya, deputy director of Investment Research Institute
under the State Development Planning Commission, said the
financial crisis sweeping most Asian nations will most likely
result in zero increase, or even a small drop in China's exports
for the year. Increase in investments and consumption will be the
only two contributors to the targeted eight percent growth in GDP.
</P>
<P>
The slow increment in income levels over the past year will
most likely limit consumption increases to about three percentage
points of GDP growth, with the remainder supported by an expanded
investment scale, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the growth rate in consumption will fluctuate
between 10-12 percent during 1998. Ensuring an increase in GDP
will require inputs in fixed assets to reach 16-18 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, veteran economists insist that the investment target
can be attained as long as the central government readjusts
financial policies and macro-control measures.

<TEXT>
<P>
Liu Rongchang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, said that instead of loosening its control over
credits the central government should resort to such financial
inducements as subsidies, stocks and guarantees to attract money
from people of all walks of life into infrastructure, high-tech
and real estate projects.
</P>
<P>
The government should offer more preferential policies to
encourage the country's enterprises to carry out structural
reform, technical upgrades and the launch of new products as well
as stimulating exports, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, senior economist for the State Statistical Bureau,
said that an abundant money supply will also be an important
guarantee for GDP growth. China plans to increase the broad money
supply by 16-to-18 percent this year. If that comes true, the
country should be on a smooth path to a GDP growth of 8 percent or
more.
</P>
<P>
In response to the idea of Qiu and other economists, Dai
Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, told the World
Economic Forum this week that the central bank will "moderately
increase the money supply" to ensure an 8 percent growth in GDP
this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government at all levels should raise more
capital by accelerating reforms in housing and water prices while
seeking more channels to get money by cooperating with state banks
and foreign firms, said Zou Shaoyan, vice governor of Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
He added that both the central and local governments should
attach more importance to the profitability of their investment
projects to speed up capital circulation.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province plans to invest 118-to-120 billion yuan in
fixed assets this year, up 13.7 percent over the same period in
1997.
</P>
<P>
A zero increase is expected in Guangdong Province's investment
schedule, the investment plans by other provinces
register big increases over the previous year. Regional
economic powers such as Shandong and Jiangsu even outline an
increase of 15 percent in investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Economists noted that these investment schedules by local
governments lay a sound basis for increases in funding for the
whole country.

<HEADLINE> Thai Press Issues Code of Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Press Council of Thailand
(PCT), formed last year as a self-governing body of the Thai
press, has unveiled the country's first Code of Conduct for
newspapers in a bid to create "a clean press."
</P>
<P>
The code, a copy of which was received here Thursday, comprises
30 articles setting strict rules for newspapers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
For example, Article 17 states that newspapers "must not
publish pictures which are obscene or horrifying" while Article 15
demands respect for human dignity by everyone involved in the news
and protection of human rights, especially when children, women
and the socially underprivileged are concerned.
</P>
<P>
A PCT official explained that this means that from now on,
publishing nude photos or scary pictures of accident or murder
victims is prohibited, no suspect shall be branded as a
"cold-blooded murderer" or "rapist" and people's personal lives
can no longer be exposed unless the disclosure serves public
interests.
</P>
<P>
According to the code, complaints against newspapers or
particular reporters or writers can be initiated by the affected
party, public representatives such as non-governmental
organizations, or consumer organizations. A subcommittee will be
set up to investigate complaints. Newspapers found to have
violated the code will be told to publish the PCT ruling and an
apology.
</P>
<P>
In the case of a ruling against an individual reporter, his or
her organization will be told to consider a punishment and inform
the PCT as soon as possible of any action taken. In case the PCT
rulings are not obeyed, council members may be asked to publish
the rulings in their respective newspapers.

cities.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to increase its water-supply capacity from
rivers and reservoirs by 10 billion cubic meters a year to prevent
overuse of underground water leading to subsidence.
</P>
<P>
The report said that many hydro-power and water conservation
projects built in the 1950s and 1960s are aging and need technical
improvements, which create other investment opportunities for
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
"Local water-resource bureaus plan to generate funds to
renovate these old projects through joint investment, cooperation
or selling off part of the property rights," the report stated.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Tanlin, a leading official of the Foreign Investment
Office, suggests overseas investors consider buying shares of the
"China Middle and Small Hydro-Power Generation Fund," which is
being established by the Bank of China. MWR proposes the
hydro-power projects to receive investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fund has aroused the interest of many
financial institutions and companies abroad.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said that MWR is also engaged with the Canadian government
in a feasibility study for some investment projects in the Aojiang
River in east China's Fujian Province.

<HEADLINE> Europe Understands Africa Better Than US: Kenyan FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana said here Wednesday that European countries seem to have a
better understanding of African countries than the United States
in providing aid for the continent.
</P>
<P>
Godana made the remark upon his arrival in Helsinki for an
unofficial visit designed to forge closer bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. president Bill Clinton expressed in his African trip last
month that the U.S. is seeking to a transition from providing
development aid to supporting bilateral trade in developing
U.S.-African relations.
</P>
<P>
Such a change of policy on the part of the U.S. government
contains the risk that the U.S. might boost its right to have a
say in the internal affairs of African countries, the foreign
minister said. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
As all economic blocs are operating across the world on an
increasingly frequent basis, all countries, including those in
Africa, should make a special effort to enhance relationships with
each other through international cooperation, Godana said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has played an
important role in promoting economic development in African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Finland is one stop of the Kenyan Foreign Minister's northern
European trip which aims to strengthen relations between Kenya and
those countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Finland, Bonaya held talks with Finish
Development and Cooperation Minister Pekka Haavisto and Foreign
Trade Minister Ole Norrback. They exchanged views on bilateral
relations and development aid and other issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has been the traditional recipient of Finnish bilateral
aid. In 1996, Finland provided 15 million Finish Marks (3 million
U.S. dollars) to Kenya for joint projects of forest preservation
and water resources.

<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China is open to foreign
participation in its water-resource development, and area of
promising benefits for both parties, Zhu Dengquan of the Ministry
Water Resources (MWR) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that China's rapid economic growth needs
an adequate water supply, hydro-power generation and flood
prevention, However, funding and technology constraints have
impeded progress in developing the country's water resources.
</P>
<P>
China used 480 million U.S. dollars of direct overseas
investment in the water resources sector during the 1992-1996
period, accounting for 0.3 percent of the total overseas
investment figure in China, according to statistics provided by
the International Cooperation Department of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told Xinhua that China is improving investment conditions
for overseas businesses, with major changes planned in the
bureaucratic system and legal construction this year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the newly elected cabinet, the State
Council, is working to achieve unified management over water
resources, to strengthen the ministry's ability to manage water
affairs.
</P>
<P>
That means, he explained, that overseas businesses may no
longer need to go through the current web of government
departments to have a project approved, but will only need one
approval -- that of the MWR.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Yellow River Hydropower Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China is currently trying to
develop hydropower resources on the upper reaches of the Yellow
River in order alleviate power shortages in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Ding Zhongzhi, director of the Northwest Power Administration,
noted that seven hydropower stations on the upper reaches of the
river, the second longest in the country, have a total generating
capacity of 5.62 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Operational plans for three large hydropower stations on the
river's section flowing through Qinghai Province have been
completed, and two thirds of total available water resources on
the upper reaches of the Yellow River are prime for development.
</P>
<P>
Ding noted that power shortages not only limit local economic
development, and also reveal the vast potential for related
development.
</P>
<P>
Experts have paid special attention to abundant water resources
on the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Plans for the 918-km
section between Longyangxia and Qingtongxia call for the
construction of 25 medium- to large-sized hydropower stations with
a total generating capacity of 15.88 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Research carried out in Qinghai and Gansu provinces, and the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region provides ample proof that the
development of hydropower stations on the upper reaches of the
Yellow River will involve minimal relocation efforts and
investments.

China is also preparing to raise water prices to reduce wastes
and increase profitability in water-supply projects, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"Out of concern for the farmers, who consume 80 percent of the
country's water, prices will be raised in a range of 1-to-1.5
cents per cubic meter of water, with different prices charged to
different social and economic sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have always stressed that water-resource development is a
social undertaking, and now we treat it as an industrial sector."
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old official said that China hopes to have its
current water law revised this year, with more efficient clauses
arranged for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"China's water law was promulgated in the planned-economy era,"
he said, "but some clauses no longer suit conditions and need
revision because China has made deep inroads in building a
socialist market economy in the past 10 years."
</P>
<P>
The Ninth National People's Congress, the legislature, has
shown a positive attitude toward a thorough review of the water
law, he said.
</P>
<P>
With administrative, price and legal progresses, the minister
is confident of a boost in foreign investment in water-resource
construction.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Foreign Investment Office of the ministry
said that 90 percent of hydro-power potential in China is
untapped, which leaves a wide arena for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The ministry provides electricity through hydro-power
generation to more than 800 counties, which are located mainly in
China's central and western parts.
</P>
<P>
The report noted, "but these counties' racing economic
development cries out for more electricity."

<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China will convert to radar air
traffic control at airports in Guangzhou and Shenzhen on July 1 to
increase the number of flights.
</P>
<P>
At present the Beijing area is the only one using radar for air
traffic control.
</P>
<P>
An official with the air traffic control bureau of the Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said that, with the
operation of Hong Kong's new airport, the flight volume is
expected to increase in Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The official said the only way to increase flights is to use
radar control. In most of China's airports, controllers have to
calculate aircraft location based on its take-off time and air
speed.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee safety, the official said, flights have to
maintain a 150-kilometer separation to allow for errors in
calculation. After installing radar, however, the spacing between
flights can be reduced to 20 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Spreads Fast in Mexico's Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of acquired
immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients has increased 277
percent in the rural areas of Mexico over the past seven years,
the Ministry of Health said.
</P>
<P>
In a press release on Wednesday, the ministry said a total of
150,000 persons have been infected by the human immuno-deficiency
virus (HIV) in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Mexico now ranks as third on the American continent with
the highest number of AIDS patients, just slightly behind the
United States and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the spread and growth of AIDS is caused by
the country's geographic, economic and social conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mexico shares a long common border in the north with the United
States. This zone registers the largest amount of AIDS infections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the southern border also represents a high risk area
for the transmission of the deadly virus. It is believed that 93
percent of the prostitutes working in the zones with the greatest
number of infections are illegal immigrants from neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Xochitl Castaneda, an analyst for the Investigation Center of
Population Health of the National Institute of Public Health,
admitted that messages and strategies to promote "safe sex" have
failed to bring the desired results.
</P>
<P>
She added that one of the most important challenges in
implementing prevention strategies is how to change the behavior
of individuals for personal and public well-being.

STOCKHOLM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Four Scandinavian countries are
to set up a joint peacekeeping force subject to the United Nations

</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the Nordic Coordinated Arrangement for
Military Peace Support was made by defense ministers from Sweden,
Finland, Denmark and Norway at a meeting in Kiruna, northern
Sweden, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An army brigade of 3,000 to 4,000 servicemen and armored

years.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Defense Minister Bjoern von Sydow said that both the
U.N. and NATO wanted Nordic countries to share greater
responsibilities in maintaining peace and stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that Scandinavian states would strengthen their
cooperation in mobilizing an efficient force within a reasonable
time to assist the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Nordic countries now provide peacekeeping forces at the
company or battalion level of no more than 800 servicemen, mostly

<HEADLINE> Exit Polls Banned in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Commission on Elections has
announced that no exit polls will be allowed during the May 11
elections in order to prevent any "unreasonable" confusion that
may arise, a leading Philippine newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Manolo Gorospe said Wednesday that the poll body
will not accredit any application for the conduct of exit polls on
May 11 in order to "prevent confusion among voters" on who is
winning or losing.
</P>
<P>
He said the commission might issue a resolution banning the
conduct of exit polls to discourage further petitions for
accreditation, according to the Philippine Star.
</P>
<P>
In an exit poll, voters emerging from the polling place are
asked at random whom they voted for. Results of such polls are
usually announced immediately. They are popular in the United
States and are usually considered highly reliable.
</P>
<P>
But Gorospe said the Philippine political culture is not ready
for exit polls.
</P>
<P>
"We have this culture that nobody loses and everybody is a
winner. If we conduct an exit poll and the result is released even
before the counting is finished, we could have a chaotic
situation," Gorospe said.
</P>
<P>
The commission is not expected to come out with the results of
the presidential polls in less than a week, as it took the poll
body three weeks in the 1992 elections to complete its counting.
</P>
<P>
Gorospe revealed that already, a local media outfit has sought
accreditation for an exit poll.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Attracting Funds From All Over China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- At the Pudong New Area in
Shanghai, 4,569 projects were built with investments from other
parts of China in the last eight years, according to a local
official.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 -- nearly half of the high-rise buildings in
Pudong -- were built by central government ministries and
commissions or governments of other provinces.
</P>
<P>
East China's Jiangsu Province was the largest domestic investor
in Pudong with an investment exceeding one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The former Ministry of Electronic Industry cooperated with
Japan-based Nippon Electric Co. Ltd. to build a
one-billion-U.S. dollar electronic joint venture in the Jinqiao
export-oriented processing zone, becoming the largest project in
Pudong invested by government ministries.
</P>
<P>
The 421-meter-high Jinmao Mansion, the highest skyscraper so
far built in China, was jointly funded by 14 foreign trade
companies under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the 89 sub-trade companies opened in Pudong by
25 provinces and cities were set up by provinces along the Yangtze
River belt.
</P>
<P>
The Pufa Machine-Building Industry Co. Ltd., a group of 200
enterprises, was rated the most profitable firm set up by

<HEADLINE> Noted Economists on East Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- One lesson China can draw from
the East Asian financial crisis is that extensive economic growth
will not last, pointed out noted Chinese economists.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian and Wei Jianing, both noted economists, wrote in an
article carried by the bimonthly magazine Reform that high speed
economic growth for almost 20 years before the financial crisis
misled leaders in many East Asian countries. But risks were
inherent in the increasingly investment-based economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to them, extensive growth has also been a problem
accompanying China's economic development. Although the government
has tried to promote the transformation of the pattern of growth
by reforming the economic system since the early 1980s, the
transformation has so far made little progress.
</P>
<P>
Over-heated investment in a few industries and duplicate
construction will make enterprises vulnerable to market
competition, they added.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis also told China that the bubble economy is
dangerous, they observed.
</P>
<P>
Over-heated stock markets and property markets could be found
in those Asian countries which were to suffer from the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In China, the stock market was once filled with the bubble
element. Although inflation is under control now, financial
speculation is still going on. Therefore, China should always be
on the alert against economic bubbles, they said.
</P>
<P>
The economists suggested that China guard against the financial
risks now.
</P>
<P>
During the rapid economic growth in recent years, enterprises
in East Asian countries borrowed loans from inefficient
investment, which contributed greatly to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
In China, the low efficiency of State-owned enterprises forced
the government to support them with extensive funding from State
banks, resulting from non-performing loans. It is high time to
deal with these financial risks, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Other lessons that China can learn from the crisis include that
enterprises must be separated from the government, the government
should interfere less in economic activities; and that the quality
of the government's policy-making system is crucial to sound
economic development.

<P>
HAVANA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has hailed as "victorious"
the defeat of an anti-Cuban resolution presented by the United
States in the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial published Wednesday, the official Granma
journal said that April 21, Tuesday, was a "historical day" when
the anti-Cuban resolution was defeated with 19 votes against, 16
for and 18 abstentions in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
What happened in Geneva Tuesday dismantled the mechanism used
by Washington to charge Cuba with human rights violations, the
journal said.
</P>
<P>
With this outcome, a great stride was made in destroying the
U.S. mechanisms of aggression, manipulation and negative publicity
against Cuba, it said.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is prepared to conduct dialogues on the basis of mutual
respect, the journal said. But it stressed that by no means will
Cuba accept an imposition of any pretended values against Cuban
socialism.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Banana Exports Fall Due to "El Nino" Phenomenon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's banana exports fell
5 percent in 1997 from the previous year mainly as a result of "El
Nino" weather phenomenon, Jorge Sauma, General Manager of the
National Banana Corporation (Corban), said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica exported 101 million boxes of bananas, each weighing
18.4 kilograms, in 1997 against 106.5 million boxes in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
"El Nino" phenomenon has caused the weather to change abruptly
along the coastline of the Latin-American Pacific Ocean, leading
to reductions in the banana output.
</P>
<P>
Sauma pointed out that exports have also been affected by some
restrictions in the banana trade. "Companies started to demand
increasing quality, this reduced the exports," he stated.
</P>
<P>
However, the manager of Corbana added that a recovery in banana
exports in the last six months of the year is expected. In 1998,
banana exports could range between 105 and 107 million boxes and
that an increase in productivity was also foreseen.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is the second largest exporter of bananas only after
Ecuador, but holds the largest productivity in the world.
</P>
<P>
The country's banana exports are bounded mainly to the North
American market, which consumes 52 percent of the total. The
European Union purchases almost the resting 48 percent, while a
small portion is exported to Asia, mainly to China and Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Soybean production in
Brazil will set a new record this year reaching more than 30
million tons, the local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report disclosed that with soybean cultivation areas
increasing from 11 million hectares last year to 13 million
hectares this year, soybean production will reach 30.93 million
tons this year compared to 26.16 million tons last year,
establishing a new historical record.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the fall of soybean prices in the international
market, Brazil is expected to earn 5 to 5.3 billion U.S. dollars
from the export of soybeans this year.
</P>
<P>
This amount represents a slight reduction if compared with that
of last year, when the country registered an income from soybeans
of more than 5.7 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese newspapers are paying
more attention to environmental protection issues, the latest
survey on the media shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey included 76 newspapers which published 22,066
stories concerning environmental protection in 1997, a monthly
average of 24 stories for each compared with 21 in 1996 and 11 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Only Science and Technology Daily and Legal Daily's reports on
environmental protection exceeded 1 percent of their total
coverage in 1995. But in 1997 some 48 newspapers exceeded the
percentage.
</P>
<P>
Except those special environmental media, Science and
Technology Daily was most concerned about environmental protection
in 1997, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers from coastal areas also showed more enthusiasm about
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers attached the greatest importance to planting
trees, public hygiene and governmental response to environmental

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Small Loan Program Introduced To Help Poor Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Gongshan County is a remote,
poor area in southwest China's Yunnan Province, with local
farmers having little knowledge of the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, they have been talking about Bangladesh which
is only several hundred km away from the county but used to be
felt by the villagers as far as a country on the other side of the
globe.
</P>
<P>
What has made Bangladesh known to Gongshan farmers is the Small
Credits Scheme, which was created by the Agameen Bank of
Bangladesh and has succeeded in helping millions of poor rural
families eliminate poverty in its birthplace, as well as in dozens
of other developing nations.
</P>
<P>
China's Foreign Ministry has tried hard to spread the
Bangladeshi successful poverty-elimination practice in the
country, since the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka made detailed reports
on the scheme in the mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, the small loan program has been carried
out on a small scale on a trial basis in Yunnan, central China's
Henan Province, and the Tibet Autonomous Regions.
</P>
<P>
The successful results of these experiments have enabled the
central government to adopt the scheme in all poor areas in the
country, including the whole of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Four of Gongshan's five townships have provided four million
yuan from the central exchequer to implement the program, with
the exception of Dulongjiang Township that cannot try out the
program because of harsh national conditions.
</P>
<P>
The motto of the Bangladeshi program is "providing the loans
only to poor families and wives". In China, some revisions have
to be made to suit local conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We mainly target families that are poor but ambitious," says
Yang Ruxiao, head of the Small Credits Scheme Work Station, a
Chinese version of the Agameen Bank, in Puladi Township,
Gongshan.

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Two similar goals scored in each
half of a Belgium-Romania World Cup warm-up game tied the two
teams at one all on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The visitors proved their worthiness as World Cup group G seed
by opening the scoring first at half time though they had been
pressed hard during the entire game.
</P>
<P>
Gheorghe Hagi, Romania's 1994 World Cup hero, set up the score
by chipping to the left an accurate pass which striker Viorel
Moldovan drove to the far bottom corner for the lead.
</P>
<P>
Romania had called up a record of 16 foreign-based players for
its 20-man team for Wednesday's game, including Hagi and Gabi
Popescu.
</P>
<P>
Belgium also recalled its foreign-based stars including regular
goalkeeper Filip de Wilde, Marc Wilmots, Luc Nilis and Michael
Goossens.
</P>
<P>
It was Nilis, who plays for the Dutch club of PSV Eindhoven,
found the ball at the left of the penal area and chipped it past
Romania's goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea to the far bottom corner for
the equalizer at the 77th minute.
</P>
<P>
The game developed into a rather physical one during which the
referee had to fish out the yellow cards more than a dozen times
to caution players from both sides to calm down and restrain from
high kicking and foul tackling.
</P>
<P>
It was the second drawn game on home turf during Belgium's
run-up toward this summer's World Cup finale in France. The
Belgians, best known as the Red Demons, first beat the United
States 2-0 before being pindowned by Norway to a 2-2 tie.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Star striker Gabriel Batistuta led
World Cup team Argentina to a 2-0 win over Ireland in Dublin on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta found the net in the 27th minute before Ariel Ortega
added the second five minutes before the break.
</P>
<P>
Argentina took the Irish defense apart in the first half to
move smoothly into a two-goal lead that could easily have been
more.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta should have put the visitor ahead in the 12th minute
when he found himself with only goalkeeper Shay Given to beat. But
the Fiorentina striker, who has scored 36 times for his country,
fired straight at the goalkeeper.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Posts Profit in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Boeing showed a profit of 50
million U.S. dollars in the first quarter, a profit substantially
below the year earlier quarter of 540 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The cost of grappling with production problems was blamed for
the cuts of the first-quarter earnings. The company lost money
with the third and fourth quarters of 1997 and for the year.
</P>
<P>
Boeing had disclosed earlier this month that continuing
bottlenecks in the assembly of its new 737 models would cost the
company 350 million dollars before taxes in the first quarter this
year.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the production snags have cost Boeing about 3 billion
dollars before taxes and put heavy pressure on management to get
production back on track and restore the company's financial
health.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's sales climbed 24 percent in the first quarter to 12.9
billion dollars, on the strength of increased deliveries of
commercial jets. It delivered 108 planes in the first quarter
compared with 77 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the company quoted its chairman Phil Condit as
saying that Boeing still expects to deliver 550 commercial jets
this year, including 225 of the newer 737s that have been delayed.
Increased production rates for the 757, 777 and 747 are on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Seattle manufacturer is monitoring the Asian
financial situation, which has the potential to hurt future
commercial jet deliveries, especially of big models such as the
777 and 747. So far no cancellations have been announced, but the
company has said as many as 60 deliveries could be affected in the
next two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government announced
some new initiatives to assist in the Middle East peace process
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new initiatives include a contribution of 4 million dollars
(2.8 million U.S. dollars) for reconstruction efforts in

Lloyd Axworthy said Canada's approach is to "identify practical

<HEADLINE> UK PM Blair Defends Decision to Accept Nuclear Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Wednesday defended his decision to give green-light to accepting
nuclear material due to be reprocessed in a nuclear plant in
Scotland from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government's decision to accept these dangerous
materials has triggered widespread outcries in Britain, with
environmentalists describing the decision as "ill-conceived and
dangerous".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the House of Commons, Blair insisted that
reprocessing some five kilograms of nuclear materials at a remote
Scottish plant would add only marginally to the stockpile of
nuclear waste there.
</P>
<P>
Blair noted that the United States had already taken some 600
kg of unused highly enriched uranium from Kazakhstan while Russia
had taken 137 kg from Iraq since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"Other European countries are making other contributions. That
is the reason why we thought it important to do what we did,"
Blair added.
</P>
<P>
On why the government failed to announce the plan beforehand,
Blair explained that the operation had been kept secret because
there were fears that the laboratory in Georgia could be taken
over by Chechen rebels opposed to the Georgian government.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Malaysian-Backed Firm to Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has affirmed its commitment to all legally binding agreements
with a Malaysian-backed power company but maintained that it will
not agree on the extraordinarily high power tariffs.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the State House Wednesday said the
implementation of the International Power Tanzania Limited (IPTL)
project will make Tanzania increase the tariffs by nearly 50
percent at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The country already has the highest costs of electricity in
the east Africa region.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, IPTL, a private Malaysia-Tanzania joint venture, won
a contract to build a 100 megawatt thermal power plant station
worth 150 million U.S. Dollars in the northern outskirts of Dar
es Salaam. The construction of power station, lasting 12 months,
is expected to end by August.
</P>
<P>
But the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
(WB) later said the project will be an unacceptable burden on
Tanzania's fragile economy because of the proposed wholesale
tariff of 21 cents per kilowatt hour is too high.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the prices of electricity are likely to be
even higher in 1999 and in the subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
It further said that the government therefore called on IPTL
to meet the obligations in negotiating for power tariffs on good
faith to ensure that they are based on "actual, reasonable and
affordable rates."
</P>
<P>
The statement said this could be achieved by working out the
capital and operational costs of IPTL, and give fair return to
the investors, and at the same time leave tariff affordable by
the state power company TANESCO, the national economy and the
people.
</P>
<P>
Last week, after three days of fruitless talks between IPTL,
the Energy Ministry and TANESCO, the government angrily ordered a
seven-member Malaysian delegation representing IPTL to leave the
country immediately.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources explained the reason for the dispute was
that TANESCO had defaulted to buy electricity from IPTL.
</P>
<P>
Denying it was a deportation, the statement said, "The
government and TANESCO assert their rights under the agreements
they signed while leaving the door open to resolve all disputes
with IPTL through reasoned negotiations."
</P>
<P>
It stressed that when embarking on the negotiations, IPTL
should recognize that the government represents a sovereign
state, free to select internal and external experts, advisors and
partners in order to promote and protect the country's interests,
and is accountable to its citizens.
