<HEADLINE> S. Korean Political Parties Hail Amnesty to Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean political parties
Saturday hailed the decision by President Kim Young-sam to grant a
special amnesty to imprisoned former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and
Roh Tae-woo, describing it as a turning point for national
reconciliation and overcoming current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The presidential office Saturday announced Kim's decision to
grant amnesties to Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo and restore their
citizen rights.
</P>
<P>
The Grand National Party, the ruling camp, wished the forthcoming
amnesty would become a turning point of for national unity and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The National Congress for New Politics, whose leader Kim Dae-jung
has been elected as next president of the country, said the amnesty
will help the nation overcome animosity and social clashes.
</P>
<P>
The New Party by the People wished the amnesty would be a turning
point for defeating the country's current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The presidential amnesty, which will also go to 23 other
prisoners involving in the 1979 military coup, or other misdeeds,
will be effective from December 22.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, top leaders of the 1979 military coup, were
separately sentenced to life imprisonment and 17 years in jail in
last April because they were charged with mutiny, treason and
embezzlement of public funds when they were in power.
</P>
<P>
The pardon is aimed for a grand national unity when the country
desperately needs combination of all forces to overcome the
current financial crisis, said a spokesman of the presidential
office.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is currently in a serious financial crisis caused
by the collapse of a slew of conglomerates and bad loans of
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, under the amnesty, the two jailbirds have to
respectively return 220.5 billion won (about 150 million
U.S. dollars) and 262.8 billion won (about 180 million
U.S. dollars) they illegally amassed.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Attacks Butler's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq
Aziz today lashed out at chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler,
calling his statements "inaccurate and unobjective."
</P>
<P>
Aziz accused Butler of moving ahead "with a spree of inaccurate
and unobjective statements" on his Baghdad talks, thereby serving
the American plan aimed at unjustifiably scaling up the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Butler said on Friday in New York that he had reasons to doubt
that Iraq was hiding prohibited materials at "presidential and
sovereign sites."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that U.N. arms inspectors had actually carried out
119 inspections of national security-related locations during
1996 and 1997 upon receiving information similar to those cited
in Butler's statements, but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
"I asked him (Butler) in Baghdad if that was not enough to
construe that the information on the basis of which inspection had
been made were groundless and misleading," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier said he reminded Butler of a British
newspaper revelation about a meeting between Israel's intelligence
service Mossad and the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
on disarming Iraq reportedly held to provide UNSCOM with such
information.
</P>
<P>
It was a right decision to videotape the talks, said Aziz,
expressing confidence that the attendance of Russian, French and
British representatives at the talks would largely contribute to
revealing the facts.
</P>
<P>
Butler held three rounds of talks with Iraqi officials during
his four-day visit to Baghdad from December 12-16, but failed to
persuade Iraq to allow U.N. arms inspectors' access to the
presidential sites, which Iraq views as symbols of national
sovereignty and dignity.

<HEADLINE> French PM Lays Out New Africa Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, who is on his first tour to Africa, presented France's new
Africa policy on Saturday in the Senegalese capital of Dakar.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that the new approach is based on the "adaptation
of the tools of cooperation" to the present era. He promised that
France would not "do less", but will "do better" in its
cooperation with African countries.
</P>
<P>
"France does not say or think that the time of aid is past," he
said, following talks with Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, and
Senegalese Prime Minister Habib Thiam.
</P>
<P>
Jospin assured the Franco-zone nations of Africa that the
launching of the European single currency will not affect them.
</P>
<P>
On international affairs, Jospin promised that France would
continue to serve as the "lawyer" of Africa in seeking
international aid for the continent.
</P>
<P>
France will ask the international community to contribute to
the building of an African peace-keeping force through the
"Reinforcement of African Capacities for the Maintenance of
Peace", to be jointly launched by the European Union and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The French prime minister said that as part of the preparations
for the force, France will provide the complete equipment for a
battalion of troops and a military field hospital for
Senegal. This will be done in February when French troops jointly
hold military maneuvers with their Senegalese, Mauritanian and
Malian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said France could not ensure by itself the security of its
African partners, and hoped to reinforce the inter-African
cooperation in security through multilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of emigration by Africans to France, Jospin said
Paris hoped African governments could take measures to control
this.
</P>
<P>
France would also soften its policy on visa issues, he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister to Chair Welfare Working Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said today that he is to chair a new government working
party on reforming the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the announcement in a speech to an audience in his
Sedgefield constituency, saying "the party that created the
welfare state is the party that is going to have to reform it."
</P>
<P>
He said the system created with such pride in 1945 by the
post-war Labor government had been left behind by changes in
society.
</P>
<P>
Blair, fighting rebels in his party over cuts in welfare
payment, said the current 100 billion pounds (166 billion US
dollars) a year cost of the welfare state neither relieved poverty
nor delivered the investment needed for the future.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said benefit fraud was costing 5
billion pounds (8 billion US dollars) a year, but he pledged help
would continue for the poorest.
</P>
<P>
He said the reforms would aim to relieve poverty, narrow social
division, extend opportunity and help the poor rather than punish
them.
</P>
<P>
"There can't be any backing down. It is essential that we make
these reforms," Blair insisted.
</P>
<P>
Last week 47 Labor MPs voted against cuts in benefit payments
for lone parents.

<HEADLINE> Three Chinese into Singles Finals at ITTF Pro-Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese have qualified
for the men's and women's singles finals following their victories
in the semi-finals at the 1997 International Table Tennis
Federation Pro-Tour Grand Finals here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liqin, 19, who made himself known after his stunning
victory over Sweden's world champion Jan-Ove Waldner on Friday,
scored an fairly easy 21-10, 21-19, 21-10 semi-final victory
Saturday over Belgian Jean-Michel Saive, now ranked 13th in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Saive beat China's defending champion Kong Linghui in the
quarter-finals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I won because I'd taken the initiative today," said the
Chinese teenager from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Saive, 28, said he could not play his game today. "I was not
waken as I almost did not sleep last night," he said.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive Belgian said he did not know much about the
Chinese opponent before. "They (Chinese) might have 2,000 copies
of tapes of my matches and I, as a European, could feel very
difficult in playing a Chinese for the first time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't playing my game today. If I could have played as
yesterday and the before, I could win over anyone," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Cai Zhenhua, Head Coach of the Chinese team, said Wang should
owe his victory to his better tactics today. He admitted that his
team was in a better position as they had known a lot about Saive.
</P>
<P>
"Saive was managing throughout the match today to get the game
of Wang," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang is to play in Sunday's final Vladimir Samsonov from
Belarus, who eliminated Zoran Primorac of Croatia 23-21, 12-21,
21-17, 22-20 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov had won over Wang three times and lost once before.
</P>
<P>
China's world number two and top seed here Li Ju qualified for
the women's singles final after beating Park Hae Jung from South
Korea 21-8, 21-19, 22-24, 21-12 in the semi-finals today.
</P>
<P>
Li's victory set an all-Chinese final as China's world
runner-up and world number three Wang Nan eliminated South Korea's
Ryu Ji Hye 21-9, 21-19, 21-18 today.
</P>
<P>
China has one pair each into the men's and women's doubles
finals. Kong Linhui teamed with Olympic champion Liu Guoliang to
beat Patrick Chila/Christophe Legout from France 21-8, 16-21,
21-17, 21-12 for a berth in the men's doubles final.
</P>
<P>
And the German-Belarussian combination of Jorg Rosskopf and
Vladimir Samsonov downed Chinese Wang Liqin and Yan Sen 21-19,
16-21, 11-21, 21-19, 21-17 in the semi-finals today.
</P>
<P>
The qualifier for the women's doubles final were Chinese Li
Ju/Wang Nan and South Korea's Park Hae Jung/Kim Moo Kyu. They
beat their compatriots Cheng Hongxia/Wang Hui and Ryu Ji Hye/Lee
Eun Sil in the semi-finals on Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 20 (Xinhua) --A senior Zimbabwean government
official today called on various ministries to work out coherent
mission and strategic perspectives to guide their programs and
daily activities.
</P>
<P>
The call was made today by Chief Secretary in the presidential
office, Charles Utete, when he addressed participants from
different ministries attending a two-day strategic directions
workshop held by the Ministry of Mines, Environment and Tourism
in Juliasdale in east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Utete said that it is also necessary to have appropriate
legislation in ministries like that of mines, environment and tourism
that resolves issues of environment protection which is paramount to
the sustainability of the country's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
''Without strategic perspectives that guide us in our work and
where we are headed, we are no different from a rudderless
ship,'' he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is in light of such considerations and having regarded to
the government's overall reform program that the cabinet last
year invited all ministries to formulate and present to the
review panel how government programs and mission statements can
be successfully implemented.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Denies Border Disputes with Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean officials have
denied allegations of border disputes with Mozambique in the
eastern highlands following reports that some Zimbabwean farmers
were altering border markers to extend their farms eastwards.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency today quoted officials in the
country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that they had not
received any imformation about border disputes from
the offical channel of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The Maputo daily Noticias reported recently that Zimbabwean
farmers were altering border markers and pushing their lands
deeper into Mozambique in an attempt to extend their farms.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are reportedly planting tea and coffee on
Mozambican soil.
</P>
<P>
Negion Moyo, Deputy Provincial Criminal Investigations Officer
of Zimbabwe's Manicaland Province, said the police had not
received any such complaints from the Mozambicans.
</P>
<P>
"There could be some communal farmers encroaching onto the
Mozambican land. These people along the border, because of their
cross border relations, can do anything but we can not declare
that a border dispute," Moyo noted.
</P>
<P>
"If there was an issue of that nature it would have been
brought to our attention," the officer said, adding "These may be
isolated cases."
</P>
<P>
According to Mozambican officials, maps of the conventional
limits between the two countries could be consulted to sort out
the facts if things worsened, reported the news agency.

particularly in the last few years."
</P>
<P>

countries.

Sri Lanka would always be cooperative in promoting this
process, she added.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Hands over Party Leadership to Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- As the five-day national
conference of South Africa's ruling African National Congress
(ANC) concluded today, former ANC president Nelson Mandela handed
over a symbolic baton of leadership to his successor Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said, as the 1999 general election draws near along
with his departure from the national presidency, he would try to
delegate increasing responsibility to Mbeki to ensure a smooth
transition, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
As Mandela would not seek re-election in 1999, it is generally
believed that Mbeki will become the next state president.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who has been left to run the day-to-day work of the
government, is the de facto president of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela, Mbeki's unopposed election as ANC
president at the conference was a fitting tribute to his
performance in various capacities in exile, the impressive
contribution he made as part of the ANC team at the Codesa
settlement talks, and the brilliant way in which he had carried
out his duties as deputy president of the ANC and of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Codesa (Convention for a Democratic South Africa) talks in
the early 1990s, helped bring about the end of apartheid in South
Africa and heralded the first all-race elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, in a closing speech of the conference, chanted eulogies
to his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
"Once more, many thanks, Madiba (Mandela's clan name), for who
you are, for what you are, for what you have done for us and for
our people."
</P>
<P>
"The happiness of your people will be your reward, the loyalty
of the members to the traditions of your movement, your pride."
</P>
<P>
The national conference ended today with a soccer match that
overwhelmed planned speeches of Mandela and Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The speeches were canceled at the last minute at a rally in a
stadium in Mafikeng when ANC leaders realized that soccer
fanaticism had won over political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
ANC supporters at the rally were excited at the sight of their
soccer teams when the rally began.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to cater for the large local and international
media contingent, Mandela approached the podium to deliver his
prepared speech, but was interrupted when the crowd erupted again
at the sight of the Orlando Pirates soccer team strolling on to
the pitch.
</P>
<P>
Mandela then strode to the reporters to read part of his
speech instead.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki declined to deliver his prepared speech for fear that
the restless crowd might get out of hand.

<HEADLINE> Drug Use Among Teen-Agers Remains Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Drug use among teen-agers
in the United States remained stable and the number of high
school seniors who use marijuana was on the rise last year,
according to a U.S. annual federal survey.
</P>
<P>
The use of illegal drugs among eighth graders was steady from
1996 to 1997, with the exceptions of marijuana, cigarettes and
heroin, which showed a slight decrease in use, the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) said in a report released today.
</P>
<P>
The number of 10th and 12th graders who used drugs in the past
year or months was also stable. However, reported daily use of
marijuana by high school seniors rose from 4.9 percent in 1996 to
5.8 percent this year, the department said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton today called on parents to make
efforts to prevent children from using drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The most effective strategy we have against drugs begins at
home. It's a fight that can be won at kitchen tables all across
America," Clinton said in his weekly radio appearance.
</P>
<P>
"This holiday season, as we spend some hard-earned time with
our families, I urge all parents to sit down with their children,
as Hillary and I have done, and share a simple and important
lesson: Drugs are dangerous, drugs are wrong and drugs can kill,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The HHS said the possible slowdown of illicit drug use among
young people is encouraging, even though rates of use remain
unacceptably high. But it said parents and teachers need to
redouble their efforts to make young people understand that drug
abuse is illegal, dangerous and wrong.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Oil Sector Needs 90 b Dollar in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- An oil expert has predicted
Iran needs about 90 billion dollars of investment for the oil
industry in the coming 10 years to preserve its present output,
local daily Etelaat reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Iranian Economists' Association Manouchehr
Farhang made the remark at a monthly gathering of the association,
adding that Iran enjoys 10 percent of the world's oil reserves and
20 percent of the world's gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
At present, Iran has a crude production of 3.6 million barrels
per day (bpd) and the figure will be increased to 3.94 million bpd
as of next year under the new quota made by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last month.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said earlier that his
country expected 5 billion dollars of investment for onshore and
offshore oil fields every year after the National Iranian Oil
Company (NIOC) signed a buyback agreement with the French Total in
September.
</P>
<P>
Farhang said that the buyback agreement between NIOC and Total
would help better exploit the country's oil and gas resources and
consolidate the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The buyback agreement will inject 2 billion dollars by Total
into Iran's South Pars gas field project, he said, encouraging the
Iranian government to sign more buyback agreements with foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Once the South Pars gas field project takes wing, it will
produce 80,000 barrels per day of natural gas and the main loan
plus interests will be repaid to the foreign side within a period
of seven years," Farhang said. That gas field was reported to have
240 trillion cubic feet of gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the U.S. economic sanctions on Iran, saying "had we
not been under sanctions, it would have been better to sign a
joint capital investment venture with a foreign company so that
the foreign partner would have been committed to guarantee its
execution and share the profits as well as the losses."
</P>
<P>
However, former deputy oil minister for international affairs,
Hadi Nejat Husseinian, told the gathering that the reason for the
lack of foreign joint investment in Iran's oil projects was that
the country's laws do not allow foreign participation in such
projects.
</P>
<P>
This is aimed at protecting Iran's national sovereignty over
these projects, he explained, by signing buyback agreements, Iran
would be the sole owner of the project whereas in a joint venture
both partners will work until the project is exhausted.
</P>
<P>
The IEA was formed five years ago with members from professors
and students of economic sciences. It holds monthly meetings to
discuss the country's economic issues.

<HEADLINE> German, Italian Insurance Giants Strike Deal Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest insurance
company Allianz AG and its Italian counterpart, Assicurazioni
Generali SpA, have struck a deal over the takeover of the third
largest French insurer Assurances Generales de France SA (AGF),
said news reports today.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal announced by the companies Friday evening,
Allianz will buy AGF for 320 French francs (53.60 U.S. dollars) a
share and sell part of AGF's newly-acquired insurance group Athena
to Generali.
</P>
<P>
Allianz, which is relatively weak in France, would become the
second biggest insurer in the country under the arrangement,
analysts said. The deal could also allow Allianz to recapture the
title as Europe's largest insurer it lost last year after the
merger of French insurers Axa SA and Union des Assurances de
France.
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Generali will also buy the shares owned by
Allianz and AGF in the Aachener and Muenchener Beteiligungs AG,
giving Generali a controlling stake in the third-largest insurer
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
The latest agreement represented a cease-fire between Allianz
and Generali which were battling with each other to take over AGF
over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Both Allianz and Generali said today that they were satisfied
with the accord because it would gave them a better position in
France and Germany respectively.
</P>
<P>
The takeover deal over AGF is also the latest of a series of
acquisitions in the European insurance industry in the past year
as companies rushed to prepare themselves for a wider single
market to be ushered in by the planned single European currency,
the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The planned introduction of the Euro in 1999 would make it
easier for companies to sell the same products in countries that
share the currency and eliminate exchange-rate costs in the
region, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They also predicted that only a handful of firms would dominate
Europe's lucrative insurance business in the future.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Report on Rushdie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran today denied its reported
readiness to issue a written guarantee not to make any attempt on
the lift of British writer Salman Rushdie, who was condemned to
death by Iran's late spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The British Independent newspaper reported Iran's Minister of
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani has said Tehran
is ready to issue such a guarantee to spare the life of Rushdie,
accused of blasphemy to Islam for his novel the "Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance
said Mohajerani only reiterated the country's stand that the
decree by Khomeini is irrevocable, although the Iranian government
would not take actions against Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the British daily for "distorting"
Mohajerani's remarks, saying "this new ploy has long been rejected
by Iranian and even European public opinions."
</P>
<P>
"Considering Iran's unambiguous stance on the issue, a written
guarantee in this regard has long been out of the question," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Khomeini issued a religious order against Rushdie's life in
1989 after deeming the author's novel blasphemous to Islam. The
British writer has been forced to live under heavy protection of
the British police.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's issue has been one of the most sticking problems
hampering the development of relations between Iran and the
European countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian press, Mohajerani, during his interview
with the Independent, hoped Iran and the European Union (EU) would
restart negotiations on the death sentence on Rushdie following
the end of their diplomatic row last month.
</P>
<P>
The EU states had recalled their envoys from Tehran in protest
after a Berlin Court in April accused Iranian leadership of
involvement in the murder of two dissidents and sponsoring "state
terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Arrest of Iranian in Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry today
summoned Azerbaijani ambassador to Tehran to protest the arrest of
the head of the Union of Iranian Merchants in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, the
ministry termed the accusations against the Iranian citizen
Abdul-Hussein Moeenzadeh as "unfounded" and demanded his immediate
release.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Moeenzadeh was imprisoned two week ago
and he went on a hunger strike for one week. However, no
information is so far available about the charges against the
Iranian national in Baku.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian embassy in Baku also lodged protest to the arrest
and urged for immediate release of Moeenzadeh.

<HEADLINE> Over 35 Million Ethiopians Risk Iodine Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 35 million
Ethiopians, about 60 percent of the population, are at risk of
iodine deficiency diseases, the Ethiopian News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting statistics from the Ethiopian Ministry of Health, the
report said some 26 persons in every 100 people in Ethiopia will
be found to have goitre.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 pre-natal deaths are caused by severe iodine
deficiency in pregnant women annually, said the report.
</P>
<P>
As Ethiopia's environment is iodine poor, correction has to be
achieved through iodine supplementation. Ethiopia has cooperated
with the government of Eritrea, with the assistance from the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), to ensure that all salt
coming in from Eritrea is iodine at the souse.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is strengthening community based monitoring
systems to ensure availability of iodized salt at the consumer
levels, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Emir Opens 18th GCC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah today opened the 18th summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) by calling for "collective defense" to
deal with dangers in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, the emir called on his GCC
colleagues to realize the principle of collective defense "and
total military build-up to our capabilities in order to withstand
dangers."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the six GCC member states - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - began
their three-day meeting to discuss a host of issues of political,
economic and security concerns.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti emir said "the concept of security to our people
and our countries ... is based on the defense of our lands, the
preservation of our society, and the protection of our wealth."
</P>
<P>
He said the GCC states would continue to commit themselves to
preservation of international norms based on mutual respect and
peace.
</P>
<P>
He said GCC states have chosen a comprehensive peace in the
region as a strategic option, and blamed Israel for the stalemate
of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the family of nations of the world to play a
decisive role and stand up to the policies of Israel," he said,
adding that peace cannot be achieved except by the return of all
occupied territories and the establishment of a Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital."
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of failing to commit itself to peace
agreements signed with the Arab states, and of bringing the peace
march to a standstill by continuing the construction of
controversial Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Turning to relations with Iran, he said "I felt that a new era
has begun to emerge in our neighborly relations, based on
brotherhood, mutual respect and non-interference in internal
affairs and rejection of the use of force or the threat to use it.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the disputed islands between Iran and the UAE near
the strategic Strait of Hormuz, he reiterated a call on Tehran to
resolve the issue through peaceful channels.
</P>
<P>
The emir also accused Iraq of evading to comply with the U.N.
resolutions pertinent to its 1990 invasion of the small Gulf
emirate.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the cause of the sufferings of the Iraqi people
under U.N. economic sanctions to Baghdad's tactics, saying "we
sympathize with them (Iraqi people) and hope that the reasons for
the continuation of their suffering will disappear by the
regime's compliance with all relevant resolutions."
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, the GCC leaders went into a
closed-door session and due to resume deliberations of the agenda
on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Asks Qataris to Get Entry Visas in Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt told Qatar today that
Qatari nationals who want to go to Egypt must apply for entry
visas in advance starting from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari news agency (QNA) monitored here quoted a statement
of the Egyptian Embassy in Doha as saying that "Egyptian
authorities related decided to issue entry visas in advance to
bearers of all categories of Qatari passports starting from
December 21, 1997."
</P>
<P>
The Qatari government asked its citizens to "get required visa
before departure (for Egypt)" shortly after the issue of the
Egyptian statement, QNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Qatari people could obtain entry visas after they
arrived in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the change indicated that the two countries
failed to improve their relations despite the mediation of Saudi
Arabia earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa al-Thani held talks in Riyadh, capital of Saudi
Arabia, in a bid to end a war of words between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries deteriorated in October
when Egypt was ready to boycott the fourth Middle East and North
African economic conference in Doha.
</P>
<P>
Qatar responded with a ban on the entry of Egyptian nationals
alongside other nine countries as a security precaution for the
Doha conference, infuriating Cairo and other Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to their row were Qatar's charges that Egypt had
plotted the 1996 coup attempt to topple the Qatari government.
Cairo denied the charges and demanded for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
After the talks of their heads of state, both Egypt and Qatar
claimed that their relations were improved.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Process near Dead End: Moussa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa warned today that the Mideast peace process is grinding to
a "dead end," the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remark after submitting a report to President
Hosni Mubarak on the results of the eighth Islamic summit held in
Iran on December 9-11 as well as the results of his recent
European tour of Germany and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that "The statements by Israeli Premier
Benjamin Netanyahu on regarding the West Bank as part of Israel
are considered, if true, a major setback."
</P>
<P>
On if Netanyahu's statements had driven the peace process to a
dead end, Moussa said that "the dead end was very close."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza are occupied
lands and the U.N. Resolution 242 prohibits the acquisition of
land by force, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also noted that Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat, who is in Cairo for a two-day visit, said today
that there is no breakthrough in the peace march because of the
Israeli intransigent stance.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have broken down
since March over the Israeli settlement building in East Jerusalem
and long overdue troop pullout from the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The recent U.S. bid to reactivate the peace process failed to
fix the time and scope of the Israeli further redeployment in the
West Bank. As a result, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said that she will propose to President Bill Clinton to meet with
Arafat and Netanyahu in Washington in January.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen arrived here this afternoon from
Beirut for a two-day official visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Qian told reporters that he
was very glad to visit Syria, the second leg of his Mideast tour
which has taken him to Lebanon, and will take him to Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule areas and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
China and Syria are friendly countries whose peoples are linked
together by a deep friendship, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He added that since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1956, their friendship and cooperation have developed
satisfactorily, and their mutual support on international and
regional issues was useful to both sides.
</P>
<P>
During his visit he would hold talks with his Syrian

<HEADLINE> Some Shanghai People Prefer Having Ashes Scattered Into Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The ashes of 878 Shanghai
people were scattered out to sea this year after they were
cremated as they had chosen, and this was the largest number for
any area in China.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, which is the economic, financial and cultural center
of the country, is also taking a lead in changing funeral
practices. The cremation rate of the local residents has been
about 100 percent since the early 1960s, but the number of methods
of interment of ashes has grown, and that includes burial at grave
sites, being put in mausoleums, and being buried under a tree.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Shanghai has had 23 collective funeral services at
sea, six of them this year, and the number of people has increased
three-fold since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"I think the scattering of Deng Xiaoping's ashes into the sea
has set a good example for our people," said Yu Kangwei, head of
the city's funeral and interment administration.
</P>
<P>
The scattering of ashes will be advertised and encouraged,
according to the Shanghai City Funeral and Interment Management
Regulations, which will go into effect on January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the scattering of ashes among nature may
become a very popular choice of Shanghai people in future, when
they die.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Says Northern City Should Be Modern Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, during a
two-day visit to the northern city of Tianjin, told the local
government that they should work harder to build it into a
modernized port city and economic center.
</P>
<P>
The city is a municipality under the direct jurisdiction of the
central government, on the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
It needs an industrial development plan, based solidly on the
city's actual conditions and should play a larger role in the
regional and national economy, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the city has maintained double-digit
growth in its GDP and low inflation, and the highest GDP, incomes,
gross industrial output, and foreign investment for any coastal
city in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The coastal area of Tianjin must concentrate on new technology
and marketable products, Li said, pointing out that the country's
markets are undergoing great changes in supply and demand for many
products, with supply sometimes exceeding demand, causing
difficulties for rural and township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin needs to improve management and technology in township
enterprises to make sure they can survive market competition, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the company of State Councillor Luo Gan and Tianjin's Mayor
Zhang Lichang, Li visited the new Beiping-Tianjin Campaign Museum,
a museum for Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng Yingchao, which is under
construction, the city's container port, the Tianjin Economic and
Technological Development Zone, and the bonded zone.
</P>
<P>
Li and his wife Zhu Lin donated 1,000 yuan to the museum for
Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lin also donated a handbag used by Deng Yingchao that was
later given to her.

<HEADLINE> GCC States Urged to Take New Policy towards Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian daily today urged
the ongoing summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to adopt
a new policy towards Iran, which has made a series of goodwill
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times, which is believed to have good connection with
the Foreign Ministry, said the GCC states must prepare ground for
closer ties with Iran in all fields in the new atmosphere,
particularly after the eighth Islamic summit held in Tehran on
December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has already suggested that it is ready to sign a
non-aggression pact with its Arab neighbors," it said, now the
ball is in the court of the GCC.
</P>
<P>
The daily stated that Iran also hopes that the GCC states
adopt a new approach to the "misunderstandings" between Iran and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the disputed islands in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Both Tehran and Abu Dhabi claimed full sovereignty over the
islands of Abu Musa, the greater and the lesser Tumbs despite
their agreement to co-rule them following the British withdrawal
from the region in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has said that Iran is ready
to settle the issue with the UAE through negotiations at any
level, the paper said, the GCC should advise the UAE to respond.
</P>
<P>
The Khatami government has taken a series of steps to show
Tehran's goodwill for friendly relations and cooperation with the
Gulf sheikdoms, and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made a
week-long tour of the six states in November.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times called on the GCC members to work for unity among
Muslim countries, saying it is not possible for the Muslims to
play an effective role in the world unless they first remove
differences among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The paper said GCC members have had a "successful gathering" at
the Islamic summit, and now the GCC summit is an appropriate
forum to close ranks among a limited number of Muslim countries,
paving the way for a broader cooperation among Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The GCC summit was opened in Kuwait Saturday, which showed
willingness to improve ties with Iran.

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions In China's Non-State Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- In China's non-state sector,
there are now about 153,000 trade unions in overseas-funded,
private, and rural businesses.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions in those so-called "new economic organizations"
covered 14.67 million workers by the end of September this year,
said Yang Xingfu, vice-chairman of the All China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU), at a conference in Shanghai today. These
types of businesses employ 113.6 million in all.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that these new organizations still have a lot of
problems, with their more complicated labor relations, and some
have seriously infringed upon employees' rights and interests, so
establishing trade unions in these business is an urgent matter
for stable and harmonious labor relations, because they safeguard
workers' rights and interests and promote the healthy development.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one provinces have formulated regulations for trade
unions in overseas-funded businesses, Yang said, and a negotiation
and contract system has been set up in 17,789 overseas-funded
businesses, 6,085 private ones, and 15,396 rural ones.
</P>
<P>
The chairmen of trade unions in 8,865 overseas-funded
businesses are members of the board of directors or attend board
meetings as non-voting members.

TEHRAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Due to heavy rain and
snow in this cold winter, wild animals are leaving their
natural habitats and seeking shelters in nearby villages and

<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Ducks stunned Sichuan
Pandas 70-65 in a ninth-round match of the Chinese Basketball
Association first division league here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pandas held most of the possession of the game but lost their
forms midway into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Ba Teer, who paired with Shan Tao for Ducks' double-center
tactics, scored eight of his 12 points in the first half, and
grabbed the game-high 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan missed seven of eight attempts in their free-throws for
a 35-all tie before the breaker.
</P>
<P>
The Ducks made a late 15-0 run midway in the second half after
Pandas clawed back for 47-50 by scoring 11 points in a row.
</P>
<P>
L. Arstone of Ducks and Zhu Dong of Pandas led their teams in
scoring, both 19 points.

<P>
John Spencer, who scratched the most rebounds last year, fouled
four times earlier into the match and had to sit on the beach for
the most time.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's coach Min Lulei said after the match, "Sichuan took
hold of the match for the most time. I'm not satiesfied with my
players either in the post or outside off the line."
</P>

"Our double-center tactics didn't result in the expected
outcomes against Sichuan's defence," coach Min added.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Expects New Move on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said today that he expected the most important initiative
for a settlement of the Cyprus problem emerge after February's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally in a village some 30 kilometers west of
capital Nicosia, Clerides said "Cyprus will enter a most decisive
period for its future after the elections because the most
important initiative in the history of the Cyprus question will
culminate."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, accession negotiations will start
with the European Union (EU) in March 1998 according to a decision
earlier this month by EU leaders at the Luxembourg summit.
</P>
<P>
"We need to handle the situation in a responsible and delicate
manner, with wisdom and resolve, in order to achieve the result we
want," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a Cyprus settlement must be just and viable,
reunite the divided island, rid the country of the presence of
Turkish occupation troops and settlers and safeguard permanent
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Dominant Chinese Miss One Title at ITTF Pro-Tour GF in HK </HEADLINE>

<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Dominant Chinese had only
one out of the four titles eluded off their fingers as Vladimir
Samsonov from Belarus took the men's singles crown at the 1997
International Table Tennis Federation Pro-Tour Grand Finals which
closed here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, world championships runner-up this year and runner-up
at last year's Grand Finals, beat Chinese teenager sensation Wang
Liqin 21-16, 21-14, 14-21, 21-17 in the final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov had won over Wang three times and lost once in their
four previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
Chinese swept all the four titles at last year's inaugural ITTF
Pro-Tour Grand Finals back in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to win (the title) and, with this trophy, it came
out a perfect year for me," said Samsonov after his victory.
</P>
<P>
"Wang did quite well for some points today. As he is so young
and promising, he can surely do much better in the future," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a bit nervous and too anxcious to win today," an obviously
disappointed Wang said after the title clash.
</P>
<P>
China's head coach Cai Zhenhua had predicted before the final
that a lack of international experience set a gloomy background
for the Chinese teenager while good receiving would play a key
role if he was to win.
</P>
<P>
But Cai said he felt happy with his players, "considering that
they had been so tired after so heavy a schedule for this year and
that they had come into the Grand Finals here in under-par shape."
</P>
<P>
China's world number two Li Ju won over compatriot Wang Nan
three games to one to take the women's singles title Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chinese also won the doubles titles on Sunday, with Kong
Linghui and Liu Guoliang in the men's and Li Ju and Wang Nan in
the women's.

World number two and top seed Li Ju beat world championships
runner-up and world number three Wang Nan 23-25, 21-5, 21-16,
21-17 in an all-Chinese women's singles final Sunday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hashimoto's Reforms Beset With Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has found himself beset with mountainous difficulties to
push through his ambitious reform program.
</P>
<P>
Unveiled in January, the reform program covers six areas --
national bureaucracy, fiscal and economic structures, monetary,
and social welfare and educational systems.
</P>
<P>
Its full implementation, if successful, was expected to bring
about a third rejuvenation to the country following the Meiji
Restoration and its post-war reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
However, obstruction from various circles, including
Hashimoto's own ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has weighed
down every of his reform endeavor ever since.
</P>
<P>
In September, reelected as LDP president for a second two-year
term, Hashimoto reiterated his resolve for the reforms,
particularly in administrative and fiscal areas.
</P>
<P>
"Without administrative reform, I don't think we can gain the
trust of the people," the prime minister said in a major policy
speech after launching his new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The administrative reform is to establish a simple, more
efficient and transparent system for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
To meet this end, Hashimoto must perform a major operation on
the country's decades-old, over-staffed and rigid bureaucracy,
which Hashimoto said has shown "serious limitations."
</P>
<P>
But the reform drive has met fierce resistance even at the
stage of mapping out a blueprint.
</P>
<P>
In its plan, the Hashimoto cabinet proposed to privatize the
Posts and Telecommunications Ministry's postal insurance services,
while maintaining its mail services as state-run and keeping its
postal savings services as state-run for the time being, with an
eye toward eventual privatization.
</P>
<P>
Upon releasing the plan, the proposals were strongly opposed by
"zoku-giin," or special interest lawmakers from the LDP and its
two non-cabinet allies, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the
New Party Sakigake, who have great concern with the interests of
the ministry and post offices nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of wrangling to defend various conflicting special
interest groups among bureaucrats and lawmakers, Hashimoto
eventually backed off on the reform of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He was forced to yield to calls for a commitment that the three
postal services will never be privatized, thus winning the support
of the LDP and its two non-cabinet allies.
</P>
<P>
While abandoning the initial proposal to privatize some of the
postal services, Hashimoto offered to transfer from the ministry
the mail delivery, postal savings, and postal life insurance
services simultaneously to a new public corporation.
</P>
<P>
The new public corporation, proposed by the Administrative
Reform Council, would control its own profits and use a standard
corporate accounting system. Its employees would enjoy the status
of public servants.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Rethink Stance on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioanuis Kasoulides has called on Turkey to reconsider its
position on Cyprus and work toward a settlement of the protracted
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today upon his return from a ministerial meeting of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
Kasoulides said Turkey showed displeasure in its reaction to the
European Union's (EU) decision to start accession negotiations
with Cyprus, not Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has announced to end political dialogue with the EU in
retaliation for its decision last week in Luxembourg to exclude
Turkey from the enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
It also threatened to integrate northern Cyprus controlled by
Turkish-Cypriots if the EU goes ahead with membership talks with
the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "the Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"It must be pointed out, and we do that to our European
partners as well as the U.S., that Turkey has never displayed
political will to settle the problem in Cyprus," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
The EU's stance, he added, is not at all anti-Turkish, it is
just and appropriate in that it offers something to Turkey and
demands nothing more than what is required of other applicant
countries.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if Europe firmly maintains this position on
Cyprus, sooner or later, Turkey will understand the need to allow
a Cyprus solution to be reached before the next EU enlargement,"
Kasoulides pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, noted that the international community
should respond in a forceful manner if Turkey proceeds with plans
to integrate Cyprus' northern part.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to believe that no such move will take place on
the part of Turkey. If it does, we shall respond accordingly," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE>   Roundup: Hashimoto's Reforms Beset With Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With numerous compromises made under the pressures, the
Administrative Reform Council, after 12 months of public hearings,
debates and political horse-trading, managed to finalize a report
on December 3, proposing to streamline the current 22 government
ministries and agencies to 13 by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, skirted round the crucial reform of the
Finance Ministry under pressure from the ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was squeezed between coalition partners and Finance
Ministry officials in his attempt to separate the ministry's
fiscal and financial functions.
</P>
<P>
The LDP's two allies demanded that the LDP respect an agreement
reached last year on complete separation. But Finance Ministry
officials, in a bid to maintain their traditional turfs, have
insisted on the ministry's authority over both fiscal policies and
the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who lacks a solid factional base within his own
party and has to maintain the current tripartite coalition, had no
choice but to shelve the issue.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prime minister was also compelled to give up
his ideas of dividing the functions of the Construction Ministry
due to strong resistance from party bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said whether Hashimoto is able to actually streamline
the bureaucracy remains uncertain because the reform panel has set
no specific measures on how to slash the functions and powers of
the government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
As the Nihon Keizai Shimbun commented, the administrative
reform will not go any far but result in the "overlapping" of the
central government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Sadatoshi Ozato, head of the Management and Coordination
Agency, told a press conference soon after the release of the
government's reform plan that gaining legislative approval will
pose a crucial test for Hashimoto's administrative reform.
</P>
<P>
What he hinted was that when the bill is submitted to the next
Diet, or parliament, to be convened next January for passage, it
will meet head-on with opposition from bureaucrats and "zoku-giin."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, by and large, Hashimoto's leadership on
administrative reform toward a more slender bureaucracy for the
21st century remains at stake.
</P>
<P>
As far as the fiscal reform is concerned, Japan's House of
Councillors passed on November 28 a bill aimed at rebuilding the
debt-ridden national coffers by the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The law calls for the government to stop issuing
deficit-covering government bonds by fiscal 2003, so as to restore
the country's financial health.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that the aggregate amount of central and
local government deficits should be reduced to less than 3 percent
of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
To achieve these targets, the government is required to slash 7
percent of its spending in fiscal 1998 and to limit the growth of
social welfare spending to less than 300 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
Efforts in this regard also face considerable difficulties. The
sluggish Japanese economy and successive business failures in the
financial sector have given rise to strong calls for a large tax
cut and the use of public funds to help financial institutions
pull out of the bad loan mess.
</P>
<P>
All these could threaten to soon cripple the budget-cutting
package, or at least part of it. If it happens, Hashimoto's grip
on power will be further loosened.
</P>
<P>
Given the status quo, analysts said the passage of fiscal
reform bill has presented Hashimoto a ticking political time
bomb.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Major Progress in Sino-US, Sino-Russian Ties in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Progress in Sino-US and
Sino-Russian ties was a conspicuous part of this year's
international relations, with frequent contacts between big
powers' leaders.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, Sino-US ties were stymied by
issues like Taiwan, human rights, and weapons proliferation and
made slow progress. The stalemate was not in the two peoples'
interest, nor was it in keeping with world trends in peace and
development. A major problem for China and the United States
remained how to transcend these differences, expand co-operation,
avoid confrontation, and establish a stable and healthy
relationship.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Sino-US political, economic, and military
exchanges have clearly increased this year. Major US political
figures like Vice-President Al Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich have visited
China, paving the way for the Sino-US summit.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's visit to the US in October was a new
stage in Sino-US ties. During the visit, the two countries issued
the China-US Joint Statement, an important document for ties after
the three previous joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement dealt with major common interests and their
commitment to establish a constructive strategic partnership, and
the basic status of the three joint communiques in developing
ties. It says that China and the US handle bilateral ties in a
global and strategic way and their problems in a spirit of
equality and seeking common ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian relations have also made progress, with five joint
statements signed by President Jiang Zemin and President Boris
Yeltsin over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Following an announcement last year about establishing a
strategic co-operative partnership for the next century,
Presidents Jiang and Yeltsin decided in Moscow in April of this
year that the two nations would strive to develop
multi-polarization and a new international order.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that a new long-term Sino-Russian
relationship in keeping with international law, which is not
directed at a third party, is a major part of a new international
order.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Major Progress in Sino-US, Sino-Russian Ties in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During President Yeltsin's China visit in November, the two
presidents announced the completion of demarcation work on 4,000
km of the eastern section of the Sino-Russian border, which is
significant for Sino-Russian relations and an example for the
international community for settling complicated issues left over
from the past through peaceful talks.
</P>
<P>
The partnerships to be established between China and the US and
between China and Russia have been remarkable in overcoming
hostilities during the Cold War. This new partnership has meant
substantial progress in Sino-US and Sino-Russian co-operation,
resulting in better interaction between them and other countries
and a positive impact on multi-polarization and the healthy
development of international relations.
</P>
<P>
The regular exchanges of visits by the presidents and cabinets
of China, the US, and Russia have created better conditions for
growth in relations.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the new breakthrough in Sino-US ties does not mean
the end of differences, and contradictions in some issues are
still expected to appear to some extent because of differences in
social systems, values, histories, and levels of economic
development. And, Sino-Russian economic ties are still far from
where they should be, and world peace and development still face
many challenges. There is still a lot to do in increasing Sino-US
and Sino-Russian co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The major progress in Sino-US and Sino-Russian ties in 1997
will be seen in international relations in future, and the
pragmatic manner of seeking common ground while laying aside
differences, which were used by the three countries' leaders in
dealing with relations, will serve as an important model of how to
establish state-to-state relations.

</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
and member of the Secretariat of the Party's Central Committee,

line, or those who only care for personal interests or who do not
abide by Party discipline and do nothing serious," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu called on Party committees and leading officials to adhere
to the Party's principle of standards for leading officials and to
choose such officials in a fair way, and especially in promoting
outstanding younger ones.
</P>
<P>
"We must try to create an open, equal, and competitive
environment for selecting personnel to provide institutional
guarantees that allow outstanding people to show their ability,"
he said, and that recommendations from ordinary people must be
considered by the Party in appointing leading officials, and the
assessment system must be improved.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the the Party should have stricter discipline,
something that should start with leading officials.

Committee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Visit Kenya Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will pay an official visit to Kenya as early as March or April if
his Kenyan counterpart Daniel arap Moi wins the coming poll, the
independent East African Standard newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department told the newspaper's reporter John
Knight who works in Los Angeles, that Nairobi will be the first
destination of Clinton's African tour scheduled for the first
half of 1998, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, if Moi fails to win, "everything may have to be
re-assessed. Who can say?" Knight quoted a senior spokesman in
the U.S. State Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Kenyan President, who is widely expected to win
another five-year term in the December 29 poll, is regarded as
one of the United States' most reliable friends in Africa and a
world class statesman with whom business can be done, the report
claimed.
</P>
<P>
No details of the Clinton visit will be announced until after
the election.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid her visit to
seven countries in Africa on December 9-15 to pave the way for
President Clinton's tour of Africa next year and also to try to
establish "real partnership" with African countries.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, which is to hold general elections soon, was not
included in the trip of Albright.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rises to 4.07 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation increased by 0.11 percentage points to cross the
four-percent mark to touch 4.07 for the week ended on December 6,
Press Trust of India (PTI) said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation, based on wholesale price index, rose to 4.07
percent from 3.96 percent in the previous week but much lower than
the 7.15 percent for the corresponding week last year.
</P>
<P>
The index for "all commodities" also rose by 1.4 percent during
the week to 332.4 (provisional) as against 331.0 (provisional) for
the previous week. The final index for "all commodities" for the
week stood at 331.9 as against 330.7 in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Economists have been suggesting an upturn in inflation because
of the increase in money supply in the second half of the current
fiscal year (April 1,1997-March 31, 1998). Leading economists said
that the low level of inflation was mainly due to slackening of
demand in the economy.

<HEADLINE> South China Island Province Puts Priority on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- South China's island province
of Hainan has placed top priority on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's less-polluted areas, the island province will
try to avoid the "treatment after pollution" path and give equal
priority to economic development and environmental protection, a
local government official said.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, one of China's five special economic zones, has passed
more than 20 laws and sets of regulations concerning the
environment and resources protection since it became a province in
1988. Nineteen cities and counties in the province have also
passed more than 60 sets of local regulations and rules to ensure
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province has invested nearly 100
million yuan on pollution clean-ups at hundreds of enterprises.
The discharge of wastes -- gas, water and solids -- per unit of
gross domestic product (GDP) is lower than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has closed 75 small factories that were polluters to
eliminate 5,600 tons of waste water, 18 million cubic meters of
waste gas, and 84 million tons of solid waste.
</P>
<P>
The province has 1.7 million hectares of forests, with green
coverage accounting for 50.2 percent, which includes 866,000
hectares of tropical virgin forests considered among the best in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The province, the biggest special economic zone in China, has
been listed by the State Council as one of the 12 key
environmental protection areas during the 1996-2010 period.
</P>
<P>
Hainan annually attracts millions of tourists, both domestic
and overseas, and the province has invested 6 billion U.S. dollars
and made use of more than 30 billion yuan of domestic funds in the
past nine years.

NEW DELHI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- India's Bombay Stock

delist over 750 companies for their failure to pay up their dues
for the 1997-98 fiscal year (April 1,1997 -- March 31,1998).
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Sunday said that the BSE has issued

December 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
These companies were required to pay their annual fees by April
30 this year for the financial year, but despite repeated
reminders most of them failed to do so, BSE sources said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 769 companies, 106 are finance and investment companies

<HEADLINE> Ecological Farming on Waste Mountains Used to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Qianxi County in north
China's Hebei Province is learning to maximize the productivity of
its rugged mountain areas while developing ecologically sound
farming.
</P>
<P>
Located in the mountainous region of the province, harsh
geographical conditions are a major barrier to local economic
growth. The per-capita arable land in the county was less than
0.066 hectares before the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, people in the area have been transforming mountains
into terraced fields, where Chinese chestnuts and grain have been
intercropped.
</P>
<P>
At the foot of the mountains, Qianxi farmers have combined
apple and pear trees with grains. They have also planted pine and
scholar trees on the top of the mountains to further conserve
water and soil.
</P>
<P>
This "Mountain Enclosure Project," so named by local farmers,
has attracted 50 million yuan (six million U.S. dollars) in
investments.
</P>
<P>
The project has added 12,000 hectares of farmland and upgraded
6,000 hectares of low-yield fields. The mountain farming has
enhanced the county's annual grain capacity by seven million
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
It has also benefited the local ecology. Now, sideline products
from forestry, animal husbandry and aquatic breeding account for
66.8 percent of the total agricultural output, as opposed to 52.9
percent before the program was launched.
</P>
<P>
As the project widened its scope, such modern management
procedures as contracts and share-holding have been introduced to
define separate responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the county plans to encourage farmers to reclaim
remote mountain areas by auctioning. Farmers will have 30-to-50
years of rights to use the farmland they explore, during which
time taxes will be exempted up to a certain amount.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Authority Says Chances of Finding Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation Authority
of Singapore (CAAS) said Sunday that chances of finding any
survivors from the SilkAir MI185 crash near Palembang, Indonesia,
are now remote.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the CAAS made such an announcement
since search and rescue operation started last Friday night, hours
after the Boeing 737-300 went down with 94 passengers and seven
crew on board.
</P>
<P>
The CAAS also confirmed at a press conference Sunday afternoon
that while three large parts of the wreckage have been recovered,
none of the main parts of the aircraft were found so far.
</P>
<P>
This confirmation was made in response to earlier news reports
here that the fuselage was found with trapped bodies inside.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a senior SilkAir public affairs official said that the
Boeing 737-300 that crashed had "not a single defect".
</P>
<P>
He said that the ten months old aircraft, leased from General
Electric Capital Auto Financial Services Inc. on February 14, this
year, underwent three checks called equalization checks.
</P>
<P>
These checks were said to be done every 100 flying hours as
recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
These checks took about two days each time to complete and once
completed, the documentation has to be approved by the CAAS, he
said, adding that even the most minor defect was recorded and this
aircraft had not a single defect.
</P>
<P>
The last check for the aircraft was done on December 9, only
ten days before it crashed.

BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China will spend about 10
million US dollars on a national data network next year for the
domestic telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
The US's Lucent Technologies announced today that it has signed
a contract with the Telecommunications Directorate under the
Chinese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to build the data
network based on the cellular digital packet data (CDPD)
technology.
</P>
<P>
The company will use the CDPD system for the ministry's data
network, China Radio Data Network. It has mobile data intermediate
systems in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and will go into
operation in six cities in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The CDPD can make people's day-to-day lives more convenient by
adding mobility to virtually any business that has a mobile work
force, according to Douglas Kirkpatrick, vice president of Lucent
Technologies (China) Company's network wireless systems division,
and the CDPD technology may allow the volume of data transmitted
over wireless networks to exceed the amount of voice traffic.
</P>
<P>
He says that users can obtain any data they want at any place
that has access to CDPD service, which is expected to be available
in most Chinese cities in the near future.

NEW DELHI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral said Sunday that the biggest challenge before the
country is to convert "coalition reality into a coalition
culture."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of workers of Janata Dal, the main

southeastern India, Gujral said, "coalition is a political reality
and the task is how to build a coalition culture. A single party
rule in the country is not possible."
</P>
<P>
He further said that in a single party government the leader
would speak and others would follow. But in a coalition
government, a matter was debated for almost 15 hours before
arriving at a decision. "Coalition and consensus are two sides of
the same coin," he added.
</P>
<P>
"During our coalition experiment, although the cabinet was
attended by 14 parties forming the United Front, there was not a
single occasion when the decision was not taken unanimously,
despite earlier differences," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Continues to Discuss Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet began
another session this morning to discuss its troop redeployment in
the West Bank, according to the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
At today's session, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to
brief the cabinet on his last Thursday's meeting with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Paris, in which the
two reportedly focused their attention on the linkage between
further Israeli redeployment and security guarantees from the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The session will also provide another opportunity to close the
gaps between various ministers' assessments of the amount of
territory Israel can afford to transfer to the PNA's control, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
But "it will take more time, probably until January 15 next
year, for them to reach a consensus," it added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu first proposed Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank at the end of November, but till now the Israeli
cabinet could not reach its final decision on how many territory
Israel could hand over to the PNA in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon suggested Israel
would have a 20 kilometer wide security zone in the Jordan River
Valley and another seven-to-10 kilometer wide security zone along
the 1949 Armistice Line on the western side of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Besides that, he also suggested to build several
Israeli-controlled "strategic roads" to cut the West Bank into
blocs.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharon's plan, Israel would still control about 70
percent of the West Bank in the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu, together with Foreign Minister David Levy, was
reported to favor the plan proposed by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, who recommended narrowing the width of the two planned
security zones to three to six kilometers and seven to 10
kilometers respectively.
</P>
<P>
Under Mordechai's proposal, Israel will retain control over
50-55 percent of the territories in the final settlement.

<P>
TIANJIN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Local authorities in Tianjin,
a major port city in north China, have stepped up efforts to
protect the rights of laborers by helping them recover delayed
salaries and other financial losses.
</P>
<P>
So far, 62 local work units that have violated relevant laws
and regulations in delaying the payment to their laborers
according to law have been punished, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has issued or revised 12 local laws to protect the
rights of local laborers, and 598 local people have been appointed
as full-time or part-time labor supervisors.
</P>
<P>
This year, local authorities have inspected salary and pension
records, the distribution of money to needy families, the
employment of laborers in private enterprises, and unemployment
funds.
</P>
<P>
During the check-up, 59 unlawful job agencies were canceled and
19 under-age laborers dismissed. In the meantime, 38,700 people
who did not sign their work contract with the employers have been
asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
A total of 650,000 yuan illegally collected by some work units
from their employees as "honest money" has been paid back to
laborers, while 2.35 million yuan of salaries due have been paid
to employees.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, 5,490 work units had been inspected,
while officials had received 2,145 calls, letters and visits by

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Insists on S. Leone Junta's Quit on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- West African countries have
reaffirmed their steadfast demand that the military junta in
Sierra Leone return power to ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
on April 22 next year as agreed.
</P>
<P>
The restatement, made by the ECOWAS committee of five on
Sierra Leone in Abuja Saturday, followed the threat from the
junta leader Major Johnny Paul Koroma to delay the hand-over.
</P>
<P>
Koroma said Friday that he was unlikely to honor the hand-over
deadline in view of delay in disarming combatants in the
embattled country.
</P>
<P>
Koroma's warning met with strong opposition from the
committee, set up by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) to coordinate the restoration of the legitmate
government of Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in the capital of Nigeria Saturday, the committee
stressed the need to adhere strictly to the time table of the
Conakry peace accord which fixes both the date of hand-over and
disarmament, among other things.
</P>
<P>
According to a 16-point communique issued at the end of the
meeting, the ECOWAS-brokered peace plan remains the best
framework for the restoration of peace and constitutional order
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there had been some violations of the ECOWAS and
United Nations sanctions imposed on the junta, the committee
called for strict adherance to the sanction.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising foreign ministers of Nigeria, Ghana,
Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia, called on those harboring
members of the military junta, their families and all others on
the restricted list to repartriate such persons to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It mandated the ECOWAS peace-keeping force known as Ecomog to
close the airstrip at Mabguraka recently upgraded to a
full-fledged airport by the junta.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the illegal regime is using the
airport for the importation of arms and other supplies in
violation of the sanctions and embargo against it.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged the U.N. Security Council to accelerat
efforts aimed at deploying a U.N. military observer's mission to
Sierra Leone and called on member states to contribute urgently
more troops to enhance the Ecomog operational capacity in that
country.
</P>
<P>
Deploring the incessant and unprovoked attacks on Ecomog
forces, the committee reaffirmed the right Ecomog forces to
defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
On the notice of the Liberia's government's notice to the
11,000-strong Ecomog to leave the country by February 2 next
year, the committee said Ecomog's departure would have
implications for the implementation on the ECOWAS peace plan in

<P>
DHAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people have died in
cold spell sweeping across Bangladesh during the past two days,
local press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Three people died on Saturday, and ten died on Friday, mainly
in the northern districts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city, where the lowest temperature was recorded
at 13 degree Celsius Saturday, people were wearing sweaters and
scarves to keep off cold.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts say the cold spell has become unbearable for
people as winds from the northeast and the northwest bringing the
cold continued to remain active.
</P>
<P>
The presence of moisture, a result of the rainfall a week ago,
has added an extra chill to the air, they say.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, where snow is rare, the average highest and
lowest temperatures in winter (from December to February) are 26
degrees Celsius and 13 degrees Celsius respectively.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Company to Build Refinery in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian oil company has
agreed to build an oil refinery unit in Bangladesh to help the
South Asian country out of dependence on imported petroleum
products, a local newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Malaysia's state-run oil giant, Petronas,
negotiated in Dhaka last week with Bangladesh Petroleum
Corporation (BPC)
on installing a second unit of the Eastern Refinery, the sole
crude-refining plant in the country, the Independent daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
"They have agreed to raise the refining capacity of the Eastern
Refinery," BPC Chairman Fazlul Huq was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The current unit of the refinery, in the port city of
Chittagong, southeast Bangladesh, has a refining capacity of
31,000 barrels per day, which can only meet 40 percent of the
country's total demand for refined petroleum products of 3 million
metric tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The second unit of the refinery would have a capacity of 60,000
to 100,000 barrels per day, and would cost 300 million U.S.
dollars, according to Huq.
</P>
<P>
The total oil demand of the country will reach 4.5 million
metric tons in 2001 when the new refinery unit is expected to be
completed, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Hong
Kong totaled just 792,800 in November, down 22 percent from a year
ago, local press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The continued slump was led by a plunge in most Asian markets
which were plagued by financial hardships, said the Hong Kong
Tourist Association (HKTA).
</P>
<P>
The association's figures showed that Hong Kong's top and third
largest markets, Japan and Taiwan, dropped by 59.3 percent and
16.6 percent respectively while the decline in South and Southeast
Asia was 24.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
But tourists from Hong Kong's second largest market, the
China's inland areas, edged up 1.8 percent over a year ago to
reach 200,000. Long-haul markets, including America, Australia
and New Zealand, also recorded slight increases.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of this year, tourist arrivals totaled
9.6 million in Hong Kong, down 9.4 percent from the same period of
last year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Expects 1998 Better Year for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Information Minister
Bassem Al-Sabaa today voiced hope that his country would be able
to "make a leap" on the road to achieve regional peace in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In an interview this morning with the Egyptian Voice of Arabs
radio over telephone from Beirut, Sabaa said that realization of
any peace in the region should hinge on full liberalization of
lands from Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official is also critical of America's lack of
effectiveness in its current mediation between the Arabs and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. role in the Mideast peace process at present reflects
a desire to push forward talks on all tracks but until now there
is no sign of translating this desire (into action)," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose latest bid to
reactivate the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks has floundered,
said she expected 1998 will hold out better prospects for the
Mideast peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Sabaa said Israel's repeated attacks on south Lebanon are out
of its wish to make Lebanon "a scene for domestic and regional
problems."
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops have been launching strikes from the
1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in south Lebanon it carved
out in 1985 to protect its northern territories from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks have shown no
sign of a possible resumption since stalled in February 1996.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Boost Labor Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government will
take steps to boost its labor export, the Vietnam News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs
has been directed to draft a labor export plan to the year 2000,
emphasizing the practical steps needed to boost labor exports, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam considered labor export as an important step to solve
its problem of unemployment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new plan, the government will open the labor
market, allowing non-state economic sectors to engage in labor
export.
</P>
<P>
The policies will broaden and diversify job training and
foreign language teaching, develop more foreign labor outlets,
create conditions for Vietnamese workers to have access to job
training abroad, and allow workers to do several jobs.
</P>
<P>
The government will also trim back the administrative
procedures for labor export businesses and reduce the rate of
fees required for the export of labor or even exempt poor people
from such fees.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exported 12,661 workers in 1996, some 15.6 times more
than the figure in 1992, which was the first year of the new labor
export mechanism.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: OPEC to Produce More, Earn Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is expected to produce more
oil but earn less money in 1998 due to a widely believed
considerable decline in world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Last month, OPEC decided to increase its oil output by 10
percent in the coming new year to reach 27.5 million barrels per
day (bpd). However, the predicted decline in world oil prices
would make the increase not worth the candle.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports from world crude stocks showed that by the
middle of this month, Brent blend, the world's benchmark grade
loosened 20 percent to 17.1 U.S. dollars a barrel, the lowest in
the past 22 months compared with 22 dollars a barrel two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The prices were also nearly 12 percent down from this
year's averaged 19.43 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
A November report by the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) Strategic
Studies and Research Center predicted that OPEC's 10 members,
except Iraq, would lose at least 17.5 billion dollars in 1998 even
if prices could be luckily kept at the level of 17.5 dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
The report by the UAE, one of OPEC's major members, estimated
OPEC countries' oil earning at some 169.02 billion dollars in
1997 while their oil production at some 24.1 million barrels bpd.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the report said, OPEC's oil exports (except Iraq's)
would be no more than 167.26 billion dollars despite the increased
output.
</P>
<P>
Many oil experts expected even lower figures. They said the
down trend in world oil prices, which was triggered by growing
oversupply and compounded by OPEC's decision to increase output
will accelerate next year.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Ali, marketing manager in UAE's Abu Dhabi National
Oil Company, said since OPEC considered to increase its total oil
output, world oil prices have began to go downhill when fears
grew that a flood of oil would swamp markets next spring and
summer.
</P>
<P>
He said figures from world crude stocks showed that from
October to November, world oil prices sharply declined from 22
dollars a barrel to some 18 dollars a barrel, the psychologically
important level for world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC drove the last nail for the plunge trend and made prices
hit the lowest 17.1 dollars a barrel after it decided in Jakarta,
Indonesia last month to put the new cap on its members' oil
production, a decision giving buyers more confidence to bet on
ample supply in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, countries outside of OPEC are gearing up to produce
more catalyst for the oversupply next year.
</P>
<P>
An October report by the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an
authorized oil magazine, said though many oil field projects are
at risk or delay due to a shortage of oil rigs and other
technical supplies, non-OPEC countries could pump into world
markets 1.2 million to 1.4 million bpd of fresh oil next year.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has also been piling downward pressure on the markets in
recent days. Two weeks ago, Iraqi oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid said he hoped to resume oil exports in a "few weeks" but
only after Iraq and the U.N. agree on a distribution plan for food
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is currently allowed to sell 2 billion dollars worth of
oil every six months under the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food deal, which
enabled Iraq to get food and medicine for its people suffering
under the U.N.-imposed sanctions against its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
There was the prospect of a jump in the amount of oil Iraq is
allowed to sell. Iraq sold just under 700,000 barrels per day in
the first year of the deal and the U.N. might increase the amount
next year to 3 billion or 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another bearish factor that threatens OPEC's 1998 oil economy
is the slackened world demand caused by a currency crisis
spreading in Asia since the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
London-based Petroleum Argues, another oil magazine, said in
its latest report that Asian demand is expected to be downgraded
by 340,000 barrels per day for next year and may end up being cut
more if China is sucked into the crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the full impact of Asia's financial crisis caused by the
devaluation of currencies in South Korea and Thailand on oil
consumption remains unclear and analysts said it could slice
deeper into oil demand.
</P>
<P>
The region accounts for a quarter of world oil demand and
over the past five years has contributed nearly 50 percent of
global growth in crude demand.

MAPUTO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of the
Interior has denied that the government has legalized
prostitution in the country, local weekly "Domongo" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
He said Saturday prostitution has affected almost all
Mozambican cities and that the whole society should be
concerned over this issue.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that prostitution is a kind of crime,
noting that the police don't want to legalize prostitution and
what the police have done is aimed at cracking down on it.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the police in Maputo summoned 500 prostitutes to a
meeting and banned their presence at other areas except Bagamoyo
Road of the coastal business township of Baixa in the capital,
saying this will facilitate the police to protect them and their
customers from raids by criminals.
</P>
<P>
This move of the police was regarded by capital residents as
legalizing prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique declared prostitution as illegal after winning
independence in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills 120 in Zanzibar, Poor Sanitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Poor sanitation,
manifested by lack of toilets and waste disposal pits, has been
cited as a leading cause for the outbreak of cholera in Zanzibar
which has claimed 120 lives in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to Sunday News today, World Health Organization
(WHO)'s Acting Country Representative in Tanzania, Mohammed Amri,
said here on Saturday that 70.3 percent of households in Unguja
and Pemba, major islands of Zanzibar, have no toilets.
</P>
<P>
More than 54 percent of the Zanzibar residents are drawing
unpiped water, and the rest use piped water which is inadequately
treated.
</P>
<P>
Amri said most of Zanzibar, including the historic stone town,
is too dirty with faecal elements in pools and other stagnant
water areas.
</P>
<P>
He said the municipal authorities also seemed incapable of
handling refuse collection and disposal.
</P>
<P>
In the last 48 hours, some 248 cholera patients were
discharged, and yesterday afternoon 203 patients were still
staying at the Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, the largest medical
institution in Zanzibar, and at the three treatment camps at
Rahaleo, Magogoni and Kivunge.
</P>
<P>
WHO officials have prompted people with minor symptoms to rush
to hospitals for medical check.
</P>
<P>
A WHO delegation is expected to arrive in Zanzibar as part of
United Nations' long-term support program to eradicate cholera in
the Zanzibar isles and the entire Lake Victoria region, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Amri said Tanzania has recorded 32,000 cholera cases since
January this year, making it the worst hit country in Africa. The
continental figure is 64,000.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Chinese Port Plays Larger Role with New Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- With the completion of the
Nanning-Kunming Railway, China's southwestern trunk line,
Fangcheng Port in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has played a
more prominent role in the region's cargo trade.
</P>
<P>
The port is one of China's most important sea outlets to
Southeast Asia. Midwest provinces' foreign trade through the port
will save 2016 km in railway journey and 900 sea miles of
transport compared with that through the Shanghai Port, the
largest in China.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in 1995, the port handled total
cargo worth 219 million yuan (26.3 million U.S. dollars)for
Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces in the midwest
region. However, by the end of the first three quarters of this
year, the port has already had 1.14 billion yuan (137 million
dollars) worth of cargo transport.
</P>
<P>
Now, the import and export in the three provinces have
accounted for 28.2 percent of the port's total cargo transport, as
against 3.35 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Fangcheng Port owns nine berths, each capable of
accommodating 10,000-ton vessels, and has a combined capacity of
8.5 million tons annually. It reported six million tons of cargo
by the end of this November, compared with 5.08 million tons for
all of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Speeds up Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
Fujian provincial People's Congress in east China has legislated
101 local regulations in the past five years to ensure a sound
legal environment for economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer in reform and opening-up, Fujian also ranks among
the first in terms of legislation in the country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this October, the economically prosperous
province had drawn up 57 economic regulations, accounting for 56
percent of all the local regulations made in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"These economic regulations have protected the rights and
interests of both foreign investors and domestic consumers," said
an official with the provincial legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Seven special regulations have been approved to encourage
overseas Chinese, especially Taiwan compatriots, to invest and set
up new enterprises in the province, which has played an important
role in cross-Straits ties.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the provincial legislative body has amended 41
and abolished 16 local regulations to ensure the quality of local
regulations.

<HEADLINE> Ningbo Works Hard at Export-oriented Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO December 21 (Xinhua) -- With favourable natural
conditions and a correct policy of the local government,
export-oriented agriculture in Ningbo has served as an important
driving force to propel the development of rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The coastal city, located in east China's Zhejiang province, is
expected to realize 300 million US dollars in the export of
agricultural products this year, 3.8 times of that in 1990.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has built up more than 230 joint ventures,
co-operative enterprises and wholly foreign-funded companies in
the agricultural sectors. And 14 of them involve an investment of
over 10 million US dollars each.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sichuan to Green up Whole Province in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province plans to launch a massive ecological protection project
to deal with soil erosion and the destruction of vegetation, and
in particular, protect the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Part of the project will focus on the forestry areas in the
province, covering the Jinsha, Yalong, Minjiang and Dadu river
valleys in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Also, shelter forests will be planted in the Three Gorges
reservoir area to ensure the quality of water in the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The project also includes protection of natural forests in the
source areas of the Yangtze River in a bid to protect biological
diversity and ensure water conservation of the forests there.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decades, Sichuan has planted more than four
million hectares of forests, raising the forest coverage rate up
to 20.35 percent from nine percent in the early 1960s, said a
leading official from the provincial forestry department.
</P>
<P>
However, the deterioration of ecological environment continues,
he said. For that, Sichuan plans to spend the next ten years in
greening up the whole province and another two decades in setting
up a perfect ecological system across the province.

<HEADLINE> Contracted Taiwanese Investment Drops in Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Contracted Taiwanese
investment in the mainland has dropped sharply, despite a slight
increase in actual investment, according to the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that the total contracted Taiwanese
investment was 2.013 billion US dollars between January and
September, dropping by 54 percent over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, Chinese mainland approved 2,181
Taiwanese-invested projects, down 9.1 percent over the same period
of 1996, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwanese investment actually used during the first
nine months reached 2.49 billion US dollars, increasing by 0.49
percent over last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the drop of contracted investment to
the Taiwanese authorities' present policy on trade and economic
ties across the Straits, which he said has deprived Taiwanese
entrepreneurs of business opportunities on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Also, the official said, the drop in contracted investment can
be attributed to the readjustment of taxation policy by the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that Taiwanese investment has flowed to
broader areas of business this year, with insurance, securities
and bank becoming new focuses, adding that more Taiwanese business
people have come to be interested in investing in agriculture and
high-technology.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the huge market on China's mainland
remains attractive to overseas investors and, "as the competition
is getting fierce, the early-comers can be quickly replaced by
their rivals if they hesitate."
</P>
<P>
By September this year, Taiwan has launched 37,652 projects on
the mainland all together, totaling 37.37 billion US dollars of
contracted investment, with 17.57 billion US dollars actually used.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months this year, Taiwan was the third
largest investor in the mainland in terms of actual investment,
next to Hong Kong and Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- North China's coastal city of
Tianjin has achieved an agricultural harvest rarely seen in
history, with over 2 billion kg of grain to be reaped, despite
sever drought this year.
</P>
<P>
The city was afflicted with a severe drought this summer, with
the rainfall during the June-April period dropping to only 100-200
mm, down nearly 70 percent compared with normal years. The city's
more than 800 million cubic meters of rain water stored last year
helped to ease the drought, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, advanced technology was used in developing
agriculture, making it possible to transform over 200,000 mu
(13,333 hectares) of saline-alkali land and less productive field
in the Baodi County into fertile soil.
</P>
<P>
"This alone has added more than 50 million kg of grains to the
total output," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has planted more crops in the northern
regions where the drought was less serious, and has applied potash
fertilizer to one million mu of land, up 300,000 mu over last year.
</P>
<P>
Fine varieties of wheat, maize and rice have also been
introduced on an extensive basis, the official said.

This drop, from 6.4 percent in October, was the biggest single

</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, some economists predicted that Asia's
slowdown would cost the state between 26,000 and 65,000 new

exports and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Oil Smuggling Rampant in Southern Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Oil smuggling is rife in the
Andaman sea in southern Thailand following the depreciation of the
baht which has caused oil prices to soar on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Increased oil smuggling has resulted from price gaps between
Thailand and Singapore, the Bangkok Post Sunday quotes a Thai navy
intelligence officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Smuggled oil is brought from Singapore by tankers to a location
outside the Thai territorial waters in the Andaman sea. It is then
transported from the tankers by modified fishing boats for sale to
operators of fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper smuggled oil helps fishermen reduce their operation
costs, said the intelligence officer, captain Pongsathorn
Kawekorn, deputy director of the Third Fleet's Intelligence
Division.

<HEADLINE> Andaman Sea States Pursue Stronger Transport Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The littoral countries of the
Andaman Sea have agreed to put priority on the development of
subregional transport network in a bid to forge ahead their
cooperation, a senior Thai Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from members of the BISTEC - a subregional
economic cooperation group embracing Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka,
Thailand, and now Myanmar - stressed the importance of transport
and communications linkage in the subregional cooperation,
according to Kobsak Chutikul, head of the Economic Affairs
Department under the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that lack of such links is a main obstacle
to cooperation among the countries along the Andaman sea rim,
Kobsak said on Saturday after a two-day meeting of senior
officials from the BISTEC here.
</P>
<P>
They have chosen to expedite some transport projects in the
subregion, including the Asian highway and the Trans-Asian
railway, to kick off their subregional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The BISTEC was formed at a meeting in June this year in Bangkok
with an aim to foster social and economic development in the
subregion through subregional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar expressed interest in joining the BISTEC in August and
it will formally be integrated into the non-binding group on
Monday when BISTEC ministerial-level officials meet here.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of Public
Health is reassessing the country's health and disease trends for
the coming years under a new economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry had expected a booming economy and prepared for
the so-called rich people's diseases, such as obesity and heart
diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, with a general economic slump, the ministry has to
focus on more basic and common diseases, such as malnutrition and
communicable diseases.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the health sector also has to cope with increasing
cases of mental problems, like stress and depression, Dr.
Narongsak Angkhasuvaphala, deputy permanent secretary for the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, state hospitals need to prepare themselves for a
large increase of patients, as more people will switch from
expensive private hospitals to state ones for cheaper treatment.
</P>
<P>
He also urged state hospitals to reduce spending on expensive
medical equipment and avoid unnecessary distribution of drugs like
antibiotics, according to the Bangkok Post Sunday.

</P>
<P>
Asahi, Yomiuri, Mainichi, Nihon Keizai:
</P>
<P>
-- Japan's Finance Ministry on Sunday proposed a draft budget
of about 77.66 trillion yen for fiscal 1998, up 0.4 percent from
the initial fiscal 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
Yomiuri, Mainichi:
</P>
<P>
-- Japan's opposition Komei group has formally dropped a plan
to merge with the largest opposition New Frontier Party for next
summer's upper house election.
</P>
<P>
Mainichi:
</P>
<P>
-- South Korean President Kim Young Sam and his successor

Woo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asahi, Yomiuri, Nihon Keizai:

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Receive Extra Yen Loans from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan is expected to extend
additional yen loans worth up to 600 million U.S. dollars to
Thailand to support Thai exports, Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The deal could be concluded in early next year to help ease
liquidity pressure on Thai exporters, Tarrin said after he
returned from a three-day trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be provided in credits by the Export-Import Bank
of Japan in conjunction with Thai commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Winning the loans was one of the achievements of Tarrin's
recent trip to Japan, local newspapers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin made the trip to Japan with a main aim to persuade
Japanese institutions to roll over their loans granted to the Thai
private sector, which now bears foreign debts totaling 72 billion
dollars, over half of the amount owed to Japanese lenders.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin's trip also had another aim, which was to increase the
Japanese yen's role in trade and investment in Thailand, including
the conversion of outstanding dollar-denominated loans into yen
loans.
</P>
<P>
Swapping existing dollar loans for yen would reduce costs for
Thai borrowers as yen loans offer a lower interest rate, Tarrin
said.

COLOMBO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tea production
this year is expected to hit a new high of 270 million kilograms,
compared to last year's record of 258 million kilograms, Tea Board
sources here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The tea output rose 7 percent in the first ten months to almost
225 million kilograms from 211 million kilograms in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for the increase in the production are
favorable weather conditions, the better management practices of
the estates and increased use of fertilizer, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Tea is one of the island country's main export items,
accounting for 26 percent of its export earnings. Sri Lanka's
total tea exports last year was 244 million kilograms.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tamil rebels are
infiltrating the tea plantations in the central part of Sri Lanka
from the north in a bid to cause massive disruption of work there,
official sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have already mapped out strategic plans aimed at
halting the production and export of tea, one of the premier
foreign exchange earners of the country, according to intelligence
reports received by the government.
</P>
<P>
The reports revealed that the rebels are planning to sabotage
electricity supplies to tea factories and disrupt fuel
transportation network in the plantations.
</P>
<P>
The reports said at least seven rebel cadres led by men of the
Tamil rebels intelligence unit have infiltrated the estate sector
in the central country from the north.
</P>
<P>
Apart from sabotage activities, rebels of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are also planning to infiltrate the estate
sector trade unions and incite the plantation workers to stage
strikes on estates in the country, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting against the government for a
separate state in the north and east of the country since 1983.
More than 55,000 people have been reportedly killed in the island
country's ethnic war.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Travelers Change Preferences in Overseas Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- For international travelers,
the luggage of Chinese might be among the biggest and the
heaviest. But the items in the luggage have greatly changed over
the years.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Beijing residents on business trips abroad used to
take back such jumbo goods as TV sets, refrigerators and, for the
least, microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a Beijing customs official quoted by
Beijing Youth Daily: "The age of Beijingers carrying TV sets and
refrigerators from abroad is over. What they bring home is
increasingly smaller and reflect the higher quality of their life."
</P>
<P>
The choice of goods varies according to the buyer's gender,
customs officials said. Women seem to prefer cosmetics and
nutritional supplements. They buy cosmetics not only for
themselves but also for their friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
Believing that calcium is good for their health, many women
travelers bring back supplements containing fish oil for their
parents and in-laws.
</P>
<P>
As for men, digital cameras, video equipment and notebook
computers are on the top of their shopping lists.
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents rarely buy clothes abroad nowadays, except
for leather. A man who works in the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation said he was foolish enough to buy China-made
suits in New York, but was pleased with the leather clothes he
purchased in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Some better-off Beijingers like to buy such articles as
tableware, kitchen utensils and ornaments, which they say are not
well-developed in China.

SOFIA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian police, in a recent
anti-drug operation, uncovered the country's first narcotic
drug-producing mill near the capital city and detained one
suspect, the local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After an eight-month investigation, agents with the National
Anti-Organized Crime Agency raided the mill at the Opitsvet
Village, 15 kilometers away from Sofia, on December 20, seizing
300 kilograms of amphetamine and detaining the technician in
charge of organizing and supervising the production procedure.

The amphetamine seized is estimated to have a street value of
3.7 million U.S. dollars. Amphetamine is a drug used formerly in
medicine, but it is now used illegally by people wanting
excitement.
</P>
<P>
Covering a total area of 1.5 hectares, the mill is disguised as
a "chemical laboratory," and comprises three workshops with
up-to-date equipment.

RIO DE JANEIRO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Bankers of San Paulo,
the southeastern Brazilian state, should be on the alert since the
state witnessed 13 percent more bank holdups and holdup attempts
in 1997, the local daily "Folha de Sao Paulo" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Brazilian Bankers Syndicate, some 1,546 bank
holdups in the state were recorded up to October 1997. The number
is expected to reach 1,900 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The increase of bank holdups should be mainly attributed to the
lack of investment in security systems of the banking
institutions, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
As the Brazilian Federation of Banking Associations estimated,
the 15,000 banking agencies set up in the country spend just one
billion reals (about 917 million U.S. dollars) each year in their
security systems.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Dominates with Young Generation Shining (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- American legend Pete Sampras
still kept his domination in tennis court throughout the past
season, but the foundation of the sport beneath him has started to
shift.
</P>
<P>
The American, 26, is the only player who has captured two Grand
Slams in a single season -- Wimbledon and the Australian Open.
With his victory in the season-ending elite eight tournament,
Sampras has collected a total of eight titles.
</P>
<P>
His superority on any surface except clay in the French Open
earned him the name of the best player in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
By finishing as No.1 on the ATP Tour rankings for the fifth
consecutive year, Sampras has tied the record of fellow American
Jimmy Conners in the 70's.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the ranking system in 1973, only 13
players have ever been No. 1 and only nine have ever finished the
year No. 1.
</P>
<P>
Sampras swapped the No. 1 ranking with Andre Agassi and Thomas
Muster early in 1996, but regained it on April 15 and has held it
since.
</P>
<P>
When Sampras was fighting to keep the position, Agassi was
making efforts in Challengers and Muster has dropped to No. 9 in
the rankings.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the season, there were few players who dominated and
many lower-ranked newcomers rose through the ranks by beating the
established stars and reaching the late stages of events and
winning titles.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Rafter, 24, was among them. He began the year ranked
No. 62, but went on to win the U.S. Open, his first major title.
The Australian has finished the year at No. 2.
</P>
<P>
Swede Jonas Bjorkman began the year ranked No. 69. After
winning his third title of the year in Stockholm on home soil,
Bjorkman has shot to No. 4 in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Swede also made a great achievement at the end
of the year, leading Sweden to beat the United States for the
Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Swede has one of the best returns in tennis. His
breakthrough has helped him shake off a reputation of being mainly
a successful doubles player.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bjorkman had a 25-25 singles record. This year, he
leads the tour with more than 70 match wins.
</P>
<P>
"Jonas is a very talented player," Michael Chang once said.
"He is one of the few players who really has an all-court game."
</P>
<P>
"He has a good serve, good volleys and is very solid off the
ground," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Moya, the Australian Open finalist from Spain, has been
the youngest player moving into the ATP Tour Championships. Moya,
21, has finished the year at No. 7.
</P>
<P>
American Michael Chang, who dropped to No. 3 after the ATP Tour
Championships in November, has another solid year with five
tournament wins.
</P>
<P>
Yvegeni Kafelnikov of Russia jumped to finish the year at No. 5
after beating Czech Petr Korda to claim the Kremlin Cup.
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Kuerten, from Brazil, failed to win any tournament
after taking the French Open. He finished the year at No. 14.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Recruit More Chinese to Understand China Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank, challenged by
the rapid and powerful changes in China, plans to sharpen its
analysis of the country's economic and social conditions by
recruiting and training more Chinese staff, according to today's
China Daily (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Yukon Huang, the new director of the China
Program and chief of the bank's resident mission in China, as
saying that developments in the bank's largest borrower were so
powerful and complicated that the bank needed to gain a better
understanding of the changes to be able to react quickly and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Huang's office based in Beijing will enroll 10 or 15 more
Chinese professional staff, in addition to around 30 currently
working there. The proportion of expatriates will decrease over
time, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
He believed a strong local presence was crucial to the bank's
decentralization drive, which endows national offices with wider
responsibilities and greater decision-making powers.
</P>
<P>
The World Band would like to aid China's restructuring of State
large and medium enterprises, pension reform and banking reform
with its expertise and global experience.
</P>
<P>
Predicting that the government would assume a greater social
function, the bank has proposed to finance more social projects in
the coming three years, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The programs cover education, pension reform, urbanization,
technology and skills training and poverty elimination, and are
under discussion with the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
And Infrastructure, energy, transport, agriculture and poverty
relief will remain priorities in the bank's annual US$2.5 to US$3
billion lending to China.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will tighten auditing and accounting in the
projects it funds to ensure the quality of capital utilization,
the paper quoted Huang as saying.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Dominates with Young Generation Shining (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December xx (Xinhua) -- American legend Pete Sampras
still kept his domination in tennis court throughout the past
season, but the foundation of the sport beneath him has started to
shift.
</P>
<P>
The American, 26, is the only player who has captured two Grand
Slams in a single season -- Wimbledon and the Australian Open.
With his victory in the season-ending elite eight tournament,
Sampras has collected a total of eight titles.
</P>
<P>
His superority on any surface except clay in the French Open
earned him the name of the best player in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
By finishing as No.1 on the ATP Tour rankings for the fifth
consecutive year, Sampras has tied the record of fellow American
Jimmy Conners in the 70's.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the ranking system in 1973, only 13
players have ever been No. 1 and only nine have ever finished the
year No. 1.
</P>
<P>
Sampras swapped the No. 1 ranking with Andre Agassi and Thomas
Muster early in 1996, but regained it on April 15 and has held it
since.
</P>
<P>
When Sampras was fighting to keep the position, Agassi was
making efforts in Challengers and Muster has dropped to No. 9 in
the rankings.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the season, there were few players who dominated and
many lower-ranked newcomers rose through the ranks by beating the
established stars and reaching the late stages of events and
winning titles.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Rafter, 24, was among them. He began the year ranked
No. 62, but went on to win the U.S. Open, his first major title.
The Australian has finished the year at No. 2.
</P>
<P>
Swede Jonas Bjorkman began the year ranked No. 69. After
winning his third title of the year in Stockholm on home soil,
Bjorkman has shot to No. 4 in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Swede also made a great achievement at the end
of the year, leading Sweden to beat the United States for the
Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Swede has one of the best returns in tennis. His
breakthrough has helped him shake off a reputation of being mainly
a successful doubles player.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bjorkman had a 25-25 singles record. This year, he
leads the tour with more than 70 match wins.
</P>
<P>
"Jonas is a very talented player," Michael Chang once said.
"He is one of the few players who really has an all-court game."
</P>
<P>
"He has a good serve, good volleys and is very solid off the
ground," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Moya, the Australian Open finalist from Spain, has been
the youngest player moving into the ATP Tour Championships. Moya,
21, has finished the year at No. 7.
</P>
<P>
American Michael Chang, who dropped to No. 3 after the ATP Tour
Championships in November, has another solid year with five
tournament wins.
</P>
<P>
Yvegeni Kafelnikov of Russia jumped to finish the year at No. 5
after beating Czech Petr Korda to claim the Kremlin Cup.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sampras Dominates with Young Generation Shining (2-last) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In women's tennis, young generation stole the limelight and
only Jana Novotna struck a blow for the older ones.
</P>
<P>
Without any doubt, the year should belong to Swiss sensation
Martina Hingis, who claimed her third Grand Slam title of the year
at the U.S. Open before her 17th birthday.
</P>
<P>
The world number one finished the year with 12 singles titles
-- twice as many as Lindsay Davenport who was second with six --
and earned a record of nearly 3.5 million U.S. dollars in prize
money.
</P>
<P>
The one Grand Slam title to elude Hingis this year was claimed
by Croatian Iva Majoli, who was 19 at the time.
</P>
<P>
And Charismatic teen-agers like U.S. Open runner-up Venus
Williams, Croatian newcomer Mirjana Lucic and Russian Ana
Kournikova all grabbed a share of spotlight in 1997 and all are
strong challengers for Hingis in years to come.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, at the advanced age of 29, concluded the year at world
No. 2 with the biggest title of her career in the Chase
Championships.
</P>
<P>
The Czech player, whose greatest liability has always been
mental, will take soaring confidence into the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
And next year, another old timer by the name of Steffi Graf,
28, will be recovered from the knee surgery that took her out of
the picture much of the year. The German superstar, who missed
both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, will be back in time to
challenge Hingis at the Australian Open in January.
</P>
<P>
In early November, WTA tour players Linda Harvey Wilde of the
United States, Karin Kschwendt of Luxembourg and Patricia Hy
Boulais of Canada spearheaded a revolt at the Chicago tournament
aimed at improving the stature of rank-and-file players.
</P>
<P>
The WTA Tour has received a temporary restraining court order
against the move, in which three members were removed from the
player association's executive board and replaced by associates
sympathetic to mid-ranked players' objectives.
</P>
<P>
In the next season, women's tennis circuit will add six new
lower level tournaments and increase prize money.

TEHRAN -- Iran Saturday denied its reported readiness to issue
a written guarantee not to make any attempt on the lift of British
writer Salman Rushdie, who was condemned to death by Iran's late
spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The British Independent newspaper reported Iran's Minister of
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani has said Tehran
is ready to issue such a guarantee to spare the life of Rushdie,
accused of blasphemy to Islam for his novel the "Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance
said Mohajerani only reiterated the country's stand that the
decree by Khomeini is irrevocable, although the Iranian government
would not take actions against Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned the British daily for "distorting"
Mohajerani's remarks, saying "this new ploy has long been rejected
by Iranian and even European public opinions."
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz Saturday lashed out

and unobjective statements" on his Baghdad talks, thereby serving
the American plan aimed at unjustifiably scaling up the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Butler said on Friday in New York that he had reasons to doubt
that Iraq was hiding prohibited materials at "presidential and
sovereign sites."
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that U.N. arms inspectors had actually carried out
119 inspections of national security-related locations during
1996 and 1997 upon receiving information similar to those cited
in Butler's statements, but found nothing.

<HEADLINE> Three Chinese into ITTF Singles Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese have qualified
for the men's and women's singles finals following their victories
in the semi-finals at the 1997 International Table Tennis
Federation Pro-Tour Grand Finals here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liqin, 19, who made himself known after his stunning
victory over Sweden's world champion Jan-Ove Waldner on Friday,
scored an fairly easy 21-10, 21-19, 21-10 semi-final victory over
Belgian Jean-Michel Saive, now ranked 13th in the world.
</P>
<P>
Saive beat China's defending champion Kong Linghui in the
quarter-finals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I won because I'd taken the initiative today," said the
Chinese teenager from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Saive, 28, said he could not play his game today. "I was not
waken as I almost did not sleep last night," he said.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive Belgian said he did not know much about the
Chinese opponent before. "They (Chinese) might have 2,000 copies
of tapes of my matches and I, as a European, could feel very
difficult in playing a Chinese for the first time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't playing my game today. If I could have played as
yesterday and the day before, I could win over anyone," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Cai Zhenhua, Head Coach of the Chinese team, said Wang should
owe his victory to his better tactics. He admitted that his team
was in a better position as they had known a lot about Saive.
</P>
<P>
"Saive was managing throughout the match today to get the game
of Wang," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang is to play in Sunday's final Vladimir Samsonov from
Belarus, who eliminated Zoran Primorac of Croatia 23-21, 12-21,
21-17, 22-20 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov had won over Wang three times and lost once before.
</P>
<P>
China's world number two and top seed here Li Ju qualified for
the women's singles final after beating Park Hae Jung from South
Korea 21-8, 21-19, 22-24, 21-12 in the semi-finals Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Li's victory set an all-Chinese final as China's world
runner-up and world number three Wang Nan eliminated South Korea's
Ryu Ji Hye 21-9, 21-19, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
China has one pair each into the men's and women's doubles
finals. Kong Linhui teamed with Olympic champion Liu Guoliang to
beat Patrick Chila/Christophe Legout from France 21-8, 16-21,
21-17, 21-12 for a berth in the men's doubles final.
</P>
<P>
And the Grman-Belarussian combination of Jorg Rosskopf and
Vladimir Samsonov downed Chinese Wang Liqin and Yan Sen 21-19,
16-21, 11-21, 21-19, 21-17 in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The qualifier for the women's doubles final were Chinese Li
Ju/Wang Nan and South Korea's Park Hae Jung/Kim Moo Kyu. They
beat their compatriots Cheng Hongxia/Wang Hui and Ryu Ji Hye/Lee
Eun Sil in the semi-finals on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> East China County Benefits from Nuclear Plant, Officials Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Haiyan County on the northern
bank of Hangzhou Bay has benefited enormously from construction of
a nuclear power station nearby, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The county in east China's Zhejiang Province has now grown into
one of China's top 100 counties for comprehensive economic
strength, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the county has reached 4.2
billion yuan, and its total industrial and agricultural output is
10.8 billion yuan, with the industrial value making up 95 percent
of the total.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the county's economic boom to
construction of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station, the country's
first of its kind. The station was first brought online in
December of 1991 with 300,000-kilowatt generating units.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 experts and officials from 30 countries and
regions came to visit or work in the county during the second and
third phases of construction. In the second phase two
600,000-kilowatt generating units were installed; in the third
phase, two 700,000-kilowatt units were added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the county has had more than 80,000 domestic
tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges have brought along qualified personnel,
technologies and information to Haiyan, and helped increase the
county's contacts and cooperation with the outside world, said the
officials.
</P>
<P>
While doing its best to support construction of the nuclear
power station and improving the infrastructure, Haiyan County has
built a 13.8-square-kilometer provincial-level economic
development zone for more than 100 businesses with an investment
of 600 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The county has worked toward an export-oriented economy. It
now has more than 100 overseas-financed companies with 178 million
U.S. dollars of foreign funding. The county exports 70 different
commodities and delivers 1.4 billion yuan in exports annually.

Ecclestone received the exclusive right to manage all the
commercial aspects of races, including broadcasting 15 years ago
and for a length of 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy to Grow by Nine Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to register
a GDP growth of nine percent this year with inflation around one
percent, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the figures released by the State
Statistics Bureau (SSB) seem to indicate that China has "eluded
the spectre of a boom-and-bust cycle."
</P>
<P>
Nominal investment in fixed assets would be lower than in
previous years, but higher than GDP growth, while demand for
consumer goods would rise by a mild 10 percent, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It is generally agreed that China has succeeded in achieving a
"soft landing" for its economy by modifying the speed of economic
growth to contain inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The English language paper quotes Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist
at the SSB, as saying that if the current macro-economic
adjustments continue in the coming year, and significant disasters
and international turmoil are avoided, China's economy will
sustain rapid and steady growth.

<HEADLINE> Companies Installed More Software Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of new
business computer softwares used worldwide have been installed
illegally, according to the U.S. Software Publishers Association.
</P>
<P>
From sharing floppies to using boot-legged CDs, piracy will
cost software makers 14.5 billion U.S. dollars in lost sales this
year, estimates the Business Software Alliance, another U.S.
organization engaged in the research.
</P>
<P>
Many software pirates don't even know they're pirates. Earlier
this month, New York architectural firm MKDA paid 150,000 U.S.
dollars to settle copyright infringement charges brought by the
Business Software Alliance. In October, Fort Worth, Texas-based
Marketing Management Inc. paid 400,000 U.S. dollars to settle
similar charges.
</P>
<P>
Piracies occur mostly in smaller companies, which unknowingly
buy pirated items from resellers, according to researchers.
</P>
<P>
One problem is that softlifting isn't widely seen as a crime.
But penalties can be stiff. Fines can reach 100,000 U.S. dollars
per illegal copy, while commercial piracy is punishable by five
years in prison and 250,000 U.S. dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggest several ways for small companies to stay
legal, which include checking their sources, registering the
software with the manufacturer, and organizing software
management well.

<HEADLINE> Technology Training to Be Growing Industry in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A booming high-tech industry
in the United States has created opportunities for the development
of for-profit post-secondary education, the Investor's Business
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 600 billion U.S. dollars that U.S. institutions and
individuals spend on information technology is expected to triple
to 1.3 trillion dollars by 2001 and the high-tech industry is
demanding more skilled workers, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent of the U.S. workforce is expected to compose
of skilled workers, 20 percent professional and 15 percent
unskilled by 2000, against 45 percent skilled, 20 percent
professional and 35 percent unskilled in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The trend is to be compounded with the widening pay gap, which
has grown from 25 percent in 1980 to 90 percent today between
college and high-school educated persons, a factor that has
induced more people to go to school for more training.
</P>
<P>
The paper said there may be two or three open slots for every
10 full-timers in five years as 95,000 more information technology
jobs are created each year, citing the figures of the research
group of Gartner.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, for-profit training schools enroll some 1.5
million students, 10 percent of the post-high-school education,

<HEADLINE> US, European Foreign Equity Ownership Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and European investors
increased their foreign exposure to international equities in the
third quarter, overcoming a sharp drop in Asia-Pacific equity
holdings, a leading U.S. service company has found.
</P>
<P>
The total market value of U.S. holdings in international equity
securities jumped 5.1 percent or 27.8 billion U.S. dollars from
the end of the second quarter to 576.4 billion dollars, the
New-York based Technimetrics Inc. reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
European investors also saw their international equity
portfolios grow 3 percent or 12.3 billion dollars to 373.7 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. and European investors decreased their investments in
Asian and Pacific markets in the first three quarters of the year
while increasing their international equity ownership in each
onther's market.
</P>
<P>
European equities comprised 62.3 percent of the total U.S.
international portfolio at the end of the third quarter, up from
58.8 percent at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ownership of European stocks grew 36.5 billion dollars
from 322.5 billion dollars to 359 billion dollars while European
ownership of U.S. and Canadian stocks soared from 173.8 billion
dollars to 191.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Technimetrics said U.S. and European investors
"may be bracing themselves for further setbacks" in their
Asian-Pacific portfolios given the stock market uncertainty and
financial unrest which have occurred in the region in the fourth
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Tentative Agreement Reached Shortly After Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Striking U.S. pilots
reached a tentative contract agreement with Skyway Airlines today
soon after they stopped work.
</P>
<P>
The strike by 135 pilots for the Midwestern airline started at
4:05 a.m. (1005 GMT) for higher wages. As the two sides reached an
agreement on the contract, the pilots returned to work at about
5:30 a.m. But it was not clear what the detail of the agreement
was.
</P>
<P>
Skyway pilots are among the lowest paid in the industry with 50
percent earning less than 16,000 U.S. dollars annually, the union
said.

Skyway is a subsidiary of Midwest Express Airlines. It serves
24 airports in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Missouri, Ohio, Iowa, Nebraska and in Toronto, Ontario.
</P>

As the strike lasted only one and a half hours, only a few
early morning flights had been delayed.
