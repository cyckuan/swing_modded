McCain Backs Bush, Nixes Sharing Ticket
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- While comparing the action to taking a dose of medicine,
Sen. John McCain Tuesday endorsed George W. Bush, his rival in the Republican
primaries. McCain said that he doesn't want to be Bush's running mate. Behind
their smiles, the strains from a bitter Republican primary fight were still
apparent. Even as McCain said he looked forward to ''enthusiastically
campaigning'' for the presumptive GOP nominee, the vanquished rival had to be
prompted before using the word ''endorse.''

Navy Commandos Near Sierra Leone

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Navy has commandos aboard a patrol boat in the
waters off West Africa as a ''precautionary measure'' in light of the
intensifying crisis in Sierra Leone, a Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday. Kenneth
Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen, said the Cyclone-class
patrol boat USS Thunderbolt was not directly off the coast of Sierra Leone but
was ''in the area and will remain there.'' In the last week, clashes have broken
out intermittently between United Nations' peacekeepers and rebels, with some
500 peacekeepers being held hostage.

Law Catches Up With Ex-Louisiana Gov.

   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who was known for
nod-and-a-wink politics but always evaded prosecutors, was convicted for the
first time Tuesday, on charges he extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from
businessmen applying for riverboat casino licenses. The former four-term
Democratic governor was found guilty along with his son Stephen of fraud and
racketeering. The scheme took place during Edwards' final term and after he left
office in 1996, when he still wielded considerable influence in Louisiana
politics.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an extraordinary assembly of Republican and Democratic
administrations spanning three decades, former Presidents Ford and Carter closed
ranks Tuesday with President Clinton to push for a China trade deal that appears
increasingly likely to pass. ''We want the voice of this meeting to echo across
the country and to embrace the Congress,'' Clinton told more than 200 VIPs in
the chandeliered East Room. Two weeks before the House opens debate on granting
China permanent trade benefits, supporters of the proposal are optimistic about
winning.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft is about to get its chance to rebut a
government's proposal to rip the company in two. Wednesday, Microsoft will
respond to the proposal made last month by the Justice Department and 17 state
attorneys to split it into one company that sells the dominant Windows operating
system and another selling virtually everything else. The plan was submitted to
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who on April 3 found Microsoft to
be a monopoly with business practices in wide violation of antitrust law. The
company said it will appeal the ruling.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Hill Injures Rib Cage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Angels pitcher Ken Hill left Tuesday
night's game against Oakland in the third inning after straining a
muscle in the right side of his rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who threw 67 pitches, sustained the injury while throwing
a fastball to Miguel Tejada with one out and a man on first. After
finishing his follow-through, Hill sank to his knees and doubled
over in pain as the Angels training staff went to his aid.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, 34, is 3-3 with a 7.47 ERA in eight starts. The
right-hander was on the disabled list twice last season, once
because of inflammation in his pitching elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels already have starters Jason Dickson and Tim Belcher
on the disabled list. Dickson, who had a strained hip flexor, is
eligible to come off the DL on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Belcher isn't expected to come back until June -- at the
earliest -- because of inflammation in his right elbow.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton still not set on nominating team  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton is
learning that dealing with New York's fractious Democrats can
sometimes seem as challenging as taking on a big-name Republican
like Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton's campaign was unable to say who would
nominate her at next week's state party convention. In fact, the
campaign wasn't sure if President Clinton would attend the Albany
event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have an announcement soon,'' Clinton aide Howard Wolfson
said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been known since mid-April that Giuliani would be
nominated at the state GOP convention on May 30 in Buffalo by Gov.
George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The major question on Republican minds now is whether the New
York City mayor will still be in the race by then. He announced
April 27 that he had been diagnosed with treatable prostate cancer
and was uncertain if he could remain in the race. The mayor has
promised a decision on that before the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Still on Giuliani's campaign schedule were two fund-raising
events for his Senate campaign in New York this week. Uncertain,
however, was whether he would head to California next week for
fund-raising events Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson's comment about Clinton's nomination came after the New
York Daily News reported Tuesday that state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall and federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, both eyeing a
run for governor in 2002, are battling to be the one who nominates
the first lady at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   McCall told the newspaper that he hoped he would be considered
for the nominating role, ''but I understand their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, the son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, said there
wasn't any battle that he knew about over who would nominate
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never asked anyone about nominating the first lady and
nobody talked to me about it either,'' Cuomo said in a telephone
interview from Virginia. ''I'll do whatever they think is
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said he would attend the convention and did plan to speak
at it.
</P>
<P>
   Party sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
likely solution to Clinton's dilemma would be having her nominated
by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring from the Senate at
the end of this year and whose seat Clinton is seeking, and by Sen.
Charles Schumer. Moynihan took on the duties of introducing the
first lady at her formal campaign announcement in February.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the situation, a spokesman for state Democratic
Chairwoman Judith Hope, Peter Kauffmann, said ''there's so much
talent in the Democratic Party, of course there are talented
leaders who want to nominate Hillary. I wouldn't call that
jockeying.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann said he did not yet know who would be handling the
nominating chores or even how many speakers would be taking the
podium at next week's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's being worked out this week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did attend his wife's campaign announcement in
February, but did not speak at the event. The first lady has said
she must establish an identity separate from the White House if she
is to win a Senate seat. Her first 30-second television
advertisement, unveiled last week, makes no mention of the
president.

<HEADLINE> Immigrant groups protest English Regents standards  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Veronica Kerscaek says she is lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old who came to New York from Romania three years
ago took the English language arts Regents exam in January and got
a score of 57. It was just two points above the minimum requirement
for a local diploma, but it ensured that she would graduate from
high school and pursue a college education.
</P>
<P>
   Kerscaek, a student at the Manhattan Comprehensive Day and Night
School, said many of her friends still don't have the adequate
language skills to pass the English exam.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more time,'' she told more than 100 people from
different immigrant groups rallying in front of the state Education
Department Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The groups chanted, ''Learning first, testing second,'' and
urged the state Education Department to delay imposing the English
exam requirement for English language learners.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new standards are totally unfair to immigrant students
coming into this country trying to learn English,'' said Margie
McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition.
''Students need to have a chance to learn before they get tested.''
</P>
<P>
   McHugh said there are simply not enough qualified teachers,
facilities and resources to accomplish that goal. More funding is
necessary, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the stricter education standards set by the Board of
Regents, seniors who plan to graduate this June must get at least a
score of 55 on their English language arts exam to get a local
diploma and a 65 for a Regents diploma. The new requirement does
not exempt English-language learners.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition said it takes between four to seven years before
foreign-born students can be proficient enough in English to pass
the Regents exam. The groups asked the state Education Department
to let these students graduate this year without passing the new
English exam and instead allow a safety net -- letting students take
the easier Regents competency exams administered in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents in 1998 passed a ''12-step action plan'' to prepare
English language learners for the new exams, but McHugh said many
schools received waivers and did not follow the guidelines of the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ray, a spokesman for the Education Department, denied that
charge, saying that school districts reported that they are
adhering to the plan and no waivers were given. He added that to
help these students, the Regents have required double or triple the
English instruction time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important for students to learn English because they will
need it to go to college or to get a good job. It is important that
they learn it in high school,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where 80 percent of the state's
English-language learners live, between 600 to 700 of the 2,200
foreign-born seniors still need to pass the exam as of January, Ray
said. Some students took the exam in April, and those are still
being graded. Students can still take the exam in June and if they
fail, they could take more English in the summer and try again in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the department has also made various accommodations for
English-language learners, like extending test-taking time to nine
hours for the two-day, six-hour English exam. Students can also use
a bilingual dictionary and have listening comprehension questions
read to them three times instead of just once. Aside from the
English exam, students can take other Regents tests in their native
language or with the help of a translator.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Peter Rivera, D-Bronx, said he is proposing a
bill that would waive the English exam requirement for
English-language learners. Under the measure, students would be
awarded a local diploma if they pass the Regents competency exam in
their native languages, pass an English proficiency exam and
fulfill other graduation requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would be effective until June 30, 2003,
providing time for the Education Department to institute permanent
policy changes regarding the English requirement for foreign born
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our children have the same right to graduate as anybody else.
There are options, there are alternatives,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat, a Manhattan Democrat and
co-sponsor of the bill: ''I don't know if Einstein ever got to
master the English language, but he really got to do some wonderful
things for the world.''

<HEADLINE> Andrew Cuomo: If I want to run, the party will listen  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's race for the governorship on the
Democratic side is heating up even though the election is still
more than two years away and there are no declared candidates.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall's attempt to sew up the 2002 Democratic
nomination early won't work. And, Cuomo declared: ''If Andrew Cuomo
says, 'I want to run,' the party will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo, the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, still wouldn't
say if he will run for the gubernatorial nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm seriously considering it,'' he said, adding that he would
not rule out a primary against McCall.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Cuomo said it was too early to campaign for governor
and that he was concentrating his efforts on getting Al Gore
elected president and Hillary Rodham Clinton elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's way too early to start working on any 2002 race,'' Cuomo
said in a telephone interview from Virginia. ''I think it's a
distraction from what the party should be doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the only black to be elected to statewide office in New
York, has been working for several months at lining up support for
a possible run for governor. He has told supporters privately that
he will run. Publicly, he says he will make a decision after this
November's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't made any comments about a potential primary, nor do
I intend to,'' McCall said in a statement, declining further
comment. ''I haven't announced that I'm running for governor and I
don't know who else will run if I do.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall already has the support of state Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer, state Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman and former
Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo loyalists, meanwhile, have been urging New York Democrats
not to get behind McCall.
</P>
<P>
   That effort has met with limited success and Cuomo said Tuesday
that lining up the support of the party leaders and elected
officials couldn't deliver the nomination for McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't work that way anymore -- that you can close out a
person by gaining the support of the clubhouse. Politics doesn't
work that way anymore,'' Cuomo said. ''Bradley showed us that.
McCain showed us that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that former Sen. Bill Bradley and Sen. John McCain both
lost their party's nominations for president to Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, respectively, in large part because the two winners
had a lock on party organizational support, Cuomo brushed that
aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush was in many ways a party outsider to the national
process,'' Cuomo said. ''I would argue McCain was more of an
insider.''
</P>
<P>
   And, the former governor's eldest son said that while McCall
might have organizational support, that couldn't block someone with
money or, like him, with name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that he considered himself in the same light as such
other New York party luminaries as Spitzer and Sen. Charles Schumer
-- people the party would also listen to because of their
reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm saying I'm just like these other guys,'' Cuomo said in a
follow-up interview.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Cuomo, seeking a fourth, four-year term, lost the 1994
governor's race to Republican George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said he is considering running for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo has been rumored as a possible White House chief of
staff should Gore win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Cuomo said: ''My heart is in New York. That's
where I want to be. I've been here (in Washington) for seven years
... I've done this.''

McCall: All public retiree pension funds favor boost   
By JOEL STASHENKO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Support appears to be growing for automatic
cost-of-living benefit increases for retirees from state and local
government jobs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said Tuesday that
administrators of all eight pension funds covering retired public
employees are behind the idea of recurring cost-of-living
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other systems are on board,'' H. Carl McCall said before
attending a rally of about 10,000 current and retired public
employees near the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   McCall administers the largest of the funds, the $127 billion
Common Retirement Fund. All told, the eight funds have assets of
more than $300 billion and all have grown significantly in recent
years thanks to the prolonged boom on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, representing all major public unions in New
York, gathered to push the state Legislature and Gov. George Pataki
to approve a cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) bill covering all
public employee pensions this session. Lawmakers are expected to be
meeting for six or seven more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Permanent COLA is long overdue,'' Denis Hughes, president of
the state AFL-CIO, said. ''Our pension funds are awash in cash. ...
We have enough money to do this. It's fair. And it's about time.''
</P>
<P>
   Top officials of the largest unions representing public
employees appeared at a news conference before the rally to promote
the pension boost. They included Randi Weingarten of the United
Federation of Teachers, Thomas Hobart of New York State United
Teachers, Danny Donohue of the Civil Service Employees Association,
Roger Benson of the Public Employees Federation and Greg Nash of
the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue called the failure to enact a COLA provision in public
retirement systems ''obscene'' and he said that 60 percent of those
covered by the state's Common Retirement System are getting less
than $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven other states have COLAs for public retirees, but
New York is among ''Mississippi, Alabama and some of those other
states'' that do not, Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
   A task force appointed by Pataki recommended a permanent COLA
tied to some gauge of increases in the cost of living, such as the
Consumer Price Index. The governor announced last week he agreed
with the task force's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The labor leaders said Tuesday any increases should also take
into consideration how long employees worked and how long they've
been retired, with the oldest retirees getting larger increases.
They could provide no specifics, however, about what a COLA should
provide to a typical retired public employee in the state.
</P>
<P>
   McCall had proposed ''performance-based'' COLAs, meaning that if
the pension funds did strongly, pensioners would benefit. The labor
leaders, however, said the pension funds have become so lucrative
there is no need to prohibit increases if they have an off year.
</P>
<P>
   And McCall said Tuesday all the pension systems can afford
increases without first passing a performance test.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, held under a sweltering midday sun, state Senate
Majority leader Joseph Bruno repeatedly told the retirees, ''Now,
it's your turn'' for a pension increase. State Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver also promised to give retirees the COLAs they are
pushing for.
</P>
<P>
   The pension funds for former New York City employees are
separate from the state retirees. But a pension law enacted by the
Legislature and governor would affect all eight systems in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten said the labor leaders were rallying in Albany,
despite the apparent unanimous agreement here for COLAs, because
the ''legislation is here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Albany controls pension legislation, not New York City,'' she
said. ''New York City can afford this. ... New York City is awash
in money and it can afford it.''

<HEADLINE> Court tries to halt jurors from providing own testimony tocolleagues  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Jurors in New York from now on will likely
hear an additional instruction from the judge when they go into
deliberations: Your expert testimony is not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The state's highest court on Tuesday called on judges to
''direct that jurors may not use their professional expertise to
insert facts and evidence'' as they ruled for a retrial in a
homicide case in which two jurors apparently did just that.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member Court of Appeals panel said that two nurses
should not have provided medical opinions to fellow jurors in an
Orange County trial. The unanimous opinion was written by Judge
Joseph Bellacosa.
</P>
<P>
   The decision concerns the case of Michael Maragh, 26, who was
convicted of criminally negligent homicide in Orange County Court
November 1997 in the death of May DeGroat, his girlfriend and
mother of his two children.
</P>
<P>
   His attorneys argued that the 26-year-old DeGroat died of an air
embolism caused by having sexual intercourse too soon after giving
birth. She had the couple's second child nine days earlier.
Prosecutors contended Maragh beat the woman in the couple's
Middletown apartment and that the blood loss killed her.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses, according to court documents, offered to the entire
jury their own professional opinions on the case, which they came
to after sharing a room while sequestered. One offered her own
calculation on the effect of DeGroat's blood loss. The jury
convicted Maragh on its second day of deliberations. Another juror
later testified that the nurses' opinions directly affected the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The court wrote Tuesday that when jurors who have professional
knowledge ''take the additional, forbidden step beyond the evidence
of the cases'' of advising jurors, ''that would violate the rights
of litigants to have their cases decided only on the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The nurses' remarks came to light through reports in The Times
Herald-Record in Middletown. Later, a county court judge called for
a retrial but the district attorney's office asked for a reversal
from the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court, which
reinstated Maragh's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office had argued that the county
judge's instructions that the jurors could utilize ''personal
experience'' in deciding the facts of the case entitled medical
professionals to share that knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Maragh was originally sentenced to 1-1/3 to four years in prison
and has served about 16 months already.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to jail March 31 following the reinstatement of his
conviction and has not been allowed to see his two young sons since
his arrest in March 1997, said attorney Ben Ostrer.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County District Attorney Frank Phillips said he will
press to get Maragh convicted again.

<HEADLINE> DEC gave landfill site poor review  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- As city officials ponder a lucrative offer to
accept New York City garbage, environmental issues have suddenly
loomed as a threat to trash the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   According to 7-year-old agency documents, the site for the
proposed garbage landfill was not a good location. The DEC, which
grants solid waste management facility permits for landfills, soon
may have the power to make or break the offer by Albany-based
Greenbrier Management Corp. to open a landfill on 550 acres in
Rome's rural northwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''The site does have issues,'' Sandra LeBarron of the DEC said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the DeMarma Corp. proposed a privately owned
mixed-waste landfill on some of the same land on which Greenbrier
wants to build a facility to take in 5,000 tons of New York City
trash every day for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But DEC officials had reservations about the site, according to
a letter written in response to a preliminary site assessment
submitted to the department by DeMarma.
</P>
<P>
   ''While under the new Part 360 regulations, it may be
technically possible for DeMarma to construct the required landfill
site conditions, based on the information you submitted, we still
do not believe this is a good site for a landfill,'' the letter
stated.
</P>
<P>
   Part 360 regulates solid waste management practices under state
law.
</P>
<P>
   Prior letters from the DEC to DeMarma raised questions about
groundwater flow and possible aquifers, archaeological sites and
endangered species, including the ''secretive Bog Turtle,'' in the
area of the site.
</P>
<P>
   LeBarron said she could not comment further until the DEC
receives a permit application from the company. Greenbrier Vice
President James McGuire said he was unaware of the department's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the work we have done so far ... we are confident the
site is physically suitable for what we propose,'' McGuire said.
''We looked at this site very thoroughly under today's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company would not apply for a DEC permit unless Rome
approves its landfill offer. The company, which wants an answer by
June, has tentatively offered the city incentives worth about $7
million a year if it approves the offer. That represents more than
half the city's $12.2 million tax levy for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, we're waiting on the city to see what they want to
do on this,'' McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire said if everything is approved, Greenbrier would build
the dump by 2004 and maintain the site. However, he said once it is
built one of three major New York City haulers -- Allied Waste
Industries, IESI, or Waste Management -- would own it and be
responsible for hauling trash to the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire referred to the waste, which would be transported by
rail, as residential garbage. ''It's what you and I throw away,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Former plastic surgeon pleads innocent to poisoning wife  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A former plastic surgeon who gained
celebrity for his ''snap-on hair'' invention and then went to
prison over the death of a patient denies he poisoned his wife with
arsenic, as prosecutors claim.
</P>
<P>
   In a case Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark termed
''bizarre,'' Anthony Pignataro was charged Tuesday with attempted
murder, assault and unrelated drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege Pignataro, 42, slowly poisoned his wife of 15
years between June and August last year after the couple reunited
following a separation. The arsenic, common in rat poison, was
discovered after Deborah Pignataro was hospitalized with numbness,
vomiting and other symptoms. The mother of two remains confined to
a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Pignataro's attorney said prosecutors have no case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The grand jury can indict a ham sandwich if they want to,''
Joel Daniels said. ''It's one thing to indict the ham sandwich.
It's another thing to convict it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark acknowledged prosecutors will be challenged because there
are no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a situation like this we're arguing to the jury, if not
him, who? We only had four people in the household, the father, the
mother and the children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pignataro was ordered held without bail after pleading innocent
Tuesday in state Supreme Court. He has been imprisoned since March
for using heroin in violation of his probation from a 1998
conviction of criminally negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   The homicide charge arose from the death of a 26-year-old
patient who suffered a heart attack while undergoing
breast-augmentation surgery in 1997. Pignataro served six months in
prison and lost his medical license.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of trying to kill his estranged wife he could face
up to 25 years in prison. Unrelated to the attempted murder charge
in the indictment unsealed Tuesday were three drug charges accusing
Pignataro of possessing heroin in March and July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pignataros still face a joint child-neglect trial in Erie
County Family Court in June for allegedly exposing their children
to arsenic last year. Then 9 and 12, the children were tested for
the poison after their mother became ill. While arsenic, present in
nature, was detected, ''it was well within normal range,'' Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pignataro attracted attention in the mid-1990s for his invention
of a hairpiece that attaches to snaps surgically implanted in the
scalp. His own first patient and test case, he demonstrated his
snap-on hair on late-night television.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Eyeglasses are windows to radon exposure  </HEADLINE>
By RIK STEVENS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) -- The best radon detectors could be right
before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have discovered some eyeglass lenses make reliable
recorders of a person's exposure to radon, a naturally occurring
gas linked to as many as 30,000 lung cancer deaths every year in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Fleischer, a geology professor at Union College, led a
team that examined 17 sets of lenses using regular and electron
microscopy, measuring and mapping the tiny, conical dents made when
radioactive particles of a decaying radon molecule smash into
lenses made of CR-39 plastic.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing the ''etchings'' -- less than a few thousandths of
an inch deep -- to constant markings created in a radon chamber,
Fleischer determined how much radon the wearer was exposed to since
he or she first started wearing glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer expects the research will be of use in health studies
aimed at shoring up the link between radon and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, when radon was positively connected to
lung cancer, detectors that cost about $20 have been used to
measure how much of the gas is in a given area of a building. Since
few people live exclusively in the basement where radon
concentration is highest, the detectors are of little value in
determining a person's lifetime exposure, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems with using environmental measures alone
to study the link between radon and cancer, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency. People move and it can be
impossible to track down every past address; older houses are
remodeled or even demolished, destroying or altering the radon
record.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said there are several benefits to using the
eyeglasses as personal dosimeters:
</P>
<P>
   -- Because opticians keep records of when eyeglasses were
prescribed, researchers can establish a baseline for radon exposure
over a definite time period.
</P>
<P>
   -- The glass is ground for a specific prescription, creating a
new surface when the wearer orders the glasses, a clean slate on
which to record particle etchings.
</P>
<P>
   -- The eyeglasses give researchers a long-term record of exposure
to radon particles, which can be detected for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cleaning the lenses will remove only a few ''minutes'' of
exposure over the course of 30-plus years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it puts us in much more direct contact with
establishing how much radon causes how much cancer,'' Fleischer
said. ''You get information on people rather than on the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer will present his findings May 16 in Hiroshima, Japan,
at a meeting of the International Radiation Protection Association.
He also will publish the research in the scientific journal Health
Physics later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Radon is produced when underground uranium decays. The gas seeps
into homes through cracks in foundations then breaks down into
solid particles that can either be directly inhaled or attached to
dust and drawn into the lungs. Because radon particles love to
cling to surfaces, the branched network of bronchioles in the lungs
offers an ample target.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a national residential radon survey completed in 1991,
the average indoor radon level is 1.3 picocuries per liter in the
United States, the Environmental Protection Agency says. The
average outdoor level is 0.4 pCi/L.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say homeowners who find radon levels higher
than 4 picocuries per liter should take action such as sealing
cracks in basements walls and floors or running a pipe from the
foundation through the house up to the attic.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimates radon contributes to 7,000-30,000 lung cancer
deaths every year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. R. William Field, a cancer epidemiologist at the University
of Iowa, said Fleischer's research will work best in conjunction
with environmental studies to provide a better idea of radon's
affect on lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hardest part of a radon epidemiology study is you have to
know what the retrospective radon exposure was,'' Field said.
''These give us better dose estimates. When we have better dose
estimates we can make better risk projections concerning the health
risks posed by home exposure. It's very innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal dosimeters have been used for decades to measure
exposure to certain radioactive particles such as gamma rays, but
the idea of a radon gauge is new, Field said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does provide a good reference to what the person has been
exposed to during the time that the person has worn glasses,'' said
Field, who recently completed a study into radon exposures of
people who lived in a house for at least 20 years. The results of
that study are due to be released May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer's eyeglass work began three years ago and included
Union students Stephen A. Hadley and Nicholas R. Meyer, and Dr.
Alfred Cavallo of the Environmental Measurements Laboratory, a U.S.
Department of Energy facility in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Bicycle Suspension Forks Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two companies are recalling about 31,000
bicycle suspension forks because they can break apart from
bicycles, causing riders to lose control and fall. About a dozen
people have already been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Products Inc. of Valencia, Calif., is recalling about
17,500 BMX and mountain bicycle forks because the tube that
attaches the fork to the bicycle can fail, the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Products has received six reports of forks failing,
resulting in two people suffering minor injuries such as cuts,
bruises and chipped teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Because of similar problems, By Us International Co. of Taiwan
is recalling about 13,500 Ballistic front suspension forks
installed on certain Brunswick mountain bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   By Us and Brunswick received 18 reports of forks on these
bicycles breaking apart resulting in nine riders suffering serious
head and bodily injuries, abrasions, bruises and chipped teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The Answer Products 2000 model bicycle forks have been installed
on more than 30 models of bicycles and sold under Answer and
Manitou brand names. Either ''ANSWER'' or ''MANITOU'' is written on
the side of the fork and the model name is written on the front of
the fork.
</P>
<P>
   The Answer BMX forks are the Carbo Pro and Mag Pro models. The
Manitou mountain bike forks are Mars and X-Vert Super models.
Bicycle brands that were made with these forks include Specialized,
Klein, Jamis and Marin.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycle stores nationwide and mail order catalogs sold the
Answer forks and bikes from August 1999 through May 2000. The forks
ranged in price from $245 to $695, and the assembled bicycles with
these forks ranged in price from $1,200 to more than $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled By Us forks were installed on Mongoose S-20 and MGX
S-20 bicycles, which are orange, and Roadmaster Ridge Rider
bicycles, which are red. The forks on these bikes are black with
decals that read ''BALLISTIC'' and ''105'' on the sides of the
suspension fork legs.
</P>
<P>
   The By Us recall only includes forks that have the following
serial numbers located on the inside of the suspension fork legs:
BA10044001 through BA10049000; BA10050001 through BA10051000;
BAX0001251 through BAX0006750; BAX0006781 through BAX0007080; and
98022087 through 98027843.
</P>
<P>
   Discount department and toy stores nationwide sold the bicycles
with the By Us forks from September 1998 through May 2000 for
between $125 and $150.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission advises consumers to immediately stop
using the bicycles with the recalled forks.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the Answer Products forks can determine if their
product is part of this recall by calling Answer Products Inc. at
1-800-423-0273 between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. EDT Monday through
Friday. Consumers can also get information about a free inspection
and repair service.
</P>
<P>
   For general recall information, consumers can call the safety
commission at 1-800-638-2772.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Low-Cost Health Plan Falters  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A year ago, the nation's largest health insurer
thought it would make a small dent in American's uninsured problem
by offering a cut-rate plan with minimal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna Inc. officials thought people would be better off with at
least a basic health insurance plan than no coverage at all.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, many of the 43 million uninsured think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Aetna officials acknowledged that initial sales have
been slow, though they refused to disclose how many people have
signed up for the plan. Aetna blamed the slow start on the time it
has taken state regulators to approve the plan, which is now sold
in 32 states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers fault the plan's poor benefits and lack
of coverage for catastrophic illness, and say the absence of a
major promotional campaign from Aetna has hampered its success.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Aetna's then-chairman Richard Huber announced the
Affordable HealthChoices program amid much fanfare. Huber said the
program was not the complete answer to the problem of the growing
number of uninsured, but did show that the nation's largest health
insurer was taking the lead in attacking the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Affordable HealthChoices offers three types of plans designed
for companies with five or fewer workers. All of the options have
no deductibles and cost considerably less than most health
insurance plans, with monthly premiums ranging from $46 to $91 for
an individual and $156 to $275 for a family. As with all insurance,
an employer could pick up part of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the plans provide much smaller benefits than typical
insurance. For instance, under all the options, a patient would get
a maximum $50 toward a doctor's visit, no matter how much the
doctor charged.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital benefits vary. Under one option, the insurance pays
$750 a day for the first three days, $350 a day for the next seven
days and $100 a day for the rest of the stay. That's not likely to
cover most hospital bills, particularly for patients undergoing
major surgery or needing intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of consumers believe that having a bare-bones policy is
no better than having no policy at all,'' said Pat Schoeni,
spokeswoman for the National Coalition on Health Care, a
nonpartisan group that seeks to help the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Viewpoints differ on whether Aetna offered the program as a way
to deal with the uninsured, or to score points with federal
lawmakers. Aetna and other managed care plans have faced heavy
criticism for raising premiums beyond reach of many working
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of me says they did this because it sounds like a good
piece of PR (public relations) and that they have decided not to
push it because they could not sell it or make money from it,''
Schoeni said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Amaral, national director of healthcare for National
Federal of Independent Businesses, which represents small
businesses, said the Aetna plan was a bad idea from the start.
Employers who offered the program would have difficulty explaining
the plan's many limitations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't think it offered much value, even for the low
price,'' Amaral said. ''The last thing employers want is to give
their employees a health plan they can complain about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the plan was Aetna's decision to sell it
through its network of insurance brokers, she said. Because Aetna
only pays its agents about 3 percent of the first year's premium,
the agents have little financial incentive to offer it compared to
more expensive plans, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her criticisms, Amaral said she gives Aetna credit for
at least developing a new product. ''It was a valiant effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna spokeswoman Jill Griffiths said the company is still
trying to determine the best way to sell the plan. ''We are very
aware of the criticisms of the program,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since Affordable HealthChoices was launched, Aetna
has been a company in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Huber resigned earlier this spring amid pressure from investors
discouraged by the company's poor stock performance. And after the
company rejected a takeover offer, Aetna decided to split into two
publicly traded companies, one for health care and one for
financial services.

<HEADLINE> Congress Pushes Parental Consent  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The schools get free computers and Internet
access for students. But there's a catch: the technology company
that provides the coveted equipment gets to monitor the pupils'
online activity by age, gender and Zip code.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting such business ventures in elementary and secondary
schools, a bipartisan proposal in Congress would require that most
public schools get parents' written consent before collecting
information from students for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal's Senate sponsors, Sens. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., cited the computer example Tuesday
and others -- including school kids in Massachusetts tasting cereals
and answering questions on them, and elementary students in New
Jersey keeping personal journals for a marketing survey.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more, schools are being perceived not just as centers
of learning but also as centers of commercial research,'' Dodd said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In some schools, he suggested, ''The three Rs now stand for
research, retail and resale'' and children are being used as
''marketing tools in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The national Parent Teacher Association has endorsed the student
privacy proposal and a companion measure in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that students should not be asked to relay private
information as a condition of learning,'' PTA spokeswoman Patty
Yoxall said by telephone from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, groups representing school administrators and
school board members have expressed opposition to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   It would have ''a chilling effect on the positive productive
collaborations in which local schools and businesses are currently
involved, by drastically increasing the administrative and
financial responsibilities of the local school,'' the National
School Boards Association and the American Association of School
Administrators said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   And Dodd and Shelby said they had heard objections from some
companies that have commercial contracts with schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've touched a money nerve,'' quipped Shelby, who is a leader
of the recently formed bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd and Shelby spoke as the Senate debated changes to the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provides money for
schools to help improve poor children's grades and test scores,
train teachers and other programs. Their proposal opened a new
front in a widening legislative campaign over privacy, including
measures designed to protect consumers' financial and medical
information.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd and Shelby said they planned to propose their student
privacy measure as an amendment to the 35-year-old school funding
act, which expires this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, a parallel measure proposed by Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., has been attached to that chamber's version of the school
funding act.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would require all schools that receive money under
the act -- roughly 86 percent of the nation's public schools -- to
get parents' permission before collecting data from students that
companies use for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   They also would:
</P>
<P>
   --Require that parents be informed in writing of the data to be
disclosed and to which companies, how the companies plan to use it,
how much class time will be taken up by gathering the data and how
much money, if any, the companies are paying the school under their
contract.
</P>
<P>
   --Allow schools to seek federal money to help them notify parents
of data-collecting activities.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal ''simply provides knowledge and choice,'' Shelby
said. ''It does not dictate a particular outcome; rather it gives
parents a clear picture regarding what is going on in their
children's classrooms and an opportunity to decide ... whether they
want their kids to participate.''

<HEADLINE> 14 Rescued When Dive Boat Sinks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Eleven passengers and three crew members
were rescued Tuesday when a dive boat sank two miles off shore --
the second time in eight months the craft sank.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of the 48-foot boat ''Manta'' issued a mayday call at
about 12:30 p.m. EDT saying that the stern was awash and that they
were sinking quickly, Coast Guard officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A second dive boat responded and pulled the crew and passengers
to safety. A Coast Guard ship also went to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Suki York, marketing director for the Manta's owner, Southpoint
Divers, said the boat also sank in September. It was salvaged and
restored.
</P>
<P>
   The Manta was again salvaged Tuesday and it will be inspected to
determine why it sank, York said.

<HEADLINE> More Info Surfaces About Knight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana University trustees investigating
coach Bob Knight are recommending the probe be expanded to include
new claims of misconduct that could lead to his dismissal,
according to a broadcast report.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis television station WRTV, quoting unidentified
sources, reported Tuesday that trustees heard new accusations
against the controversial basketball coach at a closed meeting last
week. The report did not specify what those accusations were, but
quoted one unidentified trustee as saying they were ''pretty ugly
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   John Walda, the president of the board of trustees, and
Frederick Eichhorn, a trustee and former president of the Indiana
State Bar Association, were appointed by IU president Myles Brand
in March to investigate a claim by former player Neil Reed. Reed,
who transferred from Indiana in 1997, claimed Knight grabbed him by
the throat and choked him during one practice.
</P>
<P>
   The two also are investigating claims that Knight once kicked
Brand out of a practice and also showed players a soiled piece of
toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has denied the allegations. A university spokesman said
Knight was out of town Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Coach Robert Scott Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama assistant men's basketball coach
Robert Scott died of cancer Tuesday. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a former All-SEC player with the Crimson Tide, died at
DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa, the school said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was diagnosed with stomach cancer in September 1999 and
continued to attend Crimson Tide games while undergoing treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like if I can just come in, sit down and watch,'' he
told The Birmingham News in February, ''it's better than not being
here. If I can get up and say one or two things, I want to try and
do something. That just keeps me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott was picked in the fourth round by Golden State in the 1980
NBA draft and played professionally overseas for six years.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Alabama to begin his coaching career at the high
school level and was assistant coach at Alabama-Birmingham from
1996-98. Scott was hired by Alabama in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska AG Wins GOP Primary  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg took
the first step Tuesday toward reclaiming Sen. Bob Kerrey's seat for
the Republicans, easily defeating the secretary of state and two
other candidates in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   With 89 percent of precincts reporting, Stenberg had 83,449
votes, or 50 percent, far more than Secretary of State Scott
Moore's 36,839 votes, or 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg will take on popular former Gov. Ben Nelson, who left
office in 1999 after two terms. Nelson easily beat a homeless man
who was his only opponent in the Democratic primary for Kerrey's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   In other elections Tuesday, former University of Nebraska
football coach Tom Osborne routed his two opponents in a GOP
congressional primary. Osborne is adored in football-crazy
Nebraska, though issues such as the struggling farm economy and
bringing technology to rural areas dominated his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question I had a name recognition advantage, but as
time went on people started to focus on the issues and not who was
a football coach and who wasn't,'' Osborne told 150 supporters at
an election night party on a private ranch.
</P>
<P>
   There were presidential primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia,
but both were essentially meaningless since George W. Bush and Al
Gore have sealed their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood, who was elected to his first
term as governor in 1956 and to his second term in 1996, easily won
the GOP nomination for a third term Tuesday. At 77, Underwood is
the nation's oldest governor. He is also the only Republican in a
statewide office in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The more dramatic West Virginia race was for the House seat
being left by nine-term Rep. Bob Wise, who won the Democratic
primary to challenge Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   Four Democrats vied for Wise's seat, including 85-year-old
Secretary of State Ken Hechler, who has already spent 18 years in
Congress, from 1959 through 1977. Hechler finished third, well
behind lawyer Jim Humphreys, who spent $3 million of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Hechler spent about $300,000 of his own money and said anything
over $1 million in a primary is ''overkill.'' He ran a TV ad Monday
urging voters to cast their ballot for anyone but Humphreys.
</P>
<P>
   With 86 percent of precincts reporting, Humphreys had 31,169
votes, or 42 percent, while state Sen. Martha Yeager Walker had
21,317 votes, or 29 percent. Hechler had 17,769 votes -- 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys will be heavily favored in deeply Democratic West
Virginia to beat Republican Shelley Moore Capito this fall. Capito,
a member of the state House of Delegates, is the daughter of former
three-term Gov. Arch Moore Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, the only Democrat in Nebraska's congressional
delegation, decided not to run for a third term and will instead
become president of New School University in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg recently defended Nebraska's ban on so-called partial
birth abortions before the Supreme Court. He beat Moore despite the
secretary of state's edge in fund raising this year. Moore had
collected $224,000 to Stenberg's $144,000.
</P>
<P>
   After coaching Nebraska for 25 years and leading the Cornhuskers
to three national championships in the 1990s, Osborne, 63, is
running for the House seat held for five terms by Republican Bill
Barrett, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   With 91 percent of precincts reporting, Osborne had 44,619 votes
-- 70 percent. Longtime state GOP leader John Gale followed with
11,205 votes, or 18 percent, and state Board of Education member
Kathy Wilmot had 7,838 votes -- 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne will face Democrat Rollie Reynolds, a real estate
investor, in November.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his self-imposed limit on campaign contributions over
$300 and his refusal to accept money from political action
committees, Osborne had raised $112,285 by mid-April. About half
was unsolicited.

Big Game Jackpot Hits $350 Million
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- People who wouldn't know a quick-pick from a scratch-off
ticket got a piece of the action in Tuesday night's Big Game lottery, swelling
the jackpot to $350 million -- the richest in U.S. history. Thomas Carter, a
clerk at the Quik Trip in Decatur, said his thumbs hurt from punching in so many
Big Game ticket requests for so many first-time lottery players Tuesday morning.
The numbers drawn were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37, Big Ball 4. Word on whether anyone held
a jackpot-winning ticket was expected Wednesday morning.

   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- While comparing the action to taking a dose of medicine,
Sen. John McCain Tuesday endorsed George W. Bush, his rival in the Republican
primaries. McCain said that he doesn't want to be Bush's running mate. Behind
their smiles, the strains from a bitter Republican primary fight were still
apparent. Even as McCain said he looked forward to ''enthusiastically
campaigning'' for the presumptive GOP nominee, the vanquished rival had to be
prompted before using the word ''endorse.''

Navy Commandos Near Sierra Leone

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Navy has commandos aboard a patrol boat in the
waters off West Africa as a ''precautionary measure'' in light of the
intensifying crisis in Sierra Leone, a Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday. Kenneth
Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen, said the Cyclone-class
patrol boat USS Thunderbolt was not directly off the coast of Sierra Leone but
was ''in the area and will remain there.'' In the last week, clashes have broken
out intermittently between United Nations' peacekeepers and rebels, with some
500 peacekeepers being held hostage.

businessmen applying for riverboat casino licenses. The former four-term
Democratic governor was found guilty along with his son Stephen of fraud and
racketeering. The scheme took place during Edwards' final term and after he left
office in 1996, when he still wielded considerable influence in Louisiana

increasingly likely to pass. ''We want the voice of this meeting to echo across

<HEADLINE> NYC police commissioner has cancer  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made his
announcement less than two weeks ago that he has prostate cancer,
his good friend Police Commissioner Howard Safir was at his side
offering support.
</P>
<P>
   Little did the commissioner know that on Tuesday, the roles
would be reversed: Safir announced he has been diagnosed with the
disease while Giuliani and the commissioner's wife looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, 58, learned of the diagnosis last week. He said his
condition is treatable. He also said he had no plans to step down
as commissioner but would take a day or two off when he needs to go
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing that I asked my doctor is if I'm going to die
from this, and he said, 'No, you're not,' and I said, 'Good,'''
Safir recounted. ''It is curable, according to my doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Giuliani, Safir said his disease was detected at a ''very
early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir underwent a routine physical a couple of weeks ago. A
blood test showed that his prostate specific antigen, or PSA,
levels were elevated, and he was told to go for follow-up tests,
which led to the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Safir's first medical crisis since being appointed
commissioner in 1996. In March 1997, he underwent triple bypass
heart surgery but soon recovered and returned to work. He also
resumed the sports he's passionate for: in-line skating, kayaking
and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, he said he still takes part in those
activities and that he's in great shape otherwise. There is no
history of prostate cancer in his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ask yourself, 'Why me?' But life is not fair that way,''
Safir said. ''You just get along with it. It's just a bump in the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Safir, who embraced her husband as he spoke, said she was
''very upset'' when she learned of the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I believe that the next month or so of treatment ... this
will be behind us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, Giuliani announced he has treatable prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At Safir's side on Tuesday, the mayor was upbeat about his
friend's prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure Howard is going to be fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both men laughed when asked if maybe the water at City Hall is
tainted, since both were diagnosed with the same disease within
weeks. Safir is being treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, Giuliani at Mount Sinai Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is
the second most common type of cancer found in American men. Early
detection greatly increases the chance of successful treatment.
About 179,300 men were diagnosed with the disease in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have survived prostate cancer are former Sen.
Bob Dole and New York Yankees manager Joe Torre. Treatments can
include removal of the prostate and/or radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Safir was appointed the city's 39th police commissioner by
Giuliani after a stint as fire commissioner. He had spent 26 years
in federal law enforcement, serving as operations chief of the U.S.
Marshals Service in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Safir replaced William Bratton, who resigned under pressure
after Giuliani ordered an investigation into trips Bratton took at
the expense of corporate honchos.
</P>
<P>
   Safir has served at a time when the New York Police Department
has been under intense scrutiny for the fatal police shooting of
Amadou Diallo in 1999 and the police torture of Abner Louima in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   And Safir himself seemed a lightning rod for controversy. Last
year, he took an all-expenses-paid trip to the Academy Awards
ceremony, courtesy of a Revlon executive friend, leaving town amid
the protests over Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars trip prompted the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association
-- the union representing more than 26,000 police officers -- to
issue its first no-confidence vote against a commissioner. Safir
refused to quit and reiterated a statement he has made many times
during his tenure: ''Crime has gone down more under my stewardship
than any time in the history of this city. ... It is a safer
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir held a variety of positions in the Drug Enforcement
Administration from 1965 to 1979 before moving to the Marshals
Service. From 1979 to 1990, he headed the service's witness
security division and was a director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   He then formed his own security consulting firm, Safir
Associates. In 1994, the Bronx native returned to the city to serve
as fire commissioner under Giuliani, before moving on to the NYPD's
top job in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Safir graduated from Hofstra University in 1963 with a bachelor
of arts degree in history and political science and went on to
Brooklyn Law School. He and his wife have been married for 34
years. Besides their son, Adam, they have a daughter, Jennifer.
Both children are married.

<HEADLINE> UN Peacekeepers Retreat in S. Leone  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Nerves in the capital of this
beleaguered West African nation were on edge today after word of a
retreat by U.N. peacekeepers and rumors about the whereabouts of
rebel leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers withdrew from Masiaka, 45 miles east of
Freetown, on Monday after exchanging gunfire with unknown attackers
and running out of ammunition, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said.
News of the retreat did not reach Freetown until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While rebels belonging to the Revolutionary United Front are
believed to be in the area, it was unclear if they were
responsible. Helicopter reconnaissance showed the city was
completely empty Tuesday afternoon. Hundreds of refugees from the
Masiaka area had reached the edge of Freetown by Tuesday, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Moseray, a civil servant, said he was worried because he
''heard that the rebels had attacked Masiaka, and Masiaka is so
close to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest bad news, Wimhurst said: ''Freetown is not
going to fall to the RUF.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh had been under U.N. guard before Monday's shooting
outside his Freetown home. Sierra Leonean army soldiers, who under
a July peace plan are supposed to be disarmed, and fighters from
the pro-government Kamajor militia fought the rebels for hours at
Sankoh's home after a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor mill had Sankoh anywhere from the Sierra Leonean
jungle to an army safehouse, but U.N. officials said they did not
know where he was.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are anxious to find a way to contact him,'' Wimhurst told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Sierra Leone has become increasingly chaotic
since a Nigerian-led regional intervention force pulled out last
week. Since then, clashes have broken out intermittently between
peacekeepers and rebels, and 500 peacekeepers are being held
hostage by the RUF. At least one peacekeeper is believed to be
dead.
</P>
<P>
   In Abuja, Nigeria, presidents from around the region met Tuesday
to try to defuse the crisis. They condemned the recent rebel moves
but fell short of ordering additional troops into Sierra Leone.
Instead, they called for a ministerial summit to be held next week
in Nigeria to discuss the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   A statement signed by nine presidents said they ''expressed
their determination to use all means at their disposal, including
the military option, to foil any attempt to take over power through
the use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the United States had sent a ''fact-finding'' team
to Nigeria on Monday to assess what help the U.S. military might
provide if Nigeria or other African nations decide to augment their
peacekeeping role in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the United
States was not considering sending any combat troops to Sierra
Leone, but he confirmed news reports that the Clinton
administration has told the United Nations it is willing to provide
air transportation for a battalion of 700 to 800 peacekeepers from
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the United States might also help transport
additional peacekeepers from Jordan and India. He said it was not
yet clear what other kinds of military assistance the United States
might provide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Specifically, the types of help we will provide remain to be
determined because it depends on what the U.N. and the
international community, including the regional countries in West
Africa, decide to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a U.N. spokesman said three remaining battalions
appear ready to deploy by next week, which would bring the U.N.
force up to its full strength of 11,100.
</P>
<P>
   British helicopters, meanwhile, continued swooping into Freetown
on Tuesday, ferrying out frightened people.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a Ministry of Defense spokeswoman said 320 British,
European Union and Commonwealth citizens had been evacuated so far.
They were flown to Sierra Leone's main airport, and then most were
taken by airplane to Dakar, the capital of Senegal, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone, among the world's poorest countries despite vast
diamond resources, was brutalized during eight years of civil war,
which ended with a peace accord last July that created a
power-sharing government. In principle, that deal included the
rebels and Sankoh, whose forces killed and maimed thousands during
the war.

<HEADLINE> Jackpot hits $350 million, pushes even reluctant gamblers over theedge  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- People who wouldn't know a quick-pick from a
scratch-off wanted a piece of the action in Tuesday night's Big
Game lottery, swelling the jackpot to $350 million -- the richest in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers were 1-2-12-33-37, Big Ball 4. It was not
immediately known if anyone held a jackpot-winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Carter, a clerk at the Quik Trip in Decatur, said his
thumbs hurt from punching in so many Big Game ticket requests for
so many first-time lottery players Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of them don't know what they're doing,'' Carter said.
''You have to explain to them that they can pick the numbers
themselves, or they can let the computer do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The almost inconceivably large jackpot has converted even the
most reluctant gamblers. John Smith, a 23-year-old student at the
University of Maryland, had never bought any sort of lottery ticket
before buying five tickets Tuesday at a liquor store in College
Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Melody McPipkin, of Decatur, also bought five tickets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless it gets way up there, I don't bother,'' she said. ''I'm
not going to waste my time on just a few million.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets were sold in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   If a single person wins the jackpot, the payout is either $8.9
million a year for 26 years, or a one-time payment of $114 million.
That's after taxes, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million jackpot tops the previous American record, a
$295.7 million Powerball jackpot split by 13 machinists in
Westerville, Ohio, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set last December by
Spain's El Gordo, or the Fat One. But that game spreads itself thin
by awarding thousands of prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The odds that a $1 ticket will have all five winning numbers and
the matching Big Money Ball are one in more than 76 million. But
who's thinking about odds when $1 buys a chance to dream?
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't mind calling my company and telling them I'm not
coming in to work tomorrow,'' said Mitchell Ingram, a construction
foreman from Woodstock. ''And you can't win if you don't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Georgia and Massachusetts almost didn't have a
chance to play Monday night and Tuesday morning because damaged
phones lines shut down hundreds of lottery terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with BellSouth phone lines shut down about 370
retailers in northeast Georgia until Tuesday afternoon. The problem
was worse in southeastern Massachusetts, where an accidentally cut
fiber-optic cable disabled between 750 and 1,000 lottery agents.
</P>
<P>
   The hype surrounding the Big Game has created problems for some.
Alcoholics can avoid bars, but compulsive gamblers have a hard time
avoiding lottery advertisements, news stories and talk around the
office water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Ed B., a self-described compulsive gambler from Griffin, lost
his life savings, took out a second mortgage to cover his debts and
tried to kill himself before getting into Gamblers Anonymous. The
Big Game is certainly tempting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I can't buy one,'' he said. ''If I buy one ticket, I'm
going to buy 10,000 of them before long.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on
Problem Gambling in Washington, D.C., said hard-core gamblers -- who
make up about 1-2 percent of the adult population -- play because of
an overwhelming need to gamble, not because of the size of the
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people, the largest jackpot in American history is
too much to turn down. Edward Franco, who bought his tickets at
Union Station in Chicago, said he knows exactly what he will do if
he wins the jackpot:
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to walk into the closest Harley (Davidson) shop and
not even haggle. Just get some keys and ride ... I don't even know
if I'll put a call in to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco stopped and corrected himself: ''I don't know if I'll
have my people call in to work.''

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Peacekeepers from around the world put
themselves at risk in faraway countries every day. But not for
free. The United Nations promises $1,000 per person, per month to
countries that volunteer troops for peace missions.
</P>
<P>
   That money can be helpful for poorer nations, such as Zambia and
Guinea. But the flat rate won't cover the costs for better-trained
western forces, who seem unwilling to lose money on high-risk
missions in areas where they have little at stake.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say they take what they can get. But that leaves
some wondering if the United Nations is getting what it pays for.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, 500 U.N. personnel have been taken hostage by
rebels of the Revolutionary United Front. At least one peacekeeper
is believed to be dead, and 12 others have been injured. Many
peacekeepers have been stripped of their weapons, and some have
engaged in fighting. Monday in the capital, Freetown, troops found
themselves caught between angry residents and rebels who opened
fire on the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Sierra Leone, the mission is largely made up of Africans,
and while it's no reflection on the troops themselves, a number of
these units will not have trained specifically for peacekeeping
duties and many of them are poorly equipped,'' said David Malone,
Canada's former deputy ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Most Western powers have been willing to pay their own way when
peace and stability is in their direct interest, as it was for
Australia in East Timor or European nations in Kosovo. But for
others, the money can be critical.
</P>
<P>
   ''For developing countries, the financial issues are very
important,'' Malone said. ''Some countries wind up doing relatively
well out of peacekeeping because the flat rate more than covers
their costs. But for other countries, it's always a money-losing
proposition. Canada is one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the possibility that peacekeepers may not see the
money at all. Jordan, which has participated in countless
peacekeeping missions on several continents, is owed millions of
dollars, according to its deputy U.N. ambassador, Prince Zeid
Hussein. Still, that has not stopped the country from volunteering.
</P>
<P>
   No big-name Western peacekeeping countries sent troops to Sierra
Leone, where the mission is charged with maintaining a crumbling
peace deal that ended eight years of brutal civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said contributors such as Canada and Norway, which often
volunteer for such missions, are either spread thin elsewhere or
unwilling to take another chance on Africa after the 1993 debacle
in Somalia, when 18 Americans were killed in a botched U.S. raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. policy has been to support Africans in resolving
conflicts on their own continent,'' said Tim Bork, director of the
African Policy Initiative for the Carnegie Endowment. ''I don't
think there would be support for U.S. troops swooping in there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, the United Nations had to rely on those nations
that offered troops and whatever experience the forces brought from
home. The U.N. peacekeeping department does not provide any formal
training to peacekeepers and expects troops to arrive with their
own equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said some showed up in Sierra
Leone without supplies, and the United Nations had to scramble to
get equipment from storage facilities in Italy to the troops in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   He also said an erroneous U.N. report on rebel troop movements
in Sierra Leone was caused by poor communications equipment being
used by the Guineans and Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing peacekeeping these days on a shoestring,'' Eckhard
said, adding that years of budget cutbacks and late payments by
member states have prevented the United Nations from doing ''the
kind of professional job we would like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United Nations continues to authorize peacekeeping
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's information minister, Julius Spencer, expressed
his own doubts Monday over the mission's ability to deal with the
turmoil in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are beginning to question whether troops from certain
countries have the resolve and are willing to dirty their hands,''
he said. ''We find it difficult to understand how such a large
number of people can be disarmed and abducted.''
</P>
<P>
   African nations, including Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Guinea and
Zambia, make up the bulk of the authorized 11,100-member Sierra
Leone mission. The three non-regional contributors are Jordan,
India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Laurenti, executive director of policy studies at the
United Nations Association of the USA, said the United Nations
knows that recruiting from the poorest countries means tapping
armies that have few resources invested.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say they are constantly shopping around for
troops and try for the greatest mix of expertise in planning
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations ''is often not able to get what it needs
and is reduced to accepting what is on offer,'' said Malone, who
now heads the International Peace Academy. ''Experience shows that
where big powers deploy, you get more power.''

<HEADLINE> Picasso Piece Sells for $28.6 Mil  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE CARROLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pablo Picasso's 1932 abstract portrait of a
woman in blue holding a pot of red and yellow tulips sold for $28.6
million at auction Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nature morte aux tulipes,'' a portrait of Picasso's mistress
Marie-Therese Walter, fetched the 10th highest price for any piece
of art ever sold, said Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for
Christie's.
</P>
<P>

expensive piece Tuesday evening, selling for $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   --The artist's 14-by-9 inch abstract portrait of Dora Maar --
another of his mistresses -- appears in ''Buste de femme a la
frange.'' It sold for $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Six other Picassos painted between 1911 and 1963 were up for
auction. There were also works by Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Paul
Klee, Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Roy
Lichtenstein.

holding a violin while a floating rooster carrying a couple
levitates above his head -- sold for $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Warhol's ''Myths'' is a series of vertical silhouettes of famous
characters including Superman, Santa Claus, Mickey Mouse, Uncle Sam
and Dracula and sold for $446,000.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Farmers Hope Rain Improves Soil  </HEADLINE>
By KEN THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- When Bill Radke talks to his neighbors
about the dry conditions this spring, one year keeps coming up --
1977.
</P>
<P>
   During that dry summer, Radke couldn't salvage his corn crop and
was only saved by a decent soybean crop. He says conditions have
been equally dry this spring, so arid that he decided to double his
crop insurance for the first time after nearly 40 years of farming.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains -- the first in weeks -- woke Radke and his wife early
this week, pounding his 820 acre farm in Van Meter with about one
inch of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will help things get started,'' said Radke, 64, a farmer
since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa has experienced one of its driest planting seasons since
1989, raising concerns among farmers that it could hurt crop
yields.
</P>
<P>
   Recent rains moistened topsoil, but much of the state still lags
behind in precipitation totals.
</P>
<P>
   Sioux City, for example, is about 2 inches short of normal for
this time of year. Before the rains, both topsoil and subsoil
moisture were short or very short in more than 80 percent of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   State Climatologist Harry Hillaker said the weather has brought
the driest conditions in parts of central and northwest Iowa since
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa has been averaging about one-third of an inch of rain each
week, well below the nearly 1 inch per week the state normally
gets. The clouds will need to release about 1\ inch to an 1{ inch
of rain to get soil conditions back to normal, Hillaker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time of year, they could still make some good progress
and get moisture in the ground before we get to full-time
summertime temperatures in the area,'' Hillaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Radke said dry conditions last August were cushioned by a moist
subsoil. Without much snow this winter and scant rainfall, he said
the intense heat of summer could hurt crop outputs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we have no subsoil. If we get rains when we need it
... we'll get along until August comes,'' Radke said. ''When August
comes and we have no subsoil ... it will burn it up for sure.''
</P>

   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Strong domestic and international
competition may sour the Oregon strawberry and raspberry harvest
this year, but the outlook for blueberries and Marionberries is
sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of California strawberries already worries Oregon
growers and processors, said Roy Malensky of Oregon Berry Packing
in Hillsboro, a leader in the Oregon berry industry.
</P>
<P>
   California ''has so many strawberries they don't know what to do
with them,'' Malensky said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the Oregon harvest is labor costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a difficult time competing with other states,''
Malensky said. ''The cost of labor in Oregon is comparable only to
Washington and Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the harvest and acreage has been shrinking
steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1993, strawberry acreage in the state was about 6,200
acres. Now it's around 3,400 and dropping, Malensky said.
</P>
<P>
   Red raspberry acreage dropped from about 4,000 acres in 1992 to
about 3,000 and is still falling. Prices are low, along with
intense competition from Northern Washington, and from
high-yielding countries such as Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and
Chile.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Arms Pact Seems Difficult  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American election politics and Vladimir
Putin's uncertain agenda make progress this year on arms control
doubtful, even though the subject likely will dominate President
Clinton's June summit with the new Russian president.
</P>
<P>
   In his final months in office, Clinton is looking for an arms
deal to add to his legacy; the incoming Putin is seeking to
establish his credentials on the world stage as the leader of a
nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to keep Clinton from grabbing the spotlight, Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., pledged last month to single-handedly block any
late-term arms-control pact that Clinton and Putin might negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said any
such treaty would be ''dead on arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   But even before Helms' attention-grabbing statement on the
Senate floor, there seemed little likelihood senators would be in a
position to deal with any major new treaties this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong feeling among both congressional Democrats and
Republicans that such weighty issues best be left to the next
president. And time is running short, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Helms was stating the obvious,'' said John Isaacs, president
of the Council for a Livable World, a group that supports
arms-control measures. There is not enough time for such a treaty
to be concluded and sent to the Senate in 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs contends ''the odds are very slim'' that Clinton and
Putin will reach such an agreement -- or even the framework for one
-- at their Moscow meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Clinton and Putin appear eager for a possible
breakthrough on arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly, Clinton would like to win Russian blessings for an
amendment to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to authorize
the building of a limited missile defense shield against attacks
from hostile states such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia continues to oppose ABM changes and Putin has echoed
that opposition, so far at least, suggesting any changes could
undermine all arms control measures now in place.
</P>
<P>
   But the one-time KGB agent remains something of a mystery to
U.S. policy-makers, at least in terms of his negotiating skills.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders ''usually don't show what they're going to do
until they get the power to do it,'' said Jack Matlock, a U.S.
ambassador to the Soviet Union under both Presidents Reagan and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, inaugurated last Sunday, is almost ''an accidental
president,'' suggested Thomas Graham, a former U.S. diplomat now
with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''He's a man
of limited horizons (and) ... there are real limits to what Putin
or any other president of Russia can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian parliament recently ratified the START II arms
control treaty -- which would reduce each side's arsenal from 6,000
warheads to between 3,000 and 3,500 -- after seven years of delay.
And it also ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the
U.S. Senate rejected last fall.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia has expressed an eagerness to move on to even deeper
cuts in nuclear arms -- a START III treaty. Its nuclear arsenal is
rusting, increasingly expensive to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Both votes put pressure on the United States to move forward on
arms reduction.
</P>
<P>
   On the presidential campaign trail, the summit will be closely
watched.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush favors rewriting the ABM Treaty and
development of a national anti-missile system as ''part of
redefining a post-Cold War era.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Bush and other Republicans seek to portray Democrats
as weak on defense, Vice President Al Gore has sought to link Bush
with Helms and other right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Governor Bush were to inherit from us an arms control
agreement so clearly in the best interests of the American people,
is Senator Helms the last word?'' Gore asked recently.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has pledged to make the rejected Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty the first measure he submits to the Senate if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said his advice to Clinton is to
ignore Helms and other naysayers and to press ahead in his meeting
with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is appropriate, I think it is useful and I think he
should attempt to deal with arms control issues,'' Biden said. ''I
do not believe, axiomatically, that there is not time to deal with
any arms control agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the minimum, what he does, if he comes back with a serious
arms control agreement, it puts the next president in a better
position to continue to pursue arms control,'' Biden said.

<HEADLINE> ABC Crushes Competition In Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four celebrity editions of ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' gave ABC its best week in the ratings since the Super
Bowl and a commanding lead in the important May ''sweeps'' period.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's average prime-time audience of 18.2 million people last
week easily outdistanced second-place CBS and its 11.6 million
viewers, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishment came even though 3.5 million Time Warner
customers lost access to ABC on May 1 because of the cable
company's dispute with ABC's parent, the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity editions of ''Millionaire'' each drew an audience
of 34.6 million to 36 million. Last Wednesday's episode, where
longtime fan of the show Rosie O'Donnell won $500,000 for charity,
was the game show's most-watched episode ever.
</P>
<P>
   ABC beat NBC on Thursday night for the first time in a ratings
sweeps month since 1994. The victory came after ''Millionaire'' ran
eight minutes long, cutting in to the audience for NBC's ''ER,'' a
move that raised some eyebrows in the industry. An NBC spokeswoman
refused to comment on the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A regular edition of ''Millionaire'' and ''The Practice'' also
beat two made-for-TV movies on rival networks Sunday. CBS could at
least brag that its ''Cupid and Cate'' movie was more popular than
the first part of NBC's miniseries, ''Jason and the Argonauts.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC saw another high-priced miniseries, ''The '70s,'' finish
fourth at the 9 p.m. hour on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had an 11.7 rating and 20 share for the week, with CBS at
8.2 and 14. NBC had 11.4 million viewers (8.1 rating, 14 share),
Fox had 7.4 million viewers (5.0, 8), UPN had 3.7 million (2.8, 5),
the WB had 3.2 million (2.4, 4) and Pax TV had 990,000 viewers
(0.7, 1).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' and ABC's ''World News Tonight'' finished
in a virtual tie in the evening news ratings race. NBC had an
average of 10,000 more viewers (9.03 million viewers to 9.02
million), but ABC (7.0 rating, 16 share) bested NBC (6.9, 15) in
the ratings. The ''CBS Evening News'' had 7 million viewers (5.5,
12).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of May 1-7, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC,
23.6; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Wednesday), ABC, 22.6;
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (Monday), ABC, 22.5; ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 22.1; ''ER,'' NBC, 18.0; ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 17.1; ''The Practice,''
ABC, 14.1; ''Friends,'' NBC, 13.7; ''20/20 Downtown,'' ABC, 13.5;
''Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ABC, 12.9; ''Friends'' special, NBC, 12.9.

<HEADLINE> Tests Urged for Drug-Resistant HIV  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Tests that help identify drug-resistant strains
of the AIDS virus should be routinely used in most infected
patients to help doctors customize treatment, according to a
recommendation in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with drug-resistant strains are at greater risk of
developing full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Because the AIDS virus tends to mutate rapidly, becoming
resistant to drugs, patients generally receive a combination of
medicines. But initial treatment fails in about half of all AIDS
patients, and doctors frequently have to change the treatment to
keep up with mutations.
</P>
<P>
   In today's journal, a panel of the International AIDS
Society-USA said doctors should consider routine testing for
virtually all HIV-infected patients except those whose infection is
already being successfully treated.
</P>
<P>
   Two types of tests help determine resistance: Genotype tests
identify genetic mutations known to be resistant. And phenotype
tests determine whether a drug will kill a patient's virus strain.
</P>
<P>
   Both tests are costly, running about $400 to $1,000 each, Dr.
Charles Flexner of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
said in an accompanying editorial. Also, it can take up to a month
to get results, and the tests are not foolproof and may produce
false-negative results, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The International AIDS Society-USA is a nonprofit program for
doctors involved in HIV and AIDS care. It works to improve AIDS
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Snake Venom May Help Treat Stroke  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A blood-thinning drug derived from the venom of
the Malayan pit viper can reverse symptoms in stroke victims,
researchers reported today in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   However, other research suggests that if doctors wait too long
to administer the drug, it might kill the patient.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental treatment follows the discovery that blood
failed to clot in people bitten by the snake. Scientists figured
the venom could be used as an anticoagulant to help stroke victims
who have a clot that is blocking blood flow to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 500 stroke patients, 42 percent who were given the
drug ancrod within three hours after the onset of symptoms regained
significant functioning vs. 34 percent of those who got a placebo.
The two groups had similar death rates three months after
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Dr. David Sherman, a neurologist at the
University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, and was
conducted in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The promising results led ancrod's manufacturer, BASF Pharma, to
launch a separate European study to see if it would also work
within six hours of symptoms. But the three-month death rate in the
ancrod patients was higher than in a placebo group and the study
was halted in March.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Mayer, spokeswoman for BASF Pharma's U.S. subsidiary,
Knoll Pharmaceutical Co., said deaths were ''minimally higher'' in
the ancrod patients. The company is analyzing data from both
studies and has not yet applied for federal approval of ancrod for
stroke treatment, Mayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said ancrod should still be considered a promising
potential treatment, and stroke experts not involved in the study
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Ancrod is similar to the clot-buster TPA, the only federally
approved drug for strokes. TPA dissolves clots, while ancrod lowers
blood levels of fibrinogen, a substance that can help form clots.
That allows blood to flow more freely.
</P>
<P>
   Both drugs are given intravenously. TPA, like ancrod, has a
three-hour treatment window.
</P>
<P>
   About 700,000 Americans have strokes each year. Many end up with
paralysis, impaired speech and other debilitating effects. Until
the recent use of TPA, there was little doctors could do to treat
strokes once symptoms such as numbness and difficulty speaking
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   TPA, like ancrod, has also been linked with more deaths after
the three-hour window, said Dr. John Marler, associate director for
clinical trials at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke. He said the studies underscore how critical very early
treatment is.
</P>
<P>
   Ancrod may be slightly less likely to produce bleeding in the
brain, a potentially fatal complication, said Dr. Thomas Brott, a
neurologist with the Mayo Medical School in Jacksonville, Fla., and
a member of the American Heart Association's stroke council. In
Sherman's study, 5 percent of ancrod patients had brain
hemorrhaging vs. 2 percent of the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be possible to fine-tune ancrod to make it even safer
than it was in the study,'' Brott said.
</P>
<P>
   BASF Pharma keeps a colony of snakes in Germany and milks them
regularly to extract the venom. Sherman said the company has not
succeeded in making a synthetic version so far.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial in the journal, Drs. Marc R. Mayberg and Anthony
Furlan of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation said they are not
convinced ancrod has any clear advantage over TPA but could be
another drug at doctors' disposal.

<HEADLINE> Md. Students Get Ethics Lesson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUMBERLAND, Md. (AP) -- An ethics course required for MBA
students at the University of Maryland includes visits to federal
prisons, where white-collar criminals urge students to take the
high road.
</P>
<P>
   ''I call this 'Scared Straight' for MBA students,'' said
Victoria Rymer, a professor who recently accompanied 35 students to
a prison near Cumberland. Students heard from three inmates who
once thought they had it all.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine what this does to my sense of self-esteem,'' said
Nicholas Bush, 54, fingering his green prison work clothes. ''It
takes a great deal for me to stand here and talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is serving 3{ years for embezzling almost $2.5 million from
the Natural Gas Supply Association during 16 years as head of the
Washington-based trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will all have the opportunity to make ethical decisions in
your career,'' Bush said. ''You will help yourselves by always
erring on the side of right.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Matthieson, 37, serving 21 months for theft and mail
fraud, recalled his high-flying days as a travel industry
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three years ago, I was having lunch in Monte Carlo and Nice.
You know where I had lunch today,'' he said. ''You don't want to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Morris, who expects to get her master's degree in
business administration this month, said she was struck by how much
the inmates resembled ordinary business people.
</P>
<P>
   ''You go in thinking this could never happen to me, but then you
see these people who don't look like what you think of as
criminals,'' she said. ''They look like what I see myself as, in
education and experience.''

<HEADLINE> Kennedy May Not Have GOP Challenger  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LeBLANC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts Republicans could be on the verge of
a political milestone but none of the party faithful are
celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1916, the year United States senators
began being popularly elected, a Massachusetts Democrat faces the
possibility of a campaign without a Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Jack E. Robinson had hoped to be the Republican to take on Sen.
Edward Kennedy in November.
</P>
<P>
   But by 5 p.m. Tuesday, the deadline to turn in 10,000 signatures
needed to get his name on the ballot, Robinson was well short. He
had submitted at least 5,122 signatures, Secretary of State William
Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   That number could increase, because not all towns are connected
to the state computer system that tracks the signatures, Galvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson planned to announce today that he had collected well
over 10,000 signatures, the Boston Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson -- a young, black Republican and former Eastern Airlines
executive now running a cellular phone business -- also is
struggling to regain the backing of his party's leaders, including
Gov. Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Some top state Republicans withdrew their endorsements in March
after the 39-year-old political neophyte released a detailed
11-page personal history. In it, Robinson outlined a drunken
driving arrest -- he was eventually cleared -- and a relationship
with a girlfriend who took out a restraining order against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think there's some pretty big questions he's left
unanswered,'' Cellucci said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since releasing the so-called ''Robinson Report,'' the candidate
has kept a low profile, but vowed to fight on without the help of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his popularity among Massachusetts voters, Kennedy has
faced a Republican foe in every campaign since he was first elected
to the Senate seat that had been held by his brother John F.
Kennedy. Each time -- in 1964, 1970, 1976, 1982, 1988 and 1994 --
Kennedy fended off those challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy faced his toughest re-election battle in 1994, against
wealthy Republican businessman Mitt Romney. Early polls showed the
two in a virtual tie, but Kennedy ended up winning, 58 percent to
41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy aide declined comment on Robinson's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Election Commission reports for the period between
January and March show Kennedy had more than $3.7 million on hand.
Robinson has so far loaned his campaign $39,000 and spent all but
$600.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier GOP challenger, Plymouth County District Attorney
Michael Sullivan, bowed out of the race, citing satisfaction with
his current job and his desire to spend time with his four
school-age children.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Robinson, Kennedy may not be alone on the November
ballot. Carla Howell, a candidate for the Libertarian Party, and
Philip Lawler, a candidate for the Constitution Party, are running.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeking New Chapter With UN  </HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After years of isolation and strain,
Israel is hoping that its compliance with a 22-year-old U.N.
resolution to withdraw from Lebanese soil will help warm ties with
the world body that gave it life.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Yehuda Lankry, told
The Associated Press that Israel has been enjoying rare cooperation
with the United Nations in preparation for a pullout by July.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has yet to comply with other U.N. resolutions calling for
it to withdraw from additional war-won territories, but Lankry said
Israel's acceptance of the Lebanon resolution was a good first step
in improving relations.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's foreign minister arrives in New York on Friday for
talks with U.N. officials on the future role of peacekeepers in
southern Lebanon. And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
the subject was high on the agenda during talks she held with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or
UNIFIL, to do more than take up the reins when Israel vacates this
summer after an 18-year presence there.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect that after Israel implements its withdrawal from
south Lebanon, that UNIFIL will help to restore Lebanese
sovereignty and to ensure a situation of stability,'' Lankry said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, after Israel first entered Lebanese territory to drive
back guerrillas from the border, the Security Council passed
resolution 425 calling for its withdrawal and for the establishment
of a U.N. peacekeeping force to confirm the withdrawal, restore
peace to the region and help the Lebanese government regain its
authority in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Israel briefly withdrew but invaded Lebanon again in 1982 to
oust the PLO. Three years later, it pulled back to a southern strip
it has patrolled ever since to prevent cross-border attacks on its
northern communities.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Israel has often found itself alone,
supported only by the United States, when facing dozens of Arab and
Muslim states. It has been a difficult relationship that both sides
say they would like to change.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has been outspoken in his criticism of member states who
continue to block Israel from taking part in U.N. groupings and
committees. Those actions and others ''have given a regrettable
impression of bias and one-sidedness,'' he said last December.
</P>
<P>
   It was upon the ashes of the Holocaust, when Europe's Jews were
nearly wiped out by Nazi Germany in World War II, that the United
Nations voted in 1947 to carve out a homeland for the Jews in
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In its younger years, Israel was an active member of the United
Nations. But after its victories in the 1967 and 1973 wars, a
coalition of developing nations in the Mideast, Africa and Asia
began concerted attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the General Assembly voted to equate Zionism with
racism, a move that all but shattered relations. Nine years ago it
was repealed but ''even so, deep and painful scars remain,'' for
both sides, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lankry believes relations with the world body are finally
starting to heal. He was hesitant to link Israel's proposed entry
into a grouping of mostly West European nations at the United
Nations with its acceptance of the Lebanon resolution. But
''psychologically, it helps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a new chapter with the United Nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there were signs that Israel was looking to the United
Nations in ways it had not before. Lankry credited Annan and the
new U.N. envoy to the region, Terje Roed-Larsen, for stepping in --
at Israel's request -- during fighting last week between Israel and
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. was immediately instrumental in exploiting the fact
that Larsen was in the area and was able to reach the Lebanese and
the Syrians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Close cooperation has been rather rare,'' he added, ''so we
are very satisfied.''

<HEADLINE> Medicare Drug Plan To Be Revealed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to show unity on a key election-year
issue, President Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders are
ready to unveil a proposed prescription drug benefit under Medicare
that the White House first touted last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to be unveiled at the White House today will stand
as an alternative to the House Republican approach calling for
private insurance, and thus set the stage for a debate in the final
months of the congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt,
Senate leader Tom Daschle and numerous rank and file Democrats
would join Clinton at today's announcement. There are likely to be
minor differences between bills advanced in the House and Senate,
they said, but stressed that the party was unified on its approach.
</P>
<P>
   According to a description of the proposal that circulated in
Congress on Tuesday, coverage would be optional, and any
beneficiary wishing to enroll would pay a premium that one official
estimated at roughly $24 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The basic Medicare benefit would pay for 50 percent of the cost
of the first $2,000 in prescriptions annually, rising to $5,000 by
2009. Low-income beneficiaries up to 135 percent of the
government's poverty level would receive subsidies, and
beneficiaries with slightly higher incomes would receive a slightly
reduced subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the basic benefit, Democrats said the plan
envisions catastrophic coverage after out-of-pocket expenses exceed
a certain level, likely $3,000 to $4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic efforts to achieve a measure of unity have been
complicated by internal debate over a separate bill to require
reduced prices for certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, advanced by Rep. Tom Allen of Maine and backed by more
than 150 House Democrats, was opposed strongly by others in the
party, including several senators, party officials said. It would
permit pharmacies to buy prescription drugs for Medicare at the
same preferred price given providers under Medicaid or Veterans
Affairs Department health programs.
</P>
<P>
   The provision is not included in the bill being unveiled at the
White House, although Clinton and Democratic lawmakers are expected
to include a provision that establishes a goal of eliminating the
higher price that seniors pay for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' measure is expected to specify using so-called
pharmacy benefit managers to seek discounts from both drug
companies and pharmacies, as Clinton proposed last winter.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Allen said Democrats have been ''able to reach
agreement on the structure of the benefit proposal. That doesn't
mean we are dropping the discount approach. We will continue to
advocate that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, ''This is an important step for
(Democrats) to be able to get cohesion'' on the prescription drug
bill.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer group attacked the decision to jettison the price
mandate in advance. ''They have completely ignored the best
cost-containment bill in their program,'' contended Frank Clemente,
a spokesman for Public Citizen Congress Watch. He said Democrats
''buckled'' to the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recommended a Medicare drug benefit in his State of the
Union address last winter, and House Republicans responded last
month with an alternative of their own.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, sketched thus far only in outline, would
establish a program of voluntary private health insurance, freeing
companies for the first time to sell policies that provide benefits
only for prescription drug costs. Like the Democrats, Republicans
envisions government subsidies for lower-income older people as
well as those with unusually high prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pledged at the time to
''work with the president to modernize our Medicare system with a
commonsense prescription drug plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry reacted coolly. Insurers are on record as
doubting the economic feasibility of stand-alone drug insurance,
and Democrats instantly attacked the GOP effort.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, leading a bid to win control of the House next fall,
noted the Republicans waited ''until the middle of an election
year'' to launch their effort. ''This is a sham proposal that was
designed to comfort the health-insurance special interests instead
of providing real relief for health care consumers,'' he said at
the time.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Drafts New Medicaid Plan  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some states could lose millions in Medicaid
payments for nursing homes under a government proposal aimed at
ending accounting gimmicks that help states increase their share of
federal matching funds without raising their own contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration, which administers
Medicaid, has proposed altering regulations that help determine how
much federal Medicaid money nursing homes receive. The change would
dramatically reduce federal matching funds in many states that have
come to rely on the money to shore up struggling county-run nursing
facilities, state officials say. Wisconsin, for instance, says it
could lose between $60 million and $104 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''The solution they have come up with would hurt many states,''
said Joy Johnson Wilson, a lawyer with the National Conference of
State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA says changes are necessary to curtail what it says are
questionable accounting practices that enable states to boost their
federal matching dollars while not spending more of their own
money.
</P>
<P>
   Used by several states and under consideration in a few more,
the practices -- all legal -- involve transferring state funds,
borrowed money or property taxes into state coffers to qualify for
more matching funds. Some states are then siphoning off a portion
of the federal funds to use for non-Medicaid programs, HCFA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The practice drives up the cost of Medicaid, the federal-state
program that provides health benefits to low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It also means that taxpayers are forced to shoulder more than
their share of federal payments to a few states,'' said Chris
Peacock, HCFA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said HCFA is still deciding what changes will be made in
matching fund formulas, but added that the agency ''will take steps
to ensure that federal Medicaid matching funds are used only for
appropriate Medicaid health services.''
</P>
<P>
   HCFA's inspector general, which investigates waste, fraud and
abuse, is examining how states are using the Medicaid funds,
Peacock said.
</P>
<P>
   State Medicaid officials say they have been using the so-called
intergovernmental transfers for years without a peep from HCFA and
contend that the new proposal could lead to service cuts or nursing
homes not being able to afford to take new Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wisconsin would suffer a devastating blow to our ability to
maintain the level of services that we have come to cherish,'' Joe
Leean, secretary of Wisconsin's Department of Health and Family
Services, said in a letter sent Monday to state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin utilizes property taxes in qualifying for Medicaid
matching funds. All the federal funds are used for nursing home
payments.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the draft proposal, obtained by The Associated
Press, would change the formula for determining the maximum amount
of federal money nursing homes could receive.
</P>
<P>
   Intergovernmental transfers vary from state to state. Michigan
routes $300 million in state funds through county-run nursing homes
to increase its matching funds, which are then used for health
services for the poor. Louisiana plans to have county-run nursing
homes borrow money -- say $10 million -- from banks and hand the
funds over to the state, which will use the money to boost what it
can qualify for in federal matching funds. The loans are paid back
out of the federal funds and nursing homes get the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Some states keep a portion of the money in their general fund
for other programs. Kansas has proposed using 25 percent of an
estimated $100 million in federal matching funds for programs
unrelated to Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer programs have been in use for several years and
states have come to rely on the extra matching funds. Wilson said
the HCFA became concerned only recently as some states have gotten
more creative with their transfer programs and bolder about using
the matching funds for programs other than Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid cost an estimated $181 billion last year. The federal
government's share was $103 million. Federal and state Medicaid
spending on nursing home care totaled $40 billion in 1998, the last
year figures were available.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Propose Nursing Home Bill  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Returning to the state that delivered his
first presidential victory, Republican George W. Bush was
continuing his move onto traditionally Democratic turf by proposing
tax incentives to buy insurance for nursing home care and financial
relief for people who care for a parent or elderly person at home.
</P>
<P>
   The two ideas, being unveiled today, were fueled by statistics
showing that half of older women and one-third of older men are
likely to need nursing home care. A cost estimate was not provided.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today a person goes into a nursing home and a lifetime of
savings can be gone in an instant,'' Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes
said Tuesday, offering the general outlines of the presumptive GOP
presidential nominee's speech at the Ridgecrest Village Senior
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush wants to encourage people to prepare for that by
buying insurance,'' she added. ''He will also recognize the
financial burden on those who provide care at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost five months after winning the Iowa caucuses, Bush's
speech marked the beginning of a series of addresses on improving
families' financial security, part of a plan by the Texas governor
to undercut traditionally Democratic themes like social welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Since besting Arizona Sen. John McCain for the nomination in
mid-March, Bush has offered an array of proposals for improving
schools, protecting teachers, encouraging savings by low-income
families and making housing more affordable for them. Some of the
proposals have been accompanied by significant new spending. For
others, Bush has relied on tax incentives and other lures so that
individuals or private industry -- not the government -- achieve his
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential rival Al Gore, meanwhile, supports the
Clinton-Gore administration's proposal to give a $1,000 tax credit
to some 2 million families caring for ill or disabled relatives,
and to expand Medicaid to cover in-home and community-based long
term care services that would help keep people out of expensive
nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech today was to be a follow-up to the most widely
anticipated component of his family security package: plans for
reforming Social Security. The main component would allow younger
workers to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes
as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   He was to have given that speech on Monday, but postponed it to
attend the funeral of New York's Cardinal John O'Connor. It has
been rescheduled for May 15 in Los Angeles. Two days later in
Seattle, Bush plans a major address on trade.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush began with a 90-minute summit in Pittsburgh
with McCain, where the Arizona senator endorsed his former
presidential opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later said he hoped McCain would campaign for Republicans
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are two really good roles for John. One is to
campaign with me, and I'd appreciate that. But the other role is
for John to campaign for members of the United States Congress,''
Bush said on CNN's ''Larry King Live.'' ''I think it's important to
have a Congress ... with which I can work. And I think John's
willing to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   From Pittsburgh, Bush headed for an education discussion at High
Point Elementary School in Atlanta. One of the most diverse schools
in the Fulton County system, more than 30 percent of its students
are served by English-as-a-second-language programs.
</P>
<P>
   He participated in a round-table discussion with the principal
and several teachers next to a campaign banner that said: ''No
child left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hailing the school, Bush said: ''It's important for America to
hear that the best school reforms bubble from the bottom up.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he attended a private reception with guests who have
raised or pledged to raise $100,000 for the Republican National
Committee or the Georgia Republican Party. In Pittsburgh on Monday,
Bush helped raise $800,000 to $1 million on behalf of the national
and state parties.
</P>
<P>
   He was returning home to Texas after visiting Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends China Trade Deal  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore, who's been something of a stealth
supporter of the proposed trade deal with China, has finally flown
a few sorties visible on everyone's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   With a tough House vote on the deal two weeks away, the
Democratic presidential candidate on Tuesday gave his most robust
defense yet of the deal to give China normal trading status on a
permanent basis, despite the fierce opposition of unions,
environmentalists and human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is right for American jobs,'' the vice president declared
as President Clinton, two former presidents and a bipartisan group
of dignitaries looked on at the White House. ''It is right for the
cause of reform in China and I believe it will move us closer to
the strong and stable world community that we all seek to create.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, questions remain about whether his heart is in the
effort, and whether a Gore administration would do much to expand
free trade. ''I don't think he's motivated on this,'' says Gary
Hufbauer, an economist who backs lowered trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Republican rival George W. Bush agree at least
theoretically that free trade deals have been good for America and
that more should be negotiated. Their main opponents in the
primaries, Bill Bradley and John McCain, felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   So has a seamless succession of presidents, as the notion of a
North American Free Trade Agreement promoted by Ronald Reagan was
handed off to Bush's father to build and then, across party lines,
to Clinton to complete. Former presidents Ford and Carter joined
Clinton and Gore at the White House on Tuesday to add their weight
to the fight for congressional approval of the China deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential campaign, third-party candidates Pat
Buchanan of the Reform Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party
have been lone voices against the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement before Congress would end the congressional review
now required to renew China's trading status from year to year.
Congress must grant China permanent normal trade relations in order
for U.S. exporters to receive the market-opening benefits China is
offering to get into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, exhorting Americans to choose ''between the politics of
fear and the politics of hope,'' Gore took on Reform Party founder
Ross Perot and his charts in a debate performance judged so
effective that hopes for NAFTA's passage instantly soared and the
Mexican stock market hit record highs the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But on China, with an eye on constituencies important to him in
the presidential election, Gore has been practicing the politics of
caution.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting congressional Democrats just as a divided Congress was
preparing to take up the China agreement, he avoided discord by
avoiding the subject.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's called members of Congress to urge them to support
the deal but his campaign staff repeatedly has declined to identify
them or say how many he's contacted. A meeting with labor leaders
earlier this year raised questions about his commitment to the
agreement; he said later he was fully behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's trying to have it both ways,'' said Hufbauer, of the
Institute for International Economics. ''I see him as a very
low-energy pusher of this agenda. I think his compass is pointed
momentarily for the benefit of White House harmony on the issue,
and his real instincts are elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks at the White House followed similar comments, in
response to questions, a day earlier at an Associated Press meeting
of newspaper publishers and editors. As well, he denounced trade
protectionism in a recent foreign policy speech that summoned some
of the free-trade passions of his past.
</P>
<P>
   His most common refrain, however, has been that he supports
''free and fair trade,'' a combination that offends no one because
it depends entirely on how ''fair'' is defined.
</P>
<P>
   The unions mounting a massive campaign to defeat the coming
House vote define fair to mean, in part, the maintenance of stiff
anti-dumping laws to keep underpriced imports from killing U.S.
manufacturing jobs. Critics also want U.S. trading partners
subjected to labor, environmental and human rights safeguards
missing in liberalized trade agreements worked out by the Clinton
administration so far.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Dave Obey of Wisconsin, an opponent of the China
deal, accused organized labor of employing a ''strategic double
standard'' -- going easy on Gore while running ads attacking the
Democratic members of Congress who agree with the vice president on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's disappointing that while refraining from criticizing the
general, they are too willing to beat up on the infantry,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Shakes Up 2004 Olympic Panel  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The woman who led Greece's winning bid for
the 2004 Olympics is being asked to reorganize the troubled
organizing committee after it was criticized for delays and
stagnant bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The move to bring back Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki was the
first bold step by Greek officials trying to restore international
confidence in Athens' ability to stage a successful modern games.
She is the first woman to head an Olympic organizing team.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio
Samaranch, who last month slammed Athens for falling behind in
planning, called the appointment ''a turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The IOC is very, very pleased,'' Samaranch told The Associated
Press from Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's pointman for Athens' preparations was equally positive
over the decision to bring back the 44-year-old lawyer to replace
central banker Panagiotis Thomopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very glad,'' Jacques Rogge, the head of the IOC panel
overseeing the Athens Olympics, told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's an intelligent, energetic woman, and I'm quite sure she
will give the Athens organizing committee the momentum and dynamism
that is needed,'' said Rogge, who is in Athens for an inspection
visit later this week with other IOC envoys.
</P>
<P>
   Her public relations savvy and determination was considered
instrumental in Athens' successful bid after the bitter 1996 loss
to Atlanta. For the 2004 games, Athens faced strong competition
from Rome and Cape Town. Athens played host to the first modern
Olympiad in 1896.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has always been a big supporter of
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki. In 1997, Samaranch expressed hope that she
would lead the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now she is the president -- finally,'' Samaranch said. ''She is
the right person for me. She is a great leader. She always has the
right people around her. She did a wonderful job during the Athens
bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Samaranch blasted Athens for organizational problems
and delays that he said could jeopardize the games. He urged
''drastic action'' to rectify problems in accommodation, traffic,
security, communications, construction, venues and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Thomopoulos offered his resignation after Greece's April 9
parliamentary elections, saying he was unable to devote his time to
the Olympics due to his role as deputy governor of the Bank of
Greece. It was widely rumored that the government would turn to
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, wife of a multimillionaire Greek
industrialist.
</P>
<P>
   Angelopoulos-Daskalaki reportedly turned down a post on the
committee after Athens was awarded the games in 1997 because the
government would not guarantee her wide autonomy to build her own
organizational team. Since then, she has been serving as the
country's ambassador-at-large reporting directly to the premier and
the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   While maintaining a distance from all preparations after 1997,
she broke a long silence last month in an interview with a Greek
television station, offering to help organizers put preparations
back on track.
</P>
<P>
   She is the third person to be appointed to lead preparations for
the games since early 1998. The first committee leader, Stratis
Stratigis, stepped down in July 1999 after an uneasy 18-month
tenure.

<HEADLINE> Francis, Brand Sharing Rookie Honor  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- After going 1-2 in the NBA draft, Elton Brand and
Steve Francis are both on top.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, the No. 1 pick, and Francis, the No. 2 choice, will share
the NBA's Rookie of the Year Award, a league source confirmed
Tuesday. The award will be announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be the first pair to share the award since Jason Kidd
and Grant Hill in 1994-95, and just the third ever. Dave Cowens and
Geoff Petrie split it in 1970-71.
</P>
<P>
   Brand led all rookies in scoring (20.1 points), rebounds (10),
blocked shots (1.63), minutes (37) and double-doubles (42). The
Chicago Bulls forward also led the entire NBA with 4.3 offensive
rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   He joined David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning and
Tim Duncan as the only rookies to average 20 points and 10 rebounds
in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, traded to the Houston Rockets after originally being
drafted by the Vancouver Grizzlies, was the rookie leader in steals
(6.6 per game). He finished second to Brand with 18 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   He was fifth in scoring among all point guards in the NBA, and
just the seventh rookie to average at least 15 points, five assists
and five rebounds, joining Oscar Robertson, Alvan Adams, Magic
Johnson, Michael Jordan, Penny Hardaway and Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle, Chicago Tribune and CNN/SI also reported
Brand and Francis would share the award.

<HEADLINE> Preparation for Hurricane Season  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like a football team that had a couple rough
games the year before, the nation's weather forecasters are facing
the upcoming hurricane season with a new quarterback, new equipment
and an improving record.
</P>
<P>
   If the nation's top long-range hurricane forecaster is right,
they'll get plenty of chances to test their mettle.
</P>
<P>
   The official hurricane season gets under way June 1 and leaders
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the
Federal Emergency Management Agency were holding a briefing today
to discuss the outlook and potential impacts on the country.
</P>
<P>
   That session was to include the man likely to become a familiar
fixture on Americans television screens when storms threaten, Max
Mayfield, the new director of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, who was named last week to replace Jerry Jarrell, will
have a new eye in the sky to help him quarterback the forecast
team.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a new weather satellite was launched that can be
pressed into service this summer if needed. The $220 million GOES-L
satellite had been delayed a year.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters rely on two Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites to monitor tropical storms and other
severe weather. The East Coast's GOES-8, however, is a year beyond
its design lifetime. Although still working, it could break down at
any moment. GOES-L is a crucial backup.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gray of Colorado State University, one of the few willing
to make long-range storm predictions, says the increased storm
activity over the last five years should continue, perhaps for the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, Gray has predicted 11 named storms, including seven
hurricanes, three of them major, meaning they have sustained winds
of 110 miles per hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gray predicted 14 named storms and said he expected
nine of them to become hurricanes and four of to be classified as
major. Her was close: There were 12 named storms, eight became
hurricanes and five ranked as major.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has been studying hurricane patterns in history and says
the trend of more and fewer storms is cyclical and not related to
pollution or global warming.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference between now and the busy storm period in the
early part of this century, Gray observed, is that many more people
now live in harm's way. According to Census figures, the population
in Gulf and Atlantic coast states from Texas to Virginia rose from
a little more than 24 million in 1930 to about 64 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three decades forecasters have gotten better at
predicting where the storms will go, researchers Colin McAdie and
Miles Lawrence report in the May issue of the Bulletin of the
American Meteorological Society.
</P>
<P>
   They found that from 1970 to 1998 track forecast errors
decreased by about 1 percent per year for the 24-hour forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a yearly basis, it's a small improvement, but one that
yields a cumulative benefit,'' said McAdie, a research
meteorologist at NOAA's Tropical Prediction Center in Miami. ''The
24 hour forecast error expected 30 years ago of about 140 miles has
been reduced to about 100 miles today.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters and emergency managers hope to avoid a repeat of the
destruction from last year's Hurricane Floyd, which inundated North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The storm wavered along the coast, seeming to tease forecasters,
leading to the evacuation of thousands in Florida, Georgia and the
Carolinas along roads that became jammed with traffic.
</P>
<P>
   When Floyd finally came ashore it lingered, pouring out
record-setting rains that resulted in more than 50 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials and local agencies were unprepared for many of
the problems, the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said two-thirds of the deaths were drownings, mostly
from cars swept away by the floodwaters. Others died in car
crashes, heart attacks and fires. Seven people died in capsized
boats and five rescue workers lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When comparing the weeks after the hurricane to the same period
the previous year, the CDC found that hypothermia, carbon monoxide
poisonings, dog bites, violent crimes, diarrhea and asthma cases
were all up significantly.

<HEADLINE> U. S. Playing Hockey Russian Style  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Even if the star-studded host team
made its earliest exit from the World Hockey Championships,
Russia's hockey style still survives in every team left in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, while the Finnish, Swedish, Latvian teams have always
reflected the influence of the Russian or Soviet hockey culture,
this year's American team integrates it even more visibly.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, a team half stocked with NHL workmen and the
rest scavenged from European pro, minor and college leagues, has
been a surprise from the start with its organized, disciplined play
and controlled passing game.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Americans have looked more Russian than the
Russians did.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lou Vairo has combined NHL-like intensity with the Russian
style of skating, passing and reading the game.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on a blend of youth and experience, the underdog
Americans generated an unusual sort of chemistry, which has
resulted in an unbeaten record (3-0-2) and an unexpected place in
the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts, billed as the ''Dream Team'' of the tournament and
stacked with 14 NHL stars -- including the NHL's leading goal
scorer, Pavel Bure, and Alexei Yashin -- were simply unable to get
off the ground. The Russians absorbed four defeats and just one
victory over a weak France before finally beating Sweden 4-2 in
their final appearance at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the time-tested qualities of Russian hockey such as
spirit, excellent strategy and team chemistry, the host team was
derided following it 3-0 defeat to the United States and 3-2 loss
to lightweight Switzerland in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were further scorned following their 3-2 loss to
tiny Latvia and their subsequent elimination from medal contention,
before sinking even further with their 1-0 fall to Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Vairo is familiar with Russian hockey through his close
friendship with the late coaching great Anatoli Tarasov, who guided
the Soviet team for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tarasov's leadership, the Soviet national team won gold at
every world championship from 1962-71. His teams also won the 1964,
1968 and 1972 Olympics. More than 30 hockey players from different
Tarasov teams have won Olympic and world gold medals
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Tarasov) felt players should be specialists, individually
outstanding at their specific job. That goes for forwards,
defensemen and goalies,'' said Vairo. ''He talked about raising
their level, making the game more fascinating by using individual
abilities to be creative, because you could only skate so fast and
shoot so hard. There are physical limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believed there were other countries gaining on Russia
especially the Czechs, and he believed Sweden was real close,''
Vairo added. ''Tarasov thought the U.S. could be a world power in
hockey with our facilities and population if we could get more of
our top athletes to play the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Vairo said the United States had a long way to go to even come
close reaching the level of Russian hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hockey is recreational, by and large,'' explained Vairo,
who worked behind the U.S. bench at the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo.
''We're at a huge disadvantage internationally compared to the
Europeans, who have a club system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young players come, try out, get selected and the kids that
don't get selected have to find someplace to play,'' he said.
''Kids start at seven, eight, nine years old, whereas in the United
States you pay to play hockey and many start too old.''

<HEADLINE> Back to the golf course for losing plaintiff  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nancy Saunders was back on the links, giving her
all for the Westchester Country Club's women's golf team, just
hours after losing her 11-year battle to prove illegal sex
discrimination at the swanky private club.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if golfing helped ease the disappointment, she said, ''I
wouldn't read too much into it. Golfing is what I would be doing
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief administrative law judge at the state Human Rights
Division, James T. King, agreed Tuesday that Saunders had been
discriminated against ''solely because of her gender.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said she had to sue within a year after becoming aware of
it -- by 1986 at the latest. Saunders sued in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also found that state human rights laws did not apply
to the club before 1994 because it was ''distinctly private.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saunders' lawyer is crying foul because the judge who issued
the decision is not the judge who heard the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something's wrong here,'' said attorney Susan Slavin.
''Where's the judge who tried the case? This is an absolutely
devastating decision, it is a tragedy, and it bears no resemblance
to what took place at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decision -- actually a recommendation to state Human
Rights Commissioner Jerome Blue -- King said Saunders should have
filed her suit within a year of joining the club or within a year
of when the club allegedly terminated her membership in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that although the club is the host for the PGA
Tour's Buick Classic, it is not ''a place of public accommodation''
that would have been subject to the human rights law before 1994,
the period covered by the suit.
</P>
<P>
   King also ruled that Saunders' claim of retaliation by the club
against her husband was not proven.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders' lawyer said she would object to the recommendations
within the 21 days provided and would appeal the case if the
commissioner accepted them.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision was not rendered by a judge who sat and observed
the demeanor of the witnesses and the credibility of the
witnesses,'' she said. ''You can't tell from a cold record whether
somebody is truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge who conducted the hearings last fall, Denise
Washington, was dismissed in January. She said it was because she
testified in federal court that the Human Rights Division needed 25
to 30 more judges to cut into a six-year backlog of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Ellison, spokeswoman for the division, said it is
''within our authority and jurisdiction'' to assign a new judge to
a case.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, 50, testified at the hearings that from the time she
joined the club in Harrison in 1982, she was barred, as a woman,
from the club's prestigious West Course for long stretches of time
each Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. She also could not get
into the Men's Grill, which she said cost her business
opportunities. And when she married a fellow member, she claimed,
the club ended her membership on the ground that the husband is
always the member.
</P>
<P>
   The club now charges $45,000 for initiation fees and $5,500 a
year for dues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed because I still believe in this, and I know
what happened,'' said Saunders, who lives in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Miller, president of the club, said the club ''does not
discriminate against people by gender, race, religion or in any
other manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real vindication,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Doing His Job For Pacers  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark Jackson, never recognized as a
tenacious defender in a 13-year NBA career, is answering the
skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is being asked to guard Allen Iverson, the league's
second-leading scorer this season, in the Eastern Conference
semifinals. Jackson's defense, in addition to his often uncanny
passing ability, are big reasons the Indiana Pacers were heading
into tonight's game at Philadelphia with a 2-0 advantage in the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an underrated defensive player,'' teammate Jalen Rose
said. ''Nobody talks about Mark being a great defender. He'll tell
you that he's not, but he's doing what we need him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson has scored 56 points in the two games, but he's taken 45
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to work. People are going to say a bunch of
things. I don't pay attention to that. I have a heart just as big
as anyone else and I try to fill it with a will to win,'' said
Jackson, who has scored only seven points and is 3-for-17 from the
field in the two games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with 24 assists and three turnovers in two games, he's
been valuable to Indiana offensively as the Pacers head into
tonight's game two victories short of making their fifth trip to
the conference finals in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, I don't worry about my points. We've got plenty of
guys who can score. Me getting them the ball for an open shot is
what being a point guard is all about,'' Jackson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I get points, that's a bonus. That has been lost in this
day and time. My job is to distribute the ball and be an extension
of the coach on the court, control the tempo, and I feel
comfortable with what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have jumped off to big leads in both games to get
into position to sweep the 76ers for a second consecutive year in
the conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had six assists in the opening quarter of Game 1, when
Indiana shot 67 percent in the period to take 34-15 lead. In the
first quarter of Monday night's Game 2, Jackson had eight assists
as Indiana shot 68 percent in the period and took a lead it never
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Travis Best, who share the point guard role, have
combined for 31 assists with only four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our second unit is more of a transition, running up and down,
and that's Travis' game,'' Reggie Miller said. ''The first unit,
since we're a little bit older, our execution is probably our top
priority, and that's where Mark is more efficient. It's a good
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana has won three straight playoff games, including a 96-95
squeaker against Milwaukee in Game 5 of the first round. In those
three games, Jackson has 32 assists and just three turnovers. Best
had 13 assists, four steals and only one turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's doing his job. That's what he's known for, running the
team, especially in the half-court offense. He's done a great job
as far as assists to turnovers,'' Austin Croshere said of Jackson.
''In the post, he looks to himself as a decoy to get a double-team
going and then he swings the ball to find guys for open shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose has been a major beneficiary of Jackson's precision passes,
scoring 70 points in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark is doing a great job of distributing the ball,'' Rose
said.

<HEADLINE> Shaq Thanks All MVP Voters  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Glen Rice believed Lakers teammate Shaquille
O'Neal was a shoo-in to become the first unanimous winner of
balloting for the MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 121 voters, Fred Hickman of CNN/SI, didn't agree,
instead picking Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was offended.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, it matters to us,'' he said of the lone vote not cast
for O'Neal. ''To us, it was no contest. I don't know where that one
vote slipped away. We felt all along Shaq would be the MVP. It was
just a matter of making it official. All along, it was a runaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers owner Jerry Buss tried to be diplomatic, but it was
obvious he wasn't pleased that O'Neal didn't get all the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a free country and everybody should vote their
conscience,'' Buss said. He then repeated and emphasized the
phrase, ''Vote their conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers vice president Jerry West noted that the vote was the
most one-sided ever, smiled and added, ''God, I feel sorry for the
guy who didn't vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Lakers, including O'Neal, seemed more amused than
angry over the one missed vote. O'Neal thanked all the voters, even
the one who cast his ballot for Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you, too. I appreciate it,'' O'Neal said with what
appeared to be a genuine smile.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers forward Robert Horry joked: ''I heard some guy at CNN
didn't vote for him. Did he ever play? If he played he probably was
a guard. Anyway, that's the great thing about this country, people
can have different opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ron Harper didn't think it mattered that O'Neal wasn't an
unanimous choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who cares? MVP is MVP,'' Harper said. ''Shaq won huge. I think
some guy is always going to vote for his guy. It's OK just so long
as Shaq gets what he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ''And he deserves the MVP. I think I know; I played with one
(Michael Jordan at Chicago) for a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, the Bulls' coach while Jordan was winning the MVP
award four times in the 1990s, said O'Neal's selection was ''no
surprise to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Those things (the one missed vote) happen. There's always
going to be a dissenter out there even in a landslide, and we
consider this a landslide,'' the Lakers' coach said.
</P>
<P>
   One avid Lakers fan wasn't a bit offended by the vote for
Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   John Lazerus, wearing a gold Los Angeles jersey with O'Neal's
No. 34, spent more than two hours hanging over the wall next to the
players' parking lot at their El Segundo practice facility, waiting
to wave to O'Neal and shout congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ''He deserves it,'' said Lazerus, a 20-year-old college student.
''But I think Iverson should get some votes, because he led the
76ers to the second round now, and I really don't think they would
be where they are without him. I believe the Lakers would still be
in the second round even if they didn't have Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickman explained his decision in much the same way, saying:
''You take Shaq away from the Lakers and you've still got a great
team. You take Iverson away from the 76ers and they are the
Clippers, the Hawks. They are no longer contenders.''

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies GM Jackson Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Stu Jackson, the first person
hired by the Vancouver Grizzlies in 1994, is leaving the team to
become vice president of basketball operations for the NBA in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's resignation as president and general manager came a
day before new owner Michael Heisley was expected to announce his
firing and one day after coach Lionel Hollins was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is very bittersweet for me,'' Jackson said. ''I look
back and I feel very good about the five years here. We have
garnered the emotions of our fans for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, also an original member of the organization, was told
of his dismissal by telephone at his Phoenix home by Dick Versace.
</P>
<P>
   Versace, a former NBA coach and broadcaster, is expected to
become president of basketball operations; Billy Knight, the
Indiana Pacers vice-president of basketball operations, the new
general manager; and Tony Barone the director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring a coach could take longer. One of the leading candidates,
Indiana assistant Rick Carlisle, is still involved in the playoffs.
He also could be considered for the Pacers job when Larry Bird
leaves after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's job had been in jeopardy since Heisley purchased the
Grizzlies from Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment for $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   Noted for his sometimes acid tongue when dealing with the media,
Jackson struggled to carve a basketball niche in Vancouver's hockey
market. His ability to attract free agents was hobbled by the view
some hold that Vancouver is a basketball backwater, where the team
loses and the players pay huge Canadian taxes.
</P>
<P>
   During Jackson's tenure, the Grizzlies won less than a third of
the 300 games they played. He also had a 6-33 record as a coach
after firing Brian Winters near the end of the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have liked to have a few more wins at this point,''
Jackson said. ''I don't think there's anybody who doesn't believe
that in the next year or two we would have done better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is credited with drafting small forward Shareef
Abdur-Rahim and point guard Mike Bibby and adding shooting guard
Mike Dickerson in a trade with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He's been criticized for signing underachieving center Bryant
Reeves to a $64 million contract, drafting guard Antonio Daniels
and taking guard Steve Francis in last year's draft even though he
made it clear he didn't want to play in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can go back and identify different events that you would
have done differently,'' Jackson said. ''At the time decisions were
made, we made the best decisions that were available. To go back
and second-guess I don't think is necessarily fruitful.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim said during the season he would seek a trade if
Hollins and Jackson were replaced.

<HEADLINE> Cincy Sentimental Over porcine Past  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NOLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Fiberglass pigs? Plush, squeezable toy pigs?
Winged pig T-shirts?
</P>
<P>
   The city that once shunned its Porkopolis nickname and
hog-butchering past is turning sentimental about its porcine past.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of artist-designed fiberglass pigs hit the streets this
month, in time for the second annual Flying Pig Marathon this
Sunday. Companies rushed to sponsor the sidewalk porkers after last
year's race produced $150,000 in sales of T-shirts and other items.
</P>
<P>
   In all, residents can look forward to 360 fiberglass pigs on the
streets, in parks and in building lobbies during the Big Pig Gig
art project that runs into October. The pigs will later be
auctioned to raise money for arts groups.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from a 1998 public art project in Zurich,
Switzerland, which featured more than 800 decorated fiberglass
cows. It was mimicked in Chicago last year with ''Cows on Parade,''
which was scheduled to hit New York City on June 15
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   There were squeals of protest in 1988 when artist Andrew
Leicester included 185-pound, 3-foot-tall winged pigs atop 30-foot
columns in a public bicentennial sculpture at Cincinnati's
riverfront. Residents wrote letters to the editor and turned out at
a City Council hearing to discuss whether it would be a permanent
embarrassment to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who got worked up back then now wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're all right. It's not the best sculpture in the world,
but it's not the worst,'' says Marian Benz, another letter writer
who has grown more comfortable with the pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indeed, what was the fuss all about?'' asks Leicester. ''It
was simply looking back at the history of the community and pulling
to the fore facts and information that people had forgotten about.
But, they were central underpinnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Greiwe, the head of the commission that chose Leicester's
design, said it was the only one that incorporated elements of the
city's history. He says he now sees locals walking around the
bicentennial sculpture, telling visitors what it signifies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fun when people internalize their history,'' Greiwe said.
''Art -- especially place-making art like Andrew did there --
accomplishes that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leicester hasn't been back to Cincinnati recently. He noted
wryly that no one invited him to fire the starter pistol last year
for the Flying Pig Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he thinks residents have accepted their history, after
getting past the perceived drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it may just have been one of those periodic seismic
shifts in the life of a society,'' Leicester said. ''They've grown
up a bit. They have a more mature concept of themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks Looking for Head Coach  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PAUL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Launching a search for a coach has become as
common to the Chicago Blackhawks as missing the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks, who have failed to reach the postseason the last
three years, fired Lorne Molleken on Tuesday. The team has had four
coaches over the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked myself, 'Do I have the confidence that Lorne would get
us into the playoffs next year as head coach?''' general manager
Mike Smith said at a United Center news conference. ''That answer
was 'I don't know.' To me, that wasn't decisive enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Molleken wasn't present when the announcement was made and was
not available for comment. Smith said Molleken took the news ''with
a lot of class.''
</P>
<P>
   The former coach denied the opportunity to stay with the team
and speak with his replacement about a job on the new coaching
staff. Interim coach Bob Pulford will return to his senior vice
president role and will not be back behind the bench next season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he has a ''short list'' of candidates. He would not
identify any candidates and said none are involved with teams still
alive in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to have been a head coach,'' Smith said of what
he's looking for in a new coach. ''I also think it's important to
have worked in the NHL and worked with NHL players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks fired Craig Hartsburg after missing the playoffs
in 1998 for the first time since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Graham replaced Hartsburg, but he was fired midway through
the next season. Molleken was named interim coach and earned the
job by leading the Hawks to a 13-6-4 finish.
</P>
<P>
   That finish sparked optimism heading into this season, but hopes
were dashed when the Blackhawks struggled to a 5-14-4 record in
October and November. The sluggish start triggered a shakeup that
saw general manager Bob Murray lose his job on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was replaced by Pulford, who also took over as head
coach, demoting Molleken to associate coach.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, Smith was hired by owner William Wirtz. Pulford
retained the general manager title, but Smith was given the task of
rebuilding the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks improved after the changes but still finished
33-39-10 with 78 points, 11th out of the 13-team Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he wants to hire a new coach within the next two to
four weeks. He did not rule out other changes before next season,
both on the ice and off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coaching is part of it but it's not the only part of it,''
Smith said. ''Things really do in fact need to be operated
differently here.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackhawks vice president Peter J. Wirtz, the owner's son, said
hiring a new coach is entirely in Smith's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike knows what we need, and we're going to back his
decisions.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 13, Giants 6  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When the St. Louis Cardinals put Garrett
Stephenson on the mound, they become even more of an offensive
juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina hit a three-run inside-the-park homer as the
Cardinals scored eight runs in the second inning of a 13-6 win
Tuesday night over the San Francisco Giants, who had their
seven-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Renteria and Ray Lankford added solo homers, J.D. Drew and
Craig Paquette had two-run doubles and Mark McGwire had an RBI
single and scored twice for the Cardinals, who had 15 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson (5-0), who allowed three runs on eight hits in 5 2-3
innings, has enjoyed remarkable run support this season. The
Cardinals have averaged 9.6 runs in his starts, as opposed to six
runs in their other games.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had an RBI single and another run scored on a wild pitch
as the Cardinals took a 2-0 lead in the first. St. Louis broke the
game open in the second, which included two homers and three passed
balls by Giants catcher Bobby Estalella.
</P>
<P>
   Vina's homer, his first of the season, was a liner over the head
of right fielder Armando Rios -- playing in place of the injured
Ellis Burks. The next batter, Renteria, hit his sixth homer of the
year into the left-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals sent 12 batters to the plate in the inning. Drew
had two hits in the frame, including a two-run double, and scored
twice in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Russ Ortiz (2-4) lasted just 1 1-3 innings, the
shortest start of his career, allowing eight runs and seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Jeff Kent hit his ninth homer of the season, a
two-run shot in the fourth. The two RBIs gave him 700 for his
career. Barry Bonds led off the seventh with his 12th homer,
breaking his 0-for-16 drought.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Snow had four hits for the Giants, including an RBI single
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McGwire went 2-for-2 with three walks. ... San Francisco 2B
Kent made an error in the second inning, breaking his streak of 68
games without an error. The streak began last August. ... The major
league record for passed balls in an inning is four. ... The
Cardinals have had back-to-back homers 10 times this season. ...
Ortiz's previous shortest start was 1 2-3 innings on June 23, 1999,
against Milwaukee. ... Burks sat out a day after aggravating his
strained left quadriceps. ... Stephenson has an ERA of 5.32 this
season.

<HEADLINE> Astros 13, Rockies 8  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Everyone called Ken Caminiti's sixth career grand
slam ''an Enron Field'' homer.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti hit a grand slam over the short left-field fence, and
Craig Biggio had a bases-loaded triple Tuesday night, rallying the
Houston Astros to a 13-8 victory over the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's homer wouldn't have made it out of many major league
ballparks, but it still counted, even after traveling the short
distance to the Crawford Corner in left field, where it's 315 feet
down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an Enron Field home run,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ''But it was the right hit at the right time in the right
ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   The slam came off Rockies starter Scott Karl, helping the Astros
to trim a 7-1 Colorado lead to 7-6 in the fifth inning. Biggio put
the Astros ahead with his big triple in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably not out of any other park in baseball, but
it's out of here,'' Karl said. ''I don't think it even gets to the
warning track at Coors. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell, running the bases ahead of Caminiti, ran as hard
as he could because he wasn't sure it was a homer.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was definitely an Enron slam,'' Caminiti said. ''What
impressed me the most is how high it went. It was definitely a big
hit for the situation. I thought it had a chance to get out with
the small porch and the winds blowing out.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been 52 home runs hit out of the Astros' new
ballpark, including four in Tuesday night's game. Todd Helton hit
two for the Rockies and Jeff Cirillo had another.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a hitter's game, but also a pitcher's game,'' Dierker
said. ''It was a case of we kept hitting and they didn't, and our
bullpen did a better job than theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yorkis Perez (2-1) pitched a perfect sixth inning for the win as
the Astros won for just the fourth time in 14 games at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies were leading 7-1 in the fifth inning when one-out
singles by Russ Johnson, Lance Berkman and Roger Cedeno loaded the
bases. Biggio had an RBI groundout and Jeff Bagwell walked to load
the bases again.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti hit a 1-1 pitch from Scott Karl over the left-field
fence for his eighth homer and sixth career grand slam. Caminiti's
1,000th hit with Houston cut the lead to 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio completed the comeback in the sixth. The Astros loaded
the bases off reliever Julian Tavarez (1-2), who hit Tony Eusebio,
and walked Berkman and Cedeno with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Belinda came on to face Biggio, who tripled just out of the
reach of center fielder Tom Goodwin. Richard Hidalgo added an RBI
single to make it 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies coach Marcel Lachemann spoke for manager Buddy Bell,
slowed by a case of flu.
</P>
<P>
   ''We walked nine and hit one and seven of those scored,''
Lachemann said. ''We made a bad pitch to Caminiti for a home run,
but the bases on balls are what killed us.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't have been a grand slam if a couple of guys weren't
on with walks.''
</P>
<P>
   The benches cleared in the ninth after Bagwell and Scott Service
got tangled up at first base, but there was no fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish every time I got run over at home plate, I could jump
up and down by it,'' said Servais, a catcher. ''I was just trying
to get hit in the back by the ball. I think Jeff understands
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies took advantage of early mistakes by Scott Elarton
and a sloppy defensive play to take a 5-0 lead after three innings.
They increased it to 7-1 before the Astros rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo extended his hitting streak to a career-high 15 games
with a two-run homer for the Rockies in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Karl allowed six runs and five hits in 4 2-3 innings. ...
Biggio is within reach of three club records established by first
base coach Jose Cruz. Biggio needs 130 at-bats, 41 hits and 11
total bases to take the records. ... Helton is 16-for-27 with six
homers and 13 RBIs in May.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- With Jamie Moyer and Freddy Garcia on
the Seattle disabled list, Paul Abbott made his first start of the
season for the Mariners against a Texas lineup averaging 11 runs in
four games.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott gave manager Lou Piniella he was looking for, pitching 5
2-3 effective innings in the 13-3 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were hoping to get him through six,'' Piniella said. ''I
thought he pitched very well. He had a really good changeup and a
good fastball. We knew he could start for us, and now he's in the
rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott (1-0) allowed three runs and five hits, with five
strikeouts and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Abby provided a big push for us,'' said Mike Cameron, who got
the Mariners off to a good start with a homer leading off the game.
''They've got guys over there who can drive in a lot of runs. He
kept us in the ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners gave Abbott plenty of support as Alex Rodriguez was
4-for-5 with a three-run homer and four RBIs, and David Bell drove
in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a little different team,'' Rodriguez said. ''We're not
going to hit as many home runs, but we walk more and we're more of
a strategic hitting team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit his ninth homer of the season in the second off
Esteban Loaiza (1-2), putting the Mariners ahead 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been dissatisfied with my performance lately,'' Rodriguez
said. ''I've been dragging a little. So this is something to build
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, Mark McLemore and Carlos Guillen each had three hits for
Seattle, which had 19 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza was pounded for eight runs and nine hits in 2 2-3
innings. His ERA rose to 4.99.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our kids came out swinging the bats,'' Piniella said. ''We
scored early and often. From a hitting standpoint, I like our team.
I'd like to see us be a little more consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cameron's homer, Edgar Martinez added a two-run double to
give the Mariners a 3-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we get off to a good start, that puts the pressure on the
other team,'' Cameron said. ''We were all able to put some
consistent at-bats together.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rodriguez's homer chased Loaiza, Guillen and Cameron hit
run-scoring singles off Matt Perisho for an 8-0 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those nights,'' Loaiza said. ''I tried to keep
the ball low, but a lot of stuff got up. One mistake was a slider
to Rodriguez that stayed in, and he took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell homered off Perisho in the fifth for a 10-0 lead, but David
Segui hit a two-run single in the sixth and Rob Ramsay, who
relieved, walked Mike Lamb with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle added three in the seven on Bell's run-scoring single,
Guillen's RBI double and Rodriguez's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cameron's homer was the fourth of his career leading off a
game. ... Loaiza has allowed a career-high eight runs three times.
... The Rangers won six of their previous eight games. ... In the
last two seasons, Abbott is 8-3 as a spot starter. He is 2-0 with a
2.88 ERA in seven career games against the Rangers. ... Texas
pitchers allowed at least 10 runs for the third time in the last
five games and have an 8.00 ERA over that span.

<P>
   Cleveland's ace retired the first 12 batters he faced Tuesday
night, then gave up six runs in the fifth inning as the Indians
lost to the Minnesota Twins 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chuck had one bad inning,'' Indians catcher Einar Diaz said.
''Before that, he was great. After that, he was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians interim manager Grady Little had no idea why Finley fell
apart in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shocked all of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley gave up six runs on four hits and three walks that
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't explain it and I don't think he can either,'' Diaz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley put in a vigorous workout after the game and didn't talk
afterward, avoiding reporters for one of the few times in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins (1-1), banished to the bullpen this season
because of his inconsistent results as a starter, also ducked
questions, leaving without commenting on his first victory of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins relieved Eric Milton to start the fourth with the Twins
trailing 5-0, and quieted the Indians long enough for Minnesota to
get to Finley (3-2).
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer led off the fifth with his sixth homer, and the Twins
loaded the bases with one out.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a no-hitter going, a perfect game,'' Minnesota
outfielder Matt Lawton said. ''Then, Coomer leads off with that
homer and he started trying to throw harder. He tried to overdo it.
The balls got up in the zone. I got no idea why.''
</P>
<P>
   Denny Hocking drew a walk, Finley's third of the inning, to make
it 5-2, and right fielder Manny Ramirez dropped Cristian Guzman's
shallow fly for an error, scoring another run.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Canizaro's comebacker nearly hit Finley in the head and tied
the game at 5, and Lawton's sacrifice fly to center gave the Twins
a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got a little lucky with that bloop that fell in,'' Twins
manager Tom Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Little said that error was the weirdest thing about the unusual
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't make a lot of errors,'' he said. ''Normally, we play
good defense. But when a pitcher's having trouble throwing strikes,
it seems to happen more often.''
</P>
<P>
   In his other six innings, Finley gave up just one hit, walked
none and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was outstanding to that point and great again after,''
Little said of why he left Finley in the game. ''He's one of our
horses. You've got to give him every opportunity to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians nearly did.
</P>
<P>
   They got consecutive two-out singles off Bob Wells in the
eighth, and Eddie Guardado walked Omar Vizquel, loading the bases.
Hector Carrasco came in and struck out Richie Sexson to preserve
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez doubled leading off the ninth and took third on Jim
Thome's flyout. Travis Fryman grounded to third, and Travis Miller
relieved and got his first career save when pinch-hitter Sandy
Alomar hit a game-ending flyout.
</P>
<P>
   Milton gave up eight hits in three innings, his shortest start
since last Aug. 6, when he lasted just two innings against Kansas
City. Sexson and Ramirez hit consecutive homers off him in the
third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cleveland OF Jolbert Cabrera had a career-high three hits,
all singles. ... Twins C Matthew LeCroy's double in the sixth
snapped an 0-for-11 streak. ... Ramirez's 3-for-4 night extended
his hitting streak to eight games, tying Roberto Alomar for the
Indians' season-high.

<HEADLINE> Fear in Haiti as Elections Approach  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Marcellin Jean is afraid he can't
provide for his family. He's afraid he might be robbed in the unlit
lanes of his slum. And he's afraid that if he votes, he will be
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the more than 4 million Haitians registered to vote
on May 21, Jean knows the elections may be the start of a way out
of poverty and lawlessness. But the fear may keep him home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still not sure whether I'm going to vote,'' the
40-year-old Jean said. ''I don't want to be caught in a rat trap,
with the ballot (as) bait in my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   His fear is not unfounded: In 1987, the army aborted Haiti's
first free elections. Hundreds were killed during campaigning and
some 30 were killed on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Jean's wife, Daniella, remembers. And the intervening years in
this desperately poor, increasingly lawless country have changed
too little. She will ''cast her vote for Jesus'' and not go to the
polls, Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodshed and vandalism have marred the preparations for
elections and halted most campaigning. A dozen people have been
killed in politically related slayings since March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Jean himself did not vote in the last elections, in 1997.
Disgusted with the corruption and ineffectiveness of elected
officials, 95 percent of Haitians stayed away from the polls. The
result was political paralysis, and Haiti has been without a
functioning government for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   International financial institutions are withholding $500
million in aid until a new Parliament is installed. Without it,
economic recovery is impossible. But organizational bumbling,
politics and escalating political violence threaten to postpone the
legislative voting -- already delayed three times -- yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during the 1991-1994 dictatorship when the army and its
henchmen ruled, and killed as many as 4,000, most people are
confused about who exactly is calling the shots now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then we could identify the enemy. Now the bullet can come from
any quarter,'' Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti is in desperate need of effective government. More than
half the work force is jobless or underemployed, and 80 percent of
the people live in poverty. Illiteracy is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Jean, a street-corner real estate agent, earns about $100 a
month, far above the per capita annual income of no more than $500.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's drug dealers who are keeping (housing) prices high,''
Jean said. He refused to elaborate, but officials say Haiti has
become a leading drug transit point between Colombia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   With the depreciation of the currency, the gourde, food prices
have risen sharply. ''We can't keep our heads above water,'' Jean
said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Embassy survey in November reported that one out of two
Haitians say their economic situation had worsened since military
rule, when international economic sanctions were imposed on Haiti.
Seventy percent said they had given ''serious thought'' to leaving
Haiti. Some 1,502 people were interviewed for the survey, which had
a margin of error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Considering our slight progress and the extent of our setbacks
... there's no doubt it will take about 200 years for us to catch
up with developed countries,'' Group Croissance, a consulting firm,
reported in April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Haiti's 5,000-member police force, trained by the
United Nations, has been unable to stem increasing crime.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians offer plenty of reasons for that: Police are
ill-equipped, overworked, lazy or even under political pressure
from former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party. Since
Aristide is running again in a vote expected in December, some
believe that if he wins, he will order a crackdown on crime and
take the credit.
</P>
<P>
   On April 8, after the funeral of prominent journalist Jean
Dominique -- whose slaying remains unsolved -- street activists
claiming to be Aristide partisans burned down the headquarters of
the opposition Space for Concord coalition. Police watched, but did
not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, gunmen shot and killed former health minister and
prominent physician Ary Bordes, 74. And on Sunday night, gunmen
killed Elam Senat, a well-known opposition militant in the town of
Savanette, and his 23-year-old son, Edner.
</P>
<P>
   A priest, the Rev. Lagneau Balot, was killed during a robbery
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''When God is no longer in men's hearts, society turns into a
jungle,'' said Roman Catholic Bishop Monsignor Louis Kebreau.
</P>
<P>
   Provisional electoral council president Leon Manus has warned
that elections may be called off if violence attributed to the
campaign persists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last chances of recovery will be lost,'' he said, ''and
the country will sink into the unknown.''

<HEADLINE> Mets 2, Pirates 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- New York Mets starter Mike Hampton's wrist had
the imprint of a baseball. His knee was bruised from a collision on
the bases. His shoulder was packed in ice to minimize the wear and
tear of throwing 126 pitches in a close game.
</P>
<P>
   And all Hampton could talk about was how comfortable he felt.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (3-4) had his best outing of the season as he held the
Pittsburgh Pirates to six hits in 8 1-3 innings, helping the Mets
to a 2-0 win Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said he discarded all the baggage that dragged him down
in the first month of the season. The left-hander was acquired from
the Houston Astros last winter to be the Mets' No. 1 starter, and
he hadn't looked much like one until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's adjustments you have to make throughout a season and
throughout a career,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   He was reminded of that over the weekend when Hall of Famer Tom
Seaver, a Mets broadcaster and occasional instructor, had a
15-minute talk with Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me that some of the greatest pitchers in the world
have had this,'' Hampton said. ''You have to go out there, focus,
concentrate and relax. That's the biggest thing. There are ups and
downs and for me there was a big down period. You have to shorten
those, go out and make pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's biggest inning was the fifth, when the Pirates got
runners at second and third with nobody out and didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton used a strikeout and two ground balls to escape the jam.
The last grounder was a sharply hit comebacker than caught Hampton
on his wrist. His hand went numb, and he threw to first base on a
bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine said the ball struck hard enough to
leave the imprint of its seams on Hampton's wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hit me flush,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the same inning, Hampton tagged out 240-pound Pirates first
baseman Kevin Young in a rundown after a football-like collision.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why Hampton is one of my favorites,'' Young said.
''He's such a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton got all the offensive support he needed in the third
inning when Edgardo Alfonzo and Derek Bell homered on consecutive
pitches from Kris Benson (2-4).
</P>
<P>
   ''Kris was outstanding,'' Pirates manager Gene Lamont said.
''The stuff he had was good enough to win most games. He just
happened to run into a guy who pitched an outstanding game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton knows now his challenge is to build on Tuesday's start
and become the kind of solid pitcher the Mets thought he'd be when
they traded for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt good, and I like the feeling,'' Hampton said. ''I want
to do what it takes to continue this. Just go out there and
execute.''

<HEADLINE> Reds 2, Padres 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- There are signs that the Cincinnati Reds'
pitching staff is finally settling down. If only their hitters
would start waking up.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. was 0-for-2 and Dante Bichette grounded into
three double plays, but the Reds scored on a sacrifice fly and an
error to beat the San Diego Padres 2-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds (16-15) moved a game above .500 for the third time this
season as Steve Parris emerged from his rut with six strong
innings. The pitching staff has given up three or fewer runs in
three of four games.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's more comfortable with his pitching staff now,
manager Jack McKeon changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not too comfortable leaving all those guys on base,'' he
said. ''When we get the big guys driving them in, that's when I'll
feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres and Reds each stranded seven runners in scoring
position. Both teams left the bases loaded. The teams went out in
order once apiece.
</P>
<P>
   It was a threat-a-minute right down to the end. Danny Graves got
Al Martin to ground out with the bases loaded for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some opportunities. I mean, we had the right guys up
there,'' manager Bruce Bochy said. ''What can you do? Both teams
had a lot of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were shut out for the first time this season,
extending their losing streak to four games. They struck out 27
times during a three-game weekend sweep in Arizona and were 0-for-7
with runners in scoring position Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (13-19) dropped a season-low six games under .500 with
its 10th loss in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way our season's been going so far,'' said Eric
Owens, who had two of the Padres' eight hits. ''That's the first
time we've been shut out. We all thought we had a chance, and we
did until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''When things are going bad, that's what happens. When things
are going good for you, the ball finds a hole somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres couldn't get a clutch hit against a pitcher who has
been erratic. Parris (2-4) came into the game with a 6.21 ERA, but
allowed only five hits before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Parris drove in the first run when the Padres chose to
intentionally walk Gookie Dawkins and face him with one out and the
bases loaded in the second. Parris hit a fly to medium center and
Eddie Taubensee easily beat Ruben Rivera's throw home.
</P>
<P>
   Parris recoiled in disappointment in the on-deck circle and left
his bat on the field when McKeon decided to pinch-hit Alex Ochoa
with the bases loaded and one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's Jack's job. He's trying to get more runs,'' Parris
said. ''I understand it, but I don't like it. I was throwing the
ball well, and that's really the first time that's happened this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa hit into a forceout at home, but second baseman Bret Boone
let in a run by dropping a throw from shortstop Damian Jackson on
Pokey Reese's grounder. Boone has six errors this season, but
hadn't made one in his last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're trying to keep it to a one-run game,'' Bochy said.
''The guy who dropped the ball is the guy you want to get the ball.
He's one of the best. It happens, but it doesn't happen very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds also wasted plenty of chances against Brian Meadows
(3-3). Bichette grounded into inning-ending double plays in the
first, third and fifth, one shy of the record.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that a Red grounded into three double
plays since Barry Larkin did it July 7, 1993 at Wrigley Field.
Bichette doubled off Donne Wall in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was going for the record there in that last at-bat,''
McKeon said. ''He had a tough night. Everyone has one.''
</P>
<P>
   Meadows gave up two runs -- one earned -- and five hits in 5 2-3
innings. He matched his career-high by walking six, three
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Eight-time NL batting champion Tony Gwynn turned 40
Tuesday. The disabled outfielder didn't accompany the Padres,
staying in California to rehabilitate his left knee. ... Pete Rose
had the most hits after age 40, collecting 691 on his way to a
record 4,256. ... Left fielder Dmitri Young was scratched from the
Reds' lineup a half-hour before the first pitch because of a
stomach virus. He has a career-high 15-game hitting streak. ... The
major league record for grounding into double plays in a game is
four -- by Detroit's Goose Goslin in the AL (1934) and New York's
Joe Torre in the NL (1975).

<HEADLINE> Yankees 4, Devil Rays 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Told by manager Joe Torre that he would start,
Chuck Knoblauch's face lit up.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch eagerly joined his teammates in a pregame jog, joked
with Derek Jeter in the batting cage and playfully slapped the ball
away from Scott Brosius as he bounded around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a lot of energy after not playing for a week,''
Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing for the New York Yankees he saved some of it for
Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the lineup after missing more than a week because of a
sprained left wrist, Knoblauch doubled to set up a bases-loaded
walk to Paul O'Neill in the 10th inning that lifted the Yankees
over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're never amazed around here because things like that keep
happening,'' Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won for the eighth time in nine games. The Devil
Rays have lost three in a row and eight of 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was saying before the game that hopefully I'd get in the box
and it would click. I was glad to get in there and not mess
anything up and keep the winning going,'' he said. ''I was lucky, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius drew a one-out walk from Rick White (0-2) in the 10th
and Knoblauch blooped an opposite-field double that bounced into
the right-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It actually jammed me a little bit, but I put it in the right
spot,'' Knoblauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch originally hurt himself April 23 at Toronto while
swinging a weighted bat, then re-injured his wrist last week at
Cleveland. The leadoff man went 2-for-5 in his return, and was
flawless in six chances at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt all right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After an intentional walk to Derek Jeter, Jim Morris relieved
White. O'Neill walked on four pitches to force home the winning
run.
</P>
<P>
   ''They brought in a lefty to get a lefty out and I didn't do
it,'' Morris said. ''It was my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I wasn't nervous,'' he said. ''I just didn't get it done.
They're very disciplined. They stay in the game until they make
someone else make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed hitters are only 3-for-18 against Morris this
season. The Yankees had scored their previous 13 runs on homers,
and were glad to get a run this way.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have the bases loaded, you have to make him throw
strikes,'' O'Neill said. ''It's a great spot to be in. These are
the at-bats that are fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson (6-0) pitched two perfect innings and tied Toronto's
David Wells and Chicago's James Baldwin for the AL victory lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never expected to be 6-0 this early. It's just because we've
been scoring late and I happened to be in the games,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won despite Jeter going 0-for-4, leaving him hitless
in 12 at-bats. He has gone three straight games without a hit for
the first time since April 1997, when he went four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada led off the seventh with a home run to dead center
field off Esteban Yan, tying it at 3. Posada also doubled, giving
him 12 hits in 17 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer hit a two-run homer in the Yankees fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn hit his 10th homer, a two-run drive in the third
that put the Devil Rays ahead 3-0. He has nine career home runs at
Yankee Stadium, including two for San Diego in Game 1 of the 1998
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Fred McGriff walked in the second and scored on Vinny Castilla's
RBI double off David Cone.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vaughn did not hit his 10th homer last year until May 31.
He was nearly traded from San Diego to the Yankees on July 4, 1997,
for Kenny Rogers and Mariano Duncan. The Yankees voided the deal,
saying Vaughn was injured. ... Vaughn is 16-for-33 with runners in
scoring position. ... The Yankees are 3-0 in extra innings after
going 7-2 last year.

<HEADLINE> FCC Close To Deciding Cable Deal  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Communications regulators soon are expected
to decide on AT&AMP;T's massive cable purchase of MediaOne -- a deal
that makes the phone giant also the nation's top cable TV company.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations are now before the five commissioners at the
Federal Communications Commission on how the merger could be
completed while still complying with federal rules that limit how
many cable households one entity may reach.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC could decide the matter in the very near future, the
agency's chief said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That merger is on the front burner at the FCC,'' said
commission Chairman William Kennard, addressing a cable industry
convention here. ''I think we're really talking about a matter of
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger also must be cleared by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said the commissioners are focused on the proposal and
are adopting final details.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're actively engaged in working out what I believe are the
final issues now,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which also would make AT&AMP;T a leading provider of
high-speed Internet services delivered over cable lines, has
trigged FCC regulations prohibiting a single cable company from
controlling more than 30 percent of the multichannel video market.
</P>
<P>
   That market comprises both cable and its competitors such as
direct broadcast satellite, and AT&AMP;T's deal with MediaOne would
exceed the 30 percent cap.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T and MediaOne deal would create the nation's largest
provider of cable TV company and high-speed cable Internet
services. For that reason, critics have raised flags that the
combined business would gain a stranglehold on the programming that
reaches consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Agency staff has offered steps for how the merger could go
through without violating the limit. For example, AT&AMP;T could sell
MediaOne's 25 percent stake in cable systems owned by Time Warner
Inc. or separate themselves from subsidiaries that sell programming
to Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 percent Time Warner share has drawn fire from consumer
groups for another reason: It would link the proposed AOL-Time
Warner with AT&AMP;T, connecting the nation's top cable providers.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest advocates have argued that AT&AMP;T's merger review
should be consolidated with evaluation of the deal between Time
Warner and AOL to make sure enough distance remains between the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials said Tuesday the commission will rule on that idea
in the context of its AT&AMP;T-MediaOne merger decision.

<HEADLINE> Marines Declare Osprey Aircraft Safe  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One month after the MV-22 Osprey crash that
killed 19 Marines in Arizona, the Marines are ready to resume
flying the hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands like a
helicopter but flies like an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel confident we can put them back in the air,'' Gen. James
L. Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, said in an interview
Tuesday. ''Everything appears to have been working normally'' at
the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said families of the 19 victims, as well as members of
Congress, have been told that investigators have found no evidence
of mechanical, engineering or structural flaws in the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see no problems whatsoever with the aircraft,'' Lt. Gen.
Fred McCorkle, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   An early model Osprey used for experimental flight was expected
to fly from Nova Scotia to Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Md.,
today -- the first Osprey flight since the accident April 8. Two
test-model Ospreys will be used to simulate some of the
circumstances of the fatal accident, in order to validate the
investigators' findings, and later this month the full Osprey fleet
will return to flight, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said investigators have concluded that the crash was
caused by a loss of aerodynamic lift that forced the aircraft into
a fatal nose dive as it was about to land.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are not yet clear, the Osprey -- with a crew of
four plus 15 Marines as passengers -- descended too rapidly toward a
small airport at Marana, Ariz., McCorkle said. It was descending at
more than 1,000 feet per minute, he said, compared to the maximum
recommended rate of 800 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   As the pilot executed an angle bank of between 5 and 15 degrees
right at about 280 feet off the ground at about 8 p.m. local time,
the aircraft encountered an aerodynamic phenomenon known as ''power
settling,'' and four seconds later it nose-dived into the ground.
McCorkle said this condition was similar to an engine stall and
seemed to be related to the excessive rate of descent, a slow
forward airspeed and the banking maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said the ''power settling'' problem was not unique to
the Osprey, and that pilots are trained to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jones and McCorkle said investigators were not yet prepared
to ascribe the accident to pilot error. They said more study was
needed. McCorkle said colleagues of the pilot, Maj. John A. Brow,
of California, Md., have told investigators that Brow was an
exceptionally talented pilot with more than 3,700 hours of flight
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have found no structural or design flaws that would
preclude safe flight operations and we maintain complete faith in
the safety of the V-22,'' McCorkle said. Investigators are still
studying whether the proximity of another Osprey, which landed
about 300 feet ahead of the one that crashed, played a role.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the worst aviation disaster for the Marines since
22 were killed in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of confidence in the aircraft's airworthiness,
Jones said he and Air Force Chief of Staff Michael Ryan plan to be
passengers aboard the first Osprey to return to operational flight.
Although the Osprey is being produced mainly for the Marines, the
Air Force plans to buy some for special operations.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers -- Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron -- are
due to deliver 11 Ospreys to the Marines this year. Eventually the
Marines are to field 360 of them to replace the Corps' Vietnam-era
CH-46 helicopters as the primary means of transporting troops into
combat from ships offshore.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Return Home Looking For a Win  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson realizes the Philadelphia
76ers are in a desperate situation. He knows exactly what the team
must do to change its fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got to do exactly the opposite of what we've been doing,''
Iverson said. ''We wanted to steal one in Indiana. We couldn't do
it. Now we got to take care of our own floor. It's easy to lose
confidence. We can come in and get blown out, but we got too much
pride for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers -- despite the final score -- were blown out twice in
Indiana as the Pacers took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern
Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has been here before, in last year's conference
semifinals, when the 76ers were swept by the Pacers. Game 3 is
tonight in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never expected this in 100 years,'' Iverson said about the
two blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana has built double-digit leads in the first half of both
victories, enabling it to withstand late comebacks. The Sixers
haven't led in either game.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose beat Philadelphia in Game 1 by
scoring 40 points each. Miller had just 19 Monday, but Rose had 30
and Austin Croshere scored a career playoff-high 20, including 16
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere, however, is bothered by an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''They execute well, they have as a good a point guard, Mark
Jackson, as we've seen in the league and they have a lot of
threats,'' Sixers coach Larry Brown said. George Lynch said he's
ultimately responsible for Rose even though the Sixers are supposed
to be rotating on defense and helping him out.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's my first assignment,'' Lynch said. ''I have to limit his
touches and I have to take him out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers will be without point guard Eric Snow for the rest of
the series. Snow reaggravated a chip fracture in his right ankle
and an MRI on Tuesday showed no signs of significant healing.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron McKie will start at point guard and reserve Kevin Ollie
should get more playing time. Iverson, who had 28 points and a
career playoff high 10 assists in Game 2, also will play the point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Allen did a great job both ways,'' Brown said. ''He played as
good a game as I've seen recently. He and Aaron will share the
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   McKie, Ollie and Iverson are all hurting. McKie has a sprained
left thumb and a sore hip that left him limping off the court
Monday. Ollie has a left knee contusion. Iverson has been playing
with a chip fracture in his right ankle, an inflamed right elbow
and a broken left toe.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many more morale boosts do we need?'' McKie said. ''We
need to find it within ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow, the floor leader and a strong defensive presence, missed
the final two games against Charlotte in the first round and the
Sixers won both.
</P>
<P>
   Miller doesn't think the Sixers will miss a beat without him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aaron McKie is much better offensively than Eric Snow,''
Miller said. ''Snow runs the show a little better than Aaron, but
looking at the Charlotte series, Aaron McKie was one of the main
reasons they advanced to the second round. So, by no means are they
ready to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers need more offensive production from their small
forwards if they expect to challenge Indiana in this series. Lynch
and Toni Kukoc combined for 10 points in Game 2 and 12 in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need Toni to play at a high level and we need George to be
a threat, because Rose hasn't had to guard anybody until McKie came
in,'' Brown said. ''We have to make Reggie work. He's had to guard
Eric Snow, who's been hobbled. You let Reggie rest on defense and
concentrate on offense and he's virtually impossible to guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana is wary of playing in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't mean anything,'' Miller said about the 2-0
advantage. ''They're a very dangerous ball club. I kind of feel
they're on the verge of exploding a little bit. They showed a
little bit of evidence to that in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by 26 points, the Sixers outscored Indiana
34-19 in the fourth quarter Monday and held them without a basket
over the final seven minutes.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 11, Dodgers 7  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Damian Miller hit a game-winning grand slam off
Orel Hershiser in the 12th inning, his second home run of the game,
as the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied past the Los Angeles Dodgers
11-7 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth, who homered leading off the game, had put
the Dodgers ahead in the 12th against Vincente Padilla (1-0) with
an RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser (1-2), trying for what would have been his first save
since Game 4 of the 1988 NL championship series, allowed a single
to Jay Bell leading off the 12th and walked Luis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Erubiel Durazo loaded the bases with a single, and Steve
Finley's sacrifice fly to shallow left tied it, with Bell sliding
home ahead of Gary Sheffield's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser hit pinch-hitter Kelly Stinnett with a pitch, loading
the bases for Miller, who hit a drive to left for his third career
slam.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth time since 1990, and the second time this
season, a major league game began and ended with a home run. Jon
Nunnally of the Mets and Jeff Kent of the Giants did it May 3 in
New York's 8-5, 11-inning loss at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield also homered for Los Angeles, which wasted a 6-5
lead when Danny Klassen doubled off Jeff Shaw with one out in the
ninth, advanced on Todd Hundley's passed ball and scored on Andy
Fox's single.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez hit a two-run homer for Arizona, which won its sixth
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Carlos Perez allowed three runs and six hits in
seven innings, while Arizona starter Armando Reynoso was pounded
for six runs and seven hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona right fielder fielder Travis Lee threw out Shawn Green
at the plate to end the fifth inning, and Klassen ended the seventh
when he fielded a hard grounder by Eric Karros with the bases
loaded, stepped on third for the force and threw to first for a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth and Sheffield homered in the first, and the
Dodgers made it 3-0 on Adrian Beltre's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez closed the gap with his 418-foot drive into the right
field bleachers in the bottom half, and Miller's homer tied it in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles went ahead 5-3 in the third on Karros' sacrifice fly
and Hundley's RBI single past a diving Greg Colbrunn at first.
Hundley had another RBI single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley hit a two-run single in the eighth off Terry Adams
cutting the Dodgers lead to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Other games since 1990 that started and ended with homers:
1990, Astros at Reds (Eric Yelding/Barry Larkin); 1991, Athletics
at Red Sox (Rickey Henderson/Jack Clark); 1993, Phillies at Cubs
(Lenny Dykstra/Rick Wilkins); 1995, Pirates at Padres (Al
Martin/Bip Roberts); 1995, A's at Indians (Henderson/Manny
Ramirez); and 1999, White Sox at Orioles (Ray Durham/Harold
Baines). ... Hollandsworth has three of the Dodgers' four leadoff
homers. ... Mark Grudzielanek, who had been hitting .500 in May,
was 0-for-7 in the series until his leadoff double in the fifth
inning. ... Reynoso popped up in his only at-bat, ending a
four-game stretch in which the Diamondbacks starting pitchers were
6-for-10 at the plate with three RBIs. ... Arizona closer Matt
Mantei, on the disabled list because of soreness in his shoulder,
is scheduled to throw in the bullpen Wednesday night and pitch in a
simulated game Friday at San Diego. ... Arizona reliever Byung-Hyun
Kim struck out his first batter, Karros, extending his team-record
strikeout streak to nine before Todd Hundley grounded out.

<HEADLINE> Envoy Heads to Muslim Rebel Camp  </HEADLINE>
By AARON FAVILA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- A Libyan envoy headed into the
Philippine jungle today to talk with Muslim separatists holding 21
Western and Asian hostages and to press for the release of an ill
German woman.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor accompanying him had medicine, oxygen, food, clothing,
and chocolate for the captives. She was also taking stretchers in
case the rebels agreed to free two captives: a German woman who has
suffered two strokes, according to her family, and a French man
with a urinary infection.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are now ready to meet us,'' said Muslim cleric Ibrahim
Ghazali, a member of the negotiating team, after talking with
representatives just back from the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, the former Libyan ambassador to the
Philippines, is on the remote southern island of Jolo hoping to use
his extensive personal contacts with Muslims in the region to help
free the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we can bring down the German woman. She is our priority
because she is sick,'' Ghazali said.
</P>
<P>
   An envoy from the European Union, Javier Solana, was also
upbeat, saying before he left Manila today: ''I do hope very much
that we will see her soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence in the impoverished southern region of Mindanao, where
Muslim guerrillas are fighting to carve an Islamic nation from the
predominantly Christian Philippines, has increased in recent weeks,
leaving scores dead and driving more than 100,000 people from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages -- three Germans, two French, two South Africans,
two Finns, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos -- were
snatched from a diving resort on the Malaysian island of Sipadan on
April 23 and taken to Jolo, an hour's boat ride away.
</P>
<P>
   They are held by the Abu Sayyaf, the smaller and more extreme of
two Muslim rebel groups active here. The Abu Sayyaf are also
holding in nearby Basilan province a separate group of Filipino
hostages seized from schools. After clashes, killings and rescues,
approximately eight people, mostly children, are thought to remain
in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Bombings and clashes between troops and the larger Muslim rebel
group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, have been on the rise
since late last month, when soldiers attacked rebels holding a
highway along the edge of their main camp.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis over the Jolo kidnapping has gained international
attention after video footage taken at the rebel camp was broadcast
around the world, showing terrified, exhausted and ill hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines had insisted that the crisis was a purely
domestic problem and rejected foreign offers of assistance.
Azzarouq, however, has the government's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, the EU's top diplomat, came to Manila on Tuesday to
remind the government that Europe does not want to see any attempts
to rescue the hostages by force.
</P>
<P>
   ''We trust the way that the government is facing the problem,''
he said after meeting President Joseph Estrada on Tuesday. ''The
president gave us a guarantee on the safety of the hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's chief negotiator was not so upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have every right to be concerned,'' negotiator Nur
Misuari said Tuesday of the European governments. ''After the
fighting ... everything is in shambles.''
</P>
<P>
   Misuari was also traveling to Jolo today from the nearby city of
Zamboanga to consult with his envoys to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Four Abu Sayyaf leaders holding the 21 Jolo hostages sent a
letter to Estrada on Saturday rejecting Misuari as negotiator and
demanding talks with the ambassadors from the hostages' countries,
presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, and
representatives of the United Nations, Libya and other Islamic
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have not yet made any concrete demands for the
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have appealed to the military to halt operations in
the area, and negotiators have asked the army to avoid skirmishes
that could endanger those held. The rebels have clashed repeatedly
with soldiers surrounding their camp.
</P>
<P>
   When Associated Press journalists visited the Abu Sayyaf camp on
Saturday, Renate Wallert, 57, appeared haggard and worn. Her
husband and son have begged the rebels to free her.
</P>
<P>
   But an Abu Sayyaf leader, Abu Escobar, told radio station DXRZ
on Tuesday that they would not release her because ''yesterday
there were gunshots and she was able to jump from her hammock and
walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said a jet and helicopter were standing by to whisk
her to a hospital if she is freed.

<HEADLINE> Governor, Wall Street exec announce Nassau financial rescue plan  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- A financial rescue plan for Nassau
County, announced by Gov. George Pataki and Wall Street's Frank
Zarb, won almost immediate bipartisan praise from both county and
state officials who will have to sign off on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a Republican solution or a Democratic solution, it is
a good government solution,'' said Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli,
chairman of the Nassau County Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Pataki, Zarb and Republican state Sen. Dean Skelos at
a press conference Tuesday to announce the plan, which calls for
the creation of an interim authority to refinance part of the
county's long-term debt, as well as $100 million in aid from the
state over five years in a bailout of one of the richest
communities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are trying to do here is to provide a road map out of
the fiscal difficulties and also a helping hand,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb, chairman of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, was appointed by Pataki in March to review the extent of
the county's financial woes, which were created, in part, from
years of increasing expenses as property taxes remained steady.
</P>
<P>
   He determined that with cuts already made, the county faces
about a $117 million shortfall this year. Unless further action is
taken, the deficit would grow to $321 million by 2003, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came to the conclusion that it's all manageable,'' Zarb
said Tuesday. ''And it can be done without people bleeding in the
streets and without being draconian and without doing things that
are really going to destroy the county's ability to grow and
prosper in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   If the county fails to act by June 30, Wall Street credit
agencies have warned they will downgrade the county's rating to
junk status, which would then create the need for a financial
control board.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki-Zarb proposal creates what they call
''control-lite,'' an interim financing board that would be
authorized to refinance part of the county's debt by utilizing
lower financing costs. The savings this year alone could be $40
million to $50 million, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides $100 million in state funding -- $25 million in each of
the first two years -- the plan also requires the county to make $50
million in further spending cuts. Also, Pataki wants to spend $5
million to help the county erase a backlog of cases that challenge
its tax assessment system.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout plan requires the approval of both the state and
county legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in the overall picture we're looking at a very
positive development in the road to fiscal health for Nassau
County,'' said Judy Jacobs, presiding officer of the county
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The financial mess in Nassau County, where the median household
income is $58,155, helped spark a political revolt last November
that saw Democrats oust the Republicans from control of the county
legislature for the first time since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans suffered another embarrassing defeat last week, when
Democrat Craig Johnson won a special election to the Nassau County
Legislature, filling the seat previously held by his mother,
Barbara Johnson, who died of breast cancer earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the seat had been held by a Democrat, the high-profile
election to determine which party would gain a 10-9 majority in the
legislature was seen as yet another GOP setback.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor said Tuesday he would leave it to the
political pundits to muse about his or anyone else's motivation --
even as numerous GOP members of the Nassau state Senate delegation
sat in the front row at the news conference. Each of the senators
is up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   County Executive Thomas Gulotta, a fellow Republican who did not
attend the Pataki press conference, said later Tuesday that the
plan was ''perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It puts the issue behind us once and for all and ensures the
county's future fiscal health and does so without the necessity of
a tax increase,'' Gulotta said.

<HEADLINE> House Bill International Sex Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is moving legislation to help tens of
thousands of foreign women and children escape sexual servitude
while imposing tougher penalties on those who enslave them.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday passed by voice vote and sent to the Senate
legislation that would give sex industry victims a safe haven in
this country rather than expose them to jail sentences or
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than 50,000 human beings, mostly women and children, are
trafficked into the United States each year,'' said Rep. Sam
Gejdenson, D-Conn., a co-sponsor with Rep. Christopher Smith,
R-N.J. ''It is intolerable that at the beginning of the 21st
century, people are still being sold into modern-day slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that worldwide as many as 2 million people, the great
majority women and children, are forced into the sex industry every
year. As an example, he said traffickers in Russia pay orphanages
$12,000 to take a group of children to the local McDonalds, never
to return.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he and Gejdenson recently talked to several women who
had been held as ''virtual slaves'' in the Washington area by
foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is by far one of the worst human rights violations of our
time,'' said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would double to 20 years the maximum penalty for
enticing and selling people into involuntary servitude, and add the
possibility of life imprisonment when violations result in death or
involve kidnapping or sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It makes trafficking victims eligible for the federal Witness
Protection Plan and creates a new visa status for victims who
cooperate with law enforcement. Those entering this program, which
would be capped at 5,000 people a year, would be able to apply for
permanent residence after three years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also directs the State Department in its annual country
reports on human rights to include information on the levels to
which countries combat or tolerate human trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The president would have the authority, beginning in 2002, to
withhold nonhumanitarian aid to countries that fail to meet minimum
standards in eliminating the sex trade. The Clinton administration
opposes the bill based on this provision, but Smith stressed that
the president would also have the discretion to waive this
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 3244.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Medicaid Cancer Plan  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Judy Lewis, getting the bad news that she
had breast cancer didn't cost a thing. Getting the needed
treatment, however, was another story.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old from Lake Ronkonkoma, N.Y., was among about 1
million low-income women who since 1990 have taken advantage of a
law entitling them to free breast cancer screening and diagnosis
from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 30,000 women under the program who have been diagnosed
with cancer or precancerous conditions, however, she discovered
that government help did not extend to paying for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once I was diagnosed I was on my own,'' Lewis said in a
telephone interview from her home. Her husband was out of work
because of a back injury when she took the test in 1998, her
mother-in-law was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and Lewis
accrued medical bills of $22,000 just from three operations she
underwent.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of those in her situation could change with
legislation passed by the House 421-1 Tuesday and sent to the
Senate for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give states the option of providing Medicaid
coverage to low-income women such as Lewis who are diagnosed with
breast or cervical cancer through the CDC early detection program.
The chief sponsor is Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C., who currently is
under treatment for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of poorer women have incomes above the line qualifying
them for Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor, but who
lack the money or insurance to get adequate treatment, said Rep.
Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., a co-sponsor. They are ''forced to face a
Hobson's choice between a flat line or a bread line.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want us to look another woman in the eye and say,
'Yes, you have cancer, but we can't treat you,'' said Rep. Tillie
Fowler, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cruel to diagnose these women with federal dollars and
not give them treatment,'' said Fran Visco, president of the
National Breast Cancer Coalition, which lobbied hard against a move
to reduce money in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the federal government would pay 75
percent of treatment expenses while the states would pay the other
25 percent. The cost to the federal government would be about $280
million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Budgets for 2001 proposed by both President Clinton and the
GOP-led Congress provide money for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also requires the Health and Human Services Department
and the CDC to develop educational materials regarding the sexually
transmitted disease human papillomavirus (HPV) for health care
providers and the public. The Food and Drug Administration is to
develop a condom warning that HPV can cause cervical cancer, and
condoms are ineffective protection against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., a fiscal conservative, cast the one
vote against the bill.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Congress Readies Spending Bills  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pressing their drive to finish Congress' work
early this election-year, Republicans have readied legislation to
finance education, health and labor programs, the biggest and most
contentious of the annual spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Senate and House Appropriations committees planned
votes today on separate versions of the fiscal 2001 measure, which
has a price tag exceeding $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is an annual battleground between President Clinton and
Republicans over issues from the federal role in local schools to
abortion. Impeded by the GOP's slim House and Senate majorities,
the bill is usually among the last of the 13 annual spending bills
to reach Clinton's desk, usually after weeks of confrontation and
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said
Republicans would boost education spending by $2 billion over this
year's levels in the House bill. Republicans want to be seen as
defenders of schools, as education has emerged as a top issue in
this year's presidential and congressional election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of being tied up by Washington bureaucrats, this money
can go directly to teachers in the classroom, where it will do the
most good,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would boost spending on the Head Start preschool
program from $5.3 billion this year to $5.7 billion in 2001, and
the Education Department's budget from $35.6 billion to $37.2
billion, said an aide speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted
overwhelmingly Tuesday to require congressional approval for U.S.
peacekeepers to remain in Kosovo beyond July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-3 vote reflected worry among lawmakers about an
open-ended deployment of American soldiers, who comprise 5,900 of
the 37,000 NATO-led peacekeepers in the breakaway Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as the appropriations panel approved roughly $7.9
billion for this year to keep American troops in Kosovo, help
Colombia's government battle drug traffickers, and assist victims
of last autumn's Hurricane Floyd and other domestic natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Tuesday night in Denver, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright called the efforts by Congress to block money
for Kosovo ''wrongheaded.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The exit strategy for our troops out of Kosovo is to provide
money for stability and the creation of institutions there,''
Albright told the World Trade Center, a business organization.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget chief Jack Lew criticized the committee for
coupling the money in the bill with other items the Clinton
administration opposes. These include provisions to restrict
federal efforts to limit waste produced at hard-rock mines and to
make it harder for the Justice Department to pursue its lawsuit
against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the Kosovo restrictions was unclear. The House
narrowly rejected a similar amendment in March, and the Clinton
administration opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   By voice vote, the appropriations panel adopted an amendment by
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., requiring the president to get
congressional approval to spend any money in Colombia beyond the
funds provided in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers of both parties have warned that the United
States risks getting dragged into a bloody civil war in Colombia,
where the government has been battling drug traffickers aided by
leftist guerrillas and right-wing militias.
</P>
<P>
   Though the appropriations panel offered few specific details,
some Senate aides estimated that the committee had approved about
$1.2 billion for Colombia and about $1.8 billion for U.S. forces in
Kosovo, a bit less than Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   That money -- plus other funds for defense, farmers and other
programs -- was divided among three measures financing agriculture,
military construction and foreign aid programs in fiscal year 2001,
which starts Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Adding momentum to a top farm issue, the Senate panel voted by
voice to add language to the agriculture bill lifting the embargo
on selling food and drugs to Cuba. A similar provision is in the
House version of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 103, Jazz 85  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- By the time the lead reached 33, the
Portland Trail Blazers were laughing and their fans were chanting
''Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.!''
</P>
<P>
   That what they think of the Utah's chances to come back and win
a series that's been overwhelmingly onesided so far.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith scored 19 points to lead six Blazers in double
figures as the Trail Blazers jumped to an early lead and poured it
on in the second half Tuesday night for a 103-85 victory and a 2-0
lead over the listless Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of our defense, we got easy layups and high-percentage
shots, and everything started clicking,'' said Smith, who made six
of eight shots. ''It seemed like the ball just kept rolling in and
going in for us.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Blazers' fans might be presumptuous, everything
they've seen so far gives them reason to believe Portland will
advance to the Western Conference finals for a showdown against the
Los Angeles Lakers, who beat Phoenix by 18 in Game 1 of their
series.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best I've seen a team play since I've been with
Utah, as far as I can remember, for 15 years,'' Utah coach Jerry
Sloan said of the Blazers, who shot 56 percent. ''They just
annihilated us defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is Thursday night at the
Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   While Utah is just 1-14 in the playoffs in Portland, it has
beaten the Blazers 10 of 13 times in Salt Lake City. Still, that
didn't provide any comfort to the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we had a few guys in our locker room who thought we
had a chance,'' Sloan said. ''I'm not sure we have anybody now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, who outscored Utah 29-14 in the fourth quarter of
Sunday's 94-75 victory, allowed just 16 first-quarter points
Tuesday night to squelch any hope of a Jazz comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Anthony scored seven points during a 10-0 run that put the
Blazers ahead 41-22, and the lead kept growing from there. A hook
shot by Jermaine O'Neal, playing his first minutes of the playoffs,
made it 93-63 with 7:37 left in the game. The lead reached 33 on
Bonzi Wells' three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone was held to just 15 points, barely half of his
playoff average this season. Yet, his total actually led the Jazz.
Bryon Russell had 12 points, and the other three Jazz starters
combined for 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to figure out a way to score,'' said Jazz guard Jeff
Hornacek, who scored two points on 0-for-3 shooting. ''It seemed
like it was just helter-skelter out there for us. I don't know. I
have no answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy was wary of the team becoming
overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've done nothing here but hold serve,'' he warned. ''We've
done what we're supposed to do. The pressure was all on us. Now
we've got to go into Utah and try to find a way to win a game
there.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's loss, Utah needed a quick start, and it didn't
come. The Jazz committed two turnovers on their first three
possessions and were outscored 13-6 in the last half of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace hit a long jumper, and Scottie Pippen followed
with a 3-pointer to give the Blazers a 20-12 lead. Wallace hit a
short turnaround jumper, then followed his own miss as Malone
flopped on the floor for a 24-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It only got worse for the Jazz after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' reserves dominated the second period as Anthony and
Detlef Schrempf combined for 19 points, matching the entire Jazz
team's output.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony schooled John Stockton at both ends of the floor during
a key 10-0 run. First, Anthony hit a 17-footer, got fouled by
Stockton and converted the free throw to make it 34-22.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, Stockton was stripped of the ball by
Anthony, who then hit a short running jumper. After the Jazz let
the shot clock run out, Anthony got fouled by Stockton and made
both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf made a 3-pointer to cap the run and extend the lead to
41-22 with 5:08 left. Anthony later hit a 3-pointer, and Smith
finished the Blazers' 32-point quarter with a long jumper for a
56-35 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our bench was big,'' said Pippen, who took just four shots and
scored five points. ''They controlled the game for us. They came in
and played with a lot of intensity and a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz briefly came to life in the third, cutting it to 15 on
a 19-foot jumper by Stockton. But Damon Stoudamire hit a midrange
shot and, after Malone lost the ball, drove for a layup to build
the lead to 66-45.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who had 11 points in the quarter, hit a 3-pointer with
33.8 seconds left to make it a laugher at 80-55.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Utah has led for just three minutes and 28 seconds in the
series, all early in the first quarter. ... The Blazers scored 27
points off 17 Jazz turnovers. Utah got 11 points off 18 Portland
turnovers. ... Wells scored 15 of his 17 points in the garbage-time
fourth. ... Jazz reserve guard Howard Eisley is just 7-for-31 in
Utah's last five playoff games.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Louisiana Gov. Found Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Edwin Edwards, the former four-term
governor who proudly bragged about his ability to beat prosecutors,
has been convicted of extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars
from businessmen applying for riverboat casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who dominated state politics since first becoming
governor in 1972, was found guilty Tuesday along with his son
Stephen on charges of racketeering and fraud. The schemes took
place during and after Edwards left office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that it ended this way, but that is the system,''
Edwards said outside court. ''I have lived 72 years in the system
and I will live the rest of my life in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was convicted of 17 of the 26 counts against him,
including two racketeering charges that each carry 20 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine. He and the four other co-defendants who
were convicted were to return today for a hearing about the assets
they will have to forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has other legal troubles, too. He faces a June trial on
federal charges he helped rig a generous deal in 1996 for the head
of a failed insurance company liquidated by the state.
</P>
<P>
   He also faces charges of trying to illegally record the
conversations of FBI agents who were investigating him in 1997. No
trial date has been set in that case.
</P>
<P>
   While his 35-year-old wife, Candy, silently sobbed, Edwards
appeared calm as the verdicts were read Tuesday. The Chinese have a
saying, he said later: ''If you sit by a river long enough, the
dead bodies of your enemies will float by you.' I suppose the feds
sat by the river long enough and here comes my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not comment on the verdict but left the
courthouse smiling.
</P>
<P>
   It is a high-profile case even in Louisiana, with its wild and
shady history of corruption. In the past 20 years, two insurance
commissioners have been convicted of charges, the current one is
under indictment and at least a half dozen legislators have been
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   By his own count, Edwards has been the subject of almost two
dozen state or federal investigations going back to his days in
Congress in the '60s. In the 1980s he was charged with racketeering
involving health care investments. His 1985 federal trial ended in
a hung jury; he was acquitted in a retrial a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards served two terms as governor in the 1970s but left
office because of a state ban on three in a row. He was elected
again in 1983 and in 1991, after defeating former Ku Klux Klansman
David Duke in a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Edwards, his son, a state senator and four
other men engaged in an elaborate bribery and extortion scheme
involving casino licenses. Two of the defendants were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The trial featured tales of huge sums of cash changing hands,
secretly recorded conversations and the public betrayal of Edwards
by men with whom he once socialized and gambled. The defense
claimed, among other things, that the money was legitimate
consulting payments.
</P>
<P>
   The government's star witness was former San Francisco 49ers
owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr., who testified that Edwards demanded and
got a $400,000 cash payoff for help in getting DeBartolo a casino
license in 1997. DeBartolo said Edwards picked up stacks of $100
bills near the San Francisco airport and hid the cash in a wide
money belt under his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberations began April 24. One of the 12 jurors was
dismissed for failing to follow the rules, and the remaining jurors
reached their verdict 2{ days later. The juror was a reported
hold-out for the defense; the judge said he brought a dictionary
and a thesaurus and highlighted the word ''extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors characterized Stephen Edwards, 45, as a manager of
the extortion scheme, while three men allegedly acted as front men
to insulate the former governor: Andrew Martin, a former aide to
Edwards; Cecil Brown, a cattleman and longtime friend; and Bobby
Johnson, a contractor and longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Martin were convicted on all counts. Johnson was found
guilty on nine counts. Stephen Edwards was convicted on 18 of 23
counts.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the state gambling board, Ecotry Fuller, was charged
with giving state Sen. Greg Tarver a copy of a confidential state
police report about casino-license applicants and lying about it to
a federal grand jury. He was acquitted, as was Tarver, who had been
accused of passing the report to Edwards for DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented three key witnesses: Robert Guidry, former
owner of the Treasure Chest casino and an Edwards poker-playing
crony; Ricky Shetler, a lifelong friend and business partner of
Stephen Edwards; and DeBartolo, who was forced to turn over control
of his football team to his sister as a result of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Guidry said he sealed an extortion deal with Edwards in 1994 and
paid $1.5 million in monthly installments once Edwards was out of
office.
</P>
<P>
   Shetler testified that he gave the Edwardses cash, cars,
furniture, appliances and vacations in return for their help in
getting state approval for two casinos and for hindering
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was convicted in all of the schemes that featured the
three key witnesses. Their testimony was bolstered by secretly
taped conversations, including one in which the Edwardses and
Martin discussed a plan to rent a tugboat to Guidry at inflated
prices so nobody would wonder why Guidry was paying out large sums
of money.
</P>
<P>
   The defense said Edwards' accusers concocted their stories in
plea bargains with prosecutors. The tapes, they argued, contained
no directly incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the only one of the seven defendants to take the stand,
testified that people have long invoked his name without his
permission to gain political advantage. He said the money from
DeBartolo was payment for legitimate legal and consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   The jury decided that prosecutors failed to link Edwards to a
shakedown of an Illinois-based group of businessmen seeking a
license for a New Orleans casino. He also was acquitted in an
alleged shakedown of the Jazz Casino Corp.'s plans for a Baton
Rouge casino.

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Croshere Has Sprained Ankle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A sprained ankle may keep Indiana's Austin
Croshere sidelined for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinal
series against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere sprained his right ankle late in Game 2 on Monday. He
left the game briefly and returned for the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere scored a career playoff high 20 points, including 16 in
the first half, as the Pacers beat the 76ers 103-97. The Pacers are
2-0 heading into tonight's game in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere wasn't able to do much during Tuesday's workout.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was a game (Tuesday night) I'm pretty sure I wouldn't
be able to play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Croshere has experienced pain in his
right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the regular season, Croshere developed plantar
fasciaitis, an inflammation and strained tendon in the sole of the
foot, which he aggravated in the Milwaukee series.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with that pain, Croshere wears a plastic boot while he
sleeps that keeps his foot at a 90-degree angle. He also endures
treatment to stretch the tendon.

<HEADLINE> Railroad Killer Prosecution Rests  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Defense attorneys now have the chance to try and
prove that an alleged rail-riding serial killer was mentally ill
and therefore not responsible for the beating and stabbing death of
a Houston-area doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday against Angel Maturino
Resendiz, after racing through 19 witnesses in two days. The
40-year-old suspect faces the death penalty if he is convicted of
the December 1998 murder of Dr. Claudia Benton of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of six people that the Mexican citizen is accused of
killing in Texas. Authorities say he also killed two people in
Illinois and another person in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Allen Tanner told jurors in opening statements
Monday that his client committed all nine killings, but should be
found innocent of Benton's murder by reason of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner and co-counsel Rudy Duarte were expected to call two
psychiatrists to testify that Maturino Resendiz was mentally ill
when he killed Benton. It remained unclear whether Maturino
Resendiz will testify.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Ranger Sgt. Drew Carter highlighted Tuesday's testimony,
which also included the introduction of DNA evidence linking
Maturino Resendiz to Benton's rape.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who arrested Maturino Resendiz at the Texas-Mexico
border last summer, described how his search began in February 1999
and blossomed into an international manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''As time went on, I learned a lot about him, but I learned more
about his nomadic nature and that there was really no good place to
start,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   He struck up a relationship with Maturino Resendiz's sister,
Manuela Maturino Karkiewicz. The work paid off on July 11, 1999,
when Karkiewicz called Carter and said her brother was ready to
surrender.

<HEADLINE> Koreas' Summit Preparation Praised  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The United States today praised
preparations for a first-ever summit between the leaders of South
Korea and North Korea, which have held four rounds of talks since
April 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States feels very confident in the way that the
summit is being approached,'' U.S. State Department counselor Wendy
Sherman said at the end of three days of talks with South Korean
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The United States believes direct dialogue between the Koreas is
the only way to bring stability to the Korean Peninsula. The two
adversaries signed an armistice, not a permanent peace treaty, at
the end of the 1950-1953 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Communist North Korea previously shunned most government
contacts with South Korea, which it dismissed as a puppet state
controlled by the United States. Pyongyang was more willing to
negotiate with Washington in a policy widely viewed as an attempt
to split the U.S.-South Korean alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said the planned summit between North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was an affirmation
of close ties between the United States, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is absolutely gratified that indeed this
historic event will take place in June because it really reinforces
the shared objectives of all three of our countries,'' Sherman said
before flying to China, a traditional ally of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the North alarmed the region by test-firing a rocket
that flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific. In September,
Washington lifted some economic sanctions against Pyongyang in
exchange for its pledge to freeze missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, South Korean officials said they and their North
Korean counterparts would no longer hold preparatory meetings for
the summit in the border village of Panmunjom. Instead, they will
communicate via documents and telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The change is meant for effectiveness,'' Kim Hyon-doo, a
spokesman for Seoul's Unification Ministry, said without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   After a long day of talks Monday, South Korea proposed a fifth
round of negotiations on Tuesday. But the North Koreans declined.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have made progress, but two issues remain
unresolved: the language of the agenda for the talks and the size
of the press corps that will accompany the South Korean president.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea had proposed an agenda calling for economic
cooperation, peace measures, the reunion of separated family
members and the establishment of a permanent channel of government
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials later said privately they would agree to
a broadly worded North Korean proposal which stresses peace and
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea proposed sending an 80-member press corps but North
Korea, which has accused the South's media of biased reporting,
asked that the number be halved.
</P>
<P>
   Today, South Korean Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu said his
president would ask Kim Jong Il to visit Seoul by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is scheduled to hold talks on improving ties
with North Korea in Rome on May 24 in a continuation of discussions
that adjourned in New York in March.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was just the beginning of John T. Stevens,
Jr.'s troubles when a bank called him demanding payments on a new
car he never bought.

<P>
   The 72-year-old retired Air Force officer who lives with his
wife of 45 years in Upper Marlboro, Md., eventually learned that
someone had used the couple's Social Security numbers to obtain
credit and run up $113,000 in bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone accepts this single nine-digit number as you,
regardless of who's handing it out,'' said Stevens, telling the
story at a congressional hearing. ''It makes us vulnerable,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are considering new protection for consumers from
misuse of Social Security numbers, which have become both a virtual
national ID and a powerful tool for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the Social Security number was never intended to be a
national identification number, it has rapidly evolved to be the de
facto identifier,'' says James Huse, the Social Security
Administration's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Americans benefit in some ways from the widespread use of a
common identification number by many government agencies and
businesses, which share and sometimes sell them. The military uses
them, and state motor vehicle departments. So do tax and public
assistance agencies, health insurers, schools, banks.
</P>
<P>
   Upsides to the situation include instant credit checks that
allow people to buy and take home new cars on the spot or get
''preapproved'' credit cards in the mail. Also, police can easier
track suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet many people have started to wonder about the proliferating
uses of Social Security numbers, and the privacy and security
implications of all of this,'' said Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social
Security, which is holding hearings on those problems this week.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of Social Security numbers can give people
with dishonest intentions easy access to others' personal records,
including financial and medical data, or help criminals assume
another person's identity to obtain credit or government benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration's fraud hot line received
62,000 phone calls last year from Americans claiming misuse of
their Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Among possible congressional action lawmakers are contemplating:
</P>
<P>
   --Ban sale of Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   --Require government agencies and businesses to obtain permission
before sharing a person's Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase penalties for fraud committed with the use of another
person's Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   --Make government agencies and businesses give people the option
of using identification numbers other than their Social Security
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw expects to have legislation prepared within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, New Hampshire Republican Judd Gregg says he will
offer an amendment banning sale, sharing or other use of a person's
Social Security number without permission. The amendment would be
attached to a broader bill aiming to improve government security,
which the Senate is to vote on soon.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups and some state and local governments have
opposed restrictions in the past as costly and inefficient, because
they might have to devise and coordinate new identification
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Only federal agencies are currently restricted in the use and
disclosure of Social Security numbers, which are issued to help the
national retirement system keep track of individuals' earnings and
benefits.

<HEADLINE> L.A. To Work With Justice Dept.  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- City officials said they want to meet with
government officials to discuss how to overhaul the Los Angeles
Police Department, a move both sides hope will prevent a federal
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department threatened to file a police misconduct
lawsuit Monday unless the city agrees to fix the LAPD, an
organization it said is plagued by rogue officers and poor
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Several City Council members and a Police Commission spokesman
said Tuesday that they intend to cooperate in resolving the matter
out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The city wouldn't find itself facing legal action if it had
acted in the past to implement reforms, said Councilwoman Jackie
Goldberg, who attended a meeting Monday with Justice Department
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their most important goal was to make sure there was a method
of accountability, that this time when you have a good set of
proposals that they actually get carried out and implemented,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Possible remedies include better training for officers and
supervisors, implementing a system to track officer misconduct and
appointing an outside auditor to oversee reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The federal action is the latest twist in the ongoing scandal,
in which anti-gang officers allegedly planted evidence, shot
unarmed suspects, falsified reports and gave false testimony to
convict innocent people of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations have prompted criminal charges against three
officers and led to about 30 being relieved of duty. So far, 73
felony convictions have been overturned since the scandal came to
light last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter warning of a possible lawsuit, the Justice
Department criticized the city and the Los Angeles Police
Department for ''serious deficiencies'' in training, supervising,
investigating and disciplining officers.
</P>
<P>
   The letter specifically targets LAPD supervisors, stating they
fail to monitor officer performance in the field, respond to the
scenes of significant incidents, adequately review arrest reports
and ensure proper treatment of those in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''This failure in direct supervision has created an environment
where officers may engage in misconduct without detection and
intervention by LAPD supervisors,'' Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant
attorney general for civil rights, said in the letter.

<HEADLINE> Ward Helps Knicks Beat Heat  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- As a bit player in the bitter New York Knicks-Miami
Heat rivalry, Charlie Ward is remembered primarily for getting
flipped to the floor during the 1997 playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Ward played a more prominent role, partly by
default.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Alonzo Mourning were
shooting poorly. Patrick Ewing and Tim Hardaway were hurting. So
Ward seized the spotlight, sinking a pair of 3-pointers in the
pivotal third period to help the Knicks beat the Heat 82-76.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a superstar. I don't get a lot of press,'' said Ward,
whose biggest accomplishment in sports was winning the 1993 Heisman
Trophy as Florida State's quarterback. ''But you need guys to help
pull a team together. I've been trying to do that since I got
here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, New York evened the best-of-seven series 1-1
and negated Miami's homecourt advantage. Game 3 is Friday at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the NBA playoffs Tuesday night, Portland routed
Utah 103-85 for a 2-0 advantage in the Western Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   In tonight's games, Indiana takes a 2-0 lead to Philadelphia,
and the Los Angeles Lakers, leading 1-0, play host to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Ward led the Knicks in scoring for only the third time this
season, matching Ewing's 13 points. Ward provided a steadying
influence at point guard on a night when Houston, Sprewell and
Ewing shot a combined 9-for-39.
</P>
<P>
   ''Charlie hit some big shots,'' Heat forward P.J. Brown said.
''He was the x-factor. He deserves a lot of credit for their win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward made a 3-pointer to give New York a 43-37 lead early in the
third period, then sank another to make it 57-50. He finished with
six rebounds, two assists, two steals, a block and no turnovers in
37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been like that all year,'' Houston said. ''He's been
overshadowed. We didn't shoot the ball well, but he came up big.''
</P>
<P>
   The sloppy game had more slapstick than a Broadway farce.
Sprewell missed three layups. Ewing hit the side of the backboard
with a jumper. Marcus Camby blew a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   For Miami, Mourning went 5-for-18. Hardaway was limited to 30
minutes -- including only four in the final period -- because of a
nagging foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   New York shot 35 percent, but the Heat were worse. They made
just 34 percent, tying a franchise playoff low, and had just one
basket during a 10-minute stretch in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   And in the first half, Miami missed 13 of 20 free throws,
including seven in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was sort of a surreal game,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said.
''We rebounded and played well enough defensively, but offensively
we were horrendous. Instead of taking the ball strong to the
basket, we settled for long jumpers and that hope game we get into
at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Heat squandered homecourt advantage. The teams
have met in the playoffs the past four years, splitting the first
two games in Miami every time. New York went on to eliminate the
Heat the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been in this situation before,'' said Jamal Mashburn,
who led the Heat with 25 points and played the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning had 17 points, 17 rebounds and four blocks, but was
upset about missing 13 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what I'm doing wrong,'' he said. ''No. 1, I'm forcing
the issue. No. 2, I'm not patient enough. You'd think a seasoned
veteran would have learned by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, playing 32 minutes despite a bothersome back, held his
own against Mourning, finishing with eight rebounds and two blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks shot 28 percent in the first half and still led
48-44. They pulled away in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rock wasn't going in the hole,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. ''That was some bad shooting in that first half.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Knicks promised, Game 2 was more physical than Game 1.
There were 60 fouls, compared with 40 Sunday when Miami won 87-83.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted this game more than anything,'' Sprewell said. ''We
showed that, even though we didn't play well offensively. We got
the job done at the defensive end.''
</P>
<P>
Trail Blazers 103, Jazz 85
</P>
<P>
   Portland took advantage of another dismal performance by Utah to
take a 2-0 lead in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith scored 11 of his 19 points in the third quarter, and
five of his teammates scored in double figures as the Blazers
nearly duplicated their 19-point defeat of the Jazz in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone was held to just 15 points, barely half of his
playoff average this season. Yet, his total actually led the Jazz.
Bryon Russell had 12 points, and the other three starters combined
for 13.
</P>
<P>
   A hook by Jermaine O'Neal, playing his first minutes of the
playoffs, made it 93-63 with 7:37 to go. The lead reached as high
as 33.

<HEADLINE> Big Game Jackpot Hits $350 Million  </HEADLINE>
By AMY FRAZIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- With the richest lottery jackpot in U.S. history
at stake, millions of people who snapped up Big Game tickets
already knew today that they hadn't won.
</P>
<P>
   Their only hope was that no one else had the winning ticket,
which would mean the $350 million jackpot will grow even larger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to enjoy this $1 roller coaster all over again,''
Robert Holland, a bartender at the East Atlanta Restaurant and
Lounge, said after Tuesday night's multi-state lottery drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37 and Big Money Ball 4.
Lottery officials were expected to announce today whether any
jackpot-winning tickets were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Holland knew the odds were stacked against him. The odds of
having all five winning numbers and the Big Money Ball were one in
more than 76 million. ''At least I only lost a dollar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't as lucky. Some players plopped down hundreds of
dollars in the hopes of becoming instant millionaires. Others
pooled their money with coworkers and friends to buy more chances.
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set in December by
Spain's El Gordo, or the Fat One. But that game awards thousands of
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Game jackpot easily tops the previous American record, a
$295.7 million Powerball jackpot split by 13 machinists in
Westerville, Ohio, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After taxes, based on federal and Georgia state taxes, the Big
Game payout on a single winning ticket is either $8.9 million a
year for 26 years, or a one-time payment of $114 million. The state
tax varies among the seven states in which tickets are sold --
Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of such big money had imaginations running wild.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Franco, who bought his tickets at Union Station in
Chicago, said he knew exactly what he would do if he won.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to walk into the closest Harley (Davidson) shop and
not even haggle,'' he said. ''Just get some keys and ride ... I
don't even know if I'll put a call in to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The hype surrounding the Big Game has created problems for some.
Alcoholics can avoid bars, but compulsive gamblers have a hard time
avoiding lottery advertisements, news stories and talk around the
office water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on
Problem Gambling in Washington, said hard-core gamblers -- who make
up about 1 to 2 percent of the adult population -- play because of
an overwhelming need to gamble, not because of the size of the
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Georgia and Massachusetts almost didn't get a
chance to try to pick the lucky numbers because damaged phone lines
shut down hundreds of lottery terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with BellSouth phone lines closed about 370 retailers
in northeast Georgia until Tuesday afternoon. The problem was worse
in southeastern Massachusetts, where an accidentally cut
fiber-optic cable disabled between 750 and 1,000 lottery agents.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Pawlowski, general manager at Vista Donuts in Attleboro,
Mass., said he lost thousands of customers after his terminals went
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have been turned away with envelopes full of money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prize also brought out some novice lottery players,
including Atlanta's Brian James.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a lot of money,'' he said. ''I would definitely make
that investment.''

<HEADLINE> American League Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   It didn't take very long for Chuck Knoblauch to show
how much he
means to the New York Yankees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out since May 1 because of a sprained left wrist, Knoblauch
doubled to set up Paul O'Neill's bases-loaded walk in the 10th
inning Tuesday night, and the Yankees beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
4-3,
</P>
<P>
   ''You're never amazed around here, because things like that keep
happening,'' Knoblauch said. ''I was saying before the game that
hopefully I'd get in the box and it would click. I was glad to get
in there and not mess anything up and keep the winning going.''
</P>
<P>
   New York won for the eighth time in nine games, sending the
visiting Devil Rays to their eighth loss in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson (6-0) pitched two perfect innings, tying Toronto's
David Wells and Chicago's James Baldwin for the AL victory lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never expected to be 6-0 this early,'' Nelson said. ''It's
just because we've been scoring late and I happened to be in the
games.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games, Chicago beat Boston 6-0, Toronto beat Boston
6-4, Seattle routed Texas 13-3, Minnesota beat Cleveland 6-5 and
Oakland beat Anaheim 5-2. Kansas City's game at Detroit was rained
out with the Tigers ahead 3-0 in the bottom of the third.
</P>
<P>
   At Yankee Stadium, Scott Brosius drew a one-out walk from Rick
White (0-2) and Knoblauch, 2-for-5 in his return, blooped an
opposite-field double that bounced into the right-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   After an intentional walk to Derek Jeter, Jim Morris relieved
and walked O'Neill on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I wasn't nervous,'' Morris said. ''I just didn't get it
done.''
White Sox 6, Red Sox 0:
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin (6-0) pitched a three-hitter for his first career
shutout, striking out eight and walking one to stop Chicago's
four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   At Fenway Park, Pete Schourek (1-3) allowed six runs -- three
earned -- and seven hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko's RBI single put Chicago ahead in the sixth and
Carlos Lee hit a two-run single. Magglio Ordonez added a two-run
single in the seventh.
Blue Jays 6, Orioles 4:
</P>
<P>
   Wells (6-1) won his fifth straight start, allowing four runs and
nine hits in eight innings at SkyDome. Raul Mondesi homered twice
in Toronto's 12th straight win over Baltimore, which has lost six
of seven overall.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken, starting at designated hitter for the first time in
his career, went 1-for-4 with a two-run single. Ripken, who broke
Lou Gehrig's mark of 2,130 consecutive games in 1995, didn't want
to take a day off.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mussina (1-4) allowed six runs -- five earned -- and 12 hits
in seven innings, giving up four homers. Billy Koch pitched the
ninth for his ninth save.
Mariners 13, Rangers 3:
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez was 4-for-5 with a three-run homer and four RBIs,
and David Bell hit a two-run homer and drove in three runs for
visiting Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   With Jamie Moyer and Freddy Garcia on the disabled list, Paul
Abbott (1-0) made his first start of the season and allowed three
runs and five hits in 5 2-3 innings with five strikeouts and four
walks.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Loaiza (1-2) was pounded for eight runs and nine hits in
2 2-3 innings. The Mariners had 19 hits.
Twins 6, Indians 5:
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins (1-1) pitched 3 2-3 innings of scoreless relief
at the Metrodome and Minnesota scored six runs in the fifth to beat
Chuck Finley (3-2), who didn't allow a runner through four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer homered leading off the fifth, Denny Hocking walked
with the bases loaded, right fielder Manny Ramirez dropped Cristian
Guzman's shallow fly for a run-scoring error, Jay Canizaro hit a
two-run single and Matt Lawton hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   With the potential tying run on third, pinch-hitter Sandy Alomar
hit a game-ending flyout off Travis Miller, who got his first
career save.
Athletics 5, Angels 2:
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (4-2) allowed one run and five hits in seven
innings, and visiting Oakland got solo homers from Ben Grieve and
Jeremy Giambi. Jason Isringhausen got two outs for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, which put shortstop Gary DiSarcina on the disabled list
after Monday night's victory, lost starting pitcher Ken Hill (3-4)
after he strained a muscle in the right side of his ribcage.

	   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- A Libyan envoy headed into the Philippine jungle
today to talk with Muslim separatists holding 21 Western and Asian hostages and
to press for the release of an ill German woman. A doctor accompanying him had
medicine, oxygen, food, clothing, and chocolate for the captives. She was also
taking stretchers in case the rebels agreed to free two captives: a German woman
who has suffered two strokes, according to her family, and a French man with a
urinary infection. The hostages -- three Germans, two French, two South
Africans, two Finns, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos -- were
snatched from a diving resort on the Malaysian island of Sipadan on April 23 and

U.N. To Pay Volunteer Peacekeepers

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Peacekeepers from around the world put themselves at
risk in faraway countries every day, but not for free. The United Nations
promises $1,000 per person, per month to countries that volunteer troops for
peace missions. That money can be helpful for poorer nations, such as Zambia and
Guinea. But the flat rate won't cover the costs for better-trained western
forces, who seem unwilling to lose money on high-risk missions in areas where
they have little at stake. In Sierra Leone, 500 U.N. personnel have been taken
hostage by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front. At least one peacekeeper is
believed to be dead, and 12 others have been injured.

Gov't Drafts New Medicaid Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some states could lose millions in Medicaid payments for
nursing homes under a government proposal aimed at ending accounting gimmicks
that help states increase their share of federal matching funds without raising
their own contributions. The Health Care Financing Administration, which
administers Medicaid, has proposed altering regulations that help determine how
much federal Medicaid money nursing homes receive. The change would dramatically
reduce federal matching funds in many states that have come to rely on the money
to shore up struggling county-run nursing facilities, state officials say.

Israel Seeking New Chapter With UN

<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After years of isolation and strain, Israel is hoping
that its compliance with a 22-year-old U.N. resolution to withdraw from Lebanese
soil will help warm ties with the world body that gave it life. Israel's
ambassador to the United Nations, Yehuda Lankry, told The Associated Press that
Israel has been enjoying rare cooperation with the United Nations in preparation
for a pullout by July. Israel has yet to comply with other U.N. resolutions
calling for it to withdraw from additional war-won territories, but Lankry said
Israel's acceptance of the Lebanon resolution was a good first step in improving

computers from mass-mailed computer viruses. The "Love Bug" virus, which has
been called the fastest-spreading and most destructive computer virus ever,
caused a flood of e-mails with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" to course through

hygiene, including not opening unexpected e-mail attachments, said Harris

<HEADLINE> Michigan Lottery reports a winner in $350 million Big Game jackpot  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A winning ticket in the multi-state Big Game
lottery with its record $350 million jackpot was sold in Michigan,
a state lottery spokesman said early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket -- one matching all the numbers -- was sold at Mr. K's
Party Shoppe in the Detroit suburb of Utica, Michigan Lottery
spokeswoman Sarah Lapshan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Results from the other six states where tickets were sold were
still being tallied when Lapshan made her announcement at 3:30 a.m.
EDT.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, lottery officials said they likely would be
waiting until daylight for results.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have anything as of yet,'' said Margaret Square, New
Jersey Lottery drawing manager. ''Our reports haven't confirmed
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers drawn were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37, Big Ball 4.
</P>
<P>
   The almost inconceivably large jackpot has converted even the
most reluctant gamblers. John Smith, a 23-year-old student at the
University of Maryland, had never bought any sort of lottery ticket
before buying five tickets at a liquor store in College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Melody McPipkin of Decatur, Ga., also bought five tickets
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless it gets way up there, I don't bother,'' she said. ''I'm
not going to waste my time on just a few million.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets were sold in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   After taxes, based on federal and Georgia state taxes, the
payout on a single winning ticket is either $8.9 million a year for
26 years, or a one-time payment of $114 million. The state tax
varies among the seven states.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million jackpot tops the previous American record, a
$295.7 million Powerball jackpot split by 13 machinists in
Westerville, Ohio, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set in December by
Spain's El Gordo lottery, or the Fat One. But that game spreads
itself thin by awarding thousands of prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The odds that a $1 Big Game ticket will have all five winning
numbers and the matching Big Money Ball are one in more than 76
million. But who's thinking about odds when $1 buys a chance to
dream?
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't mind calling my company and telling them I'm not
coming in to work tomorrow,'' said Mitchell Ingram, a construction
foreman from Woodstock. ''And you can't win if you don't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Georgia and Massachusetts almost didn't have a
chance to play Monday night and Tuesday morning because damaged
phones lines shut down hundreds of lottery terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with BellSouth phone lines shut down about 370
retailers in northeast Georgia until Tuesday afternoon. The problem
was worse in southeastern Massachusetts, where an accidentally cut
fiber-optic cable disabled between 750 and 1,000 lottery agents.
</P>
<P>
   The hype surrounding the Big Game has created problems for some.
Alcoholics can avoid bars, but compulsive gamblers have a hard time
avoiding lottery advertisements, news stories and talk around the
office water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on
Problem Gambling in Washington, said hard-core gamblers -- who make
up about 1 to 2 percent of the adult population -- play because of
an overwhelming need to gamble, not because of the size of the
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people, the largest jackpot in American history is
too much to turn down. Edward Franco, who bought his tickets at
Union Station in Chicago, said he knows exactly what he will do if
he wins the jackpot:
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to walk into the closest Harley (Davidson) shop and
not even haggle. Just get some keys and ride. ... I don't even know
if I'll put a call in to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco stopped and corrected himself: ''I don't know if I'll
have my people call in to work.''

<HEADLINE> Death Sought in Embassy Bombing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno has authorized
federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty against at least one
person charged in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in
Africa, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The decision would result in the first U.S. death penalty case
involving an act of international terrorism, lawyers in the case
told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant is Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, who is accused
of riding in the truck carrying the bomb that exploded at the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on Aug. 7, 1998. That bombing, and a
simultaneous one at the embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed
224 people, including 12 Americans. More than 5,000 people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali, the first suspect brought to New York from Africa
after the bombings, has acknowledged that he rode in the truck and
that the bombing was intended as a ''martyrdom operation,''
according to federal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali is one of three defendants eligible for the death
penalty in the case. No penalty decision has been made regarding
the other two, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   All three defendants, in custody in New York, have pleaded
innocent to murder conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali's lawyer David Bruck called Reno's decision
''folly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The government claims this young man has already tried to
detonate himself into paradise,'' Bruck said. ''Now it's offering
to do the job itself, providing him with a glorious death while the
world watches. Is this how to deter terrorism?''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White declined to comment
to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombings, federal prosecutors have indicted a total of
17 men, including Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, on charges they
conspired to kill Americans outside the United States. Eight of
those charged are fugitives, including bin Laden.

<HEADLINE> Michigan, Illinois winners in $350 million Big Game drawing  </HEADLINE>
By A.J. DICKERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan and Illinois have winners in the
$350 million Big Game lottery, spokeswomen for the states' lottery
bureaus said today.
</P>
<P>
   A ticket matching the numbers drawn Tuesday night in the
multistate lottery was sold at Mr. K's Party Shoppe in suburban
Detroit, Michigan Lottery spokeswoman Sarah Lapshan said from
Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   A winning ticket also was sold somewhere in Illinois, said
Illinois Lottery spokeswoman Anne Plohr-Rayhill. She said she did
not know where it was sold.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. K's Party Shoppe is in Macomb County's Shelby Township near
Utica, about 20 miles north of Detroit. Located in a small strip
mall with two other businesses, it was closed at 5 a.m. today, but
television trucks and other news vehicles already crowded the
rain-dampened parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   A switched-off neon sign in the window said ''Lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapshan said she did not yet know if any other winning tickets
were sold in other states. There was only one winning ticket sold
in Michigan, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we can confirm is a winning ticket in Michigan at this
time,'' Lapshan said.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the Big Game are sold in Georgia, Illinois,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Lottery officials said no winning tickets were sold
there. Maryland authorities also reported no winning tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Results from the other states hadn't been released by early
today.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the telephone at Mr. K's Party Shoppe early
today.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers were one, two, 12, 33 and 37, and the Big
Money Ball number was four. To win, a ticket had to match the five
numbers and the Big Money Ball.
</P>
<P>
   After taxes, based on federal and Georgia state taxes, the
payout on a single winning ticket is either $8.9 million a year for
26 years, or a one-time payment of $114 million. The state tax
varies among the seven states.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million jackpot tops the previous American record for a
lottery. That was a $295.7 million Powerball jackpot split by 13
machinists in Westerville, Ohio, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set in December by
Spain's El Gordo lottery, or the Fat One. But that game spreads
itself thin by awarding thousands of prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The odds that a $1 Big Game ticket will have all five winning
numbers and the matching Big Money Ball are one in more than 76
million.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Holland, a bartender at the East Atlanta Restaurant and
Lounge in Georgia, said he knew the odds were stacked against him
when he bought his ticket. The odds of having all five winning
numbers and the Big Money Ball were one in more than 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least I only lost a dollar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't as lucky. Some players plopped down hundreds of
dollars in the hopes of becoming instant millionaires. Others
pooled their money with coworkers and friends to buy more chances.

<HEADLINE> For 'Early Show' It's Getting Late  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Its ratings are ''tanking.'' Audience-wise, it's
''a two-hour sinkhole.'' Its ''$30 million face lift just adds
wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   In short: ''For 'The Early Show,' it's getting late.''
</P>
<P>
   So go media assessments of CBS' umpteenth entry in the breakfast
derby, a race long dominated by NBC's ''Today'' (with more than 6
million viewers tuned to Katie Couric and Matt Lauer) and, in
second place, ABC's ''Good Morning America'' (about 4.6 million
viewers).
</P>
<P>
   Since its launch Nov. 1, and even before, ''The Early Show'' has
been roundly written off as a lost cause. Groaning that its
viewership (about 2.2 million) is lower than the audience for the
nearly invisible show it replaced, one media Kevorkian has already
urged that ''The Early Show'' be given a swift mercy killing.
</P>
<P>
   But just how closely are these critics following ''The Early
Show'' beyond its Nielsen score? A recent issue of Time magazine is
instructive. It ran a cartoon in which co-anchors Bryant Gumbel and
Jane Clayson fret about their puny numbers. But the drawing
mislabels Clayson as ''Clayton.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an understandable error -- at least, if no one at Time
magazine happens to ever catch the show. In any case, it seems
that, of all the people who aren't watching ''The Early Show,''
professional media-watchers are a conspicuous segment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen one person write that the show is terrible,''
says Steve Friedman, its executive producer. ''All I hear about is
the ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, ''It's Not Terrible!'' hardly serves as a rallying cry.
Nor, for that matter, does ''It's Just as Good,'' which is
Friedman's own appraisal of ''The Early Show'' versus its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things are right on track, he insists. ''The first six
months was to establish ourselves as a credible show. And we've
done it. When a big story hit -- whether it was a plane crash,
politics, Elian, the stock market -- we've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman has been there before. A TV-news veteran, he served two
hitches running ''Today'' and transformed morning television with
the sidewalk studio he introduced in 1994. His ''window on the
world'' helped ''Today'' push past then-leader ''Good Morning
America.'' And now, of course, everybody does windows.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted for CBS, Friedman's master plan called for ''The Early
Show'' to originate from a built-to-order glassed studio on Fifth
Avenue across from Central Park. It returned Gumbel, Friedman's
leading man at NBC, to the morning arena where he excelled for 15
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   To share the anchor desk, Friedman chose relative newcomer Jane
Clayson, who is chipper, fresh-faced and starting to show her chops
(one day last week she began needling Gumbel about his aversion to
country music, reducing him to a grinning ''what do you want from
me?'' deferral).
</P>
<P>
   It's essential that Gumbel's co-host help humanize him in the
eyes of those viewers who complain that he is aloof, haughty and
tactless -- and who now see fresh evidence of his not-so-niceness in
publicity surrounding his ugly divorce battle.
</P>
<P>
   But, however easy to take, Clayson thus far hasn't exactly wowed
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has anything else about the show made a splash.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never said we were going to revolutionize morning
television,'' Friedman responds. ''We like morning television the
way it is. And viewers like it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's big problem: What viewers like most about morning TV
is the co-anchor team they chose months, or even years, before his
show arrived. Even if they do look in on ''The Early Show,'' they
can't help thinking, ''Gee, I wonder what Matt&AMP;Katie (or
Diane&AMP;Charlie) are doing right now?'' The only way to find out is
to bail on Bryant&AMP;Jane.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may have underestimated how hard it would be to set up a
fast-food hamburger place across the street from McDonald's and
Burger King,'' Friedman concedes. ''People like McDonald's and
Burger King.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people also like Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC; did we
really need ANOTHER hamburger stand? But the logic of Friedman's
same-but-better strategy is beside the point. Like it or not, ''The
Early Show'' is a solid, competitive program, flipping burgers with
the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we want to get ourselves in position,'' Friedman says. He
wants to be ready for the day there's a change among the other guys
(after all, how much longer do ''Good Morning America'' hosts Diane
Sawyer and Charlie Gibson want to rise before dawn?). ''That kind
of thing could give us a good opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But does CBS have the needed patience? Will its merger with
Viacom dampen the commitment? And what about network affiliates,
whose enthusiasm Friedman must re-ignite at their annual meeting
later this month?
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that we probably have another couple of years to
develop the show,'' Friedman declares. ''I hope we do. I mean, our
plaza isn't even done outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from it: Right out the window is a hole in the ground.
''This show,'' he says, gesturing with a flourish at the
construction, ''is being built as we go, brick by brick.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the work goes on, can he dodge the critics' stones?

   Microsoft To Present Counter-Proposal
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft is about to get its chance to rebut
a government's proposal to rip the company in two. Today, Microsoft
will respond to the proposal made last month by the Justice
Department and 17 state attorneys to split it into one company that
sells the dominant Windows operating system and another selling
virtually everything else. Microsoft's response to the government
proposal will include its objections to the plan, as well as its
own proposed remedies. Sources told The Associated Press last week
that Microsoft may ask the judge to scrap most of the government's
plan because it is improperly based on evidence that wasn't
presented during trial.

   Cisco Earnings Top Expectations
</P>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Internet equipment provider Cisco
Systems Inc. continues to show strong quarterly gains as a string
of acquisitions and internal development helps meet red-hot demand
for Web and data-routing services. For the three months ended April
29, the company reported net income of $662 million, or 9 cents per
share, up from $636 million, or 9 cents per share, in the year-ago
period. The numbers include $488 million in research and
development write-offs as well as several other one-time items.
Excluding those numbers, Cisco earned $1.03 billion, or 14 cents a
share. As has been a pattern, Cisco's earnings yesterday exceeded
expectations by a penny a share. Analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company to earn 13 cents a
share, excluding charges.

Internet companies this year. The global computer maker said the
money will be spent on forming strategic alliances with Korean
Internet service providers, strengthening its service and
consulting in the Internet area through mergers and acquisitions or
partnerships. It also said it will enhance e-commerce and
electronic banking activities in the country.

service will roll out first in Japan in August, followed shortly
thereafter in the United States, the company said in a statement.
Sega will hold a 20 percent stake in the company, while its

it expects to maintain healthy sales and profit growth for the
remainder of the year. The chain reported yesterday that it earned
$1.326 billion, or 30 cents a share, for the quarter ended April
30, compared with $916 million, or 20 cents a share, a year ago.
Last year's results include a 4 cent charge for a change in the
company's accounting practices. Wal-Mart's results topped Wall

<HEADLINE> Lockheed To Keep Plant in Georgia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin has decided against moving
final assembly of the F-22 stealth fighter from Marietta to Fort
Worth, Texas, preserving 1,000 jobs at the suburban Atlanta plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the last few months, we have reviewed results from
previous studies of F-22 production plans, including options for
moving final assembly,'' Marietta plant chief Tom Burbage said in a
memo Tuesday to Marietta workers.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage said ''financial implications'' of the studies did not
support such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Therefore, there are no plans to move F-22 final assembly from
our facility in Marietta,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Bethesda, Md.-based company announced 2,800
layoffs, 2 percent of its work force of 140,000, which it said
would generate $200 million in annual savings.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin said the majority of the savings would be
achieved in the Aeronautical Systems business, which would be
consolidated into a single unit to be called Lockheed Martin
Aeronautics Co., headquartered in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500 job cuts in the aeronautics division would come in
approximately equal measure from the company's three primary sites
in Georgia, California and Texas, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth plant already makes mid-fuselage sections of the
F-22.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, program manager Robert Rearden said Lockheed
would switch assembly to Fort Worth only if the Air Force ordered
and paid for such a move. Rearden said the costs of moving final
assembly from Marietta ''are such that it really doesn't make
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers and union leaders in Fort Worth, coming off a strike,
had hoped that Lockheed would consolidate the F-22 work there,
which would compensate for declining production of the F-16
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect concerned the Machinists union in Marietta and
Georgia members of Congress. Both have helped Lockheed Martin
protest the F-22 program in Congress.
</P>

<HEADLINE> GM Says It Won't Shut Daewoo Plants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has no plan to
close any Daewoo Motor Co. operations if it acquires the ailing
South Korean automaker, GM Chairman John F. Smith Jr. said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to grow Daewoo. We feel very comfortable we can do
that,'' Smith said, commenting on local concerns about a foreign
takeover of Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford Motor Co. are considered the front-runners in
international bidding for Daewoo. Also taking part in the bidding
are DaimlerChrysler AG, Fiat SpA of Italy and Hyundai Motor Co. of
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's creditors plan to choose two prime bidders by June and
the successful bidder by September.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo workers have staged strikes to protest a possible
takeover of Daewoo by a foreign carmaker, fearing that it would
lead to mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith came to Seoul on Monday for a three-day visit which
included a review of GM's plan to take over Daewoo and a visit to
an international motor show in Seoul to promote the sale of
imported cars in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said GM would run Daewoo Motor ''as a Korean company, with
its own brand.''
</P>
<P>
   By taking over Daewoo, GM can strengthen its presence in Asia,
which is expected to become the fastest growing auto market in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo Motor is a unit of Daewoo Group, which collapsed under
huge debts last year. It produced 758,500 vehicles in 1999 at its
17 facilities at home and abroad. At the end of last year, it had
$18.3 billion in assets and $13.9 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The carmaker began as a joint venture with GM in 1978. GM sold
its 50 percent stake to Daewoo for $170 million in 1992.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were lower in early trading on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 44 points in the early
going. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange held a 7-4 lead
over gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index was off 60 points and the Standard &AMP;

</P>
<P>
   With the Nasdaq down sharply the past two days, and losing more
ground in early trading, some investors might see this as a buying
situation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, market-watchers expect little overall
direction for the market for the next several days.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply in early trading today, with
technology names leading the declines as investors punished Cisco
Systems despite a profit report that topped Wall Street's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 103.40 at 10433.35.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 135.02 at 3,449.99, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was off 21.25 at 1,390.89.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco was down 2[ to 60|. After the close of trading Tuesday,
the Internet equipment provider reported net income of $662
million, or 9 cents per share. That beat Wall Street analysts'
expectations by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of Cisco have been out of favor all week after a
story in Barron's magazine said the stock is overvalued and
acquisitions will prove increasingly difficult because of
escalating purchase prices of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Motorola fell 12 15/16 to 92.
Salomon Smith Barney cut its rating on the stock to ''outperform''
from ''buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly light, continuing a string of quiet sessions.
Many market players have retreated to the sidelines ahead of the
Federal Reserve's next meeting on May 16. The Fed is expected to
raise interest rates as much as a half-percentage point in its
continuing bid to slow the pace of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the NYSE came to 113.52 million shares, behind
Tuesday's early pace. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a
9-to-5 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.13 to 482.73.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent. In

The Associated Press that the Russian soldiers were killed in a battle outside
Alleroy village, 30 miles east of Chechnya's capital, Grozny. But the Kremlin's

college freshmen on Nov. 12, 1996, when they went to a motel room near the
University of Delaware campus and she gave birth to his son. The baby was later

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Increase High-Tech Visas  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would increase the number of
visas for foreigners with technical skills such as computer
programmers and electrical engineers is gaining momentum in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is general agreement that the economy of this country is
best served by some sort of increase,'' said Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to earlier bills, a compromise crafted Tuesday in
the House Judiciary Committee would not require federal regulations
that industry officials worried would block them from hiring any
foreign workers. The committee lacked a quorum to approve the bill
today but could take it up as soon as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill already has cleared the Senate Judiciary
Committee and could be debated on the floor this week.
</P>
<P>
   The progress in both chambers is a significant change from the
reluctance in previous years to increase the number of visas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the widest change is that the debate seems to have
moved away from whether we need more to exactly how many and
exactly what conditions are being attached to that,'' said Harris
Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   H-1B visas are given to foreigners with college degrees and
allow them to work in the United States for up to six years. The
number of visas is capped at 115,000 this year, but is scheduled to
fall to 107,500 next year and 65,000 per year after that.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech industry officials say at least 300,000 jobs are going
unfilled for lack of qualified U.S. applicants. They note this
year's visa allotment was filled by mid-March, less than halfway
through the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions contend the industry is looking overseas chiefly to
hold down wages.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill from Reps. Lamar Smith, R-Texas; Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Texas; and Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., would remove the
limit on the visas for three years and set a minimum salary of
$40,000 for the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies would have to document $250,000 in assets to
participate in the program and conduct annual reviews of wages for
their American workers to ensure they either stayed the same or
rose. A $150 fee increase for each visa would be divided between
the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the State Department
to combat fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Smith backed off on his earlier requirement that the Labor
Department come up with oversight regulations for the program
before any more visas are issued.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my judgment, this bill represents a balance. It addresses
both the needs of high-tech companies and the concerns of American
workers,'' said Smith, a skeptic of the high-tech worker shortage
who said he was giving the industry ''the benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said a few ''rough edges'' need to be removed from the
bill, such as the requirement to document average wages.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., criticized the compromise for
failing to offer training for American workers. She had suggested
raising the visa fee from $500 to $1,000 to generate $100 million
for educating and training American workers so they can fill the
vacant high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill before us falls far short of what we need,'' she
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Medicare Drug Benefit Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to show unity on a key election-year
issue, President Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders today
unveiled a proposed prescription drug benefit under Medicare that
the White House first touted last winter.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his point that drugs are too costly for many older
Americans, Clinton appeared in the White House Rose Garden today
with Betty Dizik, 73, a widow who said she skips prescribed
medications for diabetes and a heart condition when she cannot
afford them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not asking for a handout or charity. I'm willing to work
and do my part,'' Dizik said. ''I'm just asking for a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said providing prescription coverage for people like
Dizik is ''the smart and the right thing to do. We would never even
think of creating Medicare today without it, and it's high time we
fixed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also released a study by the Older Women's
League that concluded women on Medicare spend 13 percent more than
men for prescription drugs. On average, the women's incomes are 40
percent below those of men.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal outlined today will stand as an alternative to the
House Republican approach calling for private insurance, and thus
set the stage for a debate in the final months of the congressional
session.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need some Republican support,'' Clinton said. ''This is a
good bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the
Republicans' plan, which would limit the prescription benefit to
those earning up to $15,000 a year doesn't address the needs of
people like Dizik.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't do a thing for her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt and numerous
rank-and-file Democrats joined Clinton at today's announcement.
There are likely to be minor differences between bills advanced in
the House and Senate, they said, but stressed that the party was
unified on its approach.
</P>
<P>
   According to a description of the proposal that circulated in
Congress on Tuesday, coverage would be optional, and any
beneficiary wishing to enroll would pay a premium that one official
estimated at roughly $24 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The basic Medicare benefit would pay for 50 percent of the cost
of the first $2,000 in prescriptions annually, rising to $5,000 by
2009. Low-income beneficiaries up to 135 percent of the
government's poverty level would receive subsidies, and
beneficiaries with slightly higher incomes would receive a slightly
reduced subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the basic benefit, Democrats said the plan
envisions catastrophic coverage after out-of-pocket expenses exceed
a certain level, likely $3,000 to $4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic efforts to achieve a measure of unity have been
complicated by internal debate over a separate bill to require
reduced prices for certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, advanced by Rep. Tom Allen of Maine and backed by more
than 150 House Democrats, was opposed strongly by others in the
party, including several senators, party officials said. It would
permit pharmacies to buy prescription drugs for Medicare at the
same preferred price given providers under Medicaid or Veterans
Affairs Department health programs.
</P>
<P>
   The provision is not included in the White House bill, although
Clinton and Democratic lawmakers are expected to include a
provision that establishes a goal of eliminating the higher price
that seniors pay for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' measure is expected to specify using so-called
pharmacy benefit managers to seek discounts from both drug
companies and pharmacies, as Clinton proposed last winter.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Allen said Democrats have been ''able to reach
agreement on the structure of the benefit proposal. That doesn't
mean we are dropping the discount approach. We will continue to
advocate that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, ''This is an important step for
(Democrats) to be able to get cohesion'' on the prescription drug
bill.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer group attacked the decision to jettison the price
mandate in advance. ''They have completely ignored the best
cost-containment bill in their program,'' contended Frank Clemente,
a spokesman for Public Citizen Congress Watch. He said Democrats
''buckled'' to the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recommended a Medicare drug benefit in his State of the
Union address last winter, and House Republicans responded last
month with an alternative of their own.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, sketched thus far only in outline, would
establish a program of voluntary private health insurance, freeing
companies for the first time to sell policies that provide benefits
only for prescription drug costs. Like the Democrats, Republicans
envisions government subsidies for lower-income older people as
well as those with unusually high prescription drug costs.

Europe's largest paper company, had already entered an all-stock
agreement to acquire Champion in February, but a slide in UPM's
stock price diminished the value of that offer.

   Lockheed To Keep Plant in Georgia
</P>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin has decided against moving
final assembly of the F-22 stealth fighter from Marietta to Fort
Worth, Texas, preserving 1,000 jobs at the suburban Atlanta plant.
Marietta plant chief Tom Burbage said ''financial implications'' of
the studies did not support such a plan. In February, the Bethesda,
Md.-based company announced 2,800 layoffs, 2 percent of its work
force of 140,000, which it said would generate $200 million in
annual savings.

<HEADLINE> Michigan, Illinois winners in $366 million Big Game drawing  </HEADLINE>
By A.J. DICKERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA , Mich. (AP) --Winning tickets in the Big Game lottery were
sold in Michigan and Illinois, officials announced today, dashing
the hopes of millions whose frenzied buying in seven states pushed
the jackpot to a record $366 million.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate details on who the winners are, though
Michigan Lottery officials say they were contacted this morning by
a man they believe holds the winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A ticket matching the numbers drawn Tuesday night in the
multistate lottery was sold at Mr. K's Party Shoppe in suburban
Detroit, Michigan Lottery Commissioner Don Gilmer said from
Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   About 9:30 a.m., a man who did not identify himself called the
Michigan Lottery office, where validation numbers he recited from
his ticket apparently matched those the winning ticket should have,
spokeswoman Sarah Lapshan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty confident this is the winning ticket. I just don't
like to say this is the winner until they're here,'' Lapshan said.
''We don't consider it validated until it's in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   She described the caller as ''remarkably quite calm'' for a
potential jackpot winner. He divulged nothing about himself.
</P>
<P>
   The other winning ticket was bought at Sweeney's Citgo in the
northwestern Chicago suburb of Lake Zurick, Ill. Assistant manager
Ginny Gallagher said lottery officials called her at 7 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I screamed at the girl on the phone, I was so excited,''
Gallagher said. The store has sold about $100,000 worth of Big Game
tickets in the past few weeks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The holder of the Michigan ticket chose the annuity option but
can change course and go with a lump-sum cash payment, Gilmer said.
By Gilmer's calculations, the annuity before taxes would pay $7
million a year -- $135,000 a week -- over the next 26 years. The
lump-sum payment would pay the Michigan winner about $61.3 million,
after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're glad it's over with,'' Gilmer said. ''The jackpot got to
almost unrealistic heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. K's Party Shoppe is in a small strip mall with two other
businesses -- a tanning parlor and a hair salon -- in Macomb County's
Shelby Township near Utica, about 20 miles north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Owner George Kassab and four sons who work in the store were so
thrilled that they opened up shortly after 6 a.m. today, three
hours earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very excited -- I'm happy for the winner,'' he said. Still,
there was a tiny bit of disappointment: ''I was hoping it was me. I
bought a few tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassab, 49, is a former General Motors Corp. assembly line
worker who immigrated to the United States from Iraq 34 years ago
and saved enough to buy the store seven years ago. His sons are
Mark, 27, Marvin, 25, Melvin, 23, and Matthew, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Kassab said his mother answered the phone when a
television station called early this morning. ''She didn't believe
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   George Kassab said he has no idea who bought the winning ticket.
On Tuesday, he said, he sold about 5,000 Big Game tickets compared
with an average of about 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   He said Michigan Lottery officials told him he will get the
maximum $2,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket -- what Gilmer
called ''very fair,'' given the ''enormous amount of publicity''
the store will get.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll just be mobbed,'' Gilmer said. ''Most stores are more
than happy. In essence, they had to push three buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmer said ''the most important winners'' in Michigan were the
state's school fund, which will get $29 million in proceeds from
the jackpot that began nine weeks ago at just $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gonzales was the first customer of the morning at Mr. K's,
arriving around 6:35 a.m. She often buys lottery tickets there, and
quickly checked her six tickets this morning when she heard the
winning ticket was sold there.
</P>
<P>
   News that the winning ticket was sold in her community came as a
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know a lot of people who buy tickets here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaarina Maul stopped by the store this morning to buy snacks and
$10 worth of lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come in every day. My husband woke me up and I kept my
tickets. I didn't win anything. I'm upset he didn't sell it to
me,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   While the drawings are held in Atlanta, results are handled by
the individual state lotteries participating in the Big Game, in
Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 a.m., officials had confirmed that the only winning tickets
were the two sold in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers were one, two, 12, 33 and 37, and the Big
Money Ball number was four. To win, a ticket had to match the five
numbers and the Big Money Ball.
</P>
<P>
   The $366 million jackpot tops the previous American record for a
lottery. That was a $295.7 million Powerball jackpot split by 13
machinists in Westerville, Ohio, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set in December by
Spain's El Gordo lottery, or the Fat One. But that game spreads
itself thin by awarding thousands of prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The odds that a $1 Big Game ticket will have all five winning
numbers and the matching Big Money Ball are one in more than 76
million.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Holland, a bartender at the East Atlanta Restaurant and
Lounge in Georgia, said he knew the odds were stacked against him
when he bought his ticket. The odds of having all five winning
numbers and the Big Money Ball were one in more than 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least I only lost a dollar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others weren't as lucky. Some players plopped down hundreds of
dollars in the hopes of becoming instant millionaires. Others
pooled their money with coworkers and friends to buy more chances.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Lead Steep Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, with technology names
leading the declines as investors punished Cisco Systems despite a
profit report that topped Wall Street's expectations. Buyers were
reluctant to enter the market while they awaited next week's
Federal Reserve meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light, forcing sellers to drop their prices in order
to find buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
123.63 at 10,413.12. The Nasdaq composite index was down 158.32 at
3,426.69.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was off 23.91 at 1,388.23.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco was down 4[ to 58|. After the close of trading Tuesday,
the Internet equipment provider reported net income of $662
million, or 9 cents per share. That beat Wall Street analysts'
expectations by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of Cisco have been out of favor all week after a
story in Barron's magazine said the stock is overvalued and
acquisitions will prove increasingly difficult because of
escalating purchase prices of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Motorola fell 14{ to 90 7/16
after Salomon Smith Barney cut its rating on the stock to
''outperform'' from ''buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks are under pressure because they still have
extremely high valuations,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ''Six months ago, people said it
didn't matter what they cost; you had to own them anyway. Now
there's a sense that what you pay for a stock really does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said investors were shying away from expensive technology
stocks because they fear that rising interest rates will compromise
their rapid growth rates. The Fed is expected to raise rates by as
much as a half-percentage point at its meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of merger talks sparked buying in the paper
sector. Champion International rose 6\ to 72 3/16 after both
International Paper and UPM-Kymmene of Finland raised their bids
for the company. The new IP bid values Champion at about $7.3
billion, and while UPM's bid would be worth about $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly light, continuing a string of quiet sessions
as many market players stay on the sidelines awaiting the Fed's
next move.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the NYSE came to 294.00 million shares, slightly ahead
of Tuesday's pace. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a
7-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 15.11 to
475.75.

<HEADLINE> Visteon To Keep Indiana Plant Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONNERSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Visteon Corp.'s top executive tried to
ease fears of autoworkers here by saying he is committed to keeping
the plant open when the company is spun off from Ford Motor Co. in
late June.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plant isn't going to suffer because of the change,''
Visteon Chairman Peter Pestillo said Tuesday after meeting with
workers in the 3,203-employee plant.
</P>
<P>
   Pestillo recently stepped down as a Ford vice chairman to become
the chairman of Visteon, an auto parts manufacturing arm of Ford.
Pestillo and his senior staff are visiting Visteon plants worldwide
to discuss the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders said many workers fear Ford intends to spin off
Visteon only to shop for components made by suppliers that pay
lower wages -- that has raised concerns the plants could lose
production and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Pestillo said the spinoff could make the 1.7 million-square-foot
plant more dependent on the international auto market.
</P>
<P>
   He said Visteon is trying to win new business from Volkswagen AG
and other international automakers. Automotive heating and cooling
components made at the Connersville plant could wind up in VWs
overseas if Visteon lands the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to have an aggressive sales mentality rather than a
service mentality,'' Pestillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Visteon operates two other Indiana plants -- a steering assembly
plant in Indianapolis that employs 2,893 and a Bedford components
plant employing 1,164.

<HEADLINE> Bayer May Settle Drug Pricing Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- German pharmaceutical company Bayer AG confirmed
today it has begun settlement talks with state and federal
officials over allegations it overbilled for years for some drugs
covered under Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   A Bayer spokeswoman said the company has opened settlement talks
with the U.S. Justice Department, the Inspector General's office of
the Department of Health and Human Services, and several state
prosecutors who jointly are pursuing the case.
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to reach a settlement with Bayer in the
hope of prodding other drug companies to seek similar agreements
that would bring about more-accurate pricing practices, according
to a story published in today's Wall Street Journal. Others under
scrutiny included Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,
Glaxo Wellcome PLC's U.S. unit, and SmithKline Beecham PLC, the
Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce Committee also is investigating, and sent
letters last Friday to seven companies requesting detailed records
on the pricing of certain drugs, including SmithKline's Kytril,
Baxter International Inc.'s Gammagard, and Glaxo Wellcome's Zofran.
Other companies that were sent letters included TAP Pharmacautics,
Day Laboratories, Aventis Behring and Warrick Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has asked the drug firms to respond by May 26.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the inquiries is a practice that allows doctors and
other medical providers to bill Medicare and Medicaid for more than
they actually pay for some drugs and keep the difference. The
medical providers can do that because the government health
insurance programs reimburse them based on the drugs' average
wholesale price set by the companies. But the companies often sell
the drugs to suppliers at deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare is the federal health insurance program for the
elderly. Medicaid is the state-federal health insurance program for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayer spokeswoman said representatives from the company's
West Haven,.Conn-based Bayer Pharmaceuticals division have met with
the government officials, most recently on May 1, and discussions
are continuing.

<HEADLINE> Shakespeare Co. Offers Regal Fare  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Don Carlos, an impetuous young prince, must
compete with his fearsome father, King Philip II of Spain, for the
affections of the woman who has been made queen.
</P>
<P>
   The plot echoes ''Hamlet'': Both plays share a level of
conspiratorial intrigue that is rare indeed. But there's a twist:
In ''Don Carlos,'' it's the boy's stepmother, not his mother, who
excites the young man's ardor.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as the new Royal Shakespeare Company staging of ''Don
Carlos'' proves, Friedrich's Schiller's 1787 play -- done well -- has
its own power to entertain and excite, as American theatergoers
will discover later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The German Expressionist classic is infrequently staged in
England, let alone in the United States, but it is by no means the
only talking point of the collective show that the RSC -- one of
Britain's two largest state-funded theater troupes -- is taking on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   After some years of mixed fortunes, the RSC is now thought to be
on a roll. On its home turf, several productions are selling out
and receiving critical acclaim and even the occasional standing
ovation, which is a rarity in England.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, no fewer than five of these shows will
be testing the waters abroad. The transatlantic traffic marks the
decades-old company's largest simultaneous presence in the United
States to date.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to Kelsey Grammer, the theater-trained TV
star who tackles Macbeth on Broadway this summer, his Thane of
Cawdor is unlikely to better Antony Sher's fiery and frightening
star turn in the role for the RSC.
</P>
<P>
   That staging, directed by Gregory Doran (Sher's real-life
partner), plays the International Festival of Arts and Ideas in New
Haven, Conn., June 15-24. A subsequent Broadway run isn't out of
the question. (If New York can play host to two ''Wild Party''
musicals in one season, why not two versions of ''Macbeth'' the
next?)
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the production is on view through June 3 at
London's Young Vic Theater. There, audiences are proclaiming Sher
and co-star Harriet Walter as the finest inhabitants of the
murderous roles since Ian McKellen and Judi Dench trod the boards
together over 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Headed further west is director Lindsay Posner's touring
production of ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' which reaches San
Francisco's Herbst Theater June 22-July 2 as part of the city's
Shakespeare Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart McQuarrie plays Petruchio, the none-too-subtle
domesticator of Katharina (Monica Dolan), the ''shrew'' who is
eventually -- if sometimes violently -- ''tamed.''
</P>
<P>
   But is there life still to be found in a play in which, or so it
seems, women exist merely to be put in their place?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the ideal play in terms of sparking debate about sexual
politics,'' Posner says. ''It's about power and empowerment and
abuse within those terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ''The Taming of the Shrew'' is an enduring play and
the most enduring plays don't date; they merely reveal different
shadings and hues over time.
</P>
<P>
   That's one way of accounting for the phenomenal impact of the
RSC revival of ''The Family Reunion,'' T S. Eliot's eerie 1939 play
that is one of three RSC productions now playing at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music. (''The Family Reunion'' debuted Wednesday and the
production runs through Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an extraordinary satire on the one hand, an extraordinary
post-Freudian drama on the other,'' says director Adrian Noble,
whose staging may remind New York theatergoers that Eliot did more
than just provide source material for the musical ''Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Margaret Tyzack, a Broadway Tony-winner for
her role in ''Lettice and Lovage,'' as the ailing matriarch of a
family of country swells and Greg Hicks as her errant son.
</P>
<P>
   Also headed for BAM is ''Don Carlos,'' which looks set to make a
star out of its dashing and talented leading man, Rupert
Penry-Jones. The 29-year-old actor's matinee idol good looks
couldn't be further from the part's disfigured 16th-century
prototype, who died at age 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''This seems to have done my career a lot of good,'' Penry-Jones
says of ''Don Carlos,'' speaking before a performance of an
inferior RSC production, ''Timon of Athens,'' which is not leaving
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a heavyweight part,'' Penry-Jones says. ''I feel like I'm
up there with the other guys playing the big classical roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing the BAM trio is one of Shakespeare's best-loved
plays, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' in a notably saucy new
production from Michael Boyd. This version leaves no doubt about
the precise nature of the intimacy between Bottom and the fairy
queen Titania, while its conclusion is one of the RSC's more joyous
of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, says Noble, who is also the Company's artistic
director, it's hard to lose when you're working with Shakespeare.

<HEADLINE> Three in Family Are Conductors  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Neeme Jarvi's two sons went into the family
business. And it keeps them thousands of miles -- often continents --
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Like their father, Paavo and Kristjan Jarvi are conductors,
making the Jarvis the only family threesome waving batons in front
of classical musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Neeme, 62, is music director of the Detroit Symphony and
principal conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony in Sweden; Paavo,
37, will become music director of the Cincinnati Symphony in fall
2001; and Kristjan, 27, is assistant conductor of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, and founder and music director of the contemporary
Absolute Ensemble in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should see our phone bills!'' says Paavo.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Neeme was conducting ''Carmen'' in Paris while Paavo
was debuting with Italy's La Scala Orchestra and Kristjan's
Absolute Ensemble was playing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But they remain close, talking often with each other and with
Liilia, Paavo's and Kristjan's mother, and their sister Maarika, a
flutist in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The Jarvis emigrated to America in 1980 from Tallinn, Estonia,
each with two suitcases and $100. They became American citizens in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Neeme stays the busiest. After a recent American tour with the
Gothenburg Symphony, he went to the Bastille Opera in Paris for 10
performances of ''Carmen,'' and in between conducted other opera
and symphonies in Paris. He also went for three days to Estonia,
now accessible again after the Soviet breakup.
</P>
<P>
   He once met a taxi driver in Tokyo who said he had ''no day
off,'' and since then he has liked to think of himself as a ''no
day off'' conductor.
</P>
<P>
   His sons have absorbed his energy, enthusiasm and delight in
conducting -- though not yet his jammed schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father is a complete workaholic,'' Kristjan Jarvi says. ''I
think he doesn't consider it work. He is just, in his way, having
fun. Look at his recordings: He's the most recorded conductor there
is. It's usually composers you never heard of. For him it's like
exploration, like going into the Amazon jungle with a machete. I
think his whole life is an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeme Jarvi has made almost 350 CDs, most with the Scottish
National Orchestra and Gothenberg Symphony, for two foreign record
companies that like live performances and little-known works.
</P>
<P>
   Paavo Jarvi says his father ''has a music library at home that
puts most large libraries to shame. He's constantly doing premieres
and old pieces that haven't been heard in hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeme Jarvi's parents were amateur musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father would say, 'Come here. Listen. What piece is
that?''' he recalls. ''I'd say, 'Some kind of Glazunov.' 'You are
right. Now you can go.''' He continued that game with his own
children.
</P>
<P>
   Neeme's older brother Vallo became a professional musician,
playing xylophone and guitar and conducting. Neeme studied in
Leningrad, then returned to Estonia's Radio Orchestra and the
Tallinn Opera, where he met young composer Arvo Part and started
playing his music, which he still champions.
</P>
<P>
   He entered a conducting competition in Rome at age 38 and won.
It made him a hero in his small country; two orchestras met him at
the airport on his return, playing the triumphal march from
''Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, however, he ran afoul of the authorities when
he conducted the Estonian State Orchestra and a choir in Part's
''Credo,'' which has a biblical text. ''It was a big scandal. A lot
of people were sacked from their positions. I finally find out we
have to escape that country and Communist ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Paavo Jarvi says he never thought of becoming anything but a
conductor. ''By the time we were conscious of what we were doing,
it was too late to turn back,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Paavo, who came to America at age 17, envies his father's first
20 years as a conductor, making mistakes and learning in an
isolated country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conducting is sort of the second half of your life's
profession,'' Paavo says. ''Before 50, nobody is a conductor.
Everything you do then is preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think conducting is sort of witchcraft. It's not really
something you can go to school and learn. Conductors, I think, are
born. It is also a craft where one needs a mentor to guide and
advise. In that way having a father as a conductor was tremendously
valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago he completed stints as principal guest conductor with
the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic and the City of Birmingham
Symphony in England. When he first went to Cincinnati, Paavo says,
he felt good chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something really basic was working well. And I like the
acoustics of that hall. The orchestra has been under very good
leadership for a long time: Jesus Lopez-Cobos. All those things
made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   While he waits to start his job there, he recently made his
debut at La Scala and, unexpectedly, with the Berlin Philharmonic,
when Daniel Barenboim got sick. He conducted an original
instruments ensemble in London. And this summer, with James Levine,
Zubin Mehta and Yuri Temirkanov, he will conduct at a festival in
Switzerland and lead the festival orchestra's world tour.
</P>
<P>
   Kristjan Jarvi, meanwhile, finds his musical identity in the
Absolute Ensemble. He wears a red shirt and black pants to conduct
the 18-piece group, which he says plays ''weird transcriptions of
regular stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Splitting his time between Absolute, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic and guest conducting in Europe, makes him a better
conductor, he says.
</P>
<P>
   At a March concert in New York, Mahler's ''Fourth Symphony'' was
played by 12 Absolute musicians, using a synthesizer and no horns.
The arrangement was made around 1920 by a student of Schoenberg's,
with the synthesizer part written for a harmonium.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking the furniture from a yellow room and putting it
into a green room and seeing how it fits. We're about creativity,
musicality and self-expression,'' says Kristjan. ''We try to create
an atmosphere with music, lighting and setting.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should have fun when they go to hear music,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: the Holocaust  </HEADLINE>
By TERRENCE PETTY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- It was a rare and astonishing sight in
Nazi Germany -- a public protest by Germans against the Holocaust.
And its outcome persuasively challenges an argument used by Germans
since the end of World War II: resistance to Hitler would have been
futile.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 27, 1943, about 200 German women married to Jewish men
who had been rounded up for the gas chambers stood on Berlin's
Rosenstrasse shouting, ''Give us back our husbands!'' The
demonstration grew to more than 1,000 over the next few days, and
the protesters ignored demands by armed SS and Gestapo men that
they disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Hitler relented. Fearing the protest could turn
public opinion against the regime, the Nazis released 1,700 Jews
who were married to Germans -- while continuing to send other Jews
to join those who were being killed in death mills like Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   This extraordinary episode -- the only open demonstration in
Germany against the deportation of Jews during the Holocaust -- is
recounted in a new book by Eric A. Johnson, ''Nazi Terror: The
Gestapo, Jews, and Ordinary Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson uses the protest to buttress a central theme of his
book: Ordinary Germans who lived during the Third Reich years are
wrong when they argue it would have been futile for them to rise up
against Hitler, or to at least protest his terror.
</P>
<P>
   There is no certainty that mass protests against Nazi policies
would have ''shut down'' the Third Reich, says Johnson, a professor
of history at Central Michigan University.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Johnson writes that ''had the silence been broken
... millions of Jews might not have died.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson does not attribute ordinary Germans' wartime acceptance
of mass murders to an ''eliminationist anti-Semitism,'' as does
Daniel Goldhagen in his controversial book, ''Hitler's Willing
Executioners.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true, writes Johnson, that ordinary Germans were guilty of
complicity in Nazi crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But he continues, ''It is also necessary to realize that most
Germans were motivated not by a willful intent to harm others but
by a mixture of cowardice, apathy and a slavish obedience to
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Allied troops walked into concentration camps and
found emaciated prisoners and cadavers 55 years ago, the world has
been trying to understand how Germans could have allowed Hitler to
kill 6 million Jews and other victims.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Germany gave us Beethoven, Bach and Wagner. How could
evil emanate from a land blessed with such a glorious cultural
heritage?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is the latest to try to understand this contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he has not nailed down the final answers. Nonetheless,
his new book gives insight into Hitler's 12-year dictatorship.
Indeed, a number of critics have proclaimed ''Nazi Terror'' to be a
benchmark work in Third Reich studies.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's recounting of the 1943 Rosenstrasse protest in Berlin
is more or less an aside in his 636-page scholarly work, which is
published by Basic Books. It was also written about in a 1996 book
by Nathan Stolzfus, although most people have probably not heard
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Johnson's book -- and what makes it original -- are
chapters in which he examines the Gestapo, Hitler's secret police,
and those in which he writes about how Germans had little to fear
from Nazi repression so long as they weren't Jewish, Communists,
Jehovah's witnesses, homosexuals and others hated by Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson read more than 1,100 files that had been kept by the
Gestapo and by Nazi courts in three Rhineland communities -- the
city of Cologne, the town of Krefeld, and the small town of
Bergheim.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he interviewed perpetrators of Nazi crimes and
Jewish survivors.
</P>
<P>
   There's Emanuel Schaefer, the Gestapo's commanding officer in
Cologne who oversaw the deportation of thousands of Jews from that
city to death camps. Before arriving in Cologne, he had rapidly
risen through the ranks of Nazi spy and storm trooper
organizations. Schaefer, writes Johnson, had a large personal role
in starting World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The war began shortly after Germany accused Polish troops of
attacking a German radio transmitter along the border. In fact,
Hitler had sent storm troopers -- dressed in Polish uniforms -- to
stage the raid themselves to create a pretext for invading Poland.
And it was Schaefer, says Johnson, who was handpicked by Hitler to
lead the storm troopers in their staged attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson's book, readers also meet lower-ranking Gestapo
officers, like Richard Schulenberg, head of the Gestapo's ''Jewish
desk'' in Krefeld. Schulenberg was responsible for arranging the
deportation of Krefeld's Jews. One day, writes Johnson, Schulenberg
rode a Jewish woman on the handlebars of his bicycle to a
collection point where Jews were being taken before being shipped
off to the Theresienstadt concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson uses the likes of Schaefer and Schulenberg to reject
what he says is a recent trend in Third Reich studies: to view the
Gestapo as ''normal police officers'' who were reliant on
denunciations from the populace to carry out their dirty work. This
view, writes Johnson, ''underestimates the ruthless effectiveness
of the Gestapo.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, only certain kinds of people really had reason to fear
the Gestapo -- those viewed by Hitler as subhuman or his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Germans would occasionally do things that violated Third Reich
edicts, such as telling anti-Nazi jokes and listening to
German-language BBC radio broadcasts, which informed them about the
murder of Jews and about the war. But the Nazis showed leniency
toward such crimes, so long as they were committed by ordinary
Germans, and not by someone in groups targeted by Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sees in this a ''Faustian bargain,'' with the Gestapo
permitting minor expressions of opposition from the populace in
exchange for Germans' silence about the murder of Nazi victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nazi terror posed no real threat to most ordinary Germans,''
Johnson argues.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson disagrees with Goldhagen that ordinary Germans
were animated by an ''eliminationist anti-Semitism,'' he still
holds them culpable for Hitler's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also castigates German clerics who were too cowardly to
encourage their congregations to oppose Hitler, and praises the few
who did dare to stand up to him, such as German Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ends his book with a chilling encounter that perhaps
expresses the feelings of some Germans who eagerly served under
Hitler and now are trying to come to terms with that in their
twilight years.
</P>
<P>
   In his last interview before leaving Germany after five years of
research for his book, Johnson went to the Cologne apartment of an
88-year-old man. The man surprised Johnson by admitting he had been
a guard at the Dachau concentration camp and a member of the
auxiliary SS.
</P>
<P>
   ''He enjoyed telling me about his past,'' writes Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But the man became somber while relating that his six-man SS
detachment had shot 300 Jewish women and children on the eastern
front. He told Johnson the most horrible part was ''wading among
the bodies in the ditch with the other members of his detachment to
administer ''mercy shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times the man got up from his couch and went over to
Johnson to point to the middle of his calf muscle to show how deep
the blood had been.
</P>
<P>
   And each time the elderly man repeated: ''Can you imagine? Can
you imagine?''

<HEADLINE> Kevin Spacey Feared Typecasting  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Even with one Oscar behind him, Kevin Spacey
felt backed in a corner where Hollywood would come looking only
when it needed the sort of sinister, lunatic-fringe type the actor
was known for.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time he won the supporting-actor Oscar for 1995's
''The Usual Suspects,'' Spacey embarked on a methodical voyage to
remake his career and the kinds of roles he could land.
</P>
<P>
   He feared he'd become typecast as a dark knight of the soul by
such roles as the diabolical serial killer in ''Seven'' or Verbal
Kint, the gimpy, fast-talking hoodlum in ''Usual Suspects,'' who
turns out to be the most menacing of puppetmasters.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey gravitated to more nuanced roles, more fully human
characters: a corrupt cop in ''L.A. Confidential,'' a charming
socialite tried for murder in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and
Evil,'' an expert hostage mediator in ''The Negotiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Capping Spacey's reinvention of himself was his second Oscar,
the best-actor honor for his take on Lester Burnham, a bumbling
family man elevated to a state of grace through the oddest of
mid-life crises in ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I came out of 1995 with a real sense that a very deep and dark
impression had been laid on me as an actor,'' Spacey, 40, said in
an interview to promote his new film, ''The Big Kahuna.''
</P>
<P>
   ''So I went on a little journey to play roles that were less
black and white, more gray, more ambiguous, with a sort of moral
shifting ground. I was trying to lead myself toward the kind of
characters I've more often played in the theater, which are very
close to Lester Burnham and very close to Larry,'' the cynical yet
honorable salesman Spacey plays in the new movie.
</P>
<P>
   Co-starring Danny DeVito and Peter Facinelli, ''Big Kahuna'' is
a dialogue-driven character piece confined almost entirely to a
hotel suite, where three hapless industrial-lubricant salesmen hope
to land a critical but elusive customer.
</P>
<P>
   The movie opened in New York City and Los Angeles last month and
expands to more cities this weekend. It's based on the play
''Hospitality Suite'' by Roger Rueff, who also wrote the
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey first read ''Hospitality Suite'' in 1991, and did a
staged reading of it in New York that helped land an agent for
Rueff, a chemical engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The play had several stage productions, but Spacey and theater
director John Swanbeck knew they wanted to collaborate themselves
on the story. Spacey's busy schedule made a stage version unlikely,
so they decided to make the project the debut of Spacey's movie
company, Trigger St. Productions, with Swanbeck directing.
</P>
<P>
   The shoot came together in a hurry. Spacey had just finished
''American Beauty'' and had a few days before beginning rehearsals
for the New York run of ''The Iceman Cometh'' last year. Since he
had done the play in London, Spacey figured he could duck out early
on rehearsals and shoot the film at night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iceman'' director Howard Davies agreed to cut him loose early
during the first couple weeks of rehearsal, and the $1.8 million
''Big Kahuna'' was shot in just 16 days.
</P>
<P>
   It helped having a cloistered set -- basically three guys in a
room talking, with just a few street and corridor scenes and a few
fantasy sequences requiring a roomful of extras.
</P>
<P>
   Though Spacey, DeVito and Facinelli play a marketing team, the
story puts them at sharp ideological odds. Spacey's Larry talks
trash and is quick to criticize Phil (DeVito) for renting a
''hospitality closet'' with carrot sticks for hors d'oeuvres, and
the youthful Bob (Facinelli) for his dogmatic religious zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ought to apply for sainthood,'' Larry tells Bob. ''The
competition's not as stiff as it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike salesmanship tales such as ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' and
''Death of a Salesmen,'' in which ruthlessness rules, ''Big
Kahuna'' evolves into a bittersweet story of friendship. Phil,
disheartened by divorce and disillusioned over missed
opportunities, bares his soul and elicits surprising compassion
from the abrasive Larry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm suddenly very conscious of the lateness of things,'' Larry
says, as much to himself as to the others, after the facades of all
three men have fallen away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I actually began to view the piece as one man at three
different stages in his life,'' Spacey said. ''You could absolutely
understand that the very questions Bob thinks he's answered
concretely are the very questions that Larry doesn't want to get
close to and that Phil finally needs to get back to in his life.
You could very easily see that they could walk in each other's
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a smallish film, but Spacey's Oscar win might draw
moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the movie won't be impaired by the fact that people
might want me to go away for awhile,'' he says, ''and I promise I
am going away for awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey's taking time off at least till fall after wrapping
production on his next film, ''Pay It Forward.'' The drama casts
him as a teacher severely burned as a child who makes an unusual
connection with a student (Haley Joel Osment) and the boy's mother
(Helen Hunt). The movie is due in theaters this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, Spacey is scheduled to begin work on ''The
Shipping News,'' based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by E.
Annie Proulx.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to produce more movies, particularly
independent features to showcase new talent, as ''Big Kahuna'' did
for Facinelli, Swanbeck and Rueff.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, the point of having a production company is to be able
to give opportunities to those who haven't had them before, and
step back and let them run with the ball,'' Spacey said. ''If it
were not for people who stepped forward and gave me opportunities
at a time when I had not proved myself at all, believe me, I would
not have a career.''

   Selected new releases:

<P>
   ''Fair Weather'' (Compass) -- Alison Brown
</P>
<P>
   Alison Brown is a major talent on the banjo who, like Bela
Fleck, pushes the instrument into places it rarely goes. Brown has
ventured into jazz and even world music on previous albums. Her
excellent new disc, ''Fair Weather,'' represents a return to her
bluegrass roots. It's melodic and fluid, occasionally lovely and
frequently surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has assembled a crack supporting cast for ''Fair Weather''
and it shows in the excellent playing, which ranges from
straight-ahead, traditional bluegrass to a more modern ''newgrass''
style. She also harnessed guest vocalists for some interesting
covers, including a wonderful bluegrass version of Elvis Costello's
''Every Day I Write the Book.''

</P>
<P>
   ''Tanto Tempo'' (Six Degrees) -- Bebel Gilberto
</P>
<P>
   On ''Tanto Tempo,'' Bebel Gilberto gently updates the bossa nova
sound her father, Joao Gilberto, helped make famous. It's a lovely
album, understated and sensuous, as romantic as a summer rainstorm
enjoyed from a porch swing. Although she occasionally ventures into
trip-hop grooves and orchestration, this is still very much a bossa
nova album, hushed and restrained but simmering with passion
underneath. Gilberto has a famous last name, but deserves to be
judged -- and enjoyed -- in her own right.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ''Real Time'' (Howdy Skies) -- Tim O'Brien and Darrell Scott
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever sat around a living room or porch while a couple
of excellent musicians had a blast playing together, you've got an
idea of how much fun ''Real Time'' is. The album was recorded in
Scott's living room and the production has an almost live feel to
it. What sets it apart from most living-room jam sessions is that
these are two of the finest musicians on the acoustic scene,
top-notch multi-instumentalists and songwriters. Through nine
originals, two traditional songs and two Hank Williams covers, what
comes through is this duo's passion for American roots music and
talent at playing it.

<HEADLINE> Spacey Offers Lesson on DeVito  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Spacey applied hardball marketing
tactics to land Danny DeVito as co-star in his new movie about
salesmen, ''The Big Kahuna.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I lied to him, actually,'' Spacey said, describing the
scramble to replace an actor initially cast opposite Spacey and
Peter Facinelli, who play a three-man sales team at a convention.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey called DeVito on a Friday early last year for a shoot
that was beginning the next week. ''I told him the role had been
specifically written for him, and he was really impressed. He said,
'Wow, that doesn't happen all that often.'''
</P>
<P>
   DeVito asked when production would start, figuring ''I was going
to say next year some time,'' Spacey said. ''I told him, actually,
funnily enough, we're going to begin shooting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Wait a minute, let me just back up a sec, Kev. A
role that was specifically written for me, you're beginning to
shoot on Tuesday, and this is the first call I'm getting?'
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Well, it should have been written for you is what I
meant to say.' He said, 'Great, the next time I have a part for
somebody lying and conniving, I'm going to give you a call.'
</P>
<P>
   ''But he read the material that night, he fell madly in love
with it, he was on a plane two days later and filming with us on
Tuesday.''

   SEATTLE (AP) -- In his young, in-your-face career, Sherman Alexie
has taken on men and women, whites and Indians, academics and
fellow authors. But on this day, before some 200 students and
teachers at North Seattle Community College, he's having it out
with his own poster.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   SHERMAN ALEXIE:
</P>
<P>
   Writer.
</P>
<P>
   Storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Politician.
</P>
<P>
   Activist.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   That first one he'll go along with. Yes, he's a writer. The
second one, storyteller, is a myth, a stereotype, the folksy Indian
passing on tribal wisdom. Gimme a break.
</P>
<P>
   The third doesn't work because he doesn't claim to speak for
anybody. The fourth is kind of sweet but an ambassador is supposed
to be nice. Not Sherman. The fifth is ridiculous; he's too honest.
The last he'll consider, but don't call him after hours.
</P>
<P>
   The auditorium is small, crowded and open to a hallway on one
side, where passers-by occasionally stop and join the laughter. The
people love Alexie. You expect the author to talk about books, but
he wants to talk about everything -- everything! -- except books. He
sounds off about sex (loves it), Republicans (hates them), Jesus
(''a liberal''), white people (''crimson necked,'' ''pigment
challenged''), Indians (horny guys), life (a tough gig).
</P>
<P>
   It's a performance, a writer playing off the idea of a writer,
and an Indian playing off the idea of an Indian. He strikes
statuesque poses, easy when you're 6 feet 2 inches, with a thick,
handsome build, like a prime block of marble. ''I must speak
slowly,'' he says at one point, his voice deepening, Tonto style.
''I must always look off into the distance, as if receiving a
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 33, Alexie has fallen into the long-running
job/privilege/burden of playing Sherman Alexie. The acclaimed
author of four works of fiction and several volumes of poetry, he
has more than half a million books in print. Last year, he was
named by The New Yorker as one of the best writers under 40. He's
also the principal creator of ''Smoke Signals,'' the first major
feature film to be written, directed, produced and acted by
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a commodity,'' he likes to say. Alexie has a business
card, an office, an office assistant, a fan club, a Web site, a
schedule board. He's a bad boy with nice clothes (today, a gray
microfiber shirt and black jeans), an overachiever who brags he's
the first Indian to move into a white neighborhood and actually
raise real estate values.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a certain injustice in what I do,'' Alexie observes
later. ''I'm a celebrity who's an Indian who's mad at the world
who's making money off being mad at the world. Where do you go with
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie's works include ''Indian Killer'' and ''Reservation
Blues,'' both novels; ''The Business of Fancydancing,'' which
includes poems and stories; and the story collection ''The Lone
Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.'' His most recent publication
is another book of stories, ''The Toughest Indian in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, especially since the release of ''Smoke
Signals,'' he has emerged as the Indian writer most sought after to
give readings, speak on campuses or appear on a panel. He's
attractive, quick-witted, and, not always to his benefit, direct.
As one of his characters puts it, ''confrontational banter'' is a
veritable flag of indigenous culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loves giving people new ideas, but sometimes he's more
confrontational than tactful about it,'' says Thom Chambliss,
executive director of the Pacific Northwest Booksellers
Association, for which Alexie has appeared at several events.
</P>
<P>
   At this morning's talk, Alexie criticizes the late mother of
Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy who became the center of an
international custody fight. Alexie wonders how she could just put
her kid on a raft in the ocean. A woman in the back row objects.
She's Asian, a boat person, and she's in tears. Her own mother
risked her family's lives to get them to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''That comment was bad,'' the woman says.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I offended you I'm sorry,'' Alexie responds. ''But that's
how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   More often, however, Alexie has the gift of making admirers out
of the people he insults. He tells the audience about sharing a
televised panel with President Clinton on race relations. During
the broadcast Clinton mentioned that his grandmother was Cherokee.
Alexie replied that white people were always telling him their
relatives were Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering later, Clinton walked right up to Alexie and
placed his big hands on the author's solid shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The president told him he was funny.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Will that cell phone ever ring?
</P>
<P>
   Alexie drives through Seattle in his rented Buick (the old car
died), down hills as steep as water slides. He's waiting for word
on a film project, and if nature's an omen, the author has a deal.
For the first time in days the sun is out, as if the sky just
finally ran dry. Look up and all you see is the biggest, brightest
blue, not a bad color when the future is on your mind.
</P>
<P>
   He has a lunch meeting at the Painted Table, a quiet,
lounge-like hotel restaurant where the paint you really notice is
the modernist swirls on the plates. Arriving shortly after Alexie
are two film producers and a soundtrack composer. They were all
part of the ''Smoke Signals'' team and they now await the ''green
light'' from Miramax Films for his next project, a screen version
of ''Reservation Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Over salmon burgers, they talk about the proposed movie, the
story of an Indian rock 'n' roll band. Alexie already has an idea
for the trailer: Two Indians, the leads in ''Smoke Signals,'' meet
Christopher Columbus when his ships first arrive and shoot him
dead. One turns to the camera and says: ''Gee, Victor, imagine if
we had tougher immigration laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours go by and the call doesn't come. Alexie thinks it
never will. The producers smile; they've heard this before. They
joke that he quits the movies every day only to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The author recalls a night last fall at the University of
Minnesota. He had gone there for a reading and the program included
a screening of ''Smoke Signals,'' which came out in 1998. All was
well until the sound suddenly went dead.
</P>
<P>
   The audience, with near-scriptural faith to the screenplay,
proceeded to fill in the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why I'm still doing this,'' Alexie says.
</P>
<P>
   There's a show biz angle as well. When the author saw John
Irving pick up an Academy Award for his own adaptation of ''The
Cider House Rules,'' he reacted like the honest man he wants to be:
He was jealous. He wants the prizes, the fame, the applause. Having
more than the average writer doesn't mean Alexie has enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just as insecure as any other artist,'' he says. ''I like
the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie once seemed fated for nothing but early death. A Spokane
Indian raised on a reservation about 50 miles from the Washington
city, he was born hydrocephalic, with water on the brain. At six
months, he underwent surgery and wasn't expected to live. When he
did survive, doctors predicted he would be severely retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he became a prodigy. By age 2 he could read and by
kindergarten he had completed (if not understood) ''The Grapes of
Wrath.'' In high school, he was prom king and captain of the
basketball team. He was also the only Indian.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to a white, Christian high school and I really had to
wear a lot of masks,'' he says. ''I remember people saying things
like, 'He doesn't care what other people think.' ... I guess people
didn't realize how much of an actor I was.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be successful, I had to be better than everyone else at
everything. I worked myself into the ground. I was working 19 hours
a day. It was my job to be popular and successful.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   It's 3 p.m. and Alexie is seated at a small kitchen table in his
office, an attic flat just off the main road in central Seattle and
a short drive from the house he shares with his wife Diane and
3-year-old son Joseph. The walls are covered by ''Smoke Signals''
posters, framed magazine covers and book jackets. An assistant
works in the other room.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie, who already has had a cappuccino and a 20-ounce latte,
drinks from a can of Diet Pepsi. He talks fast and laughs hard. He
has long boasted of an immunity from writer's block and appears
spared from talker's block as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sherman brings a real strong energy and language to Indian
literature and that energy was needed,'' says James Welch, author
of such acclaimed novels as ''Winter in the Blood'' and ''Fools
Crow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Before Sherman, Indian literature was a bit on the sober side,
including my own writing. There were certain themes being played
out again and again -- going out into the world and coming, the
culture clash. These themes were valid, but we maybe took it a
little too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie writes as much about pop culture as about Indian culture.
His characters play basketball, watch television and listen to rock
'n' roll. One early story is called ''Because My Father Always Said
He Was the Only Indian Who Saw Jimi Hendrix Play the Star-Spangled
Banner at Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   Like William Faulkner, Alexie documents a community on the
losing side of a war, people whose pasts are so much larger than
the present. The humor is survivor's humor, bitter but resilient.
In the ''Lone Ranger'' collection, an Indian boy is diagnosed as
being a slow developer. ''They've been saying that about Indians
for five hundred years,'' Alexie writes.
</P>
<P>
   But the author has been criticized for spending too much time on
the ''negative'' side of reservation life. ''He always seems to
write about family battering, drinking and long-haired, shaggy,
dirty Indians,'' complains Vernon Bellcourt, an official with the
American Indian Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie's response is that he simply describes what he's
observed. The author wishes there had been a Sherman Alexie when he
was kid, a successful, sober Indian (he's an alcoholic, clean for
10 years) whose best weapon was his imagination. A line by the
Indian poet Adrian Louis turned him on to writing: ''O, Uncle
Adrian, I'm in the reservation of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie wants to share what he's learned, to spread the good
news. Young people don't just talk to him about books, but about
their lives. His friend and fellow author, Craig Leslie, recalled
the time Alexie spoke to some ''at risk'' teen-agers at a community
college in Oregon City, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the talk was over he sat down with these kids and talked
to them for an hour,'' Leslie said. ''Before it was over, he had
won them all over. It was a wonderful connection he established.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie can be cynical about changing the world, but he does his
best to change how Indians are perceived in the world. His great
crusade is for the right of Indians to be portrayed as they are and
not as whites -- well-meaning or otherwise -- want them to be. He
believes Indians are still romanticized, simplified. At worst,
they're bloody savages. At best, wise men in beads.
</P>
<P>
   The most common villains in his books are not soldiers or
cowboys, but whites who claim expertise about Indians. In ''Indian
Killer,'' a 1996 novel, one unsympathetic character is a white
professor who teaches a class on Indian literature. In ''Dear John
Wayne,'' a story from his new collection, an Indian woman warns an
anthropologist: ''You've colonized Indian land but I'm not about to
let you colonize my heart and mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie also has attacked fellow writers, including such best
sellers as Barbara Kingsolver and Tony Hillerman. A recent target
is Ian Frazier, a highly regarded author whose latest book, ''On
the Rez,'' tells of his time with the Oglala Sioux on the Pine
Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ''(H)e is ... guilty of objectifying the entire Oglala Nation,''
Alexie wrote in a recent review for the Los Angeles Times. ''He
admires the Oglalas because of who he believes them to be, not
because of who the Oglalas believe themselves to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Half-kiddingly, Alexie calls for a 10-year moratorium on whites
writing about Indians, just to give Indians a chance to catch up.
Even among Indians this is not a universal desire. Both Welch and
fellow author N. Scott Momaday said that anyone should be allowed
to write about anything. Both writers also defended Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read Ian Frazier's book and I think very well of it. I think
Frazier knows a good deal about Indians,'' said Momaday, winner of
a Pulitzer Prize in 1969 for the novel ''House Made of Dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If a person spends as much time around a group of people as
Frazier did,'' Welch added, ''he will obviously observe things and
get to know people. And I don't think he would profess to know more
about Indians than he really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie's standards are highest for himself. He wants no distance
between his life and his work, a tough call when you get paid to
make things up. Like Alexie, his characters have moved from the
reservation to the city. They're making more money these days. In
the story ''Assimilation,'' a woman wryly includes herself among
the ''twenty-two American Indians who had ever felt even a moment
of privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   If Alexie were to write a piece about today, it would end like
this: Successful young Indian learns from assistant that his new
book got a good review from Publishers Weekly. After finishing an
interview, he picks up the phone, calls his wife and reads her
every word.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Smoke Signals,'' written by Sherman Alexie and released in
1998, was the first major feature film to be made entirely by
American Indians. In a recent interview, Alexie named five favorite
(excepting ''Smoke Signals, which he would have included) and five
least favorite movies/television shows/pop culture images. Because
Alexie didn't give specific rankings, listings are in alphabetical
order.
</P>
<P>
The Best
</P>
<P>
   --''Exiles'' (1961): ''I saw this once when I was in Boston. I
don't think it was ever released and I don't know much about it.
It's about Indians being relocated from the reservation to Los
Angeles. It's all improvised, and shot beautifully in black and
white. It has stuff I still haven't seen in other films. There's a
scene where one Indian guy is shaving another Indian guy -- just a
tender moment like that.''
</P>
<P>
   --''Heat'' (1995): Michael Mann's crime thriller starred Al
Pacino and Robert De Niro, but also featured the Indian actor Wes
Studi. ''Wes looks very Indian, but it was never the point of his
character. He was just a cop. That kind of casting made me very
happy. It was a great movie.''
</P>
<P>
   --''Little Big Man'' (1970): Dustin Hoffman starred as the
121-year-old who claims to have been adopted by Indians. Co-star
Chief Dan George received an Oscar nomination for best supporting
actor. ''Chief Dan George's performance has the combination of
absolute irreverence and the aura of magic. It's a stereotypical
role, the Indian grandfather, but Dan George elevates it to
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   --''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' (1975): The Academy
Award-winning adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel about an insane
asylum. ''I love this movie. They changed it a bit from the novel,
but I still think the Indian was the hero.''
</P>
<P>
   --''Soldier Blue'' (1970): Candice Bergen starred in this
antiracist Western about the 1864 Sand Creek Indian massacre.
''It's really good in its way. Some films like this are amazingly
self-congratulatory, but this one didn't do any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
The Worst
</P>
<P>
   --''Dances With Wolves'' (1991): Kevin Costner's Academy Award
winner about a Civil War officer transformed by his friendship with
the Sioux Indians. ''As great the movie is -- technically,
artistically -- it's just so much wish fulfillment and so much
revision of history. It does a historical disservice. 'Dances With
Wolves' would have been a great movie if the cavalry had caught
him.''
</P>
<P>
   --''F Troop'': ''It was 12 Sambos running around. 'F Troop' and
'Hogans' Heroes' I would put together as shows that denigrated real
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   --''The Searchers'' (1956): John Ford's acclaimed Western about a
man's years-long pursuit of his niece and the Indians who abducted
her. ''It's one of my favorite movies, and also one of the most
anti-Indian movies ever made. I have it on DVD. I watch it once or
twice a month. It's just another one of those contradictions.''
</P>
<P>
   --''Thunderheart'' (1992): Val Kilmer stars as an FBI agent with
Indian blood whose loyalty to the white world is shaken when he
uncovers evidence of abuses against the Oglala Sioux. ''It was a
good film until the last five minutes, when all the Indians come
out with the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   --Tonto: ''Tonto is the one who started it all. He was the first
really mainstream, pop culture Indian figure, the monosyllabic
stoic Indian stereotype.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 200, Loses 5.6 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, pushing the Nasdaq
composite index down more than 200 points, as investors fretted
about interest rates and continued their flight from high-tech
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were reluctant to enter the market while they awaited
next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Trading was light, forcing
sellers to drop their prices in order to find buyers.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, the Nasdaq was down 200.82 at 3,374.19. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down 144.02 at 10,392.73.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was off 24.86 at 1,387.28.
</P>
<P>
   Investors punished Cisco, sending the stock down 4\ to 58{.
After the close of trading Tuesday, the Internet equipment provider
reported net income of $662 million, or 9 cents per share. That
beat Wall Street analysts' expectations by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of Cisco have been out of favor all week after a
story in Barron's magazine said the stock is overvalued and
acquisitions will prove increasingly difficult because of
escalating purchase prices of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell 5 13/16 to 103 3/16 a day after CEO Louis Gerstner made
his annual address to Wall Street. Gerstner said the company's
financial model calls for high single-digit revenue growth, not the
brisk double-digit expansion achieved in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Motorola fell 14 7/16 to 90{
after Salomon Smith Barney cut its rating on the stock to
''outperform'' from ''buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks are under pressure because they still have
extremely high valuations,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ''Six months ago, people said it
didn't matter what they cost; you had to own them anyway. Now
there's a sense that what you pay for a stock really does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said investors were shying away from expensive technology
stocks because they fear that rising interest rates will compromise
their rapid growth rates. The Fed is expected to raise rates by as
much as a half-percentage point at its meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of merger talks sparked buying in the paper
sector. Champion International rose 6 7/16 to 72] after both
International Paper and UPM-Kymmene of Finland raised their bids
for the company. The new IP bid values Champion at about $7.3
billion, and while UPM's bid would be worth about $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly light, continuing a string of quiet sessions
as many market players stay on the sidelines awaiting the Fed's
next move.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the NYSE came to 425.96 million shares, slightly ahead
of Tuesday's pace. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a
7-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 17.24 to
473.62.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Bandai Co., one of Japan's biggest toymakers,
returned to profitability in the latest fiscal year on a rebound in
its United States and European businesses and an emphasis on its
popular Power Rangers characters.
</P>
<P>
   Bandai reported Wednesday a group net profit of 1.28 billion
yen, or $11.7 million, in the fiscal year ended March 31 cmpared

fivefold to 7.8 billion yen in the current fiscal ear that ends
March 31, 2001 as continues to cut money-losing products. It plans

8,500 now.
</P>
<P>

percent to 210 billion yen during the year on sales of new game
software to Sony Corp. for use in its PlayStation2 video game

   The company added that it expects to boost sales of
Internet-based games to 2.5 billion yen this year from 600 million
yen in the year just ended.

neighborhood of Harlem. The show was to benefit the United Negro
College Fund.
</P>
<P>
   10 years ago: Frank Sinatra crooned ''Bewitched, Bothered and
Bewildered'' for a sellout crowd at Radio City Music Hall in New
York City. Sinatra sang for nearly an hour. The crowd gave him
several standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   And the Chicago City Council gave landmark status to honor Chess
Studios, the two-story, brick-and terra-cotta building where Chuck
Berry recorded ''Johnny B. Goode,'' Howlin' Wolf cut ''Spoonful''
and Muddy Waters laid down ''I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: Connie Chung was ousted as co-anchor of ''The
CBS Evening News,'' ending an uneasy two-year partnership with Dan
Rather. The pairing of Chung and Rather had dropped the newscast's
ratings into the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   And Calista Flockhart and Billy Crudup won the Clarence Derwent
Awards, the New York theater's top prize for most promising new
performers. Flockhart played the fragile Laura in a Broadway
revival of Tennessee Williams' ''The Glass Menagerie.'' Crudup
portrayed a passionate young tutor in Tom Stoppard's ''Arcadia.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago: ''Star Wars: Episode One -- The Phantom Menace''
opened in theaters nationwide. The film made a record-setting $28.5
million at the box office on its first day, breaking the one-day
mark of $26.1 million set by ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   And the first all-English album by Puerto Rican heartthrob Ricky
Martin was No. 1 in its debut on the nation's pop music charts. By
selling 661,000 copies, ''Ricky Martin'' became the best-ever album
debut by a Hispanic artist on the mainstream Billboard charts.

   ''Well, I'm rich. I'm famous. Maybe it's too much to ask to be
talented, too.'' -- Singer-actress Cher.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Kurt Elling  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES J. GANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Kurt Elling quit the University of Chicago
Divinity School just a few credits short of receiving his master's
degree in religion and philosophy when he found a new calling as a
jazz singer.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Elling, the son of a Lutheran church musician,
has made the bandstand his pulpit, delivering a swinging but
inspirational message that somehow hangs together even when he
filters Hermann Hesse through Herbie Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving graduate school in January 1992, Elling worked as
a mover and bartender while honing his skills at local jazz clubs.
His demo tape caught the ear of Blue Note Records president Bruce
Lundvall and the label released Elling's debut album ''Close Your
Eyes'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Elling's first three albums each received Grammy nominations,
but these studio recordings did not capture the surprising twists
and turns of his live performances. Elling remedies that on his new
album ''Live in Chicago'' (Blue Note) recorded at the Green Mill
club, once Al Capone's North Side hangout, where the singer and his
trio led by pianist Laurence Hobgood perform regularly. On the
album, they are joined by Jon Hendricks, the pioneer of vocalese,
the style of singing original lyrics to an instrumental jazz solo,
and some Chicago musicians who mentored Elling, including
saxophonists Von Freeman and Ed Petersen.
</P>
<P>
   The album presents some of Elling's different faces: as a
Sinatralike crooner on the ballad ''(I Love You) for Sentimental
Reasons''; a swinging master of vocalese on Wayne Shorter's ''Night
Dream''; a beat hipster reciting a spoken-word narrative on ''The
Rent Party''; and a jazz philosopher writing original lyrics
inspired by St. John of the Cross as a centerpiece to ''My Foolish
Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   1. Why did you quit divinity school to become a jazz musician?
</P>
<P>
   Elling: I just got burned out on divinity school. I didn't have
that mind-set. I was having a great time in clubs and being
encouraged all the time by established musicians on the Chicago
scene. ... After about a year of moving furniture and living in a
$150-a-month basement room, I just said, 'You know what, graduate
school wasn't right and I'm really happy doing this.'
</P>
<P>
   The jazz was much more the right fit for my personality and my
way of being creative in the world. ... I think it is a very high
calling. ... When you're delivering a sermon, that's a performance
experience; you want to enlighten and inspire people. ... And in a
lot of ways, I want people to have that experience in the club but
it will be a secular thrill. ... I can be proud to say I'm a jazz
musician and that I know where I fit in a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   2. How do you see yourself fitting into the jazz vocal
tradition?
</P>
<P>
   Elling: I'm firmly in the vocalese, straight-ahead jazz singing
tradition of Eddie Jefferson, Jon Hendricks, Annie Ross and Mark
Murphy. I hope to say that I've also learned from Frank Sinatra
about swagger. ... Sinatra had the ultimate mastery of audience
control, personal poise and was able to enjoy himself and swing
very hard. ... And I've really tried to learn from Betty Carter to
be an explorer, to be fearless and to try to be a bandleader.
</P>
<P>
   3. What was it like to work with Jon Hendricks?
</P>
<P>
   Elling: Jon was very gracious and generous to come to Chicago.
He's one of my most important antecedents on the jazz family tree.
... And it was a thrill to have him on my gig. Jon Hendricks
perfected the art form of vocalese which Eddie Jefferson invented.
He really showed how ingenious a lyric could be -- how humorous, how
articulate. He has just an incredible sense of wit and swinging
timing.
</P>
<P>
   4. What side of you does the new album capture that your
previous albums don't?
</P>
<P>
   Elling: With every record we've made, we have gotten the
response that as good as those records have been they haven't
captured how much energy and interaction there is with an audience.
... A lot of people have said they heard the first couple of
recordings and did not really get it, but when they saw us live
then everything fell into place. We do a lot of disparate creative
acts. ... When people are on the scene it makes perfect sense that
we would shift from the most far outside screaming howl of the soul
to the most simple pure melody of a beautiful standard ballad.
</P>
<P>
   5. Why do you choose to stay in Chicago rather than move to New
York, the jazz capital?
</P>
<P>
   Elling: New York is the most spectacular city on the planet. ...
But I get a lot of artistic opportunities in Chicago that I wonder
if I would get there. I've been commissioned by the Steppenwolf
Theatre to write new shows that involved a mixture of acting or
dance and my music. I wrote a show that is a critical exploration
of the work of Allen Ginsberg and the Beat poets. ... I was
commissioned by the city of Chicago to write and direct the
performance art segment of their millennium celebrations. ...
</P>
<P>
   We have a steady Wednesday gig at the Green Mill, and I'm able
to maintain a band. That's as much about staying in Chicago as
anything else. It means we can explore new music. ... I feel like
I'm still learning what it is to be a jazz musician.

<HEADLINE> Makeup Tips for Not-So-Famous Faces  </HEADLINE>
By LISI de BOURBON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Victoria Jackson dreamed of becoming a Hollywood
makeup artist. And she's worked hard to make that dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from beauty school, Jackson went to work at the
Clinique cosmetics counter of a Westwood, Calif., department store.
There she learned that many women need help doing their own makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ''That has really been my motivation since I got into this: to
make makeup accessible to women,'' said Jackson, now 44. ''When you
use it, and if you use it the right way ... it really makes a
difference in the quality of your life and it can be a powerful
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson worked as a free-lance makeup artist, enhancing the
faces of Katharine Hepburn, Brooke Shields, Rene Russo, Kate
Capshaw, Kathleen Turner and Jessica Lange.
</P>
<P>
   She adopted a ''less is more'' mantra, formulating her own
foundation to help clients achieve a more natural look.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted something that would make a person's skin look
perfect and that I could use for film, for television, for print,
and that kind of got me into (the) manufacturing mode,'' she said
in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where she lives with her
husband and three children.
</P>
<P>
   She created Victoria Jackson Cosmetics, a line of color
cosmetics based on her ''no makeup makeup'' philosophy. She
promotes her products on a Web site (http://www.vjcosmetics.com)
and with infomercials, which began airing in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson taught a ''makeup for photography'' class at the
University of California at Los Angeles for eight years, which
enabled her to develop a blueprint for her infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   Though informercials have proven to be a successful advertising
vehicle for her products, ''I think because my line is sold through
an infomercial, it's been harder for the cosmetics industry to look
at me and decide whether I'm very credible,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   However, her natural approach to makeup has become a hit in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson shares the techniques she perfected on celebrity faces
in her new book, ''Make Up Your Life: Every Woman's Guide to the
Power of Makeup'' (CliffStreet Books, an imprint of HarperCollins;
$27.50).
</P>
<P>
   The book teaches women how to use concealer, mascara, lipliner
and blush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to tell you how to do it and also tell you why it's
going to make a difference, and I want to give you a kick in the
pants and get you to the next level and feel good about yourself,''
she says. ''As long as we're stuck in always worrying about how we
look, we can't move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Jackson argues that makeup can help women stop
worrying about their appearance, boosting their self-confidence so
they can deal with weightier issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've learned that it's absolutely 100 percent true that when
you look better, you feel better, and when you feel better, you
have more success in life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One myth she wants to debunk is that women need ''perfect
features'' to be beautiful. Instead, she says, perfection exists in
how you feel about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though I've never seen you, if you're comparing yourself to a
media icon, I know you're engaged in a losing battle,'' she writes.
''There's so much airbrushing and touching up of fashion photos,
the models in real life don't even measure up to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful women, regardless of how beautiful they are, radiate
a certain glow that reflects the conviction and confidence inside,
she said.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Summer Tours  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Shania Twain, who was last year's top
draw, isn't touring, and Garth Brooks plans to sit out for a second
straight year. That leaves George Strait's third year of country
music stadium festivals as the event most likely to appeal to
country music fans this summer -- although the Dixie Chicks Fly Tour
could attract big crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to put together a package featuring the hottest acts
going in country music,'' Strait said. ''You can see and hear them
all in one afternoon and evening. I think (the fact) that the fans
can see all of these acts in one place, and it's affordable,
appeals to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim McGraw, Martina McBride, Kenny Chesney, Mark Chesnutt, Lee
Ann Womack and Asleep at the Wheel fill out the Strait bill on a
10-city tour that includes Cleveland; Cincinnati; Buffalo, N.Y.;
Dallas and Houston. This weekend (May 13-14), the show plays in
Orlando, Fla., on Saturday and Jacksonville, Fla., on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just being associated with George is cool for me,'' McGraw
said. ''There's not many things you can do where you get out in
front of 60,000 or 70,000 people every night and have a good time
playing music with your band.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Strait tour offers reliable quality, the Dixie Chicks
Fly Tour is shaping up as this summer's wild card. It is the first
headlining tour for Natalie Maines, Emily Robison and Martie
Seidel. The tour will kick off in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on June 1. It
will hit 70 arenas by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge tour, and in my opinion, it's going to do very
well,'' said Ray Waddell of Amusement Business magazine. The
magazine has reported that attendance at country shows was down 28
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most other country artists are taking the safe route, playing
state fairs and casinos, Waddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need four or five more headliners. Strait's only doing 10
stadium dates, and there's not a whole lot else in country to get
excited about right now,'' he said. ''If the Dixie Chicks do well,
maybe someone like Martina McBride will try to take it up another
notch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks are working hard to make their tour unique,
Robison said. ''I think we're very into making it an experience as
opposed to just a concert.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Texas trio will avoid harsh concert lighting,
using lighting that provides a softer, more subdued effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks also want an atmosphere ''where there's
something going on all the time inside the arena,'' Robison said.
''Natalie is a big (Nashville) Predators fan, so she got a lot of
ideas from going to hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas include selecting someone from the cheap seats for a
front-row view and dropping T-shirts and other merchandise to the
crowd from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Griffin will open most of the dates. At others, Willie
Nelson or Ricky Skaggs will be on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The industry is going to be watching this tour really close,''
Waddell said. ''It's like a snowball rolling down a hill. If
somebody does good, it increases excitement about others.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, industry sources say a tour by McGraw and his wife
Faith Hill will likely happen later this year. While McGraw
wouldn't confirm the tour, he said the couple hopes to record a
duet album.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next year it might pop up, or in a couple years it might pop
up,'' he said. ''But it's definitely something that we want to do
in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Celebrities of the Past Return  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four weekends a year, in the ballroom of a
Holiday Inn just over the hill from Hollywood, vintage celebrities
-- or near-celebrities -- arrive to meet their public.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not just any Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, it's ''Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn,'' owned and
operated by the 1950s B-movie queen in a corner of the San Fernando
Valley known as North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Names from the past, who are seated along rows of folding tables
like exhibits at a trade show, greet hordes of adoring fans who
have paid $10 to file past them -- and up to $25 more for
autographed photos. Sometimes Garland sits at one of the tables.
</P>
<P>
   Don't have exact change for the glossies? No problem. These
one-time stars of stage and screen will give you change --
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Hollywood Collectors and Celebrities Show, where
retired actors, singers, even bit players, can return to the
limelight, if only for a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The show is run by Ray Courts and his wife Sharon. Courts, 53,
grew up in Milton, W. Va., a town so small it didn't have a movie
theater. He compensated by watching films on television, especially
Westerns. He began attending Western nostalgia conventions, which
featured old-time cowboy stars but no memorabilia. He began
collecting Western paraphernalia and soon became a dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we started the show in 1991, everybody thought we were
crazy,'' said Courts. ''To build a show around celebrities?
</P>
<P>
   ''But you know something? I was a dealer for 23 years. I would
go out to California every now and then to do a show. I discovered
the promoters would not even let the celebrities come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   One promoter told Courts that celebrities were a distraction and
that he wanted collectors to spend all their time and money with
the dealers and the vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'You're crazy. I came 3,000 miles. I want to see
celebrities.' So my wife and I started this show,'' Courts
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The couple started their enterprise modestly, offering
celebrities and memorabilia relating to Western movies. As the show
grew, it attracted Mickey Rooney, Jonathan Winters, Dom DeLuise,
Gene Autry, Steve Allen and Jayne Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, the hotel parking lot is jammed, and all
the parking spaces for blocks around are taken. A few hundred
excited fans wait in line for the 10 a.m. opening, eager to find
their longtime idols.
</P>
<P>
   When the doors open, the crowd pours in. By the end of the day,
about 2,500 fans will have attended the show.
</P>
<P>
   Courts stands by the entrance, attending to myriad matters,
including helping celebrities find their assigned tables -- and
perhaps check a little of their dignity at the door.
</P>
<P>
   This morning's most popular attraction is Don Knotts, 75, one of
the stars of the '60s sitcom ''The Andy Griffith Show.'' He is
signing his book, ''Barney Fife and Other Characters I Have
Known.'' The line extends out the hall and around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Knotts, wearing a cap and glasses, signs his name, leaning over
just a few inches from the books and photos. When asked if the
adoring crowd makes him nervous, he laughs indulgently and says:
''Not really. I'm here to sell the book. I'm having fun. I'd come
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Adams, Nanette Fabray, Linda Christian, Jon Provost
(''Lassie''), Morgan Brittany (''Dallas''), Susanna Foster (the
1943 film ''Phantom of the Opera'') and singer Gogi Grant are among
those in attendance. Charlton Heston and Penny Singleton (the 1938
film ''Blondie'') are due at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''This show's OK,'' Adams, 74, remarks. ''What else is there to
do on a Saturday afternoon except watch golf on TV?''
</P>
<P>
   With his white hair and full mustache, he is hardly recognizable
as the klutzy secret agent Maxwell Smart of the sitcom ''Get
Smart,'' which ran from 1965-1970. The show was revived briefly in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, the sultry singer of the 1940s and '50s, is seated behind
a sign that reads: ''Photos $5, CDs $20, vintage photos $3.'' She
is talking to a young man who claims to have collected all her
single records. He buys a CD of songs from ''The Helen Morgan
Story.'' Grant dubbed the vocals of the 1957 film for star Ann
Blyth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love this show,'' she insists. ''What could be wrong with
somebody coming up and saying, 'I loved your records'? At my age,
75, it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she still work?
</P>
<P>
   ''Once in a while. I don't have an agent, but if somebody calls
and wants me, I'll go. The voice is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is a famous face. But tiny Margaret Pellegrini,
wearing a starched fairy-tale dress, looks like a munchkin, the
role she played in the 1939 film ''The Wizard of Oz.'' She is one
of three munchkins attending the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was 15 when I did the movie, I'm 76 now,'' she declares in
her midget voice. ''I didn't keep working after 'The Wizard.' I got
married and had two children. Now I have four grandchildren and
seven great-grandchildren. They're all big people.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the wall of the big room, concessionaires sell movie
photos, advertising posters and other collectibles. Five other
areas in the hotel offer posters, photos, books and a variety of
memorabilia. Concessionaires pay for the space; celebrities don't.
</P>
<P>
   The Courts conduct business from their home in Spring Hill, Fla.
The couple will take the show to Chicago on May 20-21 and again on
Oct. 7-8, then it's on to San Francisco Nov. 18-19. The Courts pay
for air travel and hotels for the 30 to 40 celebrities who attend
the out-of-town shows.
</P>
<P>
   Down one of the aisles this Saturday sit William Sanderson, Tony
Papenfuss and John Voldstad.
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   Fans remember them as Larry, Darryl and Darryl, the bumbling
handymen of the ''Newhart'' sitcom, which ran on CBS from 1982 to
1990. Larry spoke on the series, the two Darryls didn't. This is
their third appearance at the show.
</P>
<P>
   Have they been working since ''Newhart''ended?
</P>
<P>
   ''Intermittently,'' admitted Voldstad. ''People didn't know
whether we could talk. They bring us in to auditions just to hear
us talk.''

<HEADLINE> Scam Suspect Arrested 15 Yrs. Later  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Police acting on a tip from federal agents
arrested a woman wanted for more than 15 years in a
multimillion-dollar securities scam.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Ann Romero, 38, was stepping off a United Airlines
flight in Denver on Tuesday when officers grabbed her.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of looked like she was ready to give up,'' said
detective Dennis Chavez. ''Fifteen years is a long time to be a
fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials had alerted police Romero might be on the
flight from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Romero faces charges of racketeering, felony theft and
securities fraud from a scam in 1982 and 1983 that bilked investors
out of $3.3 million, said Ken Lane, a Colorado deputy attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of all charges, Romero could face up to 22 years in
prison and be forced to pay restitution to surviving victims.
</P>
<P>
   She was accused along with her husband, Jay Schlaks, whose
company allegedly took investments that were supposed to fund new
business ventures. He was convicted last year after being
extradited from New Zealand, but only a handful of the victims of
the scam were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the danger in these cases,'' Lane said. ''In both
securities and insurance fraud, a lot of your victims are
elderly.''

<HEADLINE> Army Pulls Back From Hostage Site  </HEADLINE>
By AARON FAVILA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Hoping to bring some comfort, foreign
envoys read letters from home over the radio Wednesday to hostages
held by Muslim rebels in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is starting to get cold here,'' the family of South
Africans Callie and Monique Strydom, wrote in a letter read by a
Finnish envoy. ''All your friends send their love and good wishes.
You are in the thoughts of all South Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   There is hope the rebels will eventually allow their captives to
receive the actual letters, but in the meantime, diplomats read
them over DXRZ radio, a station often monitored by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please remember that we will not neglect any possibility to
help you,'' said a letter from the French ambassador. ''We will be
satisfied only when you are back among us. Good luck and be
brave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine military pulled back its troops Wednesday to open
the way for negotiations with Muslim separatists holding 21 Western
and Asian hostages, and the rebels are expected to present their
demands later this week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf guerrillas promised to respond Thursday to a
Libyan envoy's request that they free two ailing captives, although
one rebel leader repeated late Wednesday that they don't believe a
German woman is seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan envoy Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, who hiked along muddy jungle
trails on Wednesday to reach the rebel camp, said the rebels have
no ransom demands ''at the moment,'' but have made political
demands which he cannot discuss.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators expect to receive specific demands for the
hostages' freedom within 24 to 48 hours, he added. Then talks can
begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Troops pulled back from their positions around the rebels'
mountain camp on Wednesday, down to a road along the base of the
mountain on remote Jolo island in the southern Philippines, army
Lt. Abe Sarajian said. The rebels have clashed repeatedly with
soldiers surrounding their hide-out and hostages have begged for a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages -- three Germans, two French, two South Africans,
two Finns, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos -- were
kidnapped from the island of Sipadan on April 23 and taken to Jolo,
an hour's boat ride away.
</P>
<P>
   They are held by the Abu Sayyaf, the smaller and more extreme of
two Muslim rebel groups active here. The Abu Sayyaf are also
holding in nearby Basilan province a separate group of Filipino
hostages seized from two schools. After clashes, killings and
rescues, approximately eight people, mostly children, are thought
to remain in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Javier Solana, the European Union's top diplomat,
left Manila on Wednesday after a 24-hour visit during which he
received President Joseph Estrada's promise to assure the hostages'
safety and delivered humanitarian aid for the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Yo-Yo Ma Teaches Cello in Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Whether it's his choice of performance
music or his teaching methods, cellist Yo-Yo Ma likes to challenge
his audience.
</P>
<P>
   During a master class Wednesday at the start of a weeklong visit
to Taiwan, Ma duck-stepped and goose-walked around the stage to
illustrate what romantic music shouldn't sound like. A student
cellist could barely hide her giggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Relax! Don't hold your arms too close to your body. Let the
energy build!'' Ma said in fluent Chinese, his arms flailing in
wide arcs.
</P>
<P>
   But when he took the student's cello and played a brief passage
from the 19th-century showpiece -- the Saint-Saens A minor concerto
-- it was apparent the instrument was being cradled by a virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to draw the energy from all the sounds around you,
and focus that on your instrument. Then make your statement with a
bang!'' Ma said, his fingers a blur on the fingerboard as the
cello's sonority flooded the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must be one with the audience. You must enlarge your space
and interact with the audience as one,'' Ma said as his audience of
mostly music students was held in rapt silence.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ma takes a break from his patrician performances of
Bach and Beethoven and brings his acclaimed hybrid interpretations
of chamber music and American fiddle tunes to Taipei's National
Concert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his latest offbeat project ''Appalachian Journey,'' and
he teams up with fiddler Mark O'Connor and double bass player Edgar
Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris to Taiwanese parents in 1955, Ma took his first
cello lessons from his father at the age of 4. At 5, Ma gave his
first public recital, and went on to the Juilliard School of Music
in New York to study with cello master Leonard Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Since establishing himself at 19 as one of the world's most
sought-after cellists, Ma has challenged both Taiwanese and
mainland Chinese audiences, whose musical tastes are traditionally
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, Ma played
Symphony 1997 by leading mainland Chinese composer Tan Dun. He also
plans to take his ''Silk Road'' project -- where he plays
traditional folk music on his 1712 Stradivarius -- to China later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The project is not the first of its kind for Ma, whose appetite
for world music embraces the Argentine Tango, music from the bush
peoples of the African Kalahari Desert, contemporary American music
and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just like journalism. You pay attention to interesting
things around you and make a mental note. Then you work on them
later,'' Ma said during an interview broadcast this week on
Taiwan's TVBS cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Ma has also played the music of composer John Williams on the
soundtrack of the 1997 film ''Seven Years in Tibet,'' in which Brad
Pitt plays an Austrian who scales the Himalayas and meets a young
Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   The film was banned in China, and Ma's involvement displeased
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Ma hasn't been heard in Beijing's concert halls since then. He
fell short of calling it a ban, but acknowledged that China has not
been part of his concert schedule for some time, the China Times, a
leading Taiwanese daily, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ma said he was on good enough terms with Beijing to meet Chinese
Premier Zhu Rongji in the United States last year. During that
meeting, the cellist received the go-ahead to take his ''Silk
Road'' project on tour in China, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Fear Felt in Haiti Ahead of Vote  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Marcellin Jean is afraid he can't
provide for his family. He's afraid he might be robbed in the unlit
lanes of his slum. And he's afraid that if he votes, he will be
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the more than 4 million Haitians registered to vote
on May 21, Jean knows the elections may be the start of a way out
of poverty and lawlessness. But the fear may keep him home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still not sure whether I'm going to vote,'' the
40-year-old Jean said. ''I don't want to be caught in a rat trap,
with the ballot (as) bait in my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   His fear is not unfounded: In 1987, the army aborted Haiti's
first free elections. Hundreds were killed during campaigning and
some 30 were killed on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Jean's wife, Daniella, remembers. And the intervening years in
this desperately poor, increasingly lawless country have changed
too little. She will ''cast her vote for Jesus'' and not go to the
polls, Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloodshed and vandalism have marred the preparations for
elections and halted most campaigning. A dozen people have been
killed in politically related slayings since March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Lesly Tilus, an opposition mayoral candidate in the
Port-au-Prince suburb of Delmas, disappeared on Sunday, his party
said -- raising fears of another political act of violence. But his
party said Wednesday he had reappeared safe and sound. It gave no
details.
</P>
<P>
   Jean himself did not vote in the last elections, in 1997.
Disgusted with the corruption and ineffectiveness of elected
officials, 95 percent of Haitians stayed away from the polls. The
result was political paralysis, and Haiti has been without a
functioning government for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   International financial institutions are withholding $500
million in aid until a new Parliament is installed. Without it,
economic recovery is impossible. But organizational bumbling,
politics and escalating political violence threaten to postpone the
legislative voting -- already delayed three times -- yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during the 1991-1994 dictatorship when the army and its
henchmen ruled, and killed as many as 4,000, most people are
confused about who exactly is calling the shots now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then we could identify the enemy. Now the bullet can come from
any quarter,'' Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti is in desperate need of effective government. More than
half the work force is jobless or underemployed, and 80 percent of
the people live in poverty. Illiteracy is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Jean, a street-corner real estate agent, earns about $100 a
month, far above the per capita annual income of no more than $500.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's drug dealers who are keeping (housing) prices high,''
Jean said. He refused to elaborate, but officials say Haiti has
become a leading drug transit point between Colombia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   With the depreciation of the currency, the gourde, food prices
have risen sharply. ''We can't keep our heads above water,'' Jean
said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Embassy survey in November reported that one out of two
Haitians say their economic situation had worsened since military
rule, when international economic sanctions were imposed on Haiti.
Seventy percent said they had given ''serious thought'' to leaving
Haiti. Some 1,502 people were interviewed for the survey, which had
a margin of error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Considering our slight progress and the extent of our setbacks
... there's no doubt it will take about 200 years for us to catch
up with developed countries,'' Group Croissance, a consulting firm,
reported in April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Haiti's 5,000-member police force, trained by the
United Nations, has been unable to stem increasing crime.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians offer plenty of reasons for that: Police are
ill-equipped, overworked, lazy or even under political pressure
from former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party. Since
Aristide is running again in a vote expected in December, some
believe that if he wins, he will order a crackdown on crime and
take the credit.
</P>
<P>
   On April 8, after the funeral of prominent journalist Jean
Dominique -- whose slaying remains unsolved -- street activists
claiming to be Aristide partisans burned down the headquarters of
the opposition Space for Concord coalition. Police watched, but did
not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, gunmen shot and killed former health minister and
prominent physician Ary Bordes, 74. And on Sunday night, gunmen
killed Elam Senat, a well-known opposition militant in the town of
Savanette, and his 23-year-old son, Edner.
</P>
<P>
   A priest, the Rev. Lagneau Balot, was killed during a robbery
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''When God is no longer in men's hearts, society turns into a
jungle,'' said Roman Catholic Bishop Monsignor Louis Kebreau.
</P>
<P>
   Provisional electoral council president Leon Manus has warned
that elections may be called off if violence attributed to the
campaign persists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last chances of recovery will be lost,'' he said, ''and
the country will sink into the unknown.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq, Dow Both Shed Nearly 200  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, pushing both the Dow
Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index down nearly
200 points apiece, as investors fretted about interest rates and
continued their flight from high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, the Nasdaq was down 184.10 at 3,400.91.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 192.13 at 10,344.62.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was off 30.06 at 1,382.08.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks bore the brunt of investors' distress today,
with several industry leaders falling sharply. Cisco fell 3\ to
59{. After the close of trading Tuesday, the Internet equipment
provider reported net income of $662 million, or 9 cents per share.
That beat Wall Street analysts' expectations by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of Cisco have been out of favor all week after a
story in Barron's magazine said the stock is overvalued and
acquisitions will prove increasingly difficult because of
escalating purchase prices of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell 5 15/16 to 103 1/16 a day after CEO Louis Gerstner made
his annual address to Wall Street. Gerstner said the company's
financial model calls for high single-digit revenue growth, not the
brisk double-digit expansion achieved in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Motorola fell 15 13/16 to 89[
after Salomon Smith Barney cut its rating on the stock to
''outperform'' from ''buy.'' Analyst Alex Cena said Motorola
recently lost a major customer to competitor Nortel, limiting its
potential for dramatic earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   The downbeat news on three technology bellwethers forced
investors to reconsider the high prices of many stocks in the
sector, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks are under pressure because they still have
extremely high valuations,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ''Six months ago, people said it
didn't matter what they cost; you had to own them anyway. Now
there's a sense that what you pay for a stock really does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said investors were shying away from expensive technology
stocks because they fear that rising interest rates will compromise
their rapid growth rates. The Fed is expected to raise rates by as
much as a half-percentage point at its meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of merger talks sparked buying in the paper
sector. Champion International rose 5} to 72 1/16 after both
International Paper and UPM-Kymmene of Finland raised their bids
for the company. The new IP bid values Champion at about $7.3
billion, and while UPM's bid would be worth about $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly light, continuing a string of quiet sessions

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan admits complicity in Malcolm X's murder  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan admits
his complicity in the 1965 murder of Malcolm X while seated across
the table from the civil rights leader's oldest daughter in a ''60
Minutes'' interview to be broadcast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Attallah Shabazz later issued a statement thanking Farrakhan for
acknowledging his role and said: ''I wish him peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz, then 6, saw her father gunned down in the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem on Feb. 21, 1965. Three men with ties to the
Nation of Islam were convicted in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Malcolm X's criticism of Nation of Islam
spiritual leader Elijah Muhammad had caused a bitter split with
church leaders, including Farrakhan. Farrakhan called Malcolm X a
traitor and wrote, two months before the killing, that ''such a man
is worthy of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan has denied ordering the assassination but later
admitted to having ''helped create the atmosphere'' that led to it.
</P>
<P>
   His four-hour meeting with Shabazz and ''60 Minutes''
correspondent Mike Wallace, organized at her request, took place at
Farrakhan's home in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan told them that he ''truly loved'' Malcolm X and
carried his picture after his death. Shabazz's body visibly
stiffened, arms crossed over her chest, when Wallace quoted from
Farrakhan's writings about Malcolm X before he died.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Farrakhan said that the U.S. government
spied on black leaders and were concerned about a ''black messiah''
who could unite the community. ''This is bigger than the Nation of
Islam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz, struggling to keep control of her emotions, said that
while she believed the FBI had something to do with her father's
death, it was young black men who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't keep pointing fingers,'' she said. ''My father was
not killed from a grassy knoll.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan said: ''Yes, it is true that black men pulled the
trigger. We cannot deny any responsibility in this. Where we are
responsible, where our hands are a part of this, we beg God's mercy
and forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I genuinely hope that perhaps a healing can come to Miss
Shabazz and her family,'' he continued. ''As I may have been
complicit in words that I spoke leading up to February 21st, I
acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused
the loss of life of a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz's reaction to these words aren't shown. Wallace said she
needed time to absorb them. She issued a statement this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's never admitted this before publicly,'' she said. ''Until
now, he's never caressed my father's children. I thank him for
acknowledging his culpability and I wish him peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz's mother, Betty Shabazz, who died in 1997, had publicly
accused Farrakhan of a role in the murder. She reconciled with him
after her daughter Qubilah was charged in 1994 with plotting to
hire a hitman to kill him. The charges were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he believed that Farrakhan, who has battled
prostate cancer and other health problems, is making amends partly
because he has faced his own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Farrakhan publicly embraced W. Deen Mohammed,
son of Elijah Muhammad, in an attempt to heal wounds that have
split U.S. Muslims into factions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that he has thought seriously about the people he has
disaffected,'' Wallace said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz said it was still difficult for her to meet with
Farrakhan on camera. ''I did not know if I wanted to sit across
from him,'' she said. ''I did not know if my heart could handle
it.''

<HEADLINE> Chechens Claim To Kill 30 Russians  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebel fighters said they trapped a Russian
unit Wednesday in eastern Chechnya, killing 30 soldiers in the
biggest reported ambush in several weeks. Russian officials denied
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   A Chechen commander told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity that the Russians were attacked Wednesday outside the
village of Alleroy, 30 miles east of Chechnya's capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel web site reported 34 Russian troops and four rebels had
been killed in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told
a news conference Wednesday that no such attack had occurred. A
spokesman at Russia's Interior Ministry said he could not comment
on the claim.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians say they control most of Chechnya, the
militants have staged several such ambushes in the past two months,
pinning down Russian convoys then killing or capturing soldiers.
Each time, Russian officials have initially denied the attacks took
place.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also routinely exaggerate the other's losses while
playing down their own, and there was no way to check the claim of
casualties. If true, it would be the deadliest reported attack on
Russian troops since rebels ambushed a troop convoy in southern
Chechnya in March, killing some 40 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces have been trying for months to oust the
insurgents from Chechnya's southern mountains. Russian security
officials said Wednesday that there are still about 7,000 rebels
inside Chechnya -- higher than previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials claimed the militants were too disorganized
and scattered to stage large-scale attacks, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky also said that Russian troops' mopping-up
operations in Chechnya will soon be carried out only in the
presence of prosecutors. He said the decision was made ''to tighten
discipline and increase responsibility in the units ... and give
additional security guarantees to the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen refugees and human rights groups say Russian troops have
looted homes, and beaten and sometimes killed civilians after
occupying Chechen villages.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, parliament member and former Russian Justice
Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov met with former Chechen Interior
Minister Kazbek Makhashev in Ingushetia, which neighbors Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Krasheninnikov was the highest-level Russian official to meet
publicly with a rebel leader in months. The Kremlin quickly said it
had not authorized the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has indicated in recent weeks that it is looking for
a political solution to the conflict, but demands that the rebels
surrender their weapons and release all Russian hostages.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Drops 134; Dow Down 106  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as investors fretted
about interest rates and continued their flight from high-tech
issues. Some scattered bargain-hunting lifted market averages from
their midday lows.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq was down 134.39 at 3,450.62. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 106.66 at 10,430.09. Earlier in the session, both
indicators had fallen more than 200 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was off 18.51 at 1,393.63.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks bore the brunt of investors' distress today,
with several industry leaders falling sharply. Cisco fell 2 9/16 to
60 3/16. After the close of trading Tuesday, the Internet equipment
provider reported net income of $662 million, or 9 cents per share.
That beat Wall Street analysts' expectations by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of Cisco have been out of favor all week after a
story in Barron's magazine said the stock is overvalued and
acquisitions will prove increasingly difficult because of
escalating purchase prices of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell 8| to 108 5/16 after the company said it shipped
nearly 1 million computer circuit boards that could contain a
defect that destroys important files.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell 5 7/16 to 103 9/16 a day after CEO Louis Gerstner made
his annual address to Wall Street. Gerstner said the company's
financial model calls for high single-digit revenue growth, not the
brisk double-digit expansion achieved in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola fell 17\ to 87 11/16 after Salomon Smith Barney cut its
rating on the stock to ''outperform'' from ''buy.'' Analyst Alex
Cena said Motorola recently lost a major customer to competitor
Nortel, limiting its potential for dramatic earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   The downbeat news on four technology bellwethers forced
investors to reconsider the high prices of many stocks in the
sector, analysts said. Hewlett-Packard fell 6} to 126 1/16 without
releasing any significant news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks are under pressure because they still have
extremely high valuations,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ''Six months ago, people said it
didn't matter what they cost; you had to own them anyway. Now
there's a sense that what you pay for a stock really does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said investors were shying away from expensive technology
stocks because they fear rising interest rates will compromise
their rapid growth rates. The Fed is expected to raise rates by as
much as a half-percentage point at its meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks weren't the sole source of the Dow's weakness.
General Motors fell 5 7/16 to 81{ after a Merrill Lynch analyst cut
his rating on the stock to ''neutral'' from ''accumulate.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of merger talks sparked buying in the paper
sector. Champion International rose 6 5/16 to 72\ after both
International Paper and UPM-Kymmene of Finland raised their bids
for the company. The new IP bid values Champion at about $7.3
billion, and while UPM's bid would be worth about $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly light, continuing a string of quiet sessions
as many market players stay on the sidelines awaiting the Fed's
next move. On the NYSE, 770.00 million shares had changed hands as
of 3 p.m., compared with 705.95 million at the same time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two sessions, investors will receive some economic
data that could indicate whether the economy is growing fast enough
to merit a sharp rate increase. On Thursday, the Commerce
Department will report on retail sales in the month of April. On
Friday, the Labor Deparment will release its Producer Price Index,
which measures inflationary pressures at the wholesale level.

   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 13.70 to
477.16.

<HEADLINE> Party Leader Detained in Vieques  </HEADLINE>
By ISMAEL TORRES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rico's independence party
leader slipped past U.S. Marines guarding the Navy's Vieques
training ground Wednesday and was detained hours before a Navy
destroyer shelled the range using non-explosive ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Berrios and activist Jorge Fernandez Porto entered the
island bombing range before dawn and were detained at 9 a.m. by
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I'm under arrest,'' Berrios shouted from
inside the main gate before U.S. marshals took the pair away.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshals Service had no immediate comment. Marines patrol
the range perimeter to stop anyone from entering, and how Berrios
got in wasn't immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m., the USS Stump fired non-explosive rounds in the
first ship-to-shore shelling at the Atlantic fleet range in more
than a year. The shelling, which lasted roughly two hours, complied
with a presidential order allowing the Navy to resume limited
operations on Vieques using non-explosive ordnance, said Navy
spokesman Bob Nelson. Puerto Rico's government was notified at
least 15 days ago of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's training was completed safely, professionally and
without incident,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Navy A-4 Skyhawks dropped 12 ''dummy'' bombs at the ground
Monday, fulfilling a Navy pledge to resume operations despite
protesters' claims that some colleagues were still on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios, 60, had camped on the range for nearly a year, helping
lead protests against Navy training before he and 223 others were
removed in a federal operation that began May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The detainees were released without charges, but anyone entering
now faces tough penalties: up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000
fine under a new order issued by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios ''is violating the imperialist law in order to comply
with the law of his fatherland,'' said Independence Party Senator
Manuel Rodriguez Orellana.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters occupied the range in April 1999 after a civilian
security guard was killed by stray bombs. They say decades of
bombing have harmed their health and the environment and stunted
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy disputes those arguments and says Vieques is the only
place where the Atlantic Fleet can hold simultaneous air, land and
sea training. Clinton and Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello agreed
in January to let the Navy resume limited training with inert
ordnance and, in exchange, let Vieques residents vote -- probably
next year -- on whether the Navy should leave by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In San Juan, a U.S. magistrate issued arrest warrants for two
activists who, protesters claim, are inside the range. Brothers
Casimar and Pedro Zenon are accused of assault for allegedly
throwing rocks at Navy and contract personnel at the range on March
18. One civilian was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques fishermen, meanwhile, said they would try Saturday to
run a 3-mile-wide no-entry zone around the range that they say has
robbed them of their fishing grounds. The Coast Guard is enforcing
the zone.

<HEADLINE> Protesters To Launch Sprite Boycott  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A group that plans to boycott Coca-Cola products
said Wednesday the effort would begin in earnest this week in 10
large U.S. cities, with an initial focus on getting blacks to stop
drinking Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott, led by the Committee for Corporate Justice, also
hopes to persuade businesses to switch their Coke vending machines
to those from rival Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 15 businesses and churches in metro Atlanta have agreed
to remove Coke machines, said Larry Jones, the committee's leader
and a former Coke human resources manager.
</P>
<P>
   A group of eight black current and former Coke workers sued the
company last year, alleging that they were denied raises,
promotions and fair performance reviews because of their race and
are seeking to include as many as 2,000 other class members in the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Coke denies the allegations, and has been working to settle the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The group will target its boycott at the 10 markets where the
group says Coke sells the most to blacks. They are: Atlanta,
Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City,
Philadelphia, St. Louis and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sprite will be the first product targeted because blacks make up
36 percent of the soft drink's consumer base, he said. A Coke
spokesman said he could not immediately confirm that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch said the company is ''disappointed''
by the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take all comments and concerns voiced by our current and
former employees seriously, but we do not think this action is
justified,'' Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott plans were disclosed a day after an Atlanta-based
cable network partially owned by a Florida attorney involved in the
discrimination suit announced that it had signed a five-year
marketing deal with the beverage company.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Gary, a personal-injury attorney who represents four
plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit, said there is no interest
conflict in the connection between his Major Broadcasting Cable
Network and his legal work against Coke.

   CHANHASSEN, Minn. (AP) -- Fans of the artist formerly known as
Prince will have a chance to see where he works when he opens his
Paisley Park studios for a weeklong celebration.
</P>
<P>
   From June 7 to June 12, fans willing to fork over $70 can take a
half-hour tour of Paisley Park in this Minneapolis suburb, where
Prince has made many of his records and videos. The tours will move
through the recording studios, personal offices, wardrobe room and
sound stages, his publicist said in a statement. Prince will not
conduct the tours himself.
</P>
<P>
   Each night, ticket holders also can attend parties that will
include Prince concert footage and live performances by ''surprise
musical guests,'' the statement said. Visitors will be asked to
vote on which of his unreleased songs should be included on future
albums.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been wanting to do this for a while,'' said Jacqui
Thompson, a Paisley Park official.

<HEADLINE> 'Hannibal' Draws Flack in Florence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- Some local politicians object to filming
part of ''Hannibal'' inside a Florence landmark, saying the gory
scene could hurt the city's image.
</P>
<P>
   The eagerly awaited sequel to ''Silence of the Lambs'' includes
Hannibal Lecter committing a gruesome murder in the ornate Salon of
the Lilies in the Palazzo Vecchio. It's a partial re-enactment of a
slaying that took place in a different room of the palace in 1478.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will add nothing to Florence's world prestige,'' the
local Greens and Popular Party complained this week in an open
letter to the mayor. ''We believe that instead ... the city would
become the setting for morbid thrills and vulgar horror.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks the mayor to cancel permission to shoot inside
the 13th-century palazzo. The objection is unlikely to slow things
down. The mayor warmly welcomed the cast and crew to Florence last
week and the city has been generous with permits to shoot in a
number of famous sites.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's publicist, Rob Harris, said the filmmakers weren't
even aware of the objections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything's on schedule, everything's fine. It's certainly
not been a problem for us,'' he said. ''Everybody still loves us as
far as I know.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's great-uncle and Castro's daughter speak at rally  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A chilly wind blew in from New York
Harbor as about 200 Cuban-Americans at Liberty State Park cheered
speeches from Fidel Castro's estranged daughter and Elian
Gonzalez's great-uncle urging that the boy be allowed to remain in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez decried the ''injustice'' of the 6-year-old
being removed from the home of his Miami relatives: ''The people
who took Elian at gunpoint have betrayed America.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, ''I'm extremely proud to be next to the
Statue of Liberty,'' as the boisterous group faced the harbor
landmark a quarter-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd waved Cuban flags and held handmade posters bearing
reproductions of the photograph of an armed federal agent
confronting Elian in the Miami home.
</P>
<P>
   Alina Fernandez, Castro's daughter, said the rally is ''a big
opportunity'' to show people Cuba is a police state. ''This tragedy
would not have happened if Cuba was free,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know all too well the drive to escape the suffocation of
repression,'' said Fernandez, who fled the country in 1993 and is
one of her father's fiercest critics. She lives in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was among those in more than a dozen cities around the
nation the day before a federal appeals court in Atlanta considers
a request by Elian's relatives to grant the boy political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Northern New Jersey is home to the second-largest Cuban exile
population outside of Florida, including Maria Cardenas, 46, of
Hoboken, who came to the Jersey City rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was important to come here and support my Cuban
people,'' said Cardenas, who works at Morristown Memorial
Hospital's dental clinic as an administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Elian would have a better life in the United States than under
the Castro regime in Cuba, she said: ''You don't have any say in
your kids in Cuba. You don't have any control of your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A coordinator of United Cuban Organizations, Clara Nibot, said
she attended to defend the freedoms that formed the basis for the
United States and for Elian to remain in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the child can be with his father, why can't he be where his
mother intended him to be?'' said Nibot, 55, of Bergenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother and others drowned when they attempted to reach
Florida in a small boat in late November. Elian survived stayed
with his Miami relatives until taken by federal agents April 22.
Elian is now staying with his father, stepmother and 6-month-old
half-brother in Maryland. The father wants to return to Cuba with
him.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey event was sponsored by a Newark-based
telecommunications company, IDT Corp., to promote the launch last
week of its FreeAtLast.com service, which offers free Internet
access, e-mail, and Internet phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Posters for the service decorated the portable stage used by the
speakers, and an IDT van outfitted as a rolling kosher kitchen
distributed bag lunches.
</P>
<P>
   IDT paid the travel expenses for Gonzalez and Fernandez, and is
to make a contribution to a charity operated by Fernandez, company
spokesman Gil Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Company president Jim Courter, a former New Jersey congressman,
also addressed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''That Statue of Liberty is not just for the people in the
United States,'' Courter said. ''The Statue of Liberty stands for
freedom for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler introduced the speakers,
decrying communism and Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as we have freedom and human rights, the people of Cuba
deserve to have their human rights, too,'' Schundler said.

<HEADLINE> Cannes Brings Out Glamour  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- The Cannes Film festival on Wednesday
kicked off its first edition of the 21st century by looking back
400 years, to the decadent and intrigue-filled court of Louis XIV.
</P>
<P>
   Workers hammered and sawed furiously to transform part of the
festival palace into a replica of a 17th-century chateau in honor
of ''Vatel,'' a lush costume drama starring Uma Thurman and Gerard
Depardieu chosen to open the 53rd annual festival.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day event values both serious art and serious glamour,
not to mention serious business. And its opening night always tends
to favor the glamour, with films chosen to attract big name stars
at that first ritual mounting of those famous red-carpeted steps.
</P>
<P>
   The names were there on Wednesday. Young French actress Virginie
Ledoyen, best known for starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in
''The Beach,'' was emcee for the ceremony. Depardieu and Thurman
declared the festival open, along with Spanish actress Cecilia
Roth, star of last year's ''All About My Mother.'' Later, some 700
people were invited to a sumptuous dinner in honor of ''Vatel,''
including French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, a first-time visitor
to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Other luminaries climbing the red steps were model Claudia
Schiffer, actress Andie MacDowell and even Calista Flockhart, TV's
Ally McBeal, whose star-studded film, ''Things You Can Tell Just By
Looking At Her,'' was screened out of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The real contest begins Thursday, with 23 films vying for the
coveted Palme d'Or, or Golden Palm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vatel,'' directed by Roland Joffe of ''The Killing Fields''
fame, is based on the true story of a loyal servant called upon to
prepare a lavish welcome for a three-day visit to his master, a
financially struggling prince, by Louis XIV and his entire court.
</P>
<P>
   The servant, Vatel, played by Depardieu, responds admirably,
preparing extravagant meals and dazzling theatrics, such as ice
sculptures and fireworks displays, to amaze and amuse the king and
his court.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the film is in its intricate depiction of these
festivities. The prince's grand chateau at Chantilly is faithfully
recreated, and the grand theatrics produced to dazzle the king
truly are dazzling. The food, too, is beautifully presented, with
the help of experts on 17th-century recipes.
</P>
<P>
   But the acting is more uneven. Part of the problem has to do
with language: Depardieu speaks English here. In French, this
amazingly prolific actor has no problem appearing seductive, but in
English, he seems stilted, even when uttering the elegant words of
Tom Stoppard, who adapted the French screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Depardieu's lines end up sounding silly -- such as, ''I
quote Descartes, whom I once knew.'' And occasionally he sounds
like he doesn't exactly know what he is saying -- which he
cheerfully admitted at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   It also is tough to sense any romantic chemistry between
Depardieu and Thurman, who plays Anne de Montausier, a
lady-in-waiting to the queen who catches Louis' roving eye. Anne
beds the king but covets Vatel in her heart; later she beds him,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Depardieu does convey well his character's honesty and decency
in a cynical, backbiting world, traits that ultimately lead to the
movie's tragic end.
</P>
<P>
   The best performance in the film is by British-born actor Tim
Roth, no stranger to period dramas or to crafty characters. He
plays the scheming, conniving Marquis de Lauzun, the evil adviser
to Louis who conspires against Vatel.
</P>
<P>
   Also amusing is Julian Sands as the king, who provides an
interesting take on the monarch at the young age of 30, and told
reporters he ''just loved wearing those wigs and high heels.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Urged To Delay Plane  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The investigative arm of Congress urged the
Pentagon on Wednesday to delay the next critical step in developing
a new fighter aircraft to be shared by the Air Force, Navy and
Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation runs counter to the Pentagon's assertion that
it is ready to move ahead with the project. The plan is to build
three variants of a new fighter -- one each for the Air Force, Navy
and Marine Corps. At a total cost of $220 billion it is the Defense
Department's most expensive aircraft program.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft is known as the Joint Strike Fighter. Boeing Co.
and Lockheed Martin Corp. are competing to build it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress so far has supported the project, although on Tuesday
the Senate put a new restriction on how quickly the Pentagon can
spend funds on the fighter project in the fiscal 2001 budget now
being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Strike Fighter is one of three enormously expensive
fighter projects the Pentagon is pursuing simultaneously. The other
two are the F-22 stealth fighter to replace the Air Force's current
F-15 fighters, and the Navy's F/A-18 Super Hornet, billed as an
improved model of the existing F/A-18 Hornet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a Senate Armed Services subcommittee began discussing
delaying the Joint Strike Fighter, although the full committee on
Tuesday rejected that approach. Instead the senators decided to
alter the program's funding for next year, eliminating money that
had been earmarked for taking the plane into the next stage of
development. The Pentagon can request that the money be shifted
back during the year.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the Pentagon's concern, Defense Secretary William
Cohen and Gen. James L. Jones, commandant of the Marine Corps, went
to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to hold closed-door talks with key
senators. They argued that any delays would hurt the project and
set back the Defense Department's modernization plans.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office's director of national security,
Louis J. Rodrigues, told the House Government Reform subcommittee
on national security Wednesday that unless the Pentagon delayed the
next step in development it would risk adding many billions of
dollars to the eventual cost of producing the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues said the Pentagon should put off awarding a contract
to move the aircraft project into a phase known as engineering,
manufacturing and development -- a phase scheduled to last eight
years and cost $20 billion. Only after that phase is completed
would the Pentagon move into full-scale production of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key technologies to be incorporated in the new
fighter have not yet reached a level of maturity that would give
sufficient confidence that they will work as promised once the
manufacturing process begins, Rodrigues said. These technologies --
which he said he could not identify without jeopardizing
proprietary information of Boeing and Lockheed Martin -- are too
important to rush, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he argued, the Pentagon should not award the engineering,
manufacturing and development contract as scheduled in April 2001.
He did not propose a new target date for the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delaying this phase of the program until these technologies
are mature would improve the chances that the Joint Strike Fighter
will be fielded as planned,'' Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Pentagon's current timetable for moving the project into
the next phase of development, ''it is not in a good position to
succeed, if success means delivering the aircraft on time and
within budget,'' Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding for the Pentagon, Air Force Maj. Gen. Raymond P.
Huot, refuted Rodrigues' logic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any unnecessary delay to the program, such as the one being
suggested by the GAO, would not only impact the cost of the program
but also have a serious impact on our force structure,'' he told
the panel.

<HEADLINE> Congress Criticized on Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is sending the wrong message to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by moving to cut off funds
for U.S. peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, the Clinton
administration said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and State Department issued statements
challenging an amendment to the military construction bill that
would cut off funds for the continued deployment of 5,900 U.S.
troops in the Serbian province beyond July 1, 2001, unless
President Clinton or his successor obtains congressional
authorization to continue deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also requires Clinton to develop a plan to shift
responsibility to the European allies for providing ground troops
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there are 37,000 peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, most of
them provided by U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the amendment
''potentially sends the wrong message to enemies of what we did
there (Kosovo). It is a mess and it's time for the Senate
Republicans to show some leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, spokesman Philip Reeker said, ''We
believe that the proposed legislation sends the wrong message to
Milosevic and those who oppose NATO's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Reeker said, the United States and its allies
succeeded in reversing ''ethnic cleansing'' in the province, and
hundreds of thousands of refugees have been able to return to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, much work remains to be done to secure the peace in
Kosovo,'' he said. ''Progress is definitely being made. Our troops
together with those of our allies in other countries are working
very hard to meet that challenge, and they deserve our continued
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was approved 23-3 Tuesday by the Senate
Appropriations Committee. It reflects concern among legislators
with an open-ended deployment of American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to continue working with Congress to achieve
legislation that provides flexibility to respond to changing
situations, to give the president the necessary authority that he
needs to tailor our actions to meet foreign policy goals and
national security objectives,'' Reeker said.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Fires Forces Evacuations  </HEADLINE>
By PETE HERRERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUIDOSO, N.M. (AP) -- High wind kicked up today in parts of New
Mexico where two fires have scorched more than 9,000 acres and
forced hundreds of people to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The wind drove a week-old fire near Los Alamos National
Laboratory into a canyon, forcing the evacuation of 500 additional
homes.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1,000 homes have been evacuated because of the fire,
which forced the lab, Los Alamos schools and county offices to
close for the third consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   The winds, clocked at 30 to 35 mph, presented the worst-case
scenario envisioned by firefighters. But nobody has been injured
and no homes have burned.
</P>
<P>
   Winds had died down overnight around fires at Los Alamos, in
northern New Mexico, and near the southern resort town Ruidoso. But
conditions were expected to worsen today and grow particularly bad
by Thursday at Los Alamos, where the National Weather Service
forecast gusts of 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters have quickly extinguished any spot fires that have
popped up on lab property, lab spokesman Jim Danneskiold said
today. He said the property around the lab closest to the fire was
cleared of underbrush after a 1996 blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire is miles from any buildings containing any nuclear
materials and those buildings are rated to survive severe fires,
747 crashes, those kinds of things. They're bunkers, basically,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In smoke-shrouded Ruidoso, an estimated 135 evacuees from five
flame-threatened subdivisions were still kept away from their homes
Tuesday, fire information officer Karen Miranda said. The Ruidoso
fire had grown to 5,700 acres, but winds were expected to be milder
than in the Los Alamos area.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuee Anthony Scruggs, 52, said he feared for his home in the
Homestead subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably in one of the worst areas,'' he said. ''It seems
to be the focal point of the fire, and I know they're doing all
they can, but they can't control Mother Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, air tankers carrying pink fire retardant and
helicopters dangling huge buckets of water roared overhead. A
helicopter filled its bucket in a lake at the 12th hole of the
Kokopelli Country Club golf course, where Scruggs and three
companions were playing a round Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs said playing golf was better than sitting in a hotel
room or at roadside, since he wasn't allowed back home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing I can do. It's in the hands of God and the
firefighters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Person said she, too, had to leave her new home in Ruidoso
but was allowed to return late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came in, got a few things out of my home and got out,''
Person said Tuesday. ''A couple of house plants, some personal
papers and photographs. I kissed the rest goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into who set the campfire that started the
Ruidoso blaze continues, Miranda said. The Los Alamos fire was
started last week by the National Park Service to clear brush at
the nearby Bandelier National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of fighting the Los Alamos fire was estimated Tuesday
night at $1.1 million, fire officials said, while the Ruidoso
firefighting cost was placed at $650,000.

<HEADLINE> State court overturns Greenwich's beach restriction  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Greenwich's exclusive beaches must be
opened to out-of-towners, the state Appellate Court ruled
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's second highest court found the residents-only policy
at the town's parks and beaches violates a public trust doctrine
that says municipalities hold parks on behalf of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of nearby Stamford sued the town of Greenwich in 1995
after he was denied access to Greenwich Point, a 147-acre park with
a beach on Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plaintiff claims that because he is a resident of this
state, he is entitled to access to the park ... regardless of the
fact that he is not a resident of the town,'' Judge Edward
O'Connell wrote in the unanimous decision. ''We agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich First Selectman Lolly Prince said she expects the
town's governing board Thursday to approve an appeal to the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been the intention of the town to follow this as far as
we have to,'' she said. ''We felt the original decision was well
reasoned and legally sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenden Leydon, who filed the lawsuit, said he would object to a
hearing before the Supreme Court since he asked the high court for
a ruling -- and was denied -- when he filed the Appellate Court
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is confident, though, that the ruling would stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point in the decision, there's almost a full page of
citations of cases where it was decided if a town holds a park, it
does so for the general public,'' said Leydon, 32, a Stamford
attorney. ''The string of decisions goes back to 1824.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Connecticut towns let nonresidents use their beaches, but
charge them exorbitant parking fees or require them to walk to the
waterfront. Greenwich, however, bans both walkers and joggers and
allows out-of-towners to use the beaches only when they are
accompanied by a resident pay a $6 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich officials maintain a 1919 special act of the state
Legislature granted the town an exception to any public trust
doctrine. Residents say reversing the policy would damage beach
ecology and increase traffic at Greenwich Point, an already
overburdened area.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a limited amount of space that people can use and
still be able to protect the ecosystem,'' Prince said. ''It's a
delicate balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Leydon argued that banning nonresidents violates the First
Amendment right to freedom of expression. He claimed the town's
policy is rooted in an elitist attitude in this suburb known for
its celebrities and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Edward R. Karazin Jr., after a weeklong
civil trial in 1998, sided with the town.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Court ruled the judge erred when he found the
public trust doctrine did not apply because of the 1919 act.
</P>
<P>
   ''The language of the act does not expressly limit use of the
public beach to residents only,'' O'Connell wrote. ''The language
clarifies that the town's parks and beaches are intended to exist
for the benefit of the public, including the town's residents.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could potentially affect dozens of other shoreline
communities in the state. Only 30 miles of Connecticut's 78 miles
of sandy beach are public, according to the state Department of
Environmental Protection. The remaining 48 miles are under various
restrictions -- either privately run or under the control of
associations.
</P>
<P>
   The court declined to rule on Leydon's First Amendment claim
because the judges do not consider constitutional issues if they
can otherwise decide a case.
</P>
<P>
   Leydon said that when the case is over he will take advantage of
Greenwich's sandy shores.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't say this was solely to go to Greenwich Point; it
was more to establish a principle,'' he said. ''But I definitely
plan on going. I'm probably going to have a little party.''

<HEADLINE> Stronger Hurricanes Forecast in 2000  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane season is fast approaching and the
outlook isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Federal storm specialists predicted an above-average storm
season Wednesday, calling for stronger, longer-lasting storms this
year, and more of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane season officially begins June 1, and the outlook is
for 11 tropical storms, seven of which will be hurricanes, three of
them major.
</P>
<P>
   ''This puts coastal areas and the Caribbean islands at a much
higher risk of experiencing a tropical storm or hurricane,'' said
D. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast is similar to last year's, which was followed by a
series of serious storms, including Hurricane Floyd, that caused
massive evacuations along the Southeastern coast and then inundated
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The La Nina cooling of water in the Pacific Ocean, the same
condition that influenced the 1999 season, remains in place, Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For this reason we expect we'll have another major economic
impact on the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just about the number'' of storms, added Max
Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
''What really counts is where they make landfall and how strong
they are. Just one hurricane over your community makes it a very
bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, stressed the importance of having a plan and being prepared
for the storms. He cited community efforts, including Project
Impact, which helps people strengthen their homes against storms of
all types.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Witt signed a memorandum pledging to work closely
together to warn people of impending storms and help them prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter how good the forecast is if people don't
plan in advance,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's evacuations left thousands of people trapped on
jammed highways for hours and the forecasters said that is a
problem they hope to avoid in the future. Coastal areas subject to
flooding need to be evacuated in storms, but not every place that
merely expects wind damage, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You flee from storm surge, you hide from wind,'' said
Mayfield, calling on people to get storm shutters, build safe rooms
and take other steps to prepare their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The new outlook from the government forecasters echoes that of
Bill Gray of Colorado State University, one of the few willing to
make long-range storm predictions. For this season he also
predicted 11 named storms.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield was picked last week to replace the retired Jerry
Jarrell as director of the hurricane center.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week a new weather satellite was launched that can be
pressed into service this summer if needed. The $220 million GOES-L
satellite had been delayed a year.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters rely on two Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites to monitor tropical storms and other
severe weather. The East Coast's GOES-8, however, is a year beyond
its design lifetime. Although still working, it could break down at
any moment. GOES-L is a crucial backup.
</P>
<P>
   While some climate experts have been blaming the increase in
tropical storms in recent years on global warming, Gray says the
trend is cyclical and not related to warming.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this Wednesday, Baker agreed. ''We don't see, at
this point, a link between global warming and tropical cyclone
activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical cyclones is another name for hurricanes, which are also
called typhoons in some parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three decades forecasters have gotten better at
predicting where the storms will go, researchers Colin McAdie and
Miles Lawrence report in the May issue of the Bulletin of the
American Meteorological Society.
</P>
<P>
   They found that from 1970 to 1998 track forecast errors
decreased by about 1 percent per year for the 24-hour forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a yearly basis, it's a small improvement, but one that
yields a cumulative benefit,'' said McAdie, a research
meteorologist at NOAA's Tropical Prediction Center in Miami. ''The
24 hour forecast error expected 30 years ago of about 140 miles has
been reduced to about 100 miles today.''

<HEADLINE> Bishop Egan, candidate for archbishop, celebrates Mass under mediaspotlight  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Bishop Edward M. Egan, a leading
candidate to become archbishop of New York, made light of the media
spotlight as he celebrated Mass Wednesday in honor of two longtime
parish priests.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from Connecticut and New York crowded near the gray
stone pulpit at St. Augustine Cathedral to hear whether Egan would
address the successor to Cardinal John O'Connor, who died last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, in a deep and resonant voice, spoke of the first time he
met Pope John Paul II and the significance of the Mass to priests
and congregants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is more important to me -- nothing -- than to be united
with the priests of this diocese as a brother who stands at the
altar in the person of Jesus Christ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He joked several times to the chuckles of parishioners that the
usually quiet noon service had some guests from the media.
</P>
<P>
   During the quiet ceremony, cameras clicked shots of Egan, who
was dressed in a white robe with gold trim and a reddish-pink
skullcap.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the Mass, Egan left the altar to wish peace
upon parishioners, then moved to the other side of the church and
stood before the cameras and reporters to say, ''Peace be with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you to our visitors,'' Egan said at the close of the
service. ''We extend to all of them a cordial invitation to be at
the 12:10 Mass every day here at St. Augustine's Church. You are
always welcome here.''
</P>
<P>
   He left at the end of a procession of other priests and altar
attendants. He did not give a statement to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The service was arranged a year ago, in honor of the 25th year
of priesthood for the Rev. Robert G. Pohley of Sacred Heart Church
of Stamford and the Rev. Dennis Bludnicki of St. Ambrose Church in
Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who had been archbishop since 1984, died last week and
was buried Monday. Official word of his successor comes from the
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners wished Egan well if he should go to New York. They
praised his work to strengthen Roman Catholic schools and draw more
young men into the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's done quite a bit for our parish here. He's given his all
for us,'' said Juan Hernandez, who gave Egan a thumbs up sign as
Egan shook hands with parishioners. ''New York is a big city. A lot
more help is needed over there.''

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Near Confrontation  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Erstwhile allies Rwanda and Uganda edged
closer to serious confrontation Wednesday, as they accused each
other of setting off another round of fighting in northern Congo
and Rwanda's top army commander warned of a large buildup of
Ugandan troops on their common border.
</P>
<P>
   President Paul Kagame said he was hopeful that a meeting in
Tanzania this weekend with his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri
Museveni, would prevent an escalation and resolve tensions that
soared after the two armies clashed in the northern Congolese city
of Kisangani last week.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting Wednesday in Kigali between Rwandan army commander
Brig. Gen. Kayumba Nyamwasa and his Ugandan counterpart, Maj. Gen.
Jeje Odongo, yielded no concrete results. Later, Nyamwasa said
efforts to calm tensions were seriously undermined by Uganda's
''warlike rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyamwasa said the Ugandans had deployed troops along their
common border, but both he and Kagame ruled out an immediate
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall remain in our positions. As long as they deploy in
their own country, I'm not concerned at all,'' Nyamwasa said.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda's government-owned New Vision newspaper reported
Wednesday that about 1,000 troops were digging in 2 miles north of
the Kagitumba border crossing with Rwanda, and even more soldiers
were on the move along the mountainous frontier to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers from Ruhengeri, 60 miles northwest of Kigali, said
they had seen truckloads of Rwandan soldiers heading north toward
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial traffic across the busy border has virtually ceased,
and only a few cars were crossing, the travelers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been no troop movement on our side of the border.
But troops have been moving on the Ugandan side,'' Kagame said
during a joint appearance with Clare Short, the British minister
for overseas development. She called the situation ''a little bit
worrying'' and said Britain, the major donor and a key ally to both
countries, would try to calm things down on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to call each other enemies ... Underlying causes
of this are not clear to some of us. We have to find a solution,''
Kagame said.
</P>
<P>
   His adviser, Theogene Rudasingwa, said Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapathe would join the Rwandan and Ugandan presidents at
a meeting Sunday at the Lake Victoria port of Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
   The participation of South African President Thabo Mbeki had yet
to be confirmed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Friday, the two armies have battled in the northern
Congolese city of Kisangani, leaving at least 15 civilians dead and
100 wounded. At least 15 soldiers were also killed, including five
Rwandans, Nyamwasa said.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda and Rwanda back rival Congolese rebel factions opposed to
President Laurent Kabila. Troops from both countries are deployed
in Kisangani in support of the rebels, and both countries view the
city, with its two decaying airports, as a strategic rear base for
their units deployed elsewhere in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,500 U.N. troops are supposed to deploy in Congo to
protect unarmed U.N. military observers as part of the peace
process to end the 22-month civil war in which Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia are backing Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a U.N. Security Council team led by U.S. Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke helped mediate an agreement between Museveni and
Kagame to hand control of Kisangani, Congo's third-largest city,
over to a U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. team from the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, was expected
to land on Thursday at Bangoka airport where the Rwandans and
Ugandans clashed to inspect the logistical needs for the larger
U.N. force.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond was
expected to spend a second night at a Washington hospital Wednesday
for treatment of an upset stomach and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican, at age 97 the oldest serving U.S. senator in

<HEADLINE> US Defends Against Rights Report  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Stung by a report that Washington picks what human
rights treaties to observe, the United States said on Wednesday its
standards rank ''near the very top.''
</P>
<P>
   The London-based human rights organization Amnesty
International, which on Tuesday produced a 45-page report on what
it said were cases of torture in the United States, said in a
statement that Washington had to be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have long expressed concern about the U.S. pick-and-choose
approach to international human rights treaties,'' Amnesty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such an approach undermines not only the protection afforded
to individuals in the United States but also the whole enterprise
of creating a viable international system to ensure respect for
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Harold Koh, who disputed the
Amnesty charges at the U.N. Committee against Torture, defended
U.S. standards at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to put the situation into some perspective,'' he said.
''We believe the U.S. record ranks near the very top.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't a single problem on which we haven't taken some
form of remedial action if the concerns are indeed legitimate
ones,'' Koh said.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the charge that Washington sets its own standards on
whether it committed torture, Koh said:
</P>
<P>
   ''Our record is completely open and transparent and we are in
compliance. In the areas where we are not in compliance we have
been forthright and honest about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty's report alleged brutality, beatings and shootings by
police, sexual abuse of female prisoners, cruel conditions in
isolation units, ill-treatment of racial minorities and use of stun
guns and pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   Koh said the United States was a country where people who had
been tortured or mistreated had the right to complain and could
expect that justice would be done.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat rejected Amnesty's claims that the use of stun
guns, stun belts and pepper spray constituted torture. ''These are
nonlethal methods that are being used in extreme circumstances,''
Koh said. ''They are not used for punitive purposes.''

<HEADLINE> Troops Ready for Attack in Freetown  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Thousands of refugees poured into
Freetown on Wednesday as pro-government troops rushed to key towns
near Sierra Leone's steamy seaside capital to prepare for a feared
rebel attack.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers, the Sierra Leone army and pro-government
militia fighters were consolidating their forces along the road
into the capital from Waterloo, 15 miles away, where fleeing
residents said they heard the sound of gunfire Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Waterloo is now the front line,'' said Joseph Jalloh, an army
commander.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government expected an attack there by forces of the
rebel Revolutionary United Front. The rebels -- who killed thousands
during a civil war that ended last July -- have thrown the nation's
peace process into jeopardy, taking U.N. peacekeepers hostage,
clashing with pro-government forces and shooting civilian
protesters in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The massing of pro-government forces followed a night of
sporadic gunfire in three locations within 50 miles of the capital,
a U.N. official said. It was unclear whether these incidents
foreshadowed an impending rebel offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the apprehension was the mystery of rebel leader Foday
Sankoh's whereabouts. He disappeared Monday after his bodyguards
shot and killed at least four demonstrators outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said peacekeepers were
taking up defensive positions in readiness for possible fighting.
''We hope that it's not going to come to a pitched battle, but in a
sense we're preparing for one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters loyal to former military ruler Johnny Paul Koroma sped
to Waterloo on Wednesday. An aide to Koroma said President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah had authorized Koroma's forces to defend Freetown. The
aide, Prince Nicol, dismissed any defensive tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. still insists their mandate is not to fight. We are
not waiting for them,'' Nicol said.
</P>
<P>
   Passing government forces as they rushed from Freetown were
thousands of Sierra Leoneans arriving by foot, car and truck in the
capital, fearful of a spread of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last time they (the rebels) came, it happened like this. We
were not going to wait for them,'' said Rominus Conteh, sitting on
a bundle filled with the few possessions he could carry. Conteh
said he and his family had fled a refugee camp in Waterloo after
hearing gunfire Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bintou Bomeh, a pregnant 18-year-old with a cloth bundle
containing some shriveled onions atop her head, said the gunshots
near Masiaka on Monday forced her to leave home. ''I'm frightened
now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In their eight-year campaign to oust Kabbah's government before
signing a power-sharing agreement in July, the rebels mutilated and
dismembered their victims by the thousands. Limbless men, women and
children -- some fitted with prostheses, most not -- are a frequent
sight here.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Sierra Leone has become increasingly chaotic
since a Nigerian-led regional intervention force -- which had been
in the country along with U.N. peacekeepers to enforce July's peace
agreement -- pulled out last week. Since then, clashes have broken
out intermittently between peacekeepers and rebels. Some 500
peacekeepers are being held hostage by the RUF. At least one
peacekeeper is believed to be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has said the U.S. Air Force is prepared to fly in a
battalion of U.N. peacekeepers from Bangladesh -- roughly 700 to 800
soldiers -- in coming days. The United Nations wants to speed up
deployment of that battalion and two others scheduled to arrive by
mid-July, bringing the U.N. force up to its full strength of
11,100.
</P>
<P>
   Canada said Wednesday it was sending a plane to help ferry 1,800
Indian and Bangladeshi peacekeepers to the West African nation. In
London, British Defense Minister Geoff Hoon said British troops
would defend Freetown's airport but would not join the U.N. force
to quell any rebel threat. Hoon told the British Broadcasting Corp.
the soldiers would only guard the airport to allow evacuation of
British nationals and the reinforcement of the U.N. peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have said the peacekeepers in Sierra Leone are
not a well-honed fighting force. On Wednesday, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan chastised powerful members states for not sending their
better-trained forces to assist the embattled mission.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone is among the world's poorest countries despite vast
diamond resources. In principle, the rebels and Sankoh were
included in the power-sharing deal that ended the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday if the United Nations had been duped by Sankoh,
the U.N. special representative to Sierra Leone, Oluyemi Adeniji,
said ''that is a conclusion that you may reach now.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Weizman Collapses  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Days before he is expected to announce his
retirement, Israeli President Ezer Weizman collapsed due to
dehydration Wednesday but later recovered and attended an awards
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman, 76, collapsed on the lawn of his residence after
hosting the diplomatic corps at a reception marking Israel's 52nd
Independence Day. Two bodyguards picked him up and assisted him as
he entered his residence with faltering steps.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor diagnosed dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ''The President feels good, it was only a fleeting moment of
dizziness,'' Dr. Felix Umanski said on Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Weizman stood erect and sang the Israeli
national anthem at the annual Israel Prize awards ceremony. He also
delivered the prize to the winners.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman said last month that he would step down this
Independence Day, which began Tuesday night, due to ill health. But
he said he was delaying his resignation while police investigated
hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts he accepted from a French
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Police recommended that Weizman not be indicted. He then said he
was waiting for the attorney general's report, expected next week,
before he announces his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman has admitted accepting cash gifts from French textiles
magnate Edouard Sarousi, but says he did nothing wrong. Police said
his failure to report the gifts constituted fraud, but that the
statute of limitations has run out.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's second five-year term is supposed to expire in 2003.
The 120-member parliament, the Knesset, elects the president. In
informal polls, legislators have heavily favored former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres, currently a Cabinet minister, as Weizman's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman is known for his outspoken, plain language. He has
managed to offend women, gays, the Orthodox and Diaspora Jews in
his many tirades. Yet his very outspokenness -- and his tireless
work with the war-wounded and with bereaved families -- endear him
to many.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman has been an influential backer of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's peace initiatives. There were calls for his resignation
even before the money scandal broke from hard-liners who said he
was undermining the presidency's impartiality.

<HEADLINE> Self-Exiled Lebanese Pol Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Raymond Edde, a Lebanese politician who spent 24
years in self-imposed exile, refusing to return to his homeland
unless Syria and Israel withdrew their troops, died Wednesday in
Paris. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Edde's death was confirmed by the Lebanese Embassy. No cause of
death was given.
</P>
<P>
   A Christian, Edde was a moderate who advocated coexistence with
other political and religious groups in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Edde represented the Byblos district north of Beirut in the
Lebanese parliament from 1953 to 1976, except for a one-year
absence in 1964. He ran unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1958
and 1976 and held various Cabinet positions.
</P>
<P>
   Edde went into self-imposed exile in 1976 after surviving three
assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed all foreign interference in Lebanon, and said he
would not return unless Israel and Syria withdrew their soldiers
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Edde was born March 15, 1913, in Alexandria, Egypt, where his
family had fled after being condemned to death by the Ottoman
authorities in the waning years of the empire.
</P>
<P>
   The family returned to Beirut in 1920, where Edde attended a
Jesuit high school and university from which he received his law
degree in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Emile, served as Lebanon's president from 1936 to
1941. Edde succeeded his father as head of the National Bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Edde is survived by a brother, Pierre, a financier and
politician. Their sister was killed by a sniper in Beirut in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Congress Fights Over Elderly Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Democrats closed ranks Wednesday
behind President Clinton's plan to create a new Medicare
prescription drug benefit, preparing for an election-year wrangle
with Republicans who prefer expanding access to private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were calling for a bipartisan push to resolve the
issue, but many observers say chances for a compromise this year
are low.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very good issue in the election; it will be tougher to
enact and make the plan work,'' said Bob Blendon, a Harvard
professor of health policy and political analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Blendon predicted lawmakers ''will get a more consistent
proposal that they're going to run on. We'll have two divergent
views, but they're not going to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, about 60 House and Senate Democrats came to the
White House to announce that they had solidified party support for
legislation based on Clinton's year-old proposal to add drug
coverage to Medicare that any senior citizen could get for about
$25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prescription drugs are an integral part of medicine today.
They ought to be an integral part of Medicare,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are pitting their plan against an alternative
being developed by House Republicans, which would help senior
citizens get private drug insurance and provide subsidies for those
with the lowest incomes and highest bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's enough to stop at $15,000 income limit to
give help on prescription drugs,'' Clinton said of the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans made it clear in a letter sent to Clinton on
Wednesday that they are equally troubled by the Democrats'
approach. They have scheduled a hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned that the government would have too heavy a
hand in controlling the drug benefit, denying some seniors the
right to choose the coverage that best fits their needs,'' said the
letter, signed by Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, and
Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., who heads the panel's health care
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans deny the charge that their plan would help only
retirees qualifying for direct subsidies. They say that the
government would also provide financial support to help insurance
companies develop new drug policies that would result in more
choices and lower prices for all senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies continue to criticize the Democrats' plan as
''Washington command and control of health care,'' while the
insurance industry has raised concerns about whether private drug
insurance policies of the kind Republicans envision would be
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare benefit outlined by congressional Democrats on
Wednesday would pay for 50 percent of the cost of the first $2,000
in prescriptions annually, rising to $5,000 by 2009. Low-income
beneficiaries up to 135 percent of the government's poverty level
would receive subsidies, and beneficiaries with slightly higher
incomes would receive a slightly reduced subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Democrats said the plan envisions catastrophic
coverage after out-of-pocket expenses exceed a certain level,
likely $3,000 to $4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan left out proposals favored by some Democrats to
directly curb prescription prices -- such as by requiring drug
makers to sell to pharmacies that serve the elderly at discounts
received by other federal programs, including the veteran's health
care system.

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Linguists rejoice. There's hope yet for
George W. Bush, who when at a loss for a word to describe Israel
once labeled the important U.S. ally a ''buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate joked
Wednesday that he had ordered a batch of ''Verbal Advantage''
vocabulary tapes, which promise users ''a Harvard graduate's
vocabulary in just 15 minutes a day.''
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush jokes with his traveling press corps
that he has no chance in the general election against Democrat Al
Gore because the vice president graduated from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush graduated from Harvard Business School, he has an
undergraduate degree from Yale, an Ivy League rival to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   In a note written across a Verbal Advantage magazine ad, Bush
told a television producer who graduated from Harvard: ''I have
just ordered several. What do you think? Do I have a chance to have
a Harvard vocabulary?''

<HEADLINE> House May Extend Web Tax Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even though the current Internet tax
moratorium does not expire until October 2001, the House today
voted to extend the ban for five years but put aside for now the
thornier issue of how state sales taxes should apply to electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the momentum for this. We don't want to get caught up
in the more controversial sales tax issue,'' said Rep. Bob
Goodlatte, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led House voted 352-75 to pass legislation that
would extend until the fall of 2006 the moratorium on new taxes and
those that single out the Internet. It would also repeal a
provision that allows some states and cities to keep taxes they had
in place in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment that would have extended the ban for two years and
kept that provision, backed by the Clinton administration, was
defeated by 219-208.
</P>
<P>
   The White House today issued a statement opposing the five-year
version because it could delay congressional consideration of the
sales tax issue and create ''uncertainty in a vital and rapidly
growing industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which now goes to the Senate, is part of an effort
this month by the House GOP leadership to underscore their support
for the Internet and the high-tech industry in this election year.
The Commerce Committee was moving legislation permanently banning
fees on Internet use and next week a bill repealing the
102-year-old 3 percent telephone excise tax is likely to move
through the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republican leaders today announced details of their
''E-Contract 2000'' that highlights the tax measures and several
other bills sought by the high-tech sector Congress will consider
this year, including an increase in visas for highly skilled
foreign workers and permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking about maintaining freedom and growth of this
driving engine of the world economy,'' said House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-Texas. ''We believe that we are hitting the
injustices in the tax code that the American people see as either
obstructive to progress or just plain unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats, however, see the list of GOP initiatives as
geared mainly to gain political favor with Internet and computer
companies -- with their deep pockets of campaign contributions -- as
the two sides struggle for control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leadership sees this as another opportunity to play to the
high-tech crowd,'' said Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed against the extending the moratorium are state and local
officials, including 39 governors worried about future revenue
losses, and bricks-and-mortar retailers afraid the Internet will
get an unfair advantage. Although the moratorium doesn't directly
affect sales taxes -- under a Supreme Court ruling, states can't
collect them unless an Internet or catalog business has a physical
presence in that state -- opponents say it could effectively put the
issue off for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ''In five years, it may be too late to do anything,'' said Rep.
Ernest Istook, R-Okla., in a letter to colleagues. ''Destroying the
tax base that finances education won't boost a high-tech future,
but it will destroy the chances for that future.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and Republicans alike say either the extension is
likely to easily pass the House, to head for an uncertain future in
the Senate. Armey said that would give states and traditional
retailers a chance to gather better information about the impact of
Internet sales and how to streamline tax rates in thousands of
different states, counties and cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are essentially saying, rather than legislate what is
your worst fears, let's legislate our highest hope for growth and
development,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reps. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., and John Lewis, D-Ga.,
introduced a bill Tuesday that would eliminate any income tax
consequences for workers who take advantage of their employers'
gift of free computers or cut-rate Internet access. Ford Motor Co.,
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Intel Corp. have all begun
such programs, but most tax experts say workers will likely owe
taxes unless the law is changed.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The tax moratorium extension bill is H.R. 3709.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-free computer bill is H.R. 4274.

Kosovo Serbs Rally for Information   
By CVJETKO UDOVICIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Serbs protested
Wednesday in the province's most tense city and in the nation's
capital, Belgrade, demanding swift trials for jailed relatives and
information on missing Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Kosovo, a grenade and machine gun fire wounded five
Kosovo Serbs, the private Beta news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 protesters -- many of them wives, children or other
relatives of Serb prisoners -- gathered outside the jailhouse in
Kosovska Mitrovica, an industrial city bitterly split along into
ethnic Albanian and Serb sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let truth conquer doubt,'' read one banner, while others
pleaded: ''Give me back my dad'' and ''My father is innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware of the problems regarding Kosovo's judicial
system,'' the local NATO commander, French Brig. Gen. Pierre de
Saqui de Sannes, told protesters, alluding to the backlog of cases
awaiting trial because of lack of personnel and inadequate
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said the 37 Serb prisoners in Kosovska Mitrovica had
not eaten since April 12 in protest to the ''unbalanced treatment''
they allegedly received at the hands of NATO. They said they were
being held indefinitely, with little or no prospect of court
action.
</P>
<P>
   Local Serb representative Oliver Ivanovic said the Serb side
would expect U.N. and NATO peacekeepers to come up with a solution
by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a unique legal case, with prison inmates protesting
not over whether they are guilty or not, but over a lack of
trial,'' Ivanovic told protesters.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade -- which is capital both of Yugoslavia and its
largest republic, Serbia -- the families of several hundred missing
Kosovo Serbs held a protest march demanding their loved ones be
released or at least accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Here the banners shouted: ''Where is my grandpa?'' and ''We want
our children back!'' They asked for information on the 1,200 or so
Serbs believed abducted or killed in Kosovo since early 1998. Most
are believed to have fallen victim to ethnic Albanians seeking
revenge for the Serb crackdown that ended in June after NATO's
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation that some of the missing Serbs are alive
and being held in secret, Albanian-run prison camps. However,
NATO-led peacekeepers have found no such prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters in Belgrade directed their demands toward several
parties: the authorities of Yugoslavia, NATO countries with troops
in Kosovo, U.N. officials now running the province and the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Holding photographs of the missing, the protesters marched past
the Yugoslav parliament and embassies of several NATO member
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at least five Kosovo Serbs were wounded Tuesday
night, when an unidentified man hurled a grenade into a shop in the
town of Cernica, 20 miles southeast of Pristina, Beta reported. The
man then opened fire with a machine gun. One person was seriously
injured, while the others were slightly hurt, Beta said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Pristina confirmed the attack, but said six
people had been wounded. They said a grenade was thrown, but did
not mention machine gun fire.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 199; Dow Sheds 169  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, pushing the Nasdaq
composite index down nearly 200 points, as investors fretted about
interest rates and continued their flight from high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq fell 199.44 to
close at 3,385.57. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 168.97 to
close at 10,367.78. Earlier in the session, both indicators had
fallen more than 200 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks bore the brunt of investors' distress today,
with several industry leaders falling sharply. Cisco fell. After
the close of trading Tuesday, the Internet equipment provider
reported net income of $662 million, or 9 cents per share, beating
Wall Street analysts' expectations by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   But shares of Cisco have been out of favor all week after a
story in Barron's magazine said the stock is overvalued and
acquisitions will prove increasingly difficult because of
escalating purchase prices of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lead horse in the technology sector is Cisco Systems,''
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist at Dunvegan Associates
in Santa Barbara, Calif. ''Its decline was enough to send a shiver
through the rest of the technology sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel tumbled after the company said it shipped nearly 1 million
computer circuit boards that could contain a defect that destroys
important files.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell a day after CEO Louis Gerstner made his annual address
to Wall Street. Gerstner said the company's financial model calls
for high single-digit revenue growth, not the brisk double-digit
expansion achieved in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola plunged after Salomon Smith Barney cut its rating on
the stock to ''outperform'' from ''buy.'' Analyst Alex Cena said
Motorola recently lost a major customer to competitor Nortel,
limiting its potential for dramatic earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   The downbeat news on four technology bellwethers forced
investors to reconsider the high prices of many stocks in the
sector, analysts said. Hewlett-Packard fell steeply without
releasing any significant news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks are under pressure because they still have
extremely high valuations,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ''Six months ago, people said it
didn't matter what they cost; you had to own them anyway. Now
there's a sense that what you pay for a stock really does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said investors were shying away from expensive technology
stocks because they fear rising interest rates will compromise
their rapid growth rates. The Fed is expected to raise rates by as
much as a half-percentage point at its meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks weren't the sole source of the Dow's weakness.
General Motors fell after a Merrill Lynch analyst cut his rating on
the stock to ''neutral'' from ''accumulate.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of merger talks sparked buying in the paper
sector. Champion International rose after both International Paper
and UPM-Kymmene of Finland raised their bids for the company. The
new IP bid values Champion at about $7.3 billion, and UPM's bid
would be worth about $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly light, continuing a string of quiet sessions
as many market players stay on the sidelines awaiting the Fed's
next move.
</P>
<P>
   ''The background to all of this is the Fed,'' Moore said. ''The
fear of interest rates is continuing to take a toll on stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next two sessions, investors will receive some economic
data that could indicate whether the economy is growing fast enough
to merit a sharp rate increase. On Thursday, the Commerce
Department will report on retail sales in the month of April. On
Friday, the Labor Deparment will release its Producer Price Index,
which measures inflationary pressures at the wholesale level.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 29.06 to 1,383.07.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 2,106 down, 908 up and 428 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 972.31 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
889.82 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies of smaller companies
fell 15.31 to 475.55.

<HEADLINE> Fowl Play in Portugal Blackout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- New evidence found Wednesday points to
fowl play in a power outage that plunged the entire southern half
of Portugal, including the capital Lisbon, into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The stork did it.
</P>
<P>
   National grid company REN said a dead stork was found at the
foot of a pylon after presumably touching a high-voltage power line
and causing a short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic protection system at a major substation in Rio
Maior, 50 miles north of Lisbon, did not function and the short
circuit caused a domino effect that knocked out other substations
further south, REN spokesman Gil Vicente told state radio RDP.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of stork nest on top of pylons in rural Portugal. The
company said birds occasionally hit power lines but the short
circuits normally are confined to one line.
</P>
<P>
   The lights went out in Lisbon and along a 180-mile mostly rural
stretch to the Algarve coastal area around 10 p.m. Tuesday. Several
million people live in the affected region.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout ended in Lisbon after almost two hours, but power
did not return to some suburbs of the capital until Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   No damage was reported.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Principal Held on Abuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The principal of an exclusive Swiss
school that Britain's Princess Beatrice is to attend is being held
in prison on charges that he abused his own children, an
investigating judge said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McDonald, the principal of Aiglon College, has been
arrested and charged but has yet to appear in court, Judge Jacques
Antenen said, confirming a news report in the Lausanne daily 24
Heures. Antenen gave no further details and declined to specify the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Aiglon spokesman Frank Klein said McDonald took a sabbatical in
January and did not return to his job in April as planned because
of ''domestic circumstances'' that made it impossible for him to
continue at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is the latest to hit the $26,300-a-year school.
</P>
<P>
   In March, three teen-age girls were sexually assaulted at Aiglon
by an unknown man. The school confirmed the attack, but denied
there had been a sexual element.
</P>
<P>
   Investigating magistrate Pierre Veillon told 24 Heures he could
not understand why Aiglon issued the denial. ''The victims have
been reinterviewed, and sexual acts did indeed take place,''
Veillon told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   All three girls are now back in classes, the school said. There
was no link to the case involving McDonald, who was already in
custody when the girls were attacked, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A Buckingham Palace spokesman said Prince Andrew and his
ex-wife, Sarah, still plan to send Beatrice, 11, to the school in
September, despite the headmaster's arrest. ''The allegations are a
matter for Mr. McDonald and the Swiss prosecutors,'' the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aiglon is one of a group of international schools that subscribe
to the Kurt Hahn education philosophy, which focuses on practical
as well academic work. It has 300 pupils ages 9 to 18 from about 50
countries.

<HEADLINE> Feds Report Many Inmates on Drugs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reflecting the problem of drug use behind bars
across the country, 10.5 percent of jail inmates who underwent drug
tests turned up positive, the government reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide study of jail inmates and drugs as of June 1998,
more than two-thirds of the 712 jails that tested inmates had at
least one inmate who tested positive, the Bureau of Justice
Statistics found.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics also underscored the connection between crime and
drugs. Seventy percent of all inmates in local jails -- 417,000
people -- had committed a drug offense or used drugs regularly, the
bureau said. In 1989, the number was 261,000 or 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasted with prisons, local jails generally hold defendants
awaiting trial, as well as convicts serving sentences of a year or
less.
</P>
<P>
   In the testing done in June 1998, 36,200 inmates, 10.5 percent,
tested positive. In larger jurisdictions of 1,000 or more inmates,
7 percent of those tested came out positive. Some jails conduct
random tests while others test when there is some indication that
an inmate is using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread incidence of drug use in jail prompted
disciplinary measures by local corrections officials.
</P>
<P>
   When inmates test positive for drug use, 70 percent of the
jurisdictions usually took away inmate privileges and about half
took away good time or reclassified the offender to a higher
security level. Most jurisdictions have substance abuse treatment
or self-help programs such as Narcotics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   When the bureau interviewed convicted jail inmates, 16 percent
said they committed their offenses to get money for drugs and
two-thirds of all convicted jail inmates said they were actively
involved with drugs before their admission to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five percent of jail inmates said they used drugs in the
month before their offense. About one-fifth of those inmates
participated in substance abuse programs or treatment since being
sent to jail.

<HEADLINE> 2 Paper Cos. Boost Champion Bids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The paper industry, which has not been known for
high-stakes takeover battles, is suddenly heating up.
</P>
<P>
   In separate moves revealed Wednesday, the two rival bidders for
Champion International each sweetened their offers raising the
stakes for the Stamford, Conn.-based company to more than $7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper is hoping to be the spoiler of a deal
reached in February between Champion and European paper giant
UPM-Kymmene of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   UPM's all-stock deal was originally worth $6.6 billion but later
fell to $5 billion because of a decline in the UPM's shares.
</P>
<P>
   IP, which jumped in two weeks ago with a surprise cash-and-stock
bid of $64 a share for Champion, upped the ante to $75 a share late
Tuesday and increased the cash component of the offer to from $43
to $50.
</P>
<P>
   UPM also increased its offer, bidding $70 per share in cash. The
total value of IP's offer is still richer at $7.3 billion, but UPM
has until Friday to make another offer.
</P>
<P>
   UPM's current offer values Champion at about $6.7 billion.
Champion also has about $2.3 billion in debt that would be taken on
by the company that acquires it.
</P>
<P>
   Champion's shares jumped after news of the rival bids hit the
market. Champion shares were up $6.06\ at $72.37{ in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, while IP was off 43} cents at $36.81\ and
UPM's New York-listed shares were up $1.87{ at $30.25.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding war comes shortly after another sizable merger in
the global paper industry. Just five days after UPM's merger accord
with Champion was announced in February, the Finnish-Swedish forest
products company Stora Enso announced a deal to acquire
Consolidated Papers Inc. of Wisconsin for about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper is the world's largest paper maker with
$24.6 billion in revenues and 99,000 employees. Champion has $5.3
billion in revenues and 18,000 employees, while UPM has $9.7
billion and 32,000 employees.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Bourbon Leaks Into Water Supply  </HEADLINE>
By MARK R. CHELLGREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCEBURG, Ky. (AP) -- Who would have thought bourbon and
water would be a problem in Kentucky?
</P>
<P>
   A fire at a distillery warehouse destroyed more than 17,000
oaken barrels of Wild Turkey and sent flaming bourbon into the
water supply, forcing schools and businesses in this town of 8,000
to close Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The liquor never got into the tap water, because the water plant
shut down as the bourbon -- some of it superbly well-aged at 15
years old -- splashed by on its way into the Kentucky River. But the
warehouse about 100 yards up the hill was reduced to rubble in the
blaze Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople joked about drunken fish and free drinks down at the
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just tell them we're having Happy Hour at the river later.
Just bring their own bucket,'' said city worker Debbie Steele.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries in the blaze, though two firefighters
were treated for heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the Boulevard Distillers plant were on strike for
about four weeks until about a month ago. But Gregg Snyder,
managing director of the plant, said he had no reason to believe
the blaze was related to the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, water plant workers tried to get pumping again,
and distillery employees bottled bourbon from the remaining 11
warehouses. Snyder said there is plenty of bourbon in the remaining
warehouses at the plant, which employs 150 workers, and supplies
should not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental officials found no fish kills and said no other
community water supplies were in danger. The capital, Frankfort, is
about 15 miles down river.
</P>
<P>
   This is the heart of bourbon country in a state known for
thoroughbreds, bluegrass and bourbon, a breed of whiskey made for
sipping. On Kentucky Derby Day, it's the main ingredient in mint
juleps.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, there were 16 distilleries in Anderson County
alone. Mergers and closings have concentrated the business, leaving
16 distilleries in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Bourbon must, by federal decree, contain at least 51 percent
corn, along with wheat, rye, barley, other grains and yeast. It is
aged in 53-gallon oaken casks for years, sometimes as little as
four, or as many as 15.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the water plant reported hearing an explosion and
watching the warehouse reduced to a burning heap in a few minutes.
The warehouses are about seven stories high, with wooden frames and
tin siding, and contain young bourbon that is more volatile than
the well-aged stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said the barrels lost in the fire had been stored
anywhere from three months to 15 years. The alcohol content
decreases as the liquor ages, with Wild Turkey sold in its flagship
101 proof version -- roughly 50 percent alcohol -- as well as 80
proof or in products such as liqueur.

<HEADLINE> China Watchdog Plan Gains Support  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal for a watchdog commission to
monitor human rights in China appeared to be gaining ground
Wednesday as backers of a landmark China trade pact worked hard to
build critically needed support.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed side language was being refined as the top
Republican House vote counter, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
suggested GOP support for the pact appears weaker than hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have to do our traditional hand-to-hand
combat,'' DeLay told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The House will vote the week of May 22 on the
administration-supported measure to extend permanent normal trade
relations to China and ease its entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Given the large number of lawmakers from both parties who remain
undecided, supporters conceded they do not now have the votes to
pass the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, DeLay predicted, ''I think in the end we will win.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission plan by Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Doug
Bereuter, R-Neb., drew tentative backing from both the White House
and key Republicans as possibly the best chance to shore up needed
support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is we need some more votes,'' said GOP Rep. Bill
Archer of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Archer and other Republican leaders suggested the language would
have to be carefully worded to attract wavering Democrats without
losing GOP support.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic and Republican leaders expect the House vote to
be extremely close. Passage requires 218 votes in the 435-member
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay would not discuss details of a GOP head count done by his
office this week. Other GOP officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the tally suggested Republican leaders are looking
at from 140-145 Republican votes -- not the 150 widely circulated
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Democratic supporters said they doubted they
could line up more than 70 to 80 Democratic votes. But DeLay said
Democrats need to furnish between 85 and 90 votes for the measure
to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill is expected to face a much easier time in the
Senate, which will not consider it until June. The Senate Finance
Committee will vote on it next week, said the chairman, Sen.
William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   The commission plan likely will be voted on this month when the
House considers the underlying China trade bill. A similar plan is
expected to be proposed in the Senate by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   The commission -- jointly appointed by Congress and the president
-- could recommend trade sanctions against Beijing if abuses of
human rights or worker protections continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will place an ongoing and focused spotlight on China,
rather than the temporary and diffuse spotlight of an annual
review,'' Levin told the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Congress currently considers China's trade status annually.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and congressional sponsors preferred
legislation without any such side agreements -- but said they might
have to support such a mechanism as the price for passage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it addresses some of the human rights concerns some of
the members have talked about, some of the trade-compliance
concerns,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic supporters suggested the commission proposal could
make the underlying China trade legislation more palatable to
wavering members, especially Democrats under pressure to vote
''no'' by organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan was greeted with skepticism -- from an unusual
alliance of conservatives, organized labor and human-rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney called the commission plan ''a
toothless paper tiger solution to a flesh-and-blood problem.'' Rep.
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., a member the International Relations
Committee, called it ''a cover, a fig leaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee for Human
Rights scoffed at the monitoring idea, saying Chinese workers have
been imprisoned as long as 15 years for activities such as passing
information on working conditions to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   His group released a 115-page report Wednesday detailing what he
said were ''brutal ... sweatshop conditions'' in Chinese factories
making export goods.

<HEADLINE> Germans Debate Custody Issue  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department offered strong support
Wednesday for an American father's efforts to regain custody of his
two children, who have been living in a German foster home for
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   A German court ruled in 1995 that the children had bonded with
their foster family and would suffer severe psychological loss if
they were to be separated from the family.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Joseph Cooke, of New York City, had been granted
custody of Danny, 10, and Michelle, almost 9, by a U.S. court. He
has been fighting for years to be reunited with them.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke believes he is entitled to custody under terms of the
Hague Convention of 1980, which requires member states to ''secure
the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained
in'' another member country.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for respect of custody arrangements and says the
courts in the country of habitual residence are better able to
determine custody issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking forward to a renewed commitment by Germany to
respect its treaty obligations in connection with that (the Cooke)
case,'' State Department spokesman Philip Reeker told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooke children were taken by their German mother to Germany
in 1992 during what was supposed to a three-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she remained in Germany, then turned the children over
the Germany Youth Authority as she sought treatment for mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The youth authority placed the children in foster care in the
fall of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said the United States expressed concern to German
authorities about the court ruling not to return the children.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''We have no authority to overrule judicial
decisions in another country.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright raised the issue during a
meeting Sunday with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
Fischer said he was ''deeply impressed'' by Cooke's plight, based
on an account of his case that appeared in the Washington Post last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said the State Department places the highest priority on
the issue of children who have been abducted or wrongfully retained
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooke told the Post that the support he has received from
the U.S. government for his efforts was ''as close to nothing as
you can get without feeling spit in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said there has been a continuous increase in services to
parents whose children have been abducted overseas. He said U.S.
officials spend long hours negotiating visitation with the children
by consular officials, and helping parents get assistance from
appropriate U.S. and foreign agencies.

<HEADLINE> Report: UN Reforms Make Progress  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reforms made by the United Nations so far have
strengthened the work of the world body, but more needs to be done,
a report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United Nations has substantially restructured its
operations, and we found this has provided more cohesive and
unified leadership for the organization,'' said the report by the
investigative arm of Congress, the General Accounting Office.
''However, while progress is being made, overall objectives of the
reform have not yet been achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan unveiled a sweeping plan to
reduce expenses and streamline the United Nations in July 1997
after the United States said it would withhold its dues to the
organization without changes.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said himself at the time that the organization -- which
carries out activities ranging from peacekeeping to human rights
monitoring to developmental and social works -- had become
fragmented and inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said weekly meetings started in 1997 among U.N.
department and program heads -- as well as other efforts -- ''to
reduce competition among various U.N. agencies and to foster more
coordinated actions.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how reforms have made a difference, it said,
the senior management group was able to come up with a coordinated
U.N. response during the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We also found reforms are still in process,'' the report said,
''and that U.N. agencies do not fully coordinate their
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   It said that although information-sharing had improved at the
organization's highest levels, the same didn't appear true in
''day-to-day activities at working levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared for the Senate Foreign Relations
subcommittee on international operations and released at a hearing
Wednesday before the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the GAO suggested that the U.N. Secretariat
''implement results-oriented budgeting.''
</P>
<P>
   And to ''help ensure ... momentum'' in the reform program, it
said, the Secretary of State should report annually to Congress on
the status of the U.N. Secretary General's reform plan.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Drops Against Euro and Yen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against most major currencies on
Wednesday, battered by a broad selloff in U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 91.87 cents, up
from 90.69 cents late Tuesday. The dollar was quoted at 109.39
Japanese yen, up from 109.45.
</P>
<P>
   The British pound fell to a four-year low of $1.5077, but
bounced slightly higher to $1.5115 in late day trading. That was
still below its rate of $1.5332 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar came under selling pressure as U.S. stocks plunged
for the second straight day, with the Dow Jones industrial average
falling almost 169 points and the Nasdaq composite index dropping
200.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also came under selling pressure against the euro
amid speculation that European authorities might soon intervene in
foreign-exchange markets to lift the troubled currency.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the euro has dropped to new lows as investors
predicted that European authorities would not take an aggressive
action to stimulate the economy and make investment there
attractive. The euro is the single currency of 11 European nations
and has been trading since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But there was speculation Wednesday that European Central Bank
officials and other European financial officers may decide during a
meeting on Thursday to take some action to boost the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The pound sank on Wednesday after the release of a benign
inflation report dampened expectations of further interest rate
hikes in the Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.7150 Swiss francs, down from
1.7168, and 1.4927 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4913.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1484 German
marks, down from 2.1566; 7.2055 French francs, down from 7.2329;
and 2,126.95 Italian lire, down from 2,134.92.

<HEADLINE> FBI Looks Into Missing Fund Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents are looking into reports that
approximately $750,000 is missing from last month's Millennium
March on Washington, an FBI spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the march, a celebration of gay pride, said they
have not received the funds from the company that produced the
festival related to the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't determined the sum of money that's missing, who
might have been involved and what happened to the money that's
allegedly missing,'' said Susan Lloyd, an FBI spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have launched a preliminary inquiry into the allegation
and eventually will consult with an assistant U.S. attorney to
determine whether a full investigation is warranted, Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the nonprofit Millennium March, a celebration of
gay pride, have not ruled out a lawsuit against Millennium
Productions, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The for-profit organization had agreed to turn over 65 percent
of the revenue from the sale of food, souvenirs and tickets to
entertainment events during the festival, the Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls from The Associated Press to Millennium
Productions were not answered.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Tries To Repair MD Relations  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc., moving to improve its tattered image
with doctors, ended some restrictions against physicians and
members in Connecticut on Wednesday and said it hoped to make the
same changes for its 20 million members nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna said it will let Connecticut doctors
opt out of its ''all-products'' clause, which requires they treat
patients from all of Aetna's health plans rather than just picking
the ones they like.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer which has become a
lightning rod for public criticism of managed care, also said it
was expanding members' rights to appeal coverage decisions to an
external review board. For instance, members will now be able to
appeal drug coverage and emergency room coverage decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced that specialists will be able to
refer patients directly for laboratory or radiology services.
Previously, only primary care doctors could make such referrals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Aetna said its obstetrician and gynecologists would
have additional flexibility to work as a patient's principal
doctor. For instance, the ob-gyn's will be able to refer patients
to certain specialists, something previously which had to be done
through the primary care physician. Aetna already lets women have
direct access to their ob-gyn.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the recent past the relationship between Connecticut
doctors and Aetna U.S. Healthcare has been contentious, to say the
least,'' Aetna chairman William Donaldson told the Connecticut
State Medical Society. ''We simply can't let this continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna last month settled a lawsuit with Texas, promising to give
doctors more say over what medical treatments are necessary and
removing some financial incentives for doctors to limit care.

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Abuse Symptoms Often Missed  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than nine out of 10 physicians asked to
diagnose patients with symptoms typical of early alcohol abuse
failed to recognize that problem, a study by a leading
substance-abuse center found.
</P>
<P>
   That failure is a ''lost opportunity'' to reduce substance abuse
and cut its eventual costs to society, Joseph A. Califano, head of
the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia
University, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His center's survey of physicians nationwide found nearly 94
percent failed to include substance abuse among five possible
diagnoses they were asked to make based on the following symptoms
typical of early stage alcohol abuse: A 38-year-old married patient
has recurrent abdominal pain, intermittently elevated blood
pressure, gastritis, waking up frequently at night and
irritability.
</P>
<P>
   ''These findings add up to a monumental lost opportunity,'' said
Califano, a former secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   He called on doctors to focus more closely on alcohol and drug
abuse, urged medical schools to emphasize it in their teaching and
suggested that state licensing boards stress the importance of this
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Corlin, a gastroenterologist in Santa Monica,
Calif., said the symptoms ''are vague and common symptoms that can
be related to a whole variety of conditions'' besides alcohol
abuse. Other possibilities include ulcers, depression, recurrent
gastritis and anxiety, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, they clearly could indicate alcohol abuse and
doctors need to be made more aware of this possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, people with alcohol and drug problems may lie out
of embarrassment or fear, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tremendously courageous act by a patient with drug or
alcohol problems to lay that out before their physician,'' said Dr.
Macaran Baird, a family physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn. ''We need for them to help the physician.''
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms listed in the survey present an ''interesting
scenario,'' Baird added. ''I would be happy if a higher percentage
of physicians listed alcohol abuse as a possibility.... We all want
to do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Califano said primary care physicians have a unique opportunity
to identify and help treat substance abuse in its early stages when
the potential for success is high.
</P>
<P>
   Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the White House office of
national drug control policy, said he supports the call for
additional training of physicians in substance abuse and addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Families have always relied on their doctors for health care
advice. Drug abuse rips families apart. Giving the right advice on
drug prevention and treatment can keep a family together,''
McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the failure to identify adult alcohol abuse, the
survey found 41 percent of pediatricians didn't diagnose illegal
drug abuse when presented with a classic description of a drug
abusing teen-age patient.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found only about 20 percent of doctors felt very
prepared to diagnose alcoholism and 17 percent felt prepared to
diagnose illegal drug use. In contrast, nearly 83 percent felt very
prepared to identify high blood pressure, 82 percent to diagnose
diabetes and 44 percent to identify depression.
</P>
<P>
   Some 86 percent felt treatment for high blood pressure is very
effective, and 69 percent felt diabetes treatment is very
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But only 8 percent felt treatment is very effective for smoking,
close to 4 percent believed it is effective for alcoholism and 2
percent for illegal drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The center said 58 percent of doctors don't discuss substance
abuse with their patients because they believe their patients lie
about it. Some 35 percent listed time constraints for not
discussing it and 11 percent were concerned they won't be
reimbursed for the time necessary to screen and treat a
substance-abusing patient.
</P>
<P>
   Of the physicians responding to the survey that presented the
typical symptoms in the 38-year-old married patient, just 6.2
percent mentioned substance abuse. Female doctors did a little
better, with 9.0 percent diagnosing abuse compared with 5.5 percent
of male physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Some 9.4 percent of doctors who graduated from medical school in
the last 10 years listed substance abuse as a possibility, a share
that dropped the longer a doctor was out of school.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in family practice were the most likely to recognize the
symptoms, 11.5 percent. Substance abuse was recognized by 6.8
percent of those in internal medicine, 4.3 percent of gynecologists
and 2.5 percent of general practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 648 physicians across the country has a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, the center said. The
center also conducted a survey of 510 patients but noted that was
done at only selected substance-abuse centers and was not
statistically representative.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Make Advances in Sri Lanka  </HEADLINE>
By HEMA SHUKLA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Tamil rebels captured a strategic bridge
outside the northern Sri Lankan city of Jaffna on Wednesday,
trapping thousands of government soldiers in a final assault to
retake their former capital, the insurgents said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claim.
Journalists are not allowed into the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   But if the guerrillas control Navatkuli bridge, one of five
entry points into Jaffna, they can strike Jaffna's only airport at
Pallali with artillery and cut all escape routes for the soldiers.
Pallali is the military's main supply point.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the battle were delayed in Sri Lanka, where the
government has imposed censorship on news reports. In a fax that
reached New Delhi, however, the Sri Lankan government said the
Tamil Tiger rebels were attacking in ''human waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariya Rubasinghe, the Sri Lankan information director, said
government soldiers turned back several assaults in what the Tamil
Web sites called ''Operation Unceasing Waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing an assault on Jaffna, the rebels advised the half
million residents to get out of the way of the guerrillas' drive to
seize the peninsula they controlled from 1990-95 and which they
desire as a core for their state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our fighting cadres are moving toward Jaffna city. We advise
people in Jaffna to move to safe places so that they can avoid the
fighting,'' the clandestine Voice of Tigers radio said, according
to residents of the northern town of Vavuniya reached by telephone
by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Figures were unavailable for the number of soldiers trapped
between the bridge and former Sri Lankan army base at Killali.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen miles southeast of Jaffna, Killali was part of the
military's main defense line set up after the rebels overran the
Elephant Pass causeway April 21.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fierce fighting flared up in the vicinity of Jaffna town when
the combat formations of the Tamil Tigers launched a massive
offensive assault on three fronts in the early hours of the morning
today,'' the rebels said Wednesday in a statement from their London
office.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, firing barrages of artillery and mortars,
''breached a few gaps in the army defenses at Ariyalai'' about six
miles southeast of Jaffna, Sri Lanka's information director said in
a fax received in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Tamil Tiger Internet sites reported rebel assaults on the
Ariyalai and Tanankilappu seaside military bases. The rebels also
said commando units had blocked the highway that links the
peninsula to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice of Tigers rebel radio broadcast at 4 p.m. said the
army had imposed a curfew throughout the Jaffna peninsula and was
conducting house-to-house searches, said Vavuniya residents reached
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels launched an offensive last month to force government
troops from the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the government rejected the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam's offer to allow 40,000 troops defending the city to
withdraw. The rebels said they would agree to a temporary
cease-fire to avoid ''a bloodbath'' around the city of 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Tuesday he was
''concerned about the possible humanitarian consequences of the
recent escalation of fighting in Sri Lanka. Thousands of civilians
are in danger of being displaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Ambassador Truls Hanevold said three Norwegian
diplomats, including special negotiator Erik Solhein, will come to
New Delhi on Thursday to discuss the Sri Lankan situation with
Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil Tiger rebels have fought 17 years for an independent
homeland for the country's 3.2 million minority Tamils. They accuse
the majority Sinhalese of widespread discrimination in education
and jobs, a charge the government denies. More than 60,000 people
have died in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Accused Rail Killer Called Paranoid  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The doctor who diagnosed Angel Maturino Resendiz
as paranoid schizophrenic testified Wednesday that the admitted
serial killer believed he was following God's will when he killed
nine people in three states.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Pollock, who examined the freight-hopping transient
for 10 hours over three sessions last October, said Maturino
Resendiz also said that he could travel invisibly during his sleep
and cause weather catastrophes. Those statements led to his
diagnosis, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt an evil force pulling him into these homes and
directing him to people who were evil and deserved to be dead, and
as an angel of God he was doing God's will,'' said Pollock, the
defense's opening witness.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, has pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity in the rape, bludgeoning and stabbing of Houston-area
physician Dr. Claudia Benton, who was found dead in her home Dec.
18, 1998. He could face the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Lyn McClellan noted that the defendant raped some
victims and appeared to have stolen and sold some property, all
possible motives for murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're trying to make this logical, and (paranoid
schizophrenia) is one of the most illogical diseases known,''
Pollock said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Maturino Resendiz's lawyers, the Mexican citizen
began a two-year rampage in August 1997 with the slaying of
Christopher Maier, a college student in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he is accused of six slayings in Texas, two in Illinois
and one in Kentucky before his arrest last July. Prosecutors have
not said whether they would try him on the other cases.

<HEADLINE> Audit: Adult care facilities need more oversight  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state needs to significantly improve its
supervision of adult care facilities, according to a state audit
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said state officials were
inconsistent in verifying information on license applications and
inspecting the facilities, and were slow to respond to complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people make a decision to place a loved one in a state
licensed adult care facility they should have the peace of mind
that the state has met its responsibility for licensing and
inspections,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   Adult care facilities provide temporary or long-term,
non-medical residential care for adults who are unable to live
independently.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Health oversees facilities with five or
more residents. There are 529 such facilities housing up to 37,000
residents. The state Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS)
supervises family-type homes with fewer than five residents, and
there are 741 such homes for up to 2,100 New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors found that while both the Health Department and OCFS
require license applicants to provide letters of reference and
information of prior experience and financial resources, neither
conducted verifications or sought independent information on the
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both agencies were also not devoting enough time
and manpower to track down unlicensed facilities, the audit
contended. Auditors said they were told about 800 family-type homes
were operating without a license.
</P>
<P>
   OCFS spokesman William Van Slyke denied McCall's charges and
said, ''Any reports we would get ... we would certainly
investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Slyke added that local Social Security districts that have
direct supervision of the homes already perform verifications of
the information submitted by license applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The audit) essentially suggests a number of actions we have
already taken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department's log shows 30 possible unlicensed
facilities statewide that it is investigating, spokesman John
Signor said. He added that the department has ''adequate staff'' to
handle the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also found that the Health Department failed to
regularly inspect licensed facilities. State law requires
inspections every 18 months -- annually if a facility shows problems
-- but McCall said the department's computer tracking system was
unreliable, with information misfiled or missing.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors instead reviewed records of 10 facilities in the
metropolitan New York City area and another 10 in eastern New York
and found that two eastern region facilities and eight metro area
homes had overdue inspections.
</P>
<P>
   On-site inspections of the 20 facilities revealed that
inspectors at times did not provide complete documentation or were
unaware of state-set guidelines, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one facility ... auditors found an unlocked and unattended
medical cart in the kitchen area, food stored on the floor in open
containers, worn mattresses, moldy shower stalls and a missing
faucet in a patient's room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit said state officials also failed to respond to
complaints on a timely basis. Out of 20 calls sampled from two
regional offices, six of 11 ''urgent'' calls were not responded to
within the required 24 hours. In one instance, the Health
Department waited seven days to address a complaint that a facility
had no medication available, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   Signor the Health department has ''already implemented some of
the recommendations the comptroller office had made,'' including a
new tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   Signor said he was not clear which files the auditors examined
between April 1, 1997 to April 30, 1999, but added that some of the
files could be records from the Department of Social Services was
still in charge. He said the Health Department took over
supervision of adult care facilities in January 1998 after DSS was
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The comptroller's office has yet to share with us what files
were looked at,'' Signor said. ''We're not aware of any Department
of Health files that were deficient.''

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Labor Federation Strikes  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's main labor
federation held a national one-day strike to protest joblessness
Wednesday, prompting half the country's work force to stay home and
more than 100,000 people to hit the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying placards saying ''Squash profits, not jobs,''
protesters filled the downtown streets of Johannesburg and other
major cities. They said big business is too eager to fire people in
a country with more than 40 percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The trade federation is demanding that employers pay one month's
salary for each year of service to laid-off workers. It wants new
legislation to make it even harder for businesses to lay off
workers -- something current labor law already makes extremely
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   At least half of South African workers joined the strike,
according to the Chamber of Commerce. Students arrived in some
schools to find no teachers. Only half the commuter trains in the
Pretoria area operated because many drivers failed to turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Protests in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Pretoria were peaceful.
But near the coastal city of Durban, police released tear gas after
shots were fired from a crowd of protesters who threw stones at
passing cars.
</P>
<P>
   News of the unrest pushed the rand to a record low of 7.15 per
dollar by mid-afternoon. The South African currency has lost 16
percent of its value against the dollar this year -- 10 percent in
just the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The plunging currency will make imports more expensive, fuel
inflation rates and probably force the Reserve Bank to increase
interest rates, Glynos said. The prime rate is currently 14.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates would force some indebted companies to
fire workers to divert salaries to bank payments. That would
further slow an economy that grew only 1.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The snowballing bad economic news is pushing President Thabo
Mbeki's goal of bettering the lives of South Africans still
recovering from the racist apartheid regime further out of reach. A
potential rise in interest rates could further slow an already
creeping economy.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Wakeford, CEO of the South African Chamber of Commerce,
said foreign investors hold the key to South Africa's recovery and
should support the country that has peacefully made a transition
from apartheid to a multiracial democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world should be, in fact, looking at bolstering South
Africa so we can cascade our success story into the rest of the
continent, instead of punishing us unnecessarily,'' Wakeford said.

<HEADLINE> BOC Takeover Bid Dropped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TREXLERTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Air Products &AMP; Chemicals Inc. and French
industrial gases company Air Liquide SA plan to let their bid to
take over Britain's BOC Group PLC expire Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said Wednesday they were unable to satisfy
antitrust concerns of the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   BOC shares plummeted $10.75, or more than 26 percent, to $29.25
in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Air Liquide and the Allentown-based Air Products said
they agreed to buy rival BOC for $11.6 billion in cash. They
planned to split BOC's assets between them.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies wanted to strengthen their positions in the
business of supplying carbon dioxide and other gases needed to put
the fizz in soft drinks, chill imported fruits and vegetables and
manufacture high-quality steel.
</P>
<P>
   Air Liquide is the world's largest producer of industrial gases.
BOC ranks No. 2 in the world, and Air Products is fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Air Products and Air Liquide said the companies
made several proposals to the FTC during 10 months of negotiations,
including the divestiture of BOC's U.S. gas businesses, but were
unable to win regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Air Products rose 87{ cents to $31.18}, while shares of Air
Liquide rose 1.10 euros to 151.10 euros ($137.50).

<HEADLINE> Grossberg returns home from prison  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYCKOFF, N.J. (AP) -- Amy Grossberg, who admitted to killing her
newborn son with her high school sweetheart, came home from prison
Wednesday to an intensive parole regime that includes a nightly
curfew and weekly drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg, 21, served two years of a 2 1/2-year manslaughter
sentence for the 1996 death of her son in Newark, Del., where
Grossberg had attended college. She walked out of Baylor Women's
Correctional Facility in Wilmington, Del., at 8:15 a.m. Wednesday
and into a Jeep Cherokee in which her parents were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   She did not speak to reporters, but an attorney, Robert
Gottlieb, released a handwritten statement near her parents'
Wyckoff home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am thankful to be home with family and friends and I
appreciate all of the support that I have received,'' Grossberg
wrote. ''Today, I am still reflecting on the past, but I am also
looking forward to the obligations and opportunities that lie
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Police blocked off the street to Grossberg's home in the wealthy
New York City suburb. After Grossberg arrived, two women pulled up
and walked down Grossberg's street carrying three Mylar balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg went directly from jail to a meeting with her parole
officer in Clifton, said New Jersey Department of Corrections
spokeswoman Mary Ellen Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a very compliant person,'' Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   She will be on parole for nearly six months before beginning two
years of probation and 300 hours of community service, Bolton said.
She will counsel pregnant teen-agers at a home for young mothers in
Ramsey, her attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg will need to visit her parole officer in Clifton one
to two times a week and the officer will also visit her at work and
at home ''as often as is deemed necessary,'' Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   She will have to be at home every night between 9 p.m. and 6
a.m., submit to weekly urine tests for drugs, and undergo a mental
health evaluation, Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly curfew and frequent officer visits are part of an
''intensive supervision'' parole, meaning Grossberg's case will be
assigned to an officer with a smaller caseload, Bolton said. State
corrections officials thought the extra supervision was warranted
because of the crime Grossberg was charged with and the time she
spent in prison, Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg and Brian Peterson, the infant's father, were college
freshmen on Nov. 12, 1996, when they went to a Newark, Del., hotel
room near Grossberg's University of Delaware campus and delivered a
boy.
</P>
<P>
   The newborn was found wrapped in plastic in a trash bin in the
motel parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said in court that they believed the baby was
delivered stillborn, but the medical examiner said the infant died
of skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors initially said they would seek the death penalty
against the teen-age sweethearts. The pair, both of Wyckoff,
appeared in early court hearings holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   But their defense strategies soon set them against each other.
Peterson pleaded guilty to manslaughter in March 1998 and was given
a two-year sentence, six months shorter than Grossberg's, after he
cooperated with prosecutors in Grossberg's trial. He left prison on
Jan. 4 after 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg pleaded guilty in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dora Hairston, the Delaware corrections officer who escorted
Grossberg from prison, said Grossberg told her ''Thank you'' before
getting into the car.
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg was released early for time served prior to her
sentencing and for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''She did not have any institutional write-ups while she was
here,'' said Beth Welch, spokeswoman for the Department of
Correction in Delaware. ''She was a good prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg worked as a janitor and took classes while she was
incarcerated, including 21 credits of college correspondence
courses.

<HEADLINE> Indian Population Reaches 1 Billion  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Meena Pawar spends all day in crowded
shanties cajoling women not to have more children. But India marks
a milestone Thursday that shows just how strong the tide is against
her: The population officially reaches 1 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Pawar, a municipal nurse, works in the slums of Bombay, on the
front line of efforts to reduce population growth, but she faces
deeply entrenched attitudes against birth control. If India doesn't
curtail population growth, experts say that in 50 years it will
overtake China and end up with 1.5 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding when India reaches the 1 billion mark is tricky in a
nation where 42,000 children are born every day and medical records
are scanty. The United Nations Development Program said India
joined China in the exclusive club on Aug. 15 last year. The
government's Census Board projected it for May 1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a program to promote awareness of population growth, the
government decided to mark the milestone May 11, calling it ''a
moment of celebration, a moment to ponder.''
</P>
<P>
   At New Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital, doctors are zealously
watching over several dozen pregnant mothers. The first girl
delivered after noon Thursday will be designated the one billionth
baby.
</P>
<P>
   The spiraling population has swamped every measure of progress
India has made since independence 53 years ago. Food production has
tripled, yet many people go hungry; literacy has increased, but so
has the sheer number of illiterate people.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this problem more clear than in Bombay, a city where
more than half of the 15 million people sleep on sidewalks or live
in mud-and-tin huts. For many of its poor people, every child is a
potential wage earner: a servant in a house, an understudy in a
motor garage, someone to do odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers try to explain the harsh realities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tell them how expenses will increase and detail health
complications due to so many deliveries,'' said nurse Vimal
Bhagwat. Half a million women die each year in South Asia from
complications arising from childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Pawar said men must be better educated on family planning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must motivate the family members, especially men. Women
don't have the guts on their own to say that they want to be
sterilized,'' Pawar said.
</P>
<P>
   But family planning has never recovered from the stain it
received from a 1975 mass sterilization campaign launched by the
government. Police, teachers and government officials were ordered
to round up people for vasectomy and tubectomy operations. Many
illiterate people were sterilized without their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses such as Pawar now approach the topic of birth control
cautiously, talking first about general health and hygiene. Critics
want a more assertive approach, promoting the benefits of smaller
families and offering people incentives, such as cash, for limiting
births.
</P>
<P>
   Others say birth control projects will succeed if more women get
jobs, low-cost houses and better education.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had been working before my third pregnancy, I wouldn't
have had a third child. I would have realized two children are
enough,'' Pawar said.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Evacuated for Fire  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A blaze that had been set to clear brush
but burned out of control over the weekend spread into a canyon
Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of all 11,000 residents of Los
Alamos, the site of America's most storied nuclear laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   With winds of 35 mph or more driving the flames, police,
sheriff's and fire department officials went door to door, urging
people to pack up and get out as quickly as possible. The Los
Alamos nuclear laboratory had already been closed since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire is not coming into town right now, but with spot
fires in Los Alamos Canyon, it's fairly imminent that the fire will
enter Los Alamos,'' fire spokesman Jim Paxon.
</P>
<P>
   The fire raged out of control after the National Park Service
set it last week to clear brush at the nearby Bandelier National
Monument. Five hundred homes were evacuated Sunday night, and 3,700
acres had burned by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos, 70 miles north of Albuquerque, is essentially a
company town for the federal laboratory. It sprang up in the 1940s
as the base of operations for the Manhattan Project, which built
the atomic bomb. There are still military barracks and
military-style housing in Los Alamos, along with relatively
upscale, newer developments.
</P>
<P>
   The fire moved closer to the laboratory Wednesday, and a
research building was in its path, Paxon said. Laboratory officials
were prepared to fight the fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the blaze was not near any buildings containing nuclear
materials, ''and those buildings are rated to survive severe fires,
747 crashes, those kinds of things,'' lab spokesman Jim Danneskiold
said. ''They're bunkers, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were expected to worsen Wednesday and grow
particularly bad by Thursday. The National Weather Service forecast
gusts of 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos Inn was among the homes and businesses forced to
evacuate Wednesday afternoon. Spokeswoman Brenda Lucero noted that
some of the 40 guests had been staying in the hotel because they
had evacuated their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's black smoke -- smoke everywhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Era Jones, a receptionist at Trinity Realty in Los Alamos:
''It's very windy, very smoky. There's ash blowing around.''
</P>
<P>
   Many customers at Katherine's Restaurant in Los Alamos' White
Rock area were alerted to the evacuation by calls on their cell
phones at lunch. ''They're just jumping out of their seats and
leaving,'' said waitress Chris Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The blowup was the worst thing firefighters could have imagined
after the Park Service set the fire. At a news conference Monday,
park Superintendent Roy Weaver took responsibility for the fire and
said conditions had seemed right for a controlled burn.
</P>
<P>
   However, a copy of the special weather forecast faxed to
Bandelier shortly before the fire was started, and obtained by The
Associated Press, was practically a blueprint for a spreading fire.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast told park officials that there was a maximum
potential for fire growth, that winds were about to increase, that
temperatures were about to rise and that the potential for the
usual increase in nighttime humidity was diminished.
</P>
<P>
   While Los Alamos faced disaster, fire victims in Ruidoso, a
resort 200 miles south, had better news. A 5,700-acre fire had
forced up to 400 people to flee their homes Monday, but the wind
eased Wednesday and most residents were allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've caught a break,'' fire spokeswoman Karen Miranda said.

<HEADLINE> Witness says she came forward out of guilt  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) --Defense lawyers on Wednesday sought to
portray the prosecution's star witness in the murders of 8-year-old
Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother as a woman motivated by a
desire to get a lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   By testifying, Josephine Lee found a way to get out of jail
sooner and be reunited with her four children, who have been
removed from her custody, the attorneys contended.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're hoping to get this deal by testifying Russell Peeler
was involved in this double homicide?'' asked Peeler's lawyer,
William Koch. ''You've got a future because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who has been promised a maximum seven-year sentence for
agreeing to testify, countered that she came forward out of guilt
over her role in the Jan. 7, 1999 slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't live with it,'' she said. ''It was eatin' me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who lived across the street from B.J. and his mother, Karen
Clarke, has said she was the lookout for Adrian Peeler and watched
as he killed the mother and son.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler is accused of plotting the killings to stop the
boy from testifying against him in an earlier murder.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. had witnessed a 1997 driveby shooting in which Peeler had
allegedly tried to kill Clarke's fiance, Rudolph Snead Jr. When
Snead was shot to death in a Bridgeport barber shop eight months
later, B.J. became the state's star witness against Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   Lee spent more than four hours on the stand Wednesday, her
second day of testimony in the weeklong trial. Throughout her
testimony, Koch attacked her credibility and sought to highlight
contradictions in her story.
</P>
<P>
   Koch asked her about a letter she wrote after the slayings to
her lawyer, Richard Reeves, which inadvertently fell into
prosecutors' hands. In the letter, written after Lee agreed to
testify, she denied any involvement in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, though, pointed to letters Lee wrote to Bridgeport
detectives around the same time in which she admitted remorse for
her role in the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew what I did was wrong,'' Lee said, crying as she read
from the letter. ''I get down on my knees every night and ask God
to forgive me for what I did to the boy and his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Jonathan Benedict, asked what she needed
forgiveness for.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got the Peelers into the house,'' she said. ''I got them
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch grilled Lee, who admitted smoking crack cocaine the day of
the murders and the day she claimed to hear the brothers planning
the killings, on inconsistencies between her testimony and earlier
depositions. Lee denied on the stand any desire to enter the house,
but under further questioning from Koch, admitted she told
authorities she wanted to watch the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also had trouble remembering some details of the crime,
including where in the house B.J. was shot and how many shots were
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from the prosecutor, Lee said she initially
lied to police out of fear of the suspects, who had threatened her
if she spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was scared my life was in danger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other witnesses were called as the prosecution tried to
track Adrian Peeler's movements around the time of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Peeler, who has also been charged with murder, is
scheduled to go on trial once his brother's trial is completed.
Both brothers face the possibility of the death penalty if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The killings sparked a public outcry and led to an overhaul of
the state's witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony is scheduled to resume Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nike Offers Athletes High-Tech Gear  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike Inc. wants to connect with the wired
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic shoe and apparel company said Wednesday it is
diversifying into high-tech sports gear to offer devices like
digital audio players, speed and distance monitors and
walkie-talkies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's athletes are looking for something extra to enhance
the connection between themselves and the athletic experience. They
want more information,'' said Clare Hamill, vice president of Nike
Equipment. ''These are performance products for athletes in the
emerging digital age.''
</P>
<P>
   The first and most expensive of five new products is a digital
audio player that will be in retail stores in July and was produced
in collaboration with S3's Diamond Multimedia division -- the makers
of Rio Audio digital players. It has 64 megabytes of memory and
will retail for $299.
</P>
<P>
   Nike said four other products from the Nike Techlab division
would be in stores in the fall for the holiday season, including
real-time speed-distance and heart rate monitoring devices, a
digital compass and handheld walkie-talkies aimed for use by
snowboarders, hikers and campers.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment has always been a small part of Nike's business, so
the move in this direction is not new. Still, of its $9.5 billion
in sales last year, more than $9 billion came from shoes and
apparel, said Carol Pope Murray, who follows Nike for Salomon Smith
Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Nike has been trying to expand its equipment
business for some time -- with basketballs and baseball bats and
more successfully with the Triax ergonomic running watch, of which
2.5 million have been sold since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a fabulous brand and it makes sense to extend it into
some other categories. You have to do it carefully and prudently,
which is typically how Nike executes new businesses,'' Murray said.
''The hard thing to gauge is that electronics are an incredibly
competitive market on price.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike has been in a slump for the last two years as it endured
weak sales and a shakeout among retail outlets, though its earnings
are improving. Third-quarter earnings for the period ending Feb. 29
rose 17 percent as the company earned $145.3 million, or 52 cents a
share, compared to $124.2 million, or 44 cents per share, in the
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shea, an analyst with D.A. Davidson in Portland, said he
thought some of the devices were an odd fit for a company founded
to cater to runners.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I think of a compass, I think of camping. With a heart
monitor, I think of medical technology company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nike executives said the products make perfect sense for
their active customers.
</P>
<P>
   The audio player will have a remote in case the user wants to
put it in a pocket or backpack, the walkie talkie will transmit
weather alerts and the heart monitor will eventually be designed
into women's sports bras, said Ray Riley, creative director of Nike
Techlab.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 200; Dow Sheds 169  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Wednesday, pushing the
Nasdaq composite index down 200 points, as investors fretted about
interest rates and continued their flight from high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 200.28 to 3,384.73. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost 168.97 to close at 10,367.78.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 fell 29.09 to 1,383.05.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks bore the brunt of investors' distress
Wednesday, with several industry leaders stumbling badly.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco fell 4\ to 58{. After the close of trading Tuesday, the
Internet equipment provider reported net income of $662 million, or
9 cents per share, beating Wall Street analysts' expectations by a
penny. But shares of Cisco have been out of favor all week after a
story in Barron's magazine said the stock is overvalued and
acquisitions will prove increasingly difficult because of
escalating purchase prices of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lead horse in the technology sector is Cisco Systems,''
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist at Dunvegan Associates
in Santa Barbara, Calif. ''Its decline was enough to send a shiver
through the rest of the technology sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel tumbled 10~ to 106 1/16 after the company said it shipped
nearly 1 million computer circuit boards that could contain a
defect that destroys important files.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell 6 to 103 a day after CEO Louis Gerstner made his annual
address to Wall Street. Gerstner said the company's financial model
calls for high single-digit revenue growth, not the brisk
double-digit expansion achieved in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola plunged 18 to 86{ after Salomon Smith Barney cut its
rating on the stock to ''outperform'' from ''buy.'' Analyst Alex
Cena said Motorola recently lost a major customer to competitor
Nortel, limiting its potential for dramatic earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   The downbeat news on the four technology bellwethers forced
investors to reconsider the high prices of many stocks in the
sector, analysts said. Hewlett-Packard fell 6 9/16 to 126\ without
releasing any significant news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology stocks are under pressure because they still have
extremely high valuations,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ''Six months ago, people said it
didn't matter what they cost; you had to own them anyway. Now
there's a sense that what you pay for a stock really does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said investors were shying away from expensive technology
stocks because they fear rising interest rates will compromise
their rapid growth rates. The Fed is expected to raise rates by as
much as a half-percentage point at its meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks weren't the sole source of the Dow's weakness.
General Motors fell 4 7/16 to 82{ after a Merrill Lynch analyst cut
his rating on the stock to ''neutral'' from ''accumulate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the latest round of merger talks sparked buying in the paper
sector. Champion International rose 6 1/16 to 72] after both
International Paper and UPM-Kymmene of Finland raised their bids
for the company. The new IP bid values Champion at about $7.3
billion, and UPM's bid would be worth about $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was fairly light, continuing a string of quiet sessions
as many market players stay on the sidelines awaiting the Fed's
next move. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1.20 billion shares
changed hands, compared with 1.07 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   ''The background to all of this is the Fed,'' Moore said. ''The
fear of interest rates is continuing to take a toll on stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next two sessions, investors will receive some economic
data that could indicate whether the economy is growing fast enough
to merit a sharp rate increase. On Thursday, the Commerce
Department will report on retail sales in the month of April. On
Friday, the Labor Deparment will release its Producer Price Index,
which measures inflationary pressures at the wholesale level.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on the
NYSE and by a 7-to-2 margin on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies of smaller companies
fell 16.58 to 474.28.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 2.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
slipped 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Profits Rise 15 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- News Corp., the media conglomerate run by Rupert
Murdoch, reported a 15 percent gain in quarterly profits Wednesday
led by strong showings at the Fox movie and TV studios.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. earned $193 million in the three months ended March
31, up from $168 million in the same period a year ago. Earnings
for each U.S.-listed share rose to 18 cents from 17 cents. Revenues
rose to $3.2 billion from $3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp.'s headquarters are located in Sydney, but the company
has many operations in the United States, including the Fox movie
and TV studios, the Fox TV network, the HarperCollins book
publisher and the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter's biggest gain in operating revenue, 150 percent,
came from the company's entertainment studios, which had a box
office hit with ''The Beach'' and success on the small screen with
''Malcolm in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   However, earnings from television slumped 26 percent as
advertising revenues fell off in comparison to last year, when Fox
stations broadcast the Super Bowl. Ratings for the Fox network also
have been struggling overall.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at News Corp.'s newspaper division, which includes The
Times of London and several newspapers in Australia, rose 16
percent over the same period a year ago on stronger advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, which has been emerging from a slump, reported a
big jump in operating profits to $12 million from $2 million in the
same period a year ago. Last summer the division acquired William
Morrow and Avon Books from Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of News Corp. were down $1.50, or 3 percent, to $48.37{
at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Court rules woman can sue former psychologist for testimony incustody battle  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A psychologist who testified against a
former patient in a custody battle violated their confidential
relationship, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That paves the way for the patient, who lost custody of her
children, to sue the psychologist for damages.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said the psychologist, Maureen Smith, failed to
meet the standards required in order to legally break the
psychologist-patient privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Trial evidence failed to prove that the children were in enough
danger to allow confidential information to be shared without first
meeting those standards, the court said in a split decision.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves a Saddle River couple, Diane and Guy Runyon.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, Diane Runyon got a temporary restraining order
against her husband. The next day, Guy Runyon contested the
restraining order, saying he believed his children were in danger,
according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Runyon failed to appear for that hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Runyon brought along his wife's psychologist, who testified
against her former patient.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told the judge that Diane Runyon had abused, both
physically and verbally, her oldest son. She said the woman had an
obsessive compulsive personality and was involved with a cult-like
group.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also testified that Guy Runyon was a good dad. A friend of
Diane Runyon backed up Smith's statements, while Guy Runyon also
said his wife had problems with the children.
</P>
<P>
   The testimonies convinced a judge to grant temporary custody of
the children to Guy Runyon. He later gained permanent custody.
</P>
<P>
   About two years after the first hearing, Diane Runyon sued her
former psychologist, claiming she violated the psychologist-patient
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court found in favor of Diane Runyon. The Supreme
Court upheld that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Both courts cited previous decisions that set a three-prong test
to determine whether the patient privilege can be violated. First,
there must be a real need for the evidence. It must be relevant to
the issue and it must be unavailable through less ''intrusive''
means.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attorneys acknowledged that she violated the privilege,
but argued that she did so because she believed the children were
in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The court found, ''Nothing in this record demonstrates that the
children were exposed to danger of a degree that approached the
level of danger that triggers the statutory duty to warn,'' the
justices wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Daniel O'Hern, with Chief
Justice Deborah Poritz joining him, wrote that Smith's testimony
would have been admissible in the custody action if the judge had
required her to provide it. And, even if her testimony had not been
considered, the outcome would have been the same, with the father
gaining custody of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   So, O'Hern said, the mother has no right to sue the
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing is clear, there is no evidence that (Smith) intended
to do anything but that which was best for the involved children,''
O'Hern wrote.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backs Insurance Tax Deduction  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush proposed tax breaks of up
to several thousand dollars a person Wednesday to help elderly
Americans with nursing home insurance and those caring for older
relatives at home.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal was his latest move toward the political middle,
closer to traditionally Democratic positions, in his Republican
campaign for the presidency. Democrat Al Gore supports a Clinton
administration plan that would give people comparable tax help to
care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said his plan, at a cost of $7.4 billion over
five years, was an effort to steer people off ''a path to financial
ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding for the Gore campaign, Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala dismissed the plan as ''a day late and a
dollar short,'' particularly criticizing the tax break ''to pay for
lousy long-term care insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, half of older women and a third of older men
are likely to need nursing home care eventually. An increasing
number of people will be affected as the baby boom generation ages.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to provide an income tax deduction to anyone buying
long-term care insurance. The deduction, now available only to
people who itemize and have big medical expenses, would apply to
everyone except those already on employer-subsidized long-term care
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of such plans -- and thus the potential deduction --
varies widely. An insurance plan for two years of nursing home care
could range from $358 for those aged 35-39 to $2,638 annually for
those aged 70-74.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign estimated the cost of that portion of Bush's
proposal at $5.1 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bush proposed establishing an additional tax exemption for
each elderly spouse, parent or other relative cared for in
someone's home. That exemption is currently $2,750 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign estimated the cost of that second proposal at $2.3
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to make long-term care available and affordable
instead of a path to financial ruin,'' Bush said to an audience of
about 60 senior citizens at the Ridgecrest Village Senior Center.
Some sat in wheelchairs; others used walkers. ''We have a system
today where a person goes into a nursing home and quickly consumes
their life savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Family caregivers, he added, ''deserve this country's
recognition, and they deserve a tax code that rewards their love

   Gore supports the administration's proposal to give a $3,000 tax
credit to some 2 million families caring for ill or disabled
relatives, and to expand Medicaid to cover in-home and
community-based long term care services that would help keep people
out of expensive nursing homes.

   Nearly four months after winning the Iowa caucuses, Bush's
speech marked the beginning of a series of addresses on improving
families' financial security, part of a plan by the Texas governor
to undercut traditionally Democratic themes like social welfare.
</P>
<P>
   It was also notable that he announced the plan in Iowa, a state
that has voted Democratic in the past three presidential elections,
but where polls have shown Bush running ahead of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he remains
committed to keeping the Iowa Caucuses the first campaign contest,
although Republicans are considering a plan to change the calendar
</P>
<P>
   ''I told the people when I campaigned in the caucus that I
supported the system the way it was,'' Bush said. ''I still believe
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Rob Tully held a news conference
Wednesday in Des Moines to accuse Bush and the GOP of breaking a
promise to support Iowa's status as the leadoff caucus state.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican Party committee is meeting Thursday and Friday in
Indianapolis to discuss recommendations for a primary calendar for
the 2004 presidential election. One GOP proposal would divide
states into four groups for election events to be held 30 days
apart. Under the plan, Iowa would be in the second group. A
Democratic plan would keep Iowa and New Hampshire's leadoff status.

<HEADLINE> Court: Conn. Must Share Beaches  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The exclusive beaches of Greenwich must
be opened to out-of-towners, the state Appellate Court said
Wednesday in a ruling that could make all of Connecticut's
shoreline more hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Stamford sued the adjacent town of Greenwich in
1995 after a guard prevented him from jogging in Greenwich Point, a
147-acre park with a beach on Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The state's second-highest court threw out the town's
longstanding no-trespassing policy, saying it violates a public
trust doctrine that says municipalities hold parks on behalf of all
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Many Connecticut towns charge nonresidents exorbitant parking
fees to use their beaches or require them to walk to the
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich -- whose famous and wealthy inhabitants include Ron
Howard, Mel Gibson, and Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford -- bans walkers
and joggers from its beaches, and allows out-of-towners there only
if they are accompanied by a resident and pay a $6 fee.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could affect dozens of shoreline communities. Only 30
miles of Connecticut's 78 miles of sandy beach are public,
according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. The
remaining 48 miles are under various restrictions, either privately
run or under the control of associations.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich First Selectman Lolly Prince said she expects the
town's governing board on Thursday will approve an appeal to the
state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich officials maintain a 1919 legislative act granted the
town an exception to any public trust doctrine. Residents say
reversing the policy would increase traffic at the already overused
Greenwich Point and damage the beach environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a limited amount of space that people can use and
still be able to protect the ecosystem,'' Prince said. ''It's a
delicate balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The jogger who filed the lawsuit, lawyer Brenden Leydon, said he
was confident the ruling would stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point in the decision, there's almost a full page of
citations of cases where it was decided if a town holds a park, it
does so for the general public,'' Leydon said. ''The string of
decisions goes back to 1824.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, when the case is over, he will go where the Greenwich
guard wouldn't let him jog.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably going to have a little party,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Rule Challenged  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Forest Service lacks legal authority to
implement a sweeping rule that would make forest health the top
priority in managing woodlands, the agency's former top legal
adviser said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service should revise or scrap the proposed rule, or
ask Congress to approve the changes the agency desires, James P.
Perry told the Senate Forest and Public Land Management
Subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service spokesman Chris Wood expressed ''100 percent
confidence'' the proposed rule is legally sound.
</P>
<P>
   The agency last fall proposed an overhaul of planning
regulations that govern all 192 million acres of federal forests.
Local foresters use the regulations when deciding whether to allow
logging, mining and other activities in forests.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, one of a dozen or so major rules pending in the
final year of President Clinton's term, is a departure from
existing regulations because they place ''ecological
sustainability'' -- the need to protect healthy ecosystems in
forests -- above all other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Existing regulations, which have gone unrevised since 1982,
place forest ecology on the same level as logging, recreation and
other forest uses.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said ''ecological sustainability'' is a vague and
subjective term that will result in widespread inconsistencies in
forest management. He said the rule also runs up against federal
laws that say forests should be open to many different uses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Accordingly, the Forest Service must either substantially
revise the proposed rule or return to the drawing boards,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry headed the office that provided legal counsel to the
Forest Service from 1989 until he retired in 1998. He advised five
Forest Service chiefs during a 32-year career, including current
chief Mike Dombeck.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho and the subcommittee chairman, said
Perry's testimony supports what committee Republicans have been
saying for months.
</P>
<P>
   ''To move as sweepingly as they want to move, they have to come
to the Congress -- they simply can't do it through rule-making,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he may propose legislation that would prevent the
Forest Service from enacting the planning rule administratively.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the agency never would have pursued the rule if it was
not certain the plan was legally sound.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is expected to give final approval to the
rule in early summer.

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Musicstock Lawsuit, 1st Ld-Writethru,0333  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- The organizer of a canceled music festival
filed a $250,000 lawsuit in state Supreme Court on Wednesday
against the owner of the proposed site for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Nick Papatonis is seeking to recoup out-of-pocket
expenses and lost profits in his action against Cayuga County
Fairgrounds owner Glenn Donnelly. Papatonis also claims his
business reputation has been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We suffered damages putting this show together,'' Papatonis
said. ''We have been promoting this, we spent money on fliers, we
spent money on sound companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 65 local and regional bands were expected to play at
the event July 3-5 during the county fair. The bands agreed to play
for free and proceeds would have benefited local food pantries.
About 1,000 to 3,000 people were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials, however, became alarmed when they found out the
show was being advertised on the Internet as ''the biggest indie
(independent) music festival ever.'' Officials said they feared the
event could turn into another Woodstock '99, which drew nearly
250,000 people to nearby Rome last summer and ended in a fiery
riot.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said they have had past problems with rock
concerts at the fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting last week, local officials said promoters did not
apply for two state permits regulating mass gatherings and
overnight camping. They also said promoters needed a mass-gathering
permit and a zoning variance from the town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel holding the concert is illegal,'' county attorney
Thomas P. Stopyra said. ''You know we have to try to protect the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   A deal under way last week to hold the outdoor concert at Snow
Ridge Ski Area in Lewis County failed, too, forcing Papatonis to
temporarily cancel it. He said Wednesday he still plans to stage it
sometime in August once he finds a suitable site.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Witness Implicates Defendant  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A witness in the trial of 28 men suspected
of planning terror attacks during millennium celebrations linked
one defendant Wednesday to a plan to pick up weapons in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Majed Badwan, testified that Khader Abu Hosher took
Badwan's passport last year, claiming he would use it to get Badwan
a visa to the United States. Badwan said when Abu Hosher was
arrested in December, he confessed ''in my presence that he had
tried to forge my passport to go to Syria to acquire weapons and
silencers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, another witness testified that Abu Hosher offered him
training in military camps in Afghanistan belonging to Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi dissident wanted by the United States in the 1998
bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings
killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials say the 28 accused Arabs, many of whom are
Jordanians of Palestinian descent, planned bomb attacks on U.S. and
Israeli tourists during New Year's celebrations. The targeted sites
were Mount Nebo, where tradition says Moses saw the Promised Land,
and a Christian settlement along the Jordan River said to be the
site where John baptized Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the 28 defendants are at large outside Jordan and
are being tried in absentia. The remaining 15 -- 13 Jordanians of
Palestinian descent, an Iraqi and an Algerian -- have been in
custody since December. They have all pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have been charged with possession of explosives
and affiliation with ''an outlawed group'' involved in a
''conspiracy to carry out terrorist attacks'' in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The ''outlawed group'' has not been identified in the formal
indictment. Military prosecutor Lt. Col. Mahmoud Obeidat has said
that the suspects were linked to al-Qaida, or ''the base,'' a
terrorist organization allegedly headed by bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   One defendant, Issam Barqawi, 40, told reporters before
Wednesday's hearing that he and the rest of the accused had no
links with bin Laden, though they back his goals. He said weapons
seized from them were ''to be used in fighting the Jews, not
Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   ''None of us in the dock know bin Laden or have any
organizational link with or (financial) support from him,'' Barqawi
said. ''We praise him and beseech God to have him triumph over his
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   In court Wednesday, the defendants interrupted witnesses with
shouts of ''liars!'' They accused the presiding judge of being a
''criminal'' and banged on the iron bars of the dock with their
fists when the judge attempted to bar a relative from the
courtroom.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Refuse To Discuss Letters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clintons' lawyers signaled Wednesday their
clients will refuse to discuss a conversation the president and
first lady had in 1998 about releasing personal letters of
presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to a lawsuit, the White House stated that
the Clintons' lawyers ''advise us that the substance of discussions
between the president and the first lady would be protected by the
spousal privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Around the time of the decision'' to release the
correspondence ''the president discussed the matter with the first
lady, (presidential adviser) Mr. James Carville and possibly others
whom he does not recall,'' the White House said in a written
response to the lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch, a conservative
group that is suing the Clinton administration on a number of
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   The White House released the exchange of letters between the
president and Willey in an attempt to undercut her nationally
televised assertion that Clinton had made an unwelcome sexual
advance. Presidential aides released the letters the day after the
broadcast of Willey's accusation. Many of the letters between
Willey and Clinton were written after the alleged 1993 incident.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier filings in the lawsuit in U.S. District Court, the
White House has identified the president, then-White House counsel
Charles Ruff, top aide Bruce Lindsey and then-deputy counsel Cheryl
Mills as the people who decided to release the Willey letters.

<HEADLINE> Mental Help Suggested in Columbine  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Members of a task force formed in the wake of the
Columbine massacre said Wednesday they plan to recommend mental
health assistance for those most affected by the shootings for at
least two years.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be enough, Jefferson County mental health officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of pain in the community,'' said Harriet Hall,
Jefferson County's mental health director. ''We planned to begin
reducing staff in October, but that may not be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brooks, executive director of the Department of Local
Affairs, said a report to Gov. Bill Owens will recommend that the
task force continue so members can deal with ongoing problems at
the school.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosures about videotapes made by the two gunmen, Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold, an Internet threat to a student to ''finish the
job,'' the suicide of a mother of a shooting victim, the murders of
two Columbine sweethearts at a sandwich shop and the recent release
of videotapes made at the scene have taken a toll, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, 2,000 people attended the funeral of Columbine
High School basketball star Greg Barnes hanged himself last week.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes had seen a teacher critically wounded and lost one of his
best friends in the April 20, 1999, shooting. Twelve students and a
teacher were killed. The student gunmen then turned the weapons on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Owens gave the county $1 million to pay first-year costs, but
only $125,000 went to mental health, Hall said. The rest offset
costs of the investigation, one of the largest in the state's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The task force is recommending $450,000 to cover the second year
of treatment and pay for mental health staff in schools, and Hall
is requesting $300,000 for a third year.

<HEADLINE> Dreyfus To Pay $950,000 Over Claims  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mutual fund company Dreyfus Corp. said Wednesday
it has agreed to pay $950,000 to settle charges related to the
first year performance figures of its Aggressive Growth Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York State
Attorney General's Office alleged that Dreyfus misrepresented to
investors how its Aggressive Growth Fund achieved stellar returns
in its first year of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators charged that the fund's first-year returns were
inflated through the purchase of new stocks of companies that were
completing initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Many IPO stocks soar in value shortly after they begin trading
in the public markets and can have a big impact on small mutual
funds that include them. The stocks usually decline sharply after
that initial surge, but by that time, fund managers usually have
sold them.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus' Aggressive Growth Fund was very small in its first
months, making it highly susceptible to IPO increases. As funds
grow larger, however, they are less susceptible to volatile IPO
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, fund managers who own IPO stocks can apply the
early gains recorded by IPO shares to the yearend performance
figures of their fund. Those figures are then used to market the
fund to investors despite the fact that it's highly unlikely the
figures can be duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Dreyfus' Aggressive Growth Fund,
investigators charged that Dreyfus advertised the fund's stellar
first-year returns to investors without noting that IPO stocks were
responsible for much of the gains.
</P>
<P>
   The fund managers can apply the IPO stocks' early gains to the
yearend performance figures of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Dreyfus' Aggressive Growth Fund,
investigators charged that Dreyfus advertised the funds stellar
first year returns to investors without noting that IPO stocks were
responsible for much of the gains.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus settled the allegations without admitting or denying the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by Dreyfus Wednesday, the company, the
15th largest U.S. fund family, said the SEC and the New York
Attorney General's office ''did not find intentional wrongdoing by
Dreyfus or any of its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus has also agreed to reimburse the New York Attorney
General's for the cost of the investigation. The company also said
it will voluntarily donate about $1.6 million to the State
University of New York to enhance investor education and awareness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to charges related to the first year figures of the
Aggressive Growth fund, the fund's manager, Michael Schonberg, was
under investigation for making improper trades.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg, who allegedly benefited personally from directing the
fund to buy shares of companies he owned, has agreed to pay the SEC
$50,000. In addition, he was suspended from acting as an investment
adviser for nine-months.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg, who resigned from Dreyfus in the wake of the
allegations, also settled the case without admitting or denying the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, the SEC last September fined Van Kampen Funds
$100,000 for failing to tell investors that the extraordinary
first-year performance of Van Kampen's Growth Fund was due
primarily to Van Kampen's liberal allocation of hot IPO stocks into
the fund. A former Van Kampen employee, Alan Sachtleben, who served
as the chief adviser to the fund, was also fined $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Van Kampen and Sachtleben agreed to settle the case without
admitting wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Gays Protest at Methodist Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nearly 200 gay rights demonstrators were
arrested outside a United Methodist gathering Wednesday on the eve
of a vote during which the church leadership is expected to
reaffirm its stand against homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters briefly interrrupted an ecumenical service led by
Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, leader of the world's 70
million Anglicans. Carey's sermon made only passing reference to
''issues to do with personal freedom and its limits'' such as
homosexuality and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   One of those arrested was Arun Gandhi, grandson of Mohandas
Gandhi, India's independence leader.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were jailed for a few hours, then charged with
persistent disorderly conduct. Under a deal offered by prosecutors,
most pleaded no contest, were found guilty and then fined $100 plus
court costs.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those arrested were from the church's Northern
Illinois Conference, including the Rev. Gregory Dell, a Chicago
pastor who was suspended last year for presiding over a same-sex
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   If United Methodist leaders vote Thursday to keep a ban on such
ceremonies, Dell said more protests and arrests are likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an attempt to interrupt the general conference,''
Dell said in a telephone interview after his release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since his one-year suspension began last July, Dell has headed
In All Things Charity, a group aimed at persuading church leaders
to honor same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi said he had put aside anti-homosexual prejudice that

<HEADLINE> White House Lobbies for China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Providing a behind-the-scenes glimpse of a
White House campaign, congressional auditors have found the Clinton
administration has used about 150 staffers and has taken or planned
about 40 trips in their efforts to win permanent trade status for
China.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office examined the administration's
China Trade Relations Working Group, a White House command center
with members from several government agencies that is dedicated to
securing congressional approval for ''permanent normal trade
relations'' status for China.
</P>
<P>
   After being repeatedly blocked from obtaining the ''fast track''
negotiating authority needed to strike new trade agreements, the
Clinton administration has been pushing hard to get permanent trade
status for China.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, along with the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, presented their staffing and travel information to the
GAO, but were unable to provide a total of their expenses, the
investigators said in a letter to Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-Va., dated
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury and Labor departments have also been involved and
are still compiling their staffing and travel information, the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said the working group includes 10 principal
members, five presidential advisers, plus the Secretary of State,
the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Commerce, Agriculture and
Treasury secretaries. The remaining staff come from various
agencies and departments and work from a few hours to almost
full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said he requested the investigation after learning about
the group's ''war room,'' a command center which could influence
congressional debate before a House vote on China's trade status
during the week of May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, a vocal critic of human rights abuses in China who opposes
permanent trade status, said he was concerned the White House
violated a law that prohibits using federal funds for lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits the use of congressional appropriations to
lobby lawmakers, although the statute allows executive branch
officials to request legislation ''which they deem necessary for
the efficient conduct of the public business.''

<HEADLINE> Investment company settles in mutual funds case  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- An investment company accused of failing to
inform investors about the risks associated with some of its mutual
funds has reached an out-of-court settlement with the state, the
state attorney general announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Spitzer said as part of the settlement, Dreyfus Corp. in
Manhattan will contribute $1.6 million for an investor education
program at the State University of New York and pay the attorney
general's office $400,000 for the cost of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, Dreyfus ran advertisements stating that its
Aggressive Growth Fund had returns of more than 80 percent in its
1995-96 fiscal year. But the company did not tell investors that
much of those profits came from one-time investments in initial
public offerings or that a majority of the fund consisted of
''micro-cap'' companies -- those capitalized at less than $300
million.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Spitzer said investors lost millions of dollars in the
Dreyfus Aggressive Growth Fund. The attorney general's office began
investigations after receiving complaints from investors.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also requires that the fund's manager, Michael L.
Schonberg, be suspended as an investment adviser for the next nine
months. Schonberg is already on administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case should serve as a warning,'' Spitzer said.
''Investors should do extensive research before they invest and
investment companies must be forthright in disclosing information
about products and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus also entered into a separate settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay a penalty of
$950,000. In addition to suspension, Schonberg agreed to pay the
SEC $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Dreyfus admitted to no wrongdoing when reaching the
settlement with the state.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY spokesman Jon Sorensen said Dreyfus' contribution would be
used to create new business-related courses or expand existing
ones. Specific plans as to how the money will be divided among the
campuses has not yet been determined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Dreyfus company officials emphasized
that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Spitzer's
office did not find intentional wrongdoing by the company or any of
its employees and said they were pleased the matter had been
resolved.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavs Form 'Crisis Committee'  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's opposition parties and the
leading anti-government student group on Wednesday announced the
formation of a ''crisis committee,'' to counter President Slobodan
Milosevic's increasing crackdown on his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have agreed to form a body to coordinate efforts and
resources in defending our members and all citizens who get
arrested by the authorities,'' for demanding democratic changes in
the country, said Slobodan Djinovic, a leader of Otpor, or
Resistance, the student organization spearheading efforts to oust
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Orlic of the opposition Social Democrats said all of
the political opposition had approved formation of the crisis
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Orlic and Djinovic described the committee as a task force that
would pool resources and manpower of all opposition groups to
create a network of lawyers and activists who would organize strong
protests and react swiftly to any harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after a massive display of force by police on
Tuesday prevented the opposition from holding a protest rally in
Milosevic's hometown, Pozarevac. The police also arrested dozens of
the president's opponents as well as several independent
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   All of them were released hours after the opposition had
canceled the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, about 2,000 protesters turned up in the central
city of Kragujevac, at a demonstration called by Serbia's
opposition and Otpor, to demand early elections and the end of
regime's crackdown on independent media.
</P>
<P>
   Another 500 opposition supporters also demonstrated in the
southwestern Serbian town of Cacak.
</P>
<P>
   No incidents were reported at either demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic met World War II veterans Tuesday and referred to the
United States as a ''fascist power'' that wants to ''conquer the
world'' with the help of domestic ''traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats and other allied opposition parties have scheduled
a new protest for Monday, May 15, in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Primeau Is Day-to-Day  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Flyers acquired Keith Primeau to provide
depth at center and insurance in case Eric Lindros got hurt. Now
Primeau may join Lindros on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   His status is uncertain for the upcoming Eastern Conference
finals against the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling better,'' Primeau said Wednesday. ''It's too early
to tell. We'll take it on a day-to-day basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Primeau returned to Philadelphia on Wednesday after spending the
night in a Pittsburgh hospital following a hit by the Penguins' Bob
Boughner in the first minute of a playoff game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays at UPMC Presbyterian University Hospital proved negative.
Primeau will be reevaluated by team physicians, who will determine
if he sustained a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, out since March 13 because of a concussion, was
examined Wednesday in Chicago by neurologist James Kelly about his
latest concussion, incurred during practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly reported that Lindros' condition is improving and the
former captain will engage in a graded workout increase without
skating while he continues with his cranial sacral and acupuncture
therapy through this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The best-case scenario has Lindros returning to full practice
with the team on May 23, which would be prior to Game 6 of the
conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau's injury occurred 18 seconds into his shift and 48
seconds into the game, a 2-1 Flyers' victory that ended the series
in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after a faceoff, Boughner skated across the neutral zone
from along the right wing boards and leveled Primeau, who was
skating up ice with his head down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't turned away from the play,'' Primeau said. ''I was
looking up ice. It was a clean hit, but it was still a few seconds
after the puck had left, so I think I kind of let my guard down and
unfortunately it caught me square on the chin and I went down.''
</P>
<P>
   The hit followed a controversy in Game 5 Sunday at Philadelphia
where Luke Richardson hit Boughner in the chest with a slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins contend Richardson intentionally shot the puck at
Boughner. On Monday, Boughner promised to get back at Richardson,
even if it didn't occur during Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Boughner insisted the hit on Primeau was clean, and the Flyers
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he meant to hurt him,'' Flyers interim coach
Craig Ramsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which lost four of five games this season to the
Devils, plays host to New Jersey in Game 1 of their best-of-seven
series Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Lindros May Practice With Flyers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros' post-concussion syndrome is
improving and the Philadelphia Flyers center could participate in
full team practices as soon as two weeks, his doctor said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barring any problems, Lindros would be cleared to practice with
his teammates on May 23 -- the day before Game 6 of the Eastern
Conference finals against New Jersey should the best-of-seven
series last that long.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Kelly, a neurologist and concussion specialist,
examined Lindros on Wednesday in Chicago and said there were signs
of improvement following Lindros' latest concussion, sustained last
Thursday when he collided with Francis Lessard of the AHL's
Philadelphia Phantoms during a practice drill. Lindros needed 20
stitches to close a cut on his lip.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Lindros will gradually increase his workouts without
skating through Monday, and report to Kelly by phone from Toronto,
where he is undergoing acupuncture and other therapy.
</P>
<P>
   If his recovery continues, Lindros will participate in
conditioning on and off the ice. He will skate alone, on Tuesday
and Wednesday, and then practice stick-handling skills with a
goalie and one other player from May 18 through May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros will undergo further tests and be examined again on May
22. If cleared by Kelly, Lindros could participate in full team
practices the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, the former Philadelphia captain, hasn't played since
March 13 because of a Grade II concussion sustained nine days
earlier from a check by Boston's Hal Gill.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concussion, also diagnosed by Kelly as being a Grade
II, was Lindros' third since January and fifth in two years.

<HEADLINE> Gun Found in Preschooler's Bag  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKER, Fla. (AP) -- A school bus driver found a loaded gun in the
book bag of a 5-year-old pupil, who said he was copying someone he
had seen on television, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no indication he had any intention of harming anyone
or threatening anyone,'' Okaloosa County sheriff's spokesman Rick
Hord said.
</P>
<P>
   A third-grader spotted the small, .380 semiautomatic handgun in
the pre-kindergartener's book bag Tuesday as they rode the bus home
from the all-ages Baker School.
</P>
<P>
   The older child reported the gun to the driver.
</P>
<P>
   No action will be taken against the 5-year-old, who had found
the gun in a drawer at home. Prosecutors are considering whether to
charge his parents with a misdemeanor for failing to store the
weapon properly, Hord said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told a school resource officer he had seen someone carry
a gun in a book bag on television and thought it was ''cool.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Panels OK Spending Bills  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans slashed President Clinton's
proposals for hiring teachers and providing social services on
Wednesday as the biggest and most contentious spending measure of
the year began its long trek through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings of an election-year veto fight, subcommittees
of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved similar
measures providing over $340 billion for education, labor and
health programs. The legislation is for fiscal 2001, which begins
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions would boost spending over this year for many
programs including the Head Start preschool program, the Education
Department and biomedical research at the National Institutes of
Health. But the bills also cut spending for several Clinton
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton threatened a veto. He criticized the
House version more harshly, but also said the Senate falls short in
several areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The House bill shortchanges essential initiatives and fails to
support our nation's children and schools,'' Clinton said in a
written statement. The Senate version ''does not guarantee funding
for critical education priorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House measure would completely ignore the president's
proposals for $1.75 billion to continue helping communities hire
elementary school teachers, and for $1.3 billion for school
construction and repairs. It would also shrink his plans for
after-school centers and retraining some jobless workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version cuts $1.1 billion from Clinton's $1.7 billion
request for grants to states for day care, home-delivered meals and
other social services. It provides $1.4 billion for hiring teachers
and $1.3 billion for school construction, but gives states more
flexibility in using the money.
</P>
<P>
   The bill shows the GOP's ''willingness to slash and burn so many
things'' so enough money is left in the budget for their treasured
tax cuts, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. He said the measure
''doesn't come anywhere near meeting the requirements for
presidential acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. John Porter,
R-Ill., conceded that the bill's total is ''very, very lean'' and
''just a starting point.'' But other Republicans heatedly rejected
Democratic assertions that amid economic plenty, Republicans were
skimping on programs for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Compassion is on this side of the table, too,'' said Rep. Jay
Dickey, R-Ark. ''We're just worried about how we can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate subcommittee,
said he had cut social services grants because states can use money
from their settlement against the tobacco industry. But he, too,
seemed to hint that more money will be needed before the measure
can become law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope at the end of the rainbow to have a bill which will be
signed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bill is for automatically paid benefits like
Medicaid. Clinton requested $106 billion for the rest of the
measure, covering the departments of Labor, Education, and Health
and Human Services. According to preliminary figures, the House
version falls about $6 billion below that, the Senate bill $2
billion short.
</P>
<P>
   The bill serves as an annual battlefield between Clinton and
Congress for issues including abortion, workplace safety
regulations and federal powers over schools. It has been so
controversial that in 1998 and 1999, it never even passed the House
until lawmakers and the administration negotiated a compromise as
part of autumn budget-bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   This year, GOP leaders want to move the bill early as part of
their effort to adjourn Congress early for the fall political
campaigns. Both versions contain extra money for some high-profile
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The House would match Clinton's plan to give the National
Institutes of Health $1 billion more than the $17.8 billion it is
getting this year, while the Senate increase is $2.7 billion. The
House would add $130 million to the $1.6 billion spent this year on
the Ryan White AIDS treatment program, $5 million more than Clinton
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure has $50 million proposed by Specter and Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, for the government to gather data on medical
errors and study ways to prevent it. A report last year said
mistakes by medical personnel cause up to 98,000 hospital deaths
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The full Senate Appropriations Committee plans to vote on the
measure on Thursday. The House Appropriations Committee will
consider it May 24.

<HEADLINE> Giants 4, Cardinals 3  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds, the only major leaguer to hit
a ball into San Francisco Bay, did it two more times Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' 13th and 14th homers of the season, both solo shots,
splashed into McCovey Cove behind right field, and the San
Francisco Giants defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' second homer, off Heathcliff Slocumb (0-2), broke a 3-3
tie in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rodriguez (3-0), who got all three of his wins on the
homestand that ended Wednesday, pitched one inning and Robb Nen got
three outs for his sixth save, striking out Larry Sutton to end the
game with a runner on second.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds became the first player to hit a homer into the bay on May
1 and has all three splashdowns at Pacific Bell Park. Bonds, who
broke an 0-for-16 slump with his 12th homer in the seventh inning
of Tuesday night's 13-6 loss to St. Louis, went 2-for-3 Wednesday
with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also scored on RBI singles by Doug Mirabelli in the
second and Bill Mueller in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Renteria hit a solo homer for St. Louis in the fifth, his
seventh of the season. The Cardinals scored twice in the first on
an RBI double by Jim Edmonds and a run-scoring groundout by Eric
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Benes pitched seven innings for St. Louis, allowing three
runs and six hits, and striking out five. San Francisco starter
Kirk Rueter also allowed three runs on six hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mark McGwire went 0-for-1 with three walks -- two
intentional -- for the Cardinals. ... Bonds got his 767th and 768th
RBIs while wearing a Giants uniform, passing Orlando Cepeda for
eighth place on the franchise list. ... Rueter, a native of
Hoyletown, Ill., who grew up as a fan of the nearby Cardinals, has
a 7-3 career mark against St. Louis. ... San Francisco RF Ellis
Burks was out of the starting lineup for the ninth time in the last
11 games because of a strained left quadriceps. ... The three-game
series marked the only visit by St. Louis to Pacific Bell Park this
season. ... A dropped fly ball by center fielder Jim Edmonds in the
fourth was only the 14th error by the Cardinals this season. ...
The Giants, who have won 14 of 17, went 9-3 on the homestand. It
was their first homestand with nine victories since going 9-4 from
Sept. 11-24, 1989. ... The Cardinals are 0-11 this season when they
make an error. ... It was the 43rd multihomer game for Bonds, tying
him with Lou Gehrig and Dave Kingman for 13th on the career list.
Babe Ruth had 72 multihomer games.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays-Yankees Game Rained Out  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Putting his bats in Jorge Posada's locker didn't
help Derek Jeter. Neither did some friendly advice from Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a day off will help New York's slumping All-Star shortstop
regain his hitting stroke.
</P>
<P>
   While Jeter and manager Joe Torre insist that sitting a game
won't cure hitting woes, heavy rain on Wednesday gave the All-Star
shortstop a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you correct it if you're not playing?'' Jeter said
before the Yankees' game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays was
rained out. ''I'd rather take a day off when I'm playing well than
take a day off now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is 0-for-12 in the last three games -- his first three-game
hitless streak since April 1997 -- and mired in a 6-for-39 slump
that has dropped his average to .268.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre says swinging -- not sitting -- is what Jeter needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''A day off would be counterproductive at this point,'' Torre
said. ''He'll fight his way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre does admit that Jeter needs a different approach at the
plate. He says Jeter's left shoulder is flying open, making him
susceptible to outside pitches, and he's a little ''jumpy'' in the
batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big problem has been that he's not selective enough,''
Torre said. ''I know he is a free swinger, but there's a difference
between that and swinging at everything they throw you.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncharacteristic struggles at the plate, Jeter
hasn't lost confidence. In Tuesday night's 4-3 win over Tampa Bay,
he came up with runners on second and third and one out in the 10th
inning and was certain he would deliver the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he was intentionally walked, setting up Paul O'Neill's
walk-off walk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I'd get the big hit,'' Jeter said. ''There's no
telling what will happen. But I said to myself there's no way
they're going to get me out. The law of averages have to come
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's slump is in sharp contrast to his buddy Posada, who is
12-for-17 on the homestand and hitting .376 with eight homers and
20 RBIs overall.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter put his bats in Posada's locker before Tuesday's game and
rubbed them against him in the dugout hoping for some good luck.
All he got was another 0-for-4 night.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jeter's mother is getting on his case.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mom tells me to get a good pitch and hit it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter will apply that advice Thursday -- a game the Devil Rays
wish they didn't have to play.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay preferred to go home Wednesday and make the game up
when it return Sept. 26-28. But without on off-day around that
series, the Yankees decided to play Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem was the Yankees' decision to play at
7:05 p.m., instead of in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first choice was not to play,'' catcher Mike DiFelice
said. ''If we had to play, we'd prefer to do it in the afternoon.
But it's not our choice. We'd rather spend the day with our
families, but we'll have to put that aside and play the game
whether we like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay general manager Chuck LaMar requested that the Yankees
schedule the game in the afternoon, but understood their decision
to play at night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say we wouldn't have handled it the same way because
you get a bigger gate at night,'' he said. ''But I owed it to the
players, because they are giving up an off-day, to ask to play in
the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Steve Trachsel, who pitched a three-hitter to outduel
Boston's Pedro Martinez 1-0 last Saturday, will start Thursday and
Dave Eiland will be skipped. ''It gives me an extra arm in the
bullpen and after that last outing, I wanted to keep Steve on his
regular turn,'' manager Larry Rothschild said. ... Orlando
Hernandez (4-1) will start for the Yankees. After starting the
season 3-0 with a 1.74 ERA, Hernandez is 1-1 with a 9.18 ERA his
last three starts. ... Rothschild said Wilson Alvarez will likely
need surgery on his injured left shoulder after the season, but
will try to pitch through it and return in three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Utah Hopes for Hot Jazz in Game 3  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- John Stockton insists the Utah Jazz must
''play with fire.'' In another sense, they've been doing that
already -- getting scorched by the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went out there and got our butts kicked,'' forward Bryon
Russell said. ''We've got to go home and defend our home court,
then we're back to square one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Conference semifinals shift to the Delta Center on
Thursday night for Game 3, with Portland in command after two
lopsided victories.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a must that we go home and play with fire, or it's going
to be a short series,'' Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the proud but aging Jazz have been exposed in the
best-of-seven series. The Blazers have warped the famed
pick-and-roll, turning one of Utah's greatest strengths into a
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think nothing has changed over the last four years
with the type of offense they run,'' Scottie Pippen said. ''It's
about us knowing what their plays are about and staying between
them and the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz coach Jerry Sloan gave his players the day off Wednesday to
reflect on their predicament. Before the Blazers left for Salt Lake
City, they proclaimed Utah would be a different team at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'll fight back,'' forward Brian Grant said. ''They will
fight and claw and scratch and kick when we go up there, and it's
going to be a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland has dominated the individual matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Arvydas Sabonis, lighter on his feet, has been a better shooter
than Utah's Olden Polynice. Damon Stoudamire has been a half-step
faster than the 38-year-old Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Russell is having trouble defending Steve Smith and Pippen. The
assignment on Pippen has nagged Russell since the 1997 and 1998 NBA
Finals, when Pippen and the Chicago Bulls beat the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hornacek turned 37 earlier this month and has been limited
by a creaky left knee. At 6-foot-4, he also faces a disadvantage
against the 6-8 Steve Smith and 6-7 Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   And brash Rasheed Wallace is getting the best of Karl Malone,
holding the star forward to 22 points in Game 1 and 15 points in
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're doing a lot of things right,'' Hornacek said.
''They're very active. It's not going good for us right now, but if
we go home and get some confidence back, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland has won five straight over Utah dating to the regular
season, including a 90-86 victory at the Delta Center on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing you learn in this business is that a series is never
won until it's won,'' guard Greg Anthony said. ''We can't get
complacent and we have to come out with an even better effort
because they're going to play at a much higher level.''

<HEADLINE> Former Chiefs RB Faces More Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A federal grand jury on Wednesday
indicted former Kansas City Chiefs running back Bam Morris and two
associates on drug and money laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, 28, Dewayne Calvin Bryant, 28, of Dallas, and Robert
Corey Myers, 22 of Warrensburg, Mo., are charged with one count of
conspiracy to distribute at least 220 pounds of marijuana and one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Morris and Bryant also were charged with one count of
distribution of marijuana and Myers with one count of possession
with intent to distribute marijuana, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike
Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said Wednesday's charges replace a one-count criminal
complaint that had charged the three with conspiracy to distribute
more than 220 pounds of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's indictments resulted from an investigation by the
FBI and the Internal Revenue Service. Morris, Bryant and Myers are
accused of conspiring with others since at least January 1998 to
distribute marijuana in western Missouri and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Morris and Bryant are being held without bond, while Myers is
free on bond pending further court appearances. If convicted on all
counts, the three could be sentenced to a maximum of 40 years in
prison without parole and up to $3.5 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who retired from the Chiefs at the end of the 1999
season, was on probation for a marijuana conviction in Texas when
he was arrested in Kansas City. Texas authorities have issued an
arrest warrant for violating terms of the probation.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who pleaded innocent to the earlier complaint, was
denied bond last month by U.S. Magistrate Judge John T. Maughmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any particular confidence you will follow my
conditions (of release) any more than you've followed the
conditions from Texas,'' Maughmer said in denying bond.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' participation was allegedly financed by former Chiefs
kick return specialist Tamarick Vanover.
</P>
<P>
   Vanover, who is cooperating with the investigation after
pleading guilty to his role in selling a stolen car, was cut by the
Chiefs after it was revealed that he admitted to an FBI agent that
he gave $40,000 to Morris to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' attorney, William Rork, said last month that the charges
against Morris were based solely on the words of Vanover and his
personal assistant, Gregory D. Burns, who has also been charged in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   An affidavit filed earlier this year in connection with drug
charges against Burns refers to Morris, stating that he was a
passenger in a vehicle that was found to have marijuana residue in
it after it left Vanover's driveway. His agent said then that
Morris was ''an innocent party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens signed Morris in September 1996, but he was
suspended for four games for violating the NFL's substance abuse
policy.
</P>
<P>
   He also was suspended for the first four games of the 1997
season after an offseason NFL test revealed he had used alcohol.
When he missed several meetings with his probation officer, he was
sentenced to four months in jail. Morris was released by Baltimore
after his sentencing.

<HEADLINE> House Committee OKs Cuba Food Sales  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican-controlled House committee voted
Wednesday to allow sales of food and medicine to Cuba, over the
objections of Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   By a 35-24 vote, the House Appropriations Committee preserved a
provision in an agricultural appropriations bill that would license
such sales so long as they are not subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would prohibit the president from including
food and medicine in future embargoes of other countries without
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who successfully blocked a similar measure after it
passed the Senate last year, said that trading with Cuba was ''at
odds with the national interest'' and would bolster the government
of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trade cannot come at any price to our freedom ... and to
freedom in other countries,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   But agricultural groups are lobbying heavily for easing the
decades-old embargo on Cuba, and farm-state Republicans allied with
Democrats on the committee to defeat DeLay. Democrats said it was
hypocritical for him to oppose sales to Cuba when he is working to
win permanent trade relations for China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a double standard here. Let's call it what it is,''
said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee added a similar Cuba measure
Tuesday to its version of the agricultural appropriations bill. The
House Appropriations Committee narrowly defeated such legislation
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the embargo say Cuba cannot afford to buy U.S.
food unless it is subsidized by the Agriculture Department. Farm
groups insist Cuba may save enough in shipping costs by buying
American food to make up for the lack of federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo is strongly supported by Florida's politically
powerful Cuban American community, so the legislation is likely to
get tied up in this fall's presidential campaign between Vice
President Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush, said Rep. Jose
Serrano, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is still not free of Bush and Gore trying to win
Florida,'' said Serrano, who voted for easing the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has objected to the provision in the
legislation that would give Congress a say in future embargoes.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Suffers as Violence Grows  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A stock-price plunge on Wednesday
deepened economic woes in Zimbabwe, already reeling from a surge of
political violence that has claimed at least 18 lives.
</P>
<P>
   A stock plunge of 22 percent fueled by panic selling over two
days came amid reports that Zimbabwe had defaulted on major foreign
loans, and the labor-backed opposition said it was considering a
campaign of strikes and an election boycott to protest escalating
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's agriculture-based economy was already suffering more
than 50 percent unemployment and 70 percent inflation before armed
black squatters began occupying white-owned farms in February,
sparking clashes that have killed 18 people.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations and violence have led to sharply lower
deliveries of tobacco -- the country's major hard currency earner --
and have crushed the lucrative tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   Banking officials said Wednesday that the government had fallen
into arrears on repayments of World Bank loans to the state power
and telecommunications utilities.
</P>
<P>
   However, World Bank officials in Washington said Zimbabwe has
until Monday to make payment on a loan. If it defaults, then all
other World Bank loans to the country will be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund last year
froze new loans to Zimbabwe, citing lack of fiscal controls by the
government, deteriorating human rights and the costly deployment of
11,000 troops to back President Laurent Kabila in the distant Congo
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis is further exacerbated by the government's
refusal to devalue currency that is being kept artifically high to
slow the rate of inflation, independent economist John Robertson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard to see a way out of our currency crisis unless
order is restored on the farms and the currency is allowed to find
a realistic level,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, a former head of the
nation's powerful labor federation, said Wednesday his party is
considering a program of strikes and a boycott of parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is seen as the first real challenge to President
Robert Mugabe's rule since he led the nation to independence from
Britain in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Corzine turns table on Florio, takes dramatic lead in poll  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A new poll by Quinnipiac College concludes
that Jon Corzine's heavy spending has given him a dramatic surge in
voter support heading into the June 6 Democratic primary for U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing former Gov. Jim Florio 2 to 1 in a poll taken in
late March, Corzine has now turned the tables on him and leads
Florio by the near-landslide margin of 15 percentage points,
48-to-33, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   But both campaigns denounced the poll numbers, and Steve
Goldstein of the Corzine campaign said their internal polling
showed a much closer race, with Florio still holding a slight lead.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Jim McQueeny said the failure of the poll to
screen for likely primary voters makes the outcome almost
worthless. The poll instead interviewed residents who identified
themselves as registered Democrats. ''The screen is too loose,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by the Hamden, Conn., college based its results on
answers from 347 residents surveyed last week who identified
themselves as registered Democrats. It has a margin of error of 5.3
percentage points, which when used to adjust both returns, still
places Corzine out front by at least 5 percentage points and
possibly by more than 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac political analyst Scott McLean said the change in the
past five weeks is unquestionably caused by Corzine's $1
million-a-week TV commercial blitz, especially the two-week
campaign of harshly negative ads about Florio's career as governor
that ran during the week of the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McLean said the turnaround is so severe, he too
questioned whether these numbers reflected reality. ''I am
convinced that this race is much closer than their numbers
suggest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has yet to air his first TV spot, and the candidates will
engage in the first of four debates Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McLean also said this poll -- the last before the June 6 primary
-- is not valid as the predictor of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Corzine's lead is a mile wide but his loyalty is an inch
deep,'' he said, noting that many Democrats who said they would
vote for him evidently do not have a clear idea of who he is.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, while 48 percent of the Democrats said they would
vote for Corzine today, 55 percent said they did not know enough
about him to form an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   This outcome is explained in part by the fact that 30 percent of
the Democrats said they had an unfavorable view of Florio, and 45
percent concluded his 1990 tax increases were not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Corzine can get this far ahead in one month, spending $8
million unanswered, certainly it can go back the other way in a
couple of weeks with the debates and with Florio's ads,'' McLean
said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio aide Walter Fields said the Quinnipiac Poll results ''are
laughable to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We put no value on this most recent poll. Not only our own
internal polling, but we know those (polls) of the Corzine
campaign, reflect a very close race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, remarkably, agreed, though he said the Quinnipiac
Poll did confirm their assessment that Corzine has the momentum
that will bring him victory in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our own internal polling shows (Florio) to be running stronger
than the Quinnipiac Poll indicates, and in fact shows the opponent
is in the lead,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed with McLean that Corzine's ads attacking Florio's
record as governor have increased the negative assessment of him.
''They build on what people already know to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   McQueeny said primary voter turnout will be low and that Florio
can never be counted out because his base of support among
Democrats is traditional and probably reliable, while Corzine's
support might be shallow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battle is going to be over who turns out to vote in a
boring Democratic primary, and that number is going to be low, and
the lower the turnout in the primary, the bigger the advantage for
Florio,'' McQueeny said. ''Corzine is relying on the outsider's
long-range artillery to wake up the voters and draw them out. That
is a risky proposition.''

<HEADLINE> Taliban, Opposition Sign Pact  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban and
opposition groups signed an agreement Wednesday to exchange
prisoners and ensure safe passage for humanitarian aid officials.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross will be in charge
of the prisoner exchange through contacts with the Taliban and the
opposition, the United Front, according to Mohammed Jawad Zarif,
head of a peace committee on Afghanistan set up by the Organization
of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was ironed out in talks held under the auspices of
the OIC in Saudi Arabia's Red Sea port city of Jiddah -- the OIC's
headquarters -- with the aim of reaching a comprehensive settlement
to the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
   Zarif, also Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister, said the agreement
is ''an important achievement as a start for confidence building
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   OIC officials said Tuesday that the agreement would immediately
put into force a cease-fire, but Zarif's remarks referred only to
ending attacks on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a statement attributed to a spokesman for U.N.
Secretary-general Kofi Annan said the two sides agreed on a
comprehensive exchange of prisoners only.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes just days after the United Nations warned of
heavy fighting in coming weeks in Afghanistan. On Thursday, the
U.N. Security Council expressed fears that the warring groups were
preparing for new offensives.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taliban said that they were committed to peace and would
not initiate any fighting. The hard-line regime accused the
opposition of wanting to destabilize the government and continue
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban's representative Amirkhan Muttaqi told reporters that
his government was ''ready to free all the prisoners whenever the
opposition did likewise.'' He said his government will soon
announce the number of prisoners it holds.

<HEADLINE> IU Trustees May Widen Knight Probe  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana University trustees will meet again
behind closed doors Sunday, apparently to decide whether to expand
the investigation of charges against basketball coach Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
   University president Myles Brand in March appointed two trustees
to look into accusations that Knight grabbed former player Neil
Reed by the throat during a 1997 practice. Since then, other
damaging claims have been made against the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis television station WRTV on Tuesday quoted
unidentified sources as saying the trustees heard new accusations
against Knight at a board meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana athletic director Clarence Doninger told The Associated
Press on Wednesday that ''various things'' unrelated to Reed have
been reported since Reed's charges were made public in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether the trustees discussed those or not, I don't know. I
guess I had always thought that as they went through this review
there would be some discussion of other things, but I don't know
that for a fact,'' Doninger said.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees met in a closed executive session last Thursday
during a regularly scheduled board meeting. At that time, there had
been no investigation beyond Reed, a source close to the
investigation told the AP on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   John Walda, the trustees' president, and Frederick Eichhorn, a
trustee and former president of the Indiana State Bar Association,
were appointed by Brand to investigate the accusation by Reed, who
transferred from Indiana in 1997. The two also are investigating
claims that Knight once kicked Brand out of a practice and also
showed players a piece of soiled toilet paper, saying that was what
their practice resembled.
</P>
<P>
   The university said the trustees will meet again on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The WRTV report said Eichhorn and Walda told the board several
of the people they interviewed volunteered new information,
including accusations unrelated to Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Walda did not immediately return a telephone message seeking
comment left at his office in Fort Wayne. Eichhorn, contacted at
his office in Gary, said he would not comment until the
investigation was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who was out of town Wednesday, denied the original
accusations. Brand has said he was never told to leave practice,
and university vice president Christopher Simpson, who has been
Brand's spokesman during the investigation, refused to comment on
the WRTV report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation is continuing, and we anticipate it being
completed well within the parameters of mid-June,'' Simpson said of
the 90-day deadline originally announced by Brand.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Thompson To Miss Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers' left-hander Justin
Thompson will have surgery Friday to repair a torn rotator cuff and
will miss the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   The decision for more surgery on Thompson's pitching shoulder
was made Wednesday after an examination by noted orthopedist Dr.
James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was recalled from a medical rehab May 1, and appeared
close to joining the Rangers until he continued to have sorness in
his left shoulder last week. A preliminary MRI was done Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Conway, the Rangers' team physician, said the tear
appeared larger than first thought and that surgery was the best
option for Thompson to have a chance to play in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can continue to rehab and hope it gets better, but at this
stage he will not be ready for this season anyway,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said the recovery time will be six to 12 months, meaning
Thompson could be ready to for spring training. Conway will operate
in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The tear was not fixed when Thompson had surgery from Dr.
Andrews last Aug. 27 to repair tears in the labrum of that shoulder
and smooth out fraying in the rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers and team doctors said that it's not unusual for
pitchers to have abnormality in the cuff.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Crazy Eddie Family  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Shareholders in the failed Crazy Eddie
electronics chain should get $72.7 million from three of the
company's principals who engaged in stock fraud, a federal judge
has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Investors lost at least $145.9 million when Crazy Eddie
collapsed in 1987 in one of the nation's largest swindles. The
chain was known for frenzied pitchman Eddie Antar, who touted
''INSAAAAAANE'' prices.
</P>
<P>
   If collected, the $72.7 million would be in addition to $120
million the investors already received in compensation, most of it
from bank accounts that Antar kept around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Harold Ackerman comes in a
civil case against three of Antar's family members -- his father,
brother, and brother-in-law -- brought by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled in 1998 that the three relatives sold
artificially inflated stock in the chain from 1984-87. His judgment
on the amount of restitution was entered April 27.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who represented the three Antars, Bruce Goldstein,
declined to comment on the ruling. At trial in 1997, he argued his
clients were unaware of the schemes that made the company look more
profitable than it was.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Antar fled the country about February 1990 after the
chain's collapse, and was arrested two years later in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He and another brother, Mitchell Antar, were convicted of stock
fraud at a criminal trial in 1993. Their convictions were
overturned in 1995, but both pleaded guilty before a retrial. They
have since finished prison terms.

<HEADLINE> Mich., Ill. Boast Big Game Winners  </HEADLINE>
By A.J. DICKERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, Mich. (AP) -- The record-shattering $363 million bounty in
the Big Game lottery came down to two tickets -- one sold in
Illinois, the other in Michigan to a ''remarkably quite calm'' man
who called officials Wednesday to claim his share.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan lottery officials believe the man holds one of the
winning tickets, but he had not stepped forward publicly as of
Wednesday night. Illinois officials had yet to hear from the
ticketholder there.
</P>
<P>
   The winning tickets to Tuesday night's drawing in the
seven-state lottery were sold at Mr. K's Party Shoppe near Utica,
20 miles north of Detroit, and Sweeney's Citgo in the Chicago
suburb of Lake Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, owner of Sweeney's Citgo, hit the jackpot, too -- a
$1.8 million bonus for selling a winning ticket. But because of
Michigan's different rules, Mr. K's owner George Kassab will get
only $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a slap on the face,'' son Mark Kassab said.
</P>
<P>
   The jackpot easily topped the previous American record, a $295.7
million Powerball prize split by 13 machinists in Westerville,
Ohio, two years ago. Big Game tickets are sold in Georgia,
Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the ''remarkably quite calm'' man who claimed to
have the winning numbers didn't identify himself, but the
validation numbers he recited from his ticket matched, lottery
spokeswoman Sarah Lapshan said. He did not say where he was from or
whether the ticket was his alone or bought for a group.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty confident this is the winning ticket,'' Lapshan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing capped days of frenzy that sent lottery veterans and
first-time players alike scurrying for $1 chances at the big dream,
despite odds of 76 million to 1 against getting all six numbers.
Some waited for several hours in lines at stores near non-Big Game
states.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least I only lost a dollar,'' said Robert Holland, a
bartender at the East Atlanta Restaurant and Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Altz, a regular customer of the Michigan store that sold
the winning ticket, said she flipped on TV Wednesday morning, saw
the news and grabbed her $20 worth of tickets -- but found no
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Given her severe asthma, she said, it's probably just as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could go into shock,'' Altz said. ''I hope whoever won it
needed it and had a rough life.''
</P>
<P>
   How much the winners will take home depends on state taxes in
Michigan and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Don Gilmer, Michigan lottery commissioner, estimated that the
Michigan winner could get $7 million a year -- $135,000 a week --
over the next 26 years, before taxes. He said he couldn't give an
after-tax figure.
</P>
<P>
   At Sweeney's Citgo, Sweeney said the bonus was close to 10
years' profits for all eight of the stores he owns. He said he
plans to use some of the money to pay bills, and some to treat the
employees and celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a couple islands for sale. And I thought about them.
But I didn't think much about them because I know the odds,''
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37 and Big Money Ball 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're glad it's over with,'' Gilmer said. ''The jackpot got to
almost unrealistic heights.''
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set in December by
Spain's El Gordo, or the Fat One. But that game spreads the jackpot
out among thousands of winners.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. Push for Security  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Faced with increasingly sophisticated crime rings
and terrorist networks, Canada and the United States are working
together to increase security across North America.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials of both countries said Wednesday the goal
was to prevent illegal immigrants and other undesirables from ever
reaching the continent.
</P>
<P>
   By sharing information and coordinating efforts with other
countries, the North American neighbors can operate more
efficiently and minimize security along their lengthy land border,
the officials told a teleconference on border issues from
Washington, broadcast in Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Border security concerns increased after the December arrest of
a suspected terrorist in Port Angeles, Washington, who was trying
to enter from Canada with bomb-making materials in the trunk of the
car he was driving.
</P>
<P>
   The case prompted criticism in the United States that Canada was
lax in enforcing immigration regulations. The suspect arrested,
Ahmed Ressam, was an Algerian who had been ordered deported after
his application for refugee status was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being ordered to leave, he was never was deported, even
after getting arrested for theft in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The perimeter security thinking discussed Wednesday would focus
on people traveling to the United States or Canada from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want to do is increase our effectiveness at
interdicting anyone who shouldn't be coming in the first place,''
said Michael Cronin, an acting deputy commissioner of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   He called it a common-sense approach that best uses resources
and officers. For example, Cronin said, a Canadian officer in
Bangkok with information that a U.S.-bound traveler had a forged
passport would notify the airline to prevent the passenger from
flying.
</P>
<P>
   Working overseas to stop illegal or undesirable immigrants
''will give us greater confidence in terms of how we manage the
actual land border between our two countries,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Economic Program Readied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government's economic program, months
in the making and shrouded in secrecy, will be ready by the end of
May, acting Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Cabinet will discuss the document, make adjustments
and implement it in June, Kasyanov said after a meeting with other
ministers, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over when Boris Yeltsin resigned on Dec. 31,
President Vladimir Putin has said little about what the economic
program entails. But he has several liberal economic advisers
working on the plan, and it was expected to focus on continued
market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov's appointment as prime minister on Sunday was seen as
confirmation that the government would continue economic
liberalization. Kasyanov, who previously served as finance minister
and a deputy premier, has called for greater freedom for business
and overhauling the tangled tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov's appointment must still be approved by parliament, but
wasn't expected to face major opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry said Wednesday that a team from the
International Monetary Fund would come to Moscow on May 15 to
discuss a new loan program, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF suspended its most recent loan program to Russia because
the government didn't meet several loan conditions, among them
making the central bank's operations more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Russian consumer prices rose 0.9 percent in April, up
slightly from 0.6 percent a month earlier, the Russian Statistics
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is currently at 11.4 percent, well below last year's
rate of 36.3 percent. The 2000 budget factors in inflation of 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Economics Ministry said Wednesday that Russian exports
jumped 41 percent in the first quarter of this year, reaching $17.8
billion compared to $12.6 billion last year. The increase was
partly due to rising prices for oil, the country's biggest export
commodity.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Admits Role in Murder  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan said he
regrets his writings may have led others to murder Malcolm X in a
''60 Minutes'' interview to be broadcast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke while seated across the table from the civil rights
leader's oldest daughter, Attallah Shabazz. She later issued a
statement thanking Farrakhan for acknowledging his role and said:
''I wish him peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz, then 6, saw her father gunned down in the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem on Feb. 21, 1965. Three men with ties to the
Nation of Islam were convicted in the slaying and served prison
terms.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Malcolm X's criticism of Nation of Islam
spiritual leader Elijah Muhammad had caused a bitter split with
church leaders, including Farrakhan. Farrakhan called Malcolm X a
traitor and wrote, two months before the killing, that ''such a man
is worthy of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan has denied ordering the assassination but in 1994
admitted to having ''helped create the atmosphere'' that led to it.
</P>
<P>
   His four-hour meeting with Shabazz and ''60 Minutes''
correspondent Mike Wallace, organized at her request, took place at
Farrakhan's home in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan told them that he ''truly loved'' Malcolm X and
carried his picture after his death. Shabazz's body visibly
stiffened, arms crossed over her chest, when Wallace quoted from
Farrakhan's writings about Malcolm X before he died.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Farrakhan said that the U.S. government
spied on black leaders and were concerned about a ''black messiah''
who could unite the community. ''This is bigger than the Nation of
Islam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz, struggling to keep control of her emotions, said that
while she believed the FBI had something to do with her father's
death, it was young black men who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't keep pointing fingers,'' she said. ''My father was
not killed from a grassy knoll.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan said: ''Yes, it is true that black men pulled the
trigger. We cannot deny any responsibility in this. Where we are
responsible, where our hands are a part of this, we beg God's mercy
and forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I genuinely hope that perhaps a healing can come to Miss
Shabazz and her family,'' he continued. ''As I may have been
complicit in words that I spoke leading up to February 21st, I
acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused
the loss of life of a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz's reaction to these words aren't shown. Wallace said she
needed time to absorb them. She issued a statement this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's never admitted this before publicly,'' she said. ''Until
now, he's never caressed my father's children. I thank him for
acknowledging his culpability and I wish him peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz's mother, Betty Shabazz, who died in 1997, had publicly
accused Farrakhan of a role in the murder. She reconciled with him
after her daughter Qubilah was charged in 1994 with plotting to
hire a hitman to kill him. The charges were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he believed that Farrakhan, who has battled
prostate cancer and other health problems, is making amends partly
because he has faced his own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Farrakhan publicly embraced W. Deen Mohammed,
son of Elijah Muhammad, in an attempt to heal wounds that have
split U.S. Muslims into factions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that he has thought seriously about the people he has
disaffected,'' Wallace said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz said it was still difficult for her to meet with
Farrakhan on camera. ''I did not know if I wanted to sit across
from him,'' she said. ''I did not know if my heart could handle
it.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bishop Has Rome's Approval  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Four months after China's state-controlled
Catholic church ordained five bishops in defiance of the Vatican, a
new bishop for China has been named with Rome's approval, the
Vatican's missionary news agency said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ordination on Sunday of Zhao Fengchang, 66, in Yanggu
contrasted with the ceremony organized in January without the
approval of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before the sacramental ordination began (Sunday), the approval
of the Holy See was announced in public,'' Rome-based Fides said.
</P>
<P>
   China and the Vatican broke formal relations in 1951, when the
Communists kicked out missionaries and forced Catholics to sever
ties with Rome.
</P>
<P>
   China's officially sanctioned church does not recognize papal
authority, including the right to appoint bishops, and it chose the
Jan. 6 Epiphany holiday, the traditional day when the pope ordains
bishops, for its own ordination of the five bishops in Beijing's
cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican at the time said the unapproved ordinations would
set back efforts to normalize Vatican-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Catholics who accept papal authority as part of an
underground church loyal to Rome have suffered harassment and
arrest.

<HEADLINE> Expos Closer Urbina To Have MRI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal Expos closer Ugueth Urbina was
unavailable for Wednesday night's game against the Philadelphia
Phillies after feeling pain in his right elbow while warming up the
previous night.
</P>
<P>
   Urbina, last year's NL saves leader with 41, told team officials
about the pain following the Expos' 3-2 win Tuesday night. X-rays
of the elbow were taken on Wednesday and an MRI will be performed
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Urbina, 26, had bone chips removed from his right elbow in
December 1996 after experiencing pain while pitching in his native
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out the side while recording his eighth save in his
last outing, Sunday at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Lloyd, signed as a free agent be to Montreal's set man,
hasn't pitched this season. He had arthroscopic surgery on his left
shoulder May 4 and won't return for at least three months.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Strickland, the Expos' current setup man, is on the
disabled list because of right shoulder tendinitis.

<HEADLINE> Annan Chastises Member-States  </HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan chastised
powerful U.N. member-states Wednesday for not sending their
better-trained forces to assist the embattled peacekeepers there as
they prepare for a possible rebel onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had hoped that some of those with the capacity would go to
the assistance of those who are in there doing the bidding of the
Security Council and the U.N,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 8,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone were
deployed to enforce last July's peace accord, which ended a brutal
eight-year civil war in the West African nation. The mission,
largely made up of troops from poorer African states, has been
hampered by faulty equipment and, some say, a lack of preparedness
for peacekeeping duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best peacekeeper is a well-trained soldier and we would
have liked to see some of the governments with capacity, with good
armies and well-trained soldiers to participate,'' Annan said.
''But they are not running forward to contribute to this force so
we have to take the forces we get.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Sierra Leone began to deteriorate sharply last
week after a regional African intervention force that was also
patrolling the country pulled out. Rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front began attacking the peacekeepers, taking more than 500
U.N. personnel hostage and disarming many others.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. has budgeted $265 million to cover the costs of the
peacekeeping mission from July 1999 through the end of June. The
proposed budget released this week for July through June 2001 is
nearly double that -- $476 million.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. member-states are obligated to contribute financially to
peacekeeping missions based on their abilities to pay. The United
States, which did not volunteer troops for the mission, is behind
on its peacekeeping dues.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he had been speaking with the Clinton administration
on ways the United States could be more supportive of the mission.
The United States has agreed to ferry peacekeepers from other
countries into the war-torn nation.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, meanwhile, has sent troops to Sierra Leone to evacuate
British and other foreign nationals from Freetown, the capital.
British officials said the troops will not be fighting alongside
the peacekeepers, but Annan said their presence was helping secure
a vital airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least they have moved, they have done something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once fully deployed, the mission in Sierra Leone will be largest
U.N. peacekeeping effort currently in action in the world. Its
planned strength is more than 11,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Security Council discussed possibly revising
the mandate of the peacekeeping mission, council diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Several ambassadors asked what it would take for the mission to
become a more robust peace enforcement operation instead of a
peacekeeping mission. Others, however, said the focus must remain
on implementing the current mandate, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that any revision was immediately
planned. Ambassadors were waiting for the return from Sierra Leone
of the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations, Bernard Miyet, to
recommend next steps.
</P>
<P>
   But the council may wish to increase the authorized strength of
the 11,100-member mission to accommodate new troops that might be
contributed from the region, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has approached Nigeria to send in extra
battalions, and on Wednesday it appeared discussions were focusing
on incorporating any new troops into the U.N. mission rather than
having them operate outside of the U.N. mandate, the diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Freetown, the U.N. dispatched a humanitarian assessment
mission to areas where fighting was reported. U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said the mission would travel as far as security conditions

   During the civil war in Sierra Leone, RUF rebels were
responsible for killing tens of thousands of civilians and maiming
many more. Limbless men, women and children are a frequent sight
there, and on Wednesday, thousands of people were fleeing into the
capital in hopes of escaping any renewed fighting.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Flag Burned in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
By LEIGH STROPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- As protesters burned Confederate and Nazi
flags outside South Carolina's Statehouse on Wednesday, black
Democrats and hard-core flag supporters joined forces to shoot down
a compromise amendment that would have removed the Confederate
banner from the Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of behind-the-scenes negotiations, the amendment
failed 82-35. Lawmakers continued Wednesday night to debate the
main bill about removing the Confederate flag; it was unclear when
they would take a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would have flown a similar, square Confederate
banner at a Statehouse monument to Confederate soldiers along with
banners from South Carolina regiments from World War I and II, and
the Korean and Vietnam wars. The plan also would have allowed the
Confederate flag to fly from the dome on Confederate Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is that not a small concession?'' said Rep. Bob Sheheen, a
Democrat who favored the idea. ''You get 364 days out of it and
they get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the state's first official celebration of
Confederate Memorial Day, someone vandalized the Confederate
soldier monument in front of the Statehouse, spray painting the
words ''take it down, don't put it here'' in red on the granite
base.
</P>
<P>
   The monument is where the Democrat-controlled Senate decided a
version of the flag should go. Republicans, who control the House,
favor the Senate plan, but it is opposed by many black legislators
and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
which has a 5-month-old tourism boycott of the state.
</P>
<P>
   They say the monument, which is at one of Columbia's busiest
intersections, would be too prominent a place.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP was a handful of votes short of the majority needed to
approve the Senate's plan. The war flags plan was an attempt to win
over black and white Democrats. White Democrats broke with their
black colleagues on the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Black Democrats joined with Republican flag supporters to defeat
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Another version of the Confederate flag, one that does not
resemble the better-known battle flag used in South Carolina, flew
over the North Carolina state Capitol on Wednesday for Confederate
Memorial Day. The custom dates to 1961, the centennial year for the
start of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Flag opponents ignited Confederate and Nazi flags on the South
Carolina Statehouse lawn at midday.
</P>
<P>
   Both emblems represent ''crimes against humanity,'' said Kevin
Gray of the Harriet Tubman Read Street Freedom House Project in
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag did not immediately ignite, and its
supporters chanted back, ''It won't burn.''
</P>
<P>
   The monument was vandalized early Wednesday. No immediate
arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag was raised above the Statehouse in 1962 to
commemorate the Civil War centennial, though critics suggest it was
also a gesture of defiance toward the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say it is an important part of the state's heritage;
opponents say it represents slavery and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Many state employees got the day off for South Carolina's first
permanent holiday to recognize Confederate Memorial Day. It was
authorized by a bill signed last week that also created a permanent
Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in February.

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed in Cyclist Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Murder charges were filed Wednesday
against three young men who admitted shooting a 17-year-old boy as
he biked near his home because they were looking for somebody to
kill.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the three had been driving around for several days
practicing how to shoot someone, even pointing guns at people,
before they happened upon Tony Basta taking his nightly bike ride
on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects told police they drove past Basta, came around and
passed him again, and finally shot him once in the back. They told
police they watched him fall, then laughed and congratulated each
other on getting their ''first blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Basta died shortly afterward at Regions Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with second-degree murder were Daniel Angus, 18, Dale
Stewart, 19, and Jonathan McNeill, 19. Ramsey County Attorney Susan
Gaertner said she would seek grand jury indictments for
first-degree murder. Bail was set at $1 million each. Their first
court appearance was set for Thursday; it wasn't immediately clear
if they had lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Basta, an 11th-grader and aspiring photographer, was studying
media arts at the elite Perpich Center for Arts Education in Golden
Valley.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Weapons Incinerator Leaks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOOELE, Utah (AP) -- A tiny amount of deadly nerve gas leaked
from an Army chemical weapons incinerator, but the quantity was not
harmful to residents, plant operators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The incinerator at the Tooele Chemical Agent Facility was shut
down so a team of experts could investigate the source of the leak,
which plant operators said was detected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The leak exceeded state environmental rules, but plant operators
said it was not harmful to residents or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls made to the plant's offices Wednesday were not
answered. It could not be confirmed what type of lethal gas leaked.
</P>
<P>
   The incinerator, 50 miles west of Salt Lake City, is where the
Army is destroying part of its inventory of obsolete chemical
weapons. The plant began operating in 1996 and is expected to
finish destroying the weapons after 2004.

<HEADLINE> Castro Daughter Joins Elian Protest  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fidel Castro's estranged daughter joined in as demonstrators
carrying U.S. flags rallied in more than a dozen cities Wednesday
to show their support for the relatives of Elian Gonzalez who want
the boy to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters gathered outside federal buildings in cities from
Miami to Jersey City, N.J., to Kansas City, Mo., the day before an
Atlanta federal appeals court was to consider the relatives'
request to grant political asylum to the 6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta is to consider
whether the boy is entitled to pursue an asylum claim against the
wishes of his father and an order from the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Elian had been staying with his Miami relatives since late
November, when he was found floating off the coast of Florida
lashed to an inner tube. He was seized April 22 by federal agents
and since then has been with his father, stepmother and 6-month-old
half-brother in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The court has ordered Elian to stay in the United States until
it rules, which could happen in hours or take months.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, more than 500 people carried U.S. flags and shouted
''Justice for Elian,'' shutting down two downtown blocks.
</P>
<P>
   White and yellow stenciled posters carried messages reading
''Not even a father has a right to condemn a child to slavery'' and
''Communism is slavery. Did America forget?'' One sign equated
President Clinton to Cuban President Fidel Castro and transformed
the C's in their names into the communist hammer and sickle.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 people gathered for a prayer vigil Wednesday night at
the Little Havana home where Elian had been staying with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that the child will have a chance to stay here in this
country,'' said Bernardo Alvarez, who left Cuba in 1968 with his
family. ''Here he can be anything he wants to be. Not in Cuba. In
Cuba he won't have the choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, more than 300 people waved signs and U.S. and
Cuban flags. ''Elian Gonzalez is forever etched in history as Anne
Frank is etched in history,'' said organizer Scott Holleran.
</P>
<P>
   In Jersey City, N.J., Alina Fernandez, Castro's daughter, and
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, greeted each other with
clasped hands in Liberty State Park, where they were to speak at a
afternoon rally of about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tragedy would not have happened if Cuba was free,''
Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller groups gathered elsewhere. About two dozen protesters
carried signs in downtown Jacksonville, and about half a dozen
people came to the federal courthouse in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's 83-degree heat, more than 50 women dressed in black
for Mothers Against Repression, which supports Cuban political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian for us is one of thousands of people that have come to
our shores in search of freedom, and we are here as Americans to
support Elian's right to be free,'' said leader Sylvia Iriondo.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks plunged early Thursday, pushed down by
continued weakness on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against
the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 440.00 points,
or 2.49 percent, to 17,261.47 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the average closed down 143.07 points, or
0.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 109.42 yen, up 0.06 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 109.39 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices moved sharply lower as investor
sentiment remained bearish following continued declines in U.S.
stocks, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 168.97 points
to 10,367.78 points at Wednesday's close. The technology-heavy
Nasdaq composite index closed at 3,384.73 points, down 200.28
points.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 37.98 points, or 2.29 percent, to 1,621.88
points. The TOPIX closed down 9.28 points, or 0.56 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar's strength was supported by
speculation the Federal Reserve may move to raise interest rates to
prevent the U.S. economy from overheating. The Fed's board meeting
is to be held May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates tend to make a country's currency more
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 98.72 yen, down from
99.30 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.7050 from Wednesday's finish of 1.7250 percent. Its price rose
0.17 point to 100.81.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Many Underestimate Hurricanes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many people vulnerable to the devastation of
hurricanes and related flooding underestimate their risk and are
not prepared for the storms, according to a poll released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which was conducted to gauge residents' knowledge of
storm safety and damage prevention, questioned more than 1,200
residents of coastal states from Massachusetts to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Poll takers concluded that homeowners are concerned about
hurricanes and many have experienced them, but they perceive they
are not at risk and so many are unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many people do little to protect their homes from
hurricanes because they think the cost is much higher than it
actually is.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of preparation is also due in part to residents' low
''Hurricane IQ'' or knowledge about hurricanes, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People underappreciate the dangers that a severe hurricane
would really pose to communities because people just aren't able to
suspend their disbelief for a moment and say, 'We could really be
hit by a terrific hurricane,''' said Marty McGough, who
administered the poll for Penn, Schoen &AMP; Berland Associates in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Though nearly 80 percent of the people polled believed their
community is at either great risk or some risk of a hurricane, more
than half have not protected their homes and nearly two-thirds are
not protected against flooding. One-third of the homeowners do not
have an evacuation plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's one message we can take from this poll, it's the
fact that there's still enormous work to be done to help people
understand specific steps they can take to safeguard their
families' lives and homes -- as well as their communities,'' said
James Lee Witt, Federal Emergency Management Agency director.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted in April and May. The margin of error for
the study was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Group of Chinese Migrants Sent Home
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Ninety Chinese migrants were
put aboard a plane Wednesday under armed guard to return to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Citizenship and Immigration Canada tried to quietly handle the
deportation of 75 men, 11 women and four children who were among
almost 600 migrants to arrive illegally off the West Coast last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Migrants were given scant warning about their departure.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest deportation of the migrants since their
arrival in four decrepit boats beginning last July and was among
the largest in Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   It brings to 113 the number of boat migrants returned to China
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 400 Chinese migrants had been in custody in British
Columbia since four boats carrying almost 600 people from China's
Fujian province arrived off the West Coast last summer.

Alberta MP Cleared of Unlawful Confinement Charge
</P>
<P>
   MELFORT, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Alberta MP Jack Ramsay walked out
of court Wednesday cleared of an allegation that he once ordered a
teenage girl to take down her underwear and threatened to shoot her
in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The former RCMP officer and onetime Reform justice critic had
been charged with unlawful confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Justice Gene A. Smith said she did not believe the
woman fabricated her testimony, she said her inability to pin down
a year when the incident occurred created reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Ramsay was sentenced to nine months in jail for the
attempted rape of a 14-year-old girl in the same isolated community
in northern Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
   He remains free on bail while he appeals that conviction.

Experts Comment on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Slim Defense
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- David Trott likely will have
a hard time using fetal alcohol syndrome as a defense against
accusations he abducted and murdered a nine-year-old girl, legal
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But if he's convicted, it might open the door for her family to
sue the British Columbia government because Trott never got the
treatment he and his family wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Trott is charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder in the
death of Jessica Russell, the daughter of a casual acquaintance who
disappeared last Thursday on her way to school.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy on the girl's body, found Friday inside a charred,
vacant trailer, showed she had been strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Trott is being held in the Surrey Pre-trial Center until his
next court appearance May 23.

Women Eight Times More Likely To Die of Heart Disease Than Any
Other Illness
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- The top killer of women is
heart disease. Breast cancer and other cancers are way down the
list, Dr. Donna Stewart told an international conference on women,
heart disease and stroke Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows women -- and doctors -- are not as aware as they
should be of heart disease and its potential impact on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, of the University of Toronto, was part of a recent
study of 250 heart patients that found women approach heart
conditions less vigorously than men and that hurts their chances
for prompt treatment and better recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The women in the study reported having heart-condition warning
signs up to 30 days before seeking hospital treatment, said
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The signs include: pain radiating down the arms, nausea and
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said delaying a trip to the hospital can hurt a woman's
chances for recovery because many heart-saving drugs must be
immediately administered to be effective.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Trustees Won't Release File  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic trustees refused Wednesday to
release a secret document that purportedly identifies IOC members
and their preferences for gifts or favors.
</P>
<P>
   The ''geld'' file, named after the German word for money, was
turned over the U.S. Justice Department in its criminal
investigation of the Olympic bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee argued that
releasing the file could prejudice the investigation by giving
unwary targets of the probe a heads-up, and might undermine SLOC's
uncertain status in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has never assured SLOC that it is not a target
of the investigation,'' said Beth Wilkinson, a Los Angeles lawyer
hired by the organizing committee after it was revealed bid
executives had plied members of the International Olympic Committee
with $1.2 million in inducements.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, a former federal prosecutor, said the Justice
Department might be using the geld file to surprise or test the
truthfulness of interview subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But SLOC President Mitt Romney, clearly tiring of the dragging
scandal and a deluge of media requests for bid records, said he
preferred to ''just get it out and suffer the slings and arrows.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I overwhelmingly want to release all of the information that
relates to the conduct of the bid. I want to get that stuff out of
here,'' Romney said.
</P>
<P>
   His board disagreed, voting 12-5 to keep the geld file under
wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic trustees also voted 13-3 against publicly disclosing
details about the amounts spent by SLOC on a battery of lawyers to
defend or represent the committee, some of its officers and bid
executives in the Olympic scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Romney, Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson and Ken Bullock,
director of the Utah League of Cities and Towns, were among the few
trustees voting in favor of disclosure in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   The board's refusal was the second time in three months trustees
followed the advice of lawyers and refused to turn over documents
to news agencies and TV stations under a new open-records policy.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees also refused to make public a list of documents
subpoenaed by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Romney planned to advance a compromise motion,
delaying the release of the geld file for 60 days and giving the
Justice Department advance notice of the release. Noting the
investigation has dragged on for 15 months, Romney said the geld
file might have already served its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But after closing their board meeting for 45 minutes, trustees
emerged to vote against releasing the document under any condition.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after trustees heard a lawyer for one TV station
and editors of two newspapers argue there was no sign SLOC itself
was a target and that the committee had no obligation to aid a
criminal investigation of others.

<HEADLINE> Three brothers who want to be a millionaire share secrets ofgetting on show  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Want a chance to play for a million
dollars? The Barbour brothers have a system.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers -- Paul, Mark and Mike -- are the first three
siblings to qualify for ABC's popular game show, ''Who Wants To Be
A Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Their secret: Bone up on geography and chronological lists,
review those old Trivial Pursuit cards and keep calling back.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are little things you can do to increase your chances,''
said Paul Barbour, a 38-year-old lawyer from Baldwinsville, N.Y.
''It's not just being lucky or smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barbour connection on the hit game show began shortly after
it made its debut last August. Paul was picked to appear on the
second show Aug. 17, a show taped well before anyone had an inkling
it would become the newest national craze and television's
top-rated program.
</P>
<P>
   Mark, 43, who works with computers at Welch Allyn, a medical and
diagnostic equipment maker in Skaneateles, appeared on the show
March 30.
</P>
<P>
   Neither brother made it past the preliminary ''fastest-finger
round,'' the prelude to sitting in the hot seat answering trivia
questions from host Regis Philbin. However, they were able to pass
on some advice to big brother, Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Mike, assistant director of theater at LeMoyne College, finally
made the show in April, after several close calls. That show aired
Wednesday night and like his brothers, Mike Barbour did not make it
to the hot seat either.
</P>
<P>
   Mike admitted being driven by a certain amount of competition
and pressure when his two younger brothers could both boast about
appearing on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I absolutely didn't want to be the dullard of the lot,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's appearance is generating national attention because it
marks the first time three siblings have been on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a number of families. But the closest we've had (to
three siblings) was two brothers and a sister-in-law,'' said Pat
Preblick, a publicist for the show.
</P>
<P>
   An ''Inside Edition'' crew was to film the brothers at Mike's
home watching Wednesday night's show. A producer from ''The Rosie
O'Donnell Show'' also has expressed interest in getting the
brothers on that syndicated talk show.
</P>
<P>
   To apply to be on ''Millionaire,'' Mike Barbour called a
toll-free contestant line and followed recorded instructions for
answering three multiple-choice trivia questions. The questions
required the caller to put three items in order in 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, you can figure out what kinds of things to look
at to give yourself some help,'' said Mike Barbour. ''They either
have to be putting things in order geographically or
chronologically.''
</P>
<P>
   His brothers also told him that many of the questions were
similar or identical to ones posed in Trivial Pursuit, the board
game that captivated Americans in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The real secret, though, is to be persistent, said Paul, who
knows something about being resolute, having tried regularly for
nearly two decades to get on ''Jeopardy'' without success.

   Roughly 250,000 people call to win their way onto each show.
Producers estimate that 3 to 5 percent answer all three questions
correctly. Those people then choose one of the upcoming tape dates
and enter a 5-question playoff round. Ultimately, 40 people are
selected for each show.

<P>
   ''If you get into the playoff, your odds are good. The trick is
to get to the playoff,'' said Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who is trying to get back on the show, is now writing a
book with tips on how to qualify as a contestant. Called ''Who
Wants to be a Contestant?'' the 200-page book will be published by
Harper-Collins and is due in bookstores in July or August, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was stockpiling all these tips and ran out of brothers to
train,'' said Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no more Barbour brothers to try out for the
show, they do have an older sister, Kathryn, a college dean in
California. She hasn't tried to qualify yet, but if she ever
decides to, she knows where to turn for those final answers.

<HEADLINE> Rough Hurricane Season Predicted  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane season is fast approaching and the
outlook isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Federal storm specialists predicted an above-average storm
season Wednesday, calling for stronger, longer-lasting storms this
year, and more of them.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane season officially begins June 1, and the outlook is
for 11 tropical storms, seven of which will be hurricanes, three of
them major.
</P>
<P>
   ''This puts coastal areas and the Caribbean islands at a much
higher risk of experiencing a tropical storm or hurricane,'' said
D. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast is similar to last year's, which was followed by a
series of serious storms, including Hurricane Floyd, that caused
massive evacuations along the Southeastern coast and then inundated
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The La Nina cooling of water in the Pacific Ocean, the same
condition that influenced the 1999 season, remains in place, Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For this reason we expect we'll have another major economic
impact on the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just about the number'' of storms, added Max
Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
''What really counts is where they make landfall and how strong
they are. Just one hurricane over your community makes it a very
bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, stressed the importance of having a plan and being prepared
for the storms. He cited community efforts, including Project
Impact, which helps people strengthen their homes against storms of
all types.
</P>
<P>
   A poll the agency released Wednesday revealed that more than
half of people vulnerable to hurricane damage don't prepare
adequately because they underestimate their risk. Poll takers also
concluded that many do little to protect their homes because they
think the cost is much higher than it actually is. One-third of the
homeowners do not have an evacuation plan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 people from Massachusettes to Texas were
questioned for the poll in April and May. The margin of error was
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Witt signed a memorandum pledging to work closely
together to warn people of impending storms and help them prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter how good the forecast is if people don't
plan in advance,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's evacuations left thousands of people trapped on
jammed highways for hours and the forecasters said that is a
problem they hope to avoid in the future. Coastal areas subject to
flooding need to be evacuated in storms, but not every place that
merely expects wind damage, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You flee from storm surge, you hide from wind,'' said
Mayfield, calling on people to get storm shutters, build safe rooms
and take other steps to prepare their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The new outlook from the government forecasters echoes that of
Bill Gray of Colorado State University, one of the few willing to
make long-range storm predictions. For this season he also
predicted 11 named storms.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield was picked last week to replace the retired Jerry
Jarrell as director of the hurricane center.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week a new weather satellite was launched that can be
pressed into service this summer if needed. The $220 million GOES-L
satellite had been delayed a year.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters rely on two Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites to monitor tropical storms and other
severe weather. The East Coast's GOES-8, however, is a year beyond
its design lifetime. Although still working, it could break down at
any moment. GOES-L is a crucial backup.
</P>
<P>
   While some climate experts have been blaming the increase in
tropical storms in recent years on global warming, Gray says the
trend is cyclical and not related to warming.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this Wednesday, Baker agreed. ''We don't see, at
this point, a link between global warming and tropical cyclone
activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical cyclones is another name for hurricanes, which are also
called typhoons in some parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three decades forecasters have gotten better at
predicting where the storms will go, researchers Colin McAdie and
Miles Lawrence report in the May issue of the Bulletin of the
American Meteorological Society.
</P>
<P>
   They found that from 1970 to 1998 track forecast errors
decreased by about 1 percent per year for the 24-hour forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a yearly basis, it's a small improvement, but one that
yields a cumulative benefit,'' said McAdie, a research
meteorologist at NOAA's Tropical Prediction Center in Miami. ''The
24 hour forecast error expected 30 years ago of about 140 miles has
been reduced to about 100 miles today.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Seek Injunction Vs. Goya Foods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The National Labor Relations Board filed for an
injunction Wednesday against Goya Foods, charging the company
unfairly limited labor organizing efforts at its Miami distribution
center.
</P>
<P>
   The request is an outgrowth of a separate NLRB complaint
awaiting trial next month which charges the nation's largest
Hispanic-owned food company with more than 40 unfair labor
practices.
</P>
<P>
   A call Wednesday to Goya's Miami office seeking comment was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency is seeking reinstatement of four workers
fired last summer over their reports of rat droppings in a Goya
warehouse and a rat's nest in a Goya carton at a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Russo, state director of the union Unite, called the
injunction request ''a scathing indictment of the outrageous
conduct that Goya Foods has attempted to deny and cover up.''
</P>
<P>
   The union won a representation election in 1998 -- but still has
no contract for warehouse workers, drivers and salesmen. As part of
its petition, the NLRB wants a federal judge to order Goya to
resume good-faith bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   The NLRB charged Goya has illegally barred employees from
wearing union paraphernalia at work and threatened them ''with
underemployment if they support the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and Miami-Dade County lawmakers also have called
for the reinstatement of the fired workers.
</P>
<P>
   After their complaints, Florida temporarily shut down Goya's
bean packaging operation because it found evidence of rodent
droppings and unsanitary equipment. The state gave the warehouse
its lowest overall rating of ''poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration issued a $14,000 penalty against Goya for eight
serious violations.
</P>
<P>
   The family owned company based in Secaucus, N.J., sells more
than 1,000 products under the Goya, Kirby, Nacelle and Diana
brands.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 7, Orioles 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Lance Painter, a reliever making his first start
of the season, allowed just two hits in five innings as the Toronto
Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles for the 13th straight time,
7-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays swept the three-game series and have won 14
straight games at home against the Orioles, who lost for the
seventh time in eight games overall.
</P>
<P>
   Painter (1-0) struck out a career-high eight and allowed just
one run. The left-hander replaced Roy Halladay, who is working out
his problems in the bullpen, in the Toronto rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista homered for the Blue Jays, who have 53 in 21 home
games.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore starter Scott Erickson, named one of People magazine's
''50 Most Beautiful People'' of the year in its May 8 issue,
pitched ugly against Toronto, allowing seven runs on 12 hits in 2
2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After Batista homered in the second inning, Toronto scored six
runs off Erickson (0-1) in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi, Carlos Delgado and Brad Fullmer hit consecutive
singles for one run. After Batista walked, Marty Cordova hit a
two-run single, and after Jose Cruz Jr. added an RBI single, Homer
Bush's two-run double made it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's double would have been a single, but second baseman
Delino DeShields failed to cover second base on the throw back into
the infield. Ryan Minor replaced DeShields as a pinch-hitter in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Quantrill pitched 3 2-3 innings for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson was making his second appearance since coming off the
disabled list, and he has allowed 12 runs and 20 hits in 8 2-3
innings. He had arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his
right elbow on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle homered in the second inning, his fourth of the
season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Painter made four starts for St. Louis last season. ... Cal
Ripken was a designated hitter for the second straight game. On
Tuesday, Ripken was a DH for the first time in his career. Manager
Mike Hargrove wants to keep Ripken off artificial turf. Ripken went
1-for-4. ... The Blue Jays are averaging more than seven runs a
game. ... Halladay is 2-4 with a 11.53 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Baby Hammocks Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Colorado company is recalling about 350 baby
hammocks because they can suddenly become twisted around childrens'
necks and strangle them.
</P>
<P>
   Hangouts of Boulder has received no reports of incidents or
injuries related to these hammocks, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Wednesday. But the commission said that between
1984 and 1995 they received reports of 12 deaths of children in
other mini-hammocks.
</P>
<P>
   The ''baby hammocks'' are 6-foot-long mini-hammocks woven from
thin cotton strings with nylon end strings in solid or
multi-striped colors. The label attached to the end loop reads,
''Hangouts(r) from Bellartson'' and ''Woven by Hand in MEXICO.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hangout store in Boulder and its catalogs sold these
hammocks as model number MY-BB-1110 from January 1990 through
September 1999 for about $20.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission advises consumers who bought one of the
hammocks to stop using it immediately, and return it to Hangouts
for a free, standard single hammock (model MY-SS-1130). For more
information, consumers can call Hangout at 1-800-205-4916.

<HEADLINE> Wooden Toys Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Georgia toy maker is recalling about 9,000
hand-painted, wooden stacking toys because a peg in the base can
come off, presenting a choking hazard to young children.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Rabbit Creations of Atlanta has received four reports of
the pegs coming loose from the base of their Stacking King toy, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday. No injuries have
been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The stacking toys have seven interlocking multicolored,
doughnut-shaped pieces mounted on pegs. The pieces are green with
blue dots, orange with yellow stripes, and purple with green
swirls. The bases of these toys have black and white checked
squares. The top of the toy has a round, hand-painted face with a
wooden yellow crown.
</P>
<P>
   A label on the toys packaging reads ''Stacking King,'' ''Jack
Rabbit Creations'' and ''Made in China.'' Specialty and gift shops
have sold the products from February 1999 through April 2000 for
about $25.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission advises consumers to take the toys away
from young children immediately and contact the company for a free
replacement base and a small toy. For more information, consumers
can call Jack Rabbit Creations toll free at 1-888-376-5225.

Squadron during World War II, died May 3. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   During the war he flew a P-40 War Hawk in 101 missions over
southern Europe with the squadron, one of the most decorated units
in U.S. military history.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tuskegee Airmen escort, not one American bomber was lost

combined 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, one Silver Star, one
Legion of Merit, eight Purple Hearts and three Presidential Unit
citations.
</P>
<P>
   The grandson of a slave, Wiley received a scholarship at the
University of Pittsburgh and earned a degree in physics, only to be
rejected by several companies. Working as a chauffeur, he heard of
a federal pilot training program.
</P>
<P>
   At the air base in Tuskegee, Ala., Wiley became one of the first

<P>
   Williams was appointed to the federal court in Los Angeles in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   He often handled about 4,000 criminal cases stemming from the
1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer in the 1940s, he joined a small group of black

defense arm of the NAACP, to fight the restrictive covenants that
barred minorities from living in many parts of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The covenants were declared unconstitutional in 1948, but racist
attitudes continued to deter blacks and other minorities from
buying homes in white neighborhoods.

Microsoft Moves Against Gov't Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Calling it an ''adventurous proposal,'' Microsoft today asked
a federal judge to scrap a government proposal to break up the software giant.
In its legal response to the government's proposed anti-trust remedy, Microsoft
said there was no basis for a breakup and that the issues involved do not
warrant such a step. Microsoft maintains that no company that attained its
monopoly power through growth -- rather than acquiring its rivals -- has ever

had hoped that some of those with the capacity would go to the assistance of
those who are in there doing the bidding of the Security Council and the U.N,''
Annan said. The more than 8,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone were deployed
to enforce last July's peace accord, which ended a brutal eight-year civil war
in the West African nation.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A lawyer who offered a painting on eBay that may or may
not be an original by the late Richard Diebenkorn was barred from the online
auction site today after eBay discovered that he had bid on the painting
himself. Kenneth Walton, 32, of Sacramento, told The Associated Press he was
only trying to make a few hundred dollars with the painting. His online
description made no mention of Diebenkorn, perhaps the most important abstract
impressionist who worked in California.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 5, Braves 3  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves twice loaded the bases with none
out and failed to score, and the Florida Marlins handed Tom Glavine
his first loss, 5-3 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (6-1) had won eight consecutive decisions dating to
Sept. 11, but he fell to 6-11 against Florida, the only team he has
a losing record against.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves loaded the bases with none out in the sixth, but
Andruw Jones' baserunning mistake turned a flyout into a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miceli loaded the bases with none out in the eighth, but
again the Braves failed to score. Armando Almanza retired Chipper
Jones on a flyout and Andres Galarraga on a strikeout, and Braden
Looper struck out Brian Jordan to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta left fielder Bobby Bonilla misplayed Cliff Floyd's line
drive into a two-run double in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lowell and Preston Wilson hit solo home runs off Glavine,
only the second and third the left-hander has allowed this season.
Jordan led off the seventh with his second homer for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine gave up nine hits and five runs in seven innings, hiking
his ERA from 1.73 to 2.29. Jesus Sanchez (4-1) allowed three runs
in seven innings and was helped by three double plays, including a
bizarre one in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-2, the first three Braves reached bases with the
heart of the order coming up. Chipper Jones flied out to right, and
Danny Bautista's throw home was too strong to score Glavine from
third.
</P>
<P>
   But Andruw Jones raced from first to second, thinking the
runners ahead of him would try to advance, and in the ensuing
rundown Glavine was tagged out at home for a double play. Galarraga
then hit an inning-ending groundout to end.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth for his 10th save, his first
since April 24. After Bonilla's one-out walk and Rafael Furcal's
infield hit, Alfonseca retired Keith Lockhart and Quilvio Veras on
grounders.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla led off the third with a triple and scored on Glavine's
single, but Bonilla gave the run back in the bottom of the inning.
Mike Redmond singled and Dave Berg doubled, and both scored when
Bonilla misjudged and failed to catch Floyd's liner, which glanced
off the left fielder's glove but was ruled a double.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell led off the fourth with his seventh homer, and Wilson hit
leadoff homer in the sixth, his fifth. Floyd's two-out RBI single
in the seventh put Florida ahead 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta scored in the fifth on doubles by Jordan and Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mike Redmond went 2-for-3 with two infield hits against
Glavine and is 11-for-15 against the left-hander. ... Galarraga and
Chipper Jones each went 0-for-3 against Sanchez. Galarraga is
1-for-11 lifetime against the left-hander, and Jones is 1-for-12.
... Sanchez is tied for the NL lead with three pickoffs. ...
Florida's Luis Castillo is 1-for-15 with runners in scoring
position.

<HEADLINE> Candleholders Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Florida company is recalling about 14,000
lighthouse-shaped candleholders because their tops can ignite,
posing fire and burn hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ATICO International USA of Fort Lauderdale has received three
reports of candleholders catching fire, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Wednesday. No injuries have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The candleholders are made of white painted or natural colored
wood with a glass and metal top. They are about 11 inches high and
5 inches wide. A tealight candle is placed in the top of the
lighthouse and can be seen burning through the glass windows. A
sticker on the bottom of the candleholder reads, ''Made in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid stores nationwide sold the candleholders from January
through March 2000 for about $10.
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission advises consumers to stop using the
candleholders immediately and return the product to the nearest
Rite Aid for a full refund. For additional information, consumers
should call ATICO International USA at 1-800-645-3867 between 8
a.m. and 5 p.m. EDT Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Death Penalty Sought in Rwanda Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Prosecutors said Wednesday they're seeking
the death penalty for a Roman Catholic bishop charged with genocide
in the 1994 slaughter that left at least half a million people dead
in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin Misago, 56, is the first senior church official to
stand trial on charges of genocide in connection with the 90-day
massacre that left more than 500,000 people dead, most of them
minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   He has pleaded innocent to eight charges of genocide, complicity
in genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Chief prosecutor Edward Kayihura delivered his closing arguments
Tuesday. The defense will follow suit Thursday, before the court
hands down a verdict, expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning of the prosecution's request, Pope John Paul II
sent a telegram of solidarity to Misago, the Vatican said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the face of the painful news that reaches me about your
jail detention that has gone on for 13 months already and even more
in the fact of the request for capital punishment for you, I feel
the duty to renew yet again toward you, beloved pastor of the dear
diocese of Gikongoro, all my nearness, as well as that of all the
church,'' the pope's message read.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly publicized trial that has strained Rwanda's
relations with the Vatican, Misago is accused of sending three
priests and more than 10 schoolchildren to their deaths by denying
them shelter in his parish.
</P>
<P>
   When the massacres began in April 1994, he was the top church
authority in the southern Gikongoro diocese where tens of thousands
died.
</P>
<P>
   Misago is the ranking Roman Catholic cleric among more than 20
nuns and priests accused of participating in the genocide. Two
priests have already been convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   The government believes the Catholic church was complicit, by
keeping silent, in the slaughter. Most of the victims were hacked
to death in Roman Catholic churches where they had sought refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The killings ended with a victory by the Tutsi-led rebels of the
Rwandan Patriotic Front who ousted the extremist Hutu government.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic church is the only major religious
institution that has not apologized for the genocide. The Vatican
says only individuals can be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   More than 125,000 genocide suspects are jailed in Rwanda. More
than 1,500 have been tried so far, and 300 have been sentenced to
death. The first 22 were publicly executed on April 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 62 percent of Rwanda's pre-genocide population
identified themselves as Roman Catholics.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 8, Expos 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Robert Person pitched a four-hitter for the
first complete game of his major league career, leading the
Philadelphia Phillies over the Montreal Expos 8-0 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Person (3-1) retired his first 11 batters before Rondell White's
two-out single to left in the fourth. Lee Stevens got a leadoff
single in the fifth, Lenny Webster hit a two-out double in the
eighth and Jose Vidro doubled leading off the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Making his 65th career start and 29th for the Phillies, Person
struck out five and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Jordan went 3-for-5 with three RBIs, including a two-run
single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville, Rico Brogna, Mike Lieberthal, Jordan and Desi
Relaford each had two hits. Brogna left after he was struck on the
left wrist by a Matt Blank pitch that loaded the bases in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Vazquez (3-1) gave up five runs -- four earned -- and 10
hits in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan hit a run-scoring single in the second, Vazquez threw a
run-scoring wild pitch and Glanville had an RBI double as
Philadelphia took a 3-0 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Person hit a sacrifice fly in the sixth, a ball that right
fielder Vladimir Guerrero dropped for his third error of the
season. Ron Gant added an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Lira relieved Vazquez in that inning and drew the
attention of Phillies manager Terry Francona after getting
Glanville to ground to third baseman Michael Barrett, who threw
home to retire Jordan for the first out.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire Ron Kulpa examined dirt stains on Lira's right
pants leg, conferred with crew chief Angel Hernandez, then
conferred with the rest of the crew before the game resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Johnson walked in a run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Person fell down while sacrificing Relaford to second in
the fourth and was thrown out at first by SS Orlando Cabrera when
his bunt rolled past 3B Michael Barrett. ... Phillies starters have
gone seven innings or more in nine of their last 10 games, and at
least six innings in each of those games. ... Person is 2-0 and
hasn't allowed a run in 18 innings in three appearances at Olympic
Stadium. ... Expos closer Ugueth Urbina felt pain in his right
elbow prior to the game and was not available to pitch. Urbina, who
led the NL with 41 saves last season, will have an MRI performed on
his elbow tomorrow. Urbina struck out the side to record his eighth
save in his last outing, on Sunday in Milwaukee. ... INF Andy Tracy
was recalled from Triple-A Ottawa. Tracy went 11-for-31 (.355) with
two RBIs in eight games for the Lynx after he was optioned to
Ottawa on May 1.

<HEADLINE> Reds 5, Padres 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Dante Bichette hit into another double play
Wednesday night before his three-run homer off Trevor Hoffman
lifted the Cincinnati Reds to a 5-1 victory over the San Diego
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette grounded into a double play in the first inning, his
fourth in two games -- one shy of the major league record. He came
up with two runners on base and no outs in the eighth, but this
time he homered off Hoffman, pitching for the first time in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette is 7-for-18 for his career off the Padres closer, with
four homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds (17-15) moved two games over .500 for the first time
this season by winning for the fourth time in five games. It was
roughly the same time last season that the Reds pulled out of an
early slump and went on to win 96 games.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Padres lost their fifth in a row, their worst
slump since last August. They've dropped 11 of 14 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Sterling Hitchcock (0-5) remained in an even deeper
slump, staying winless since last Aug. 18. He gave up two runs on
six hits in six innings, including Alex Ochoa's run-scoring single
in the first and Ron Villone's double, his second career RBI, in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock has only one win in his last 17 starts and seems to
bring out the worst in the Padres. San Diego has lost all of his
eight starts this season and is 1-17 in his last 18 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres got on the scoreboard for the only time so far in the
two-game series when Eric Owens homered in the sixth inning off
Villone (4-1). The left-hander gave up five hits and two walks in 6
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williamson pitched the last two innings for his fourth
save in five chances.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Padres got hurt because they couldn't get the
opposing pitcher out in a clutch situation. Benito Santiago doubled
in the second and Villone doubled -- the first extra-base hit of his
career -- for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight games, opposing pitchers are 7-for-16 with two
doubles, a homer and six RBIs against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock had trouble getting his pitches to the plate. At least
five bounced in front of it, and one pitch to Pokey Reese slipped
out of his hand and nearly made it to the backstop on the fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Padres are 2-8 against left-handed starters, losing
seven in a row. ... Owens hit leadoff for the first time this
season and went 2-for-4, raising his average to .362. ... With the
Padres in a skid, Hoffman has been used only three times in the
last 13 games. ... Zeke Bonura of the New York Giants grounded into
five double plays in consecutive games in 1939, setting the NL and
major league record. The AL record is four by numerous players. ...
Bichette has hit into seven double plays this season, most on the
team.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Reached on Hanford Cleanup  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A federal judge may oversee the cleanup of
some of the Hanford nuclear reservation's most dangerous nuclear
wastes under an agreement reached Wednesday by Gov. Gary Locke and
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   They will seek a consent decree in federal court to govern the
cleanup of 177 underground nuclear waste storage tanks. The Energy
Department, citing cost overruns, this week fired the company that
was to design and build a plant to treat the wastes.
</P>
<P>
   The tanks, one-third of which are leaking, contain wastes left
over from the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons. They are
considered one of the nation's most pressing environmental
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Locke and Richardson also agreed that nuclear wastes containing
low levels of radiation will not be shipped to the Hanford
reservation until the Department of Energy selects a new company to
build the plant to treat the tank wastes. That selection will
likely occur in January.
</P>
<P>
   A private contractor called BNFL, Inc. was supposed to design
and build the so-called vitrification plant. But Richardson fired
the company this week after cost estimates for the work rose from
$6.9 billion to $15.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The 560-square-mile reservation contains the nation's largest
volume of radioactive waste from nuclear weapons. Hanford is 120
miles southwest of Spokane.

<HEADLINE> Wreck Kills Four Wis. Teen-Agers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAUKAUNA, Wis. (AP) -- A car carrying five teen-agers apparently
ran a stop sign on a rural road in southeastern Wisconsin and was
broadsided by a pickup truck, killing four of the teens,
authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup driver and a girl in the car were injured in the
Tuesday afternoon wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup driver told authorities he didn't see anything until
the teens' car was right in front of him, said Calumet County
Deputy Lt. John Byrnes. A marijuana pipe was found in the car and
drug tests were being conducted on the victims. None was wearing a
seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy J. Johnson and Philip J. Lauer, both 17, and Jennifer
Marie Laux, 16, were pronounced dead shortly after the wreck.
Charles E. Tinkham, 17, died Wednesday morning in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger, April M. Schmidt, 15, was in fair condition
Wednesday. The truck's driver, Michael A. Schultz, 34, was treated
and released.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis team has been working at Kaukauna High School since
Tuesday night, District Superintendent Tim Hansen said. All of the
students attended the 1,200-student school.
</P>

   ''From what I know of them they're nice kids. They have lots of
friends in the schools. They're well-known throughout the
schools,'' Hansen said.

<HEADLINE> Hearst To Review Editorial Policies  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT ANDREWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Hearst Corp. appointed a former federal
judge Wednesday to review the editorial policies of its flagship
newspaper, and reassured staffers of the rival San Francisco
Chronicle that its ethical standards will be ''inviolable'' if it
takes over their paper.
</P>
<P>
   The review was motivated by the testimony of Examiner editor and
publisher Timothy White, who said in court last week that he had
offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorial treatment in
exchange for the mayor's support of Hearst's purchase of the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Charles B. Renfrew of San Francisco, who specializes in internal
corporate investigations, will lead ''an internal review of
editorial policies at the San Francisco Examiner,'' Hearst said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst executives said it will be up to Renfrew, who also once
served as a deputy U.S. attorney general, to decide how far to go
with the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be unlimited access to any and all employees and
any and all documents,'' said James Asher, Hearst chief legal
officer for development.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Hearst had said it would limit its probe to the
question of whether White alone violated journalistic ethics.
</P>
<P>
   White testified that he offered the mayor favorable editorial
treatment on Aug. 30. White later disavowed the testimony in a
statement Hearst sent to the media. Examiner Executive Editor Phil
Bronstein, who said he was at the meeting between White and Brown,
said White made no such offer, and denied that the newspaper's
opinion pages were improperly slanted in Brown's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst suspended White after his testimony, and appointed George
Irish, president of Hearst newspapers, as acting publisher of the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   White's testimony came during a trial in federal court to decide
whether Hearst can buy the Chronicle for $660 million and pay a
local publisher to take the Examiner off its hands. Former mayoral
candidate Clint Reilly is trying to persuade a judge to block the
Chronicle purchase as a violation of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   In cross examination late Wednesday, Reilly attorney Joseph
Alioto elicited testimony about what he called ''unethical''
communication between Chronicle Publishing and Hearst that may have
hastened Hearst's offer and kept other bidders out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Falk, CEO of the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which
runs most business operations for the two papers, testified that
Alan H. Nichols Jr., former chief financial officer for Chronicle
Publishing, told him of the board's confidential discussion over
the sale of its newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conveyance was, generally speaking, (Chronicle director
Richard) Rosenberg and others on the board are hoping that there is
a substantial offer ... I think he said quickly, as opposed to a
lowball offer and dragging the process out,'' said Falk.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Irish responded Tuesday to a petition signed by
Examiner employees and more than 80 Chronicle staffers expressing
ethical concerns over White's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adherence to ethical standards by all employees, and by the
newspaper itself, is a policy we promise will be inviolable if the
San Francisco Chronicle becomes a Hearst-owned newspaper,'' Irish
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust law comes into play because the morning Chronicle and
afternoon Examiner have been joined at the hip for 35 years by an
antitrust exemption that lets them combine nearly all business
operations while keeping the reporters and editors in stiff
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst contends that the Examiner in its present form is a
financial failure.

had hoped that some of those with the capacity would go to the assistance of
those who are in there doing the bidding of the Security Council and the U.N,''
Annan said. The more than 8,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone were deployed
to enforce last July's peace accord, which ended a brutal eight-year civil war
in the West African nation.

Rough Hurricane Season Predicted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal storm specialists predicted an above-average
hurricane season today, calling for stronger, longer-lasting storms this year,
and more of them. Hurricane season officially begins June 1, and the outlook is
for 11 tropical storms, seven of which will be hurricanes, three of them major.
''This puts coastal areas and the Caribbean islands at a much higher risk of
experiencing a tropical storm or hurricane,'' said D. James Baker, head of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

nearly $2.6 million of the money they got from businessmen applying for
riverboat casino licenses. Edwards was convicted yesterday with his son, Stephen
Edwards, and the three others of racketeering and fraud for schemes that took
place during and after the elder Edwards left office in 1996. Two other

<HEADLINE> Canada Deports Chinese Immigrants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER (AP) -- Under armed guard, 90 Chinese immigrants who
came to Canada on ships last summer were flown back to their
homeland Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest deportation so far of the almost 600 Chinese
who arrived, many on leaking filthy vessels, on Canada's West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants deported Wednesday included 75 men, 11 women and
four children, immigration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the immigrants would try to escape if they knew they
were being sent home, Canadian officials gave them little notice
and had armed guards accompany them to the airplane transporting
them, said Murray Wilkinson, acting manager of the immigration
department's Vancouver enforcement office.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Wong of the Vancouver Association of Chinese Canadians
called the deportation excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we had some other options for them,'' Wong said.
''Unfortunately, the Canadian government had chosen to forcibly
repatriate. It's purely a political decision.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Courts Military Veterans  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore courted veterans
Wednesday with $1.2 billion in new education money for them, their
families and their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who fight for our security should never have to fight
for the education they need to succeed,'' the presidential
candidate told about 150 veterans gathered at VFW Post 4548.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress agrees, monthly federal payments to veterans and
their families would increased by 25 percent, from $536 to $670
next year. Gore said that would be the largest increase in their
education funding since the program began 16 years ago as part of
the Montgomery GI Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits also would be indexed to inflation and veterans could
use the money for other types of learning, such as high-tech
training, during school breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said no new money would be needed to pay for the increased
benefits since they will be covered by money available from the
veterans administration.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Republican George W. Bush, Gore's presidential
rival, criticized the proposal as ''a day late'' and ''millions of
dollars short'' and noted that a former Clinton-Gore veterans'
affairs secretary had criticized the administration's budget cuts
for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''America's veterans will clearly see through Al Gore's
election-year conversion as an advocate for veterans when they
examine budget cuts in veterans' benefits over the last eight
years,'' Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Al Gore's own Secretary of Veterans' Affairs criticized
Clinton-Gore for proposing massive cuts in veterans benefits, how
can veterans trust him on veterans' issues?''
</P>
<P>
   Military service is often a sensitive issue in presidential
races. President Clinton's lack of military service nearly damaged
his bid for the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans issues got a higher profile earlier this year during
the insurgent bid of GOP Sen. John McCain, a Navy pilot imprisoned
for more than five years by the Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the son of a senator, served in Vietnam as an Army
journalist and likes to say he carried ''an M-16 and a pencil.''
Presumptive GOP nominee Bush, whose father was a member of Congress
and later was elected president, served in the Texas Air National
Guard during Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also touted administration efforts to improve health care
and military recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't give our veterans anything. You have earned what you
get with blood, sweat and tears,'' Gore said to his heartiest
applause of the event at the hall, which reeked of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's stop here in Clinton's home state is part of a
four-state, three-day swing through Arkansas, Texas, California and
Oregon before he returns home to Washington late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore helped raise $650,000 for the Democratic National
Committee at a reception and a dinner in Dallas. At the reception
at the mansion of lawyer Trevor Pearlman, Gore shook hands and
entered names of guests into his ever-present Palm Pilot. The
dinner, which brought in half a million dollars, was held in the
wealthy Dallas enclave of University Park at the home of Debbie
Branson, president of the Texas Trial Lawyers' Association, said
campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used the VFW appearance to repeat his criticisms of
Bush's proposal to shore up Social Security by allowing Americans
to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am against raising the retirement age and I am against
privatizing Social Security and turning it into a game of stock
market roulette with winners and losers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore favors using interest savings from paying down the debt to
boost the retirement system.

<HEADLINE> Malcolm X's oldest daughter confronts Farrakhan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan said he
regrets his writings may have led others to murder Malcolm X in a
''60 Minutes'' interview to be broadcast Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke while seated across the table from the civil rights
leader's oldest daughter, Attallah Shabazz. She later issued a
statement thanking Farrakhan for acknowledging his role and said:
''I wish him peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz, then 6, saw her father gunned down in the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem on Feb. 21, 1965. Three men with ties to the
Nation of Islam were convicted in the slaying and served prison
terms.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Malcolm X's criticism of Nation of Islam
spiritual leader Elijah Muhammad had caused a bitter split with
church leaders, including Farrakhan. Farrakhan called Malcolm X a
traitor and wrote, two months before the killing, that ''such a man
is worthy of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan has denied ordering the assassination but in 1994
admitted to having ''helped create the atmosphere'' that led to it.
</P>
<P>
   His four-hour meeting with Shabazz and ''60 Minutes''
correspondent Mike Wallace, organized at her request, took place at
Farrakhan's home in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan told them that he ''truly loved'' Malcolm X and
carried his picture after his death. Shabazz's body visibly
stiffened, arms crossed over her chest, when Wallace quoted from
Farrakhan's writings about Malcolm X before he died.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Farrakhan said that the U.S. government
spied on black leaders and were concerned about a ''black messiah''
who could unite the community. ''This is bigger than the Nation of
Islam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz, struggling to keep control of her emotions, said that
while she believed the FBI had something to do with her father's
death, it was young black men who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't keep pointing fingers,'' she said. ''My father was
not killed from a grassy knoll.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan said: ''Yes, it is true that black men pulled the
trigger. We cannot deny any responsibility in this. Where we are
responsible, where our hands are a part of this, we beg God's mercy
and forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I genuinely hope that perhaps a healing can come to Miss
Shabazz and her family,'' he continued. ''As I may have been
complicit in words that I spoke leading up to February 21st, I
acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused
the loss of life of a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz's reaction to these words aren't shown. Wallace said she
needed time to absorb them. She issued a statement this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's never admitted this before publicly,'' she said. ''Until
now, he's never caressed my father's children. I thank him for
acknowledging his culpability and I wish him peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz's mother, Betty Shabazz, who died in 1997, had publicly
accused Farrakhan of a role in the murder. She reconciled with him
after her daughter Qubilah was charged in 1994 with plotting to
hire a hitman to kill him. The charges were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he believed that Farrakhan, who has battled
prostate cancer and other health problems, is making amends partly
because he has faced his own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Farrakhan publicly embraced W. Deen Mohammed,
son of Elijah Muhammad, in an attempt to heal wounds that have
split U.S. Muslims into factions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that he has thought seriously about the people he has
disaffected,'' Wallace said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz said it was still difficult for her to meet with
Farrakhan on camera. ''I did not know if I wanted to sit across
from him,'' she said. ''I did not know if my heart could handle
it.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates 13, Mets 9  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Wil Cordero went 5-for-5 with four RBIs, and
the Pittsburgh Pirates had 20 hits in a 13-9 victory over the New
York Mets on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter John Vander Wal's two-run double highlighted a
five-run seventh inning that carried the Pirates to their sixth win
in eight games. Cordero added a two-run double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, losers of seven of nine, went ahead 7-6 in the top of
the seventh against Jose Silva (3-1) when Mike Piazza and Robin
Ventura singled and Todd Zeile doubled.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, the first seven batters reached
base for the Pirates. Jason Kendall singled off Dennis Cook (3-1),
and Brian Giles was hit by a pitch. Kevin Young's single off Pat
Mahomes tied the game, and Cordero singled to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Meares' single broke the tie, and Vander Wal blooped a
double to short left field. Rickey Henderson pulled up a stride
short on the ball, which bounced over his head and into the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Sojo followed with an RBI single as Mahomes faced five
batters and gave up hits to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Wal is 5-for-11 as a pinch hitter with nine RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 hits were the most the Mets allowed since giving up 20 to
the Pirates on Sept. 26, 1992. The last time the Pirates had 20 or
more hits was Aug. 4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates went into the sixth trailing 6-3 against Rick Reed.
Young opened the inning with a single, and Cordero homered to the
fourth level at Three Rivers Stadium, an estimated 434 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Meares singled, moved up on reliever Turk Wendell's balk and
scored the tying run when center fielder Melvin Mora misplayed
Adrian Brown's fly ball into a double.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a 6-1 lead with five runs in the third against
starter Todd Ritchie. Edgardo Alfonzo doubled in two runs, Piazza
hit a two-run homer and Ventura followed with his seventh homer.
</P>
<P>
   Young led off the Pirates' second with his fifth homer, tying
the score 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Meares tripled in a run, and Brown tripled and
scored when Warren Morris grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   In his first four starts this year, Reed allowed four earned
runs in 29 2-3 innings. In his last three, he's given up 15 earned
runs in 21 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero matched his career high for hits, as did Young, who had
four.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Henderson's sixth-inning at-bat was the 10,000th of his
career. He is the 21st player in major league history to reach that
level. Next on the list is Frank Robinson with 10,006. ... Reed
pitched five innings, his shortest outing of the season. He pitched
at least seven innings in all his other starts. ... The Mets have
back-to-back homers four times this season, three times in Three
Rivers Stadium. ... Pirates manager Gene Lamont was ejected by
plate umpire Bruce Froemming in the third inning for arguing about
pitches from the bench.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Residents Flee  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Fires have forced Jaret McDonald to
evacuate his home three times before. But this time it was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time I felt fear,'' the 28-year-old lifelong
resident of Los Alamos said. ''When you're against Mother Nature,
you can't contain it. You'll lose every time.''
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the 11,000 residents who had to pack and up and
flee Wednesday as a fire raged out of control toward Los Alamos. A
thick shroud of smoke swept over the city while law enforcement
officials went door to door telling people they had to get out as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's black and white and brown and it's all trailing toward
the town site,'' said Anna Casperson, owner of the Castillo del
Alba bed and breakfast in nearby White Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Casperson said she was opening up her bed and breakfast free of
charge to anyone who was displaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the least we could do,'' she said. ''I have all this
food left over from Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cities of Gold Casino in nearby Pojoaque Pueblo was opened
to accept evacuees. The hotel was full Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got two labs and two hamsters and two kids and two of
us. ... The fish are at home,'' said Renee Randolph, who was
standing near her blue-and-white pickup giving water to her two
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had the truck all loaded, waiting for this to happen,''
said her husband, Blaine Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey and Nan Sauer were taking the two black labs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting things together that we want to take. Tax
records and pictures -- things that we can't replace,'' Sauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire went out of control after the National Park Service set
it last week to clear brush at the nearby Bandelier National
Monument. The Los Alamos nuclear laboratory, Los Alamos schools and
county offices have been closed for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Two neighbors stood in the front yards of their bungalow homes
commiserating, angry that it all started with a controlled burn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it stinks,'' said Jim Keane, 33.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe in controlled burns,'' added neighbor Nancy
Welborne, who has lived in Los Alamos for 10 years. ''This really
makes me mad. I've got four dogs and I've got to go down to my
daughter's in Albuquerque.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the mass evacuation, people were leaving in an
orderly fashion and there were no traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are down to our last 20 rooms,'' said Janine Shelton,
general manager of the Hotel Loretto in Santa Fe, 20 miles
southeast of Los Alamos. ''We're prepared to do whatever we have to
do. We want to be good neighbors.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO nations approved Croatia's bid to
join the Partnership for Peace program Wednesday after praising
reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The formal invitation to Croatia was extended after both NATO's
council of 19 ambassadors and the other nations of the Partnership
for Peace program gave their go ahead for Croatia's inclusion into
the 25-member program, which includes non-NATO members Albania,
Russia, Bulgaria and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Croatia has demonstrated that the future of the region can be
bright,'' NATO Secretary-general Lord Robertson said. ''By sharing
our values, Croatia has won its place in the Euro-Atlantic
family.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's council of ambassadors met with Croatian Prime Minister
Ivica Racan on Tuesday, where they discussed progress made by the
new government in Zagreb in adopting democratic reforms including
new human rights legislation and minority protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said that the 19-nation alliance wanted to
''acknowledge these changes,'' signaling that Croatia should be
seen as an example to the rest of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Partnership for Peace program was created in 1994 to
establish cooperation with neutral and former East bloc countries.
Many former Warsaw Pact nations see the program as a step toward
eventual NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
   The program arranges for joint exercises and prepares
peacekeeping missions with NATO members. There are also regular
political meetings with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Croat political leaders see membership as boosting its chances
of joining the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani, Wife Discuss Separation  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A downcast Mayor Rudolph Giuliani disclosed
Wednesday that he and wife Donna Hanover are moving toward legal
separation -- his first acknowledgment of trouble in his marriage
after years of rumors and recent tabloid photos of his ''mystery
brunch pal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second personal announcement in the last two weeks
for the often stern Republican Senate candidate who guards his
privacy zealously. Giuliani announced on April 27 that he is
fighting prostate cancer and said he may rethink his Senate
candidacy, depending on his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''For quite some time, it's probably been apparent that Donna
and I lead in most ways independent and separate lives,'' Giuliani
said at a news conference. ''It's been a very painful road and I
hope we'll be able to formalize that in an agreement that protects
our children, that gives them all the security and protection that
they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Giuliani attended a fund-raiser Wednesday night in
suburban Westchester County, a key area in the Senate battle
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, and said he had not yet made a
decision on whether to continue as a candidate in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, 55, and Hanover, 50, a TV personality who has also
appeared in movies and soap operas, have been married for 16 years
and have two children. This is the second marriage for both. They
have not appeared in public together in years, although she made
the point of issuing a statement of support after Giuliani's cancer
diagnosis last month.
</P>
<P>
   After Giuliani's comments Wednesday, Hanover summoned reporters
to Gracie Mansion, the mayoral residence, and said the marriage had
been strained for years. She referred to a relationship the mayor
had with a staff member whom she did not name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's turn of events brings me great sadness,'' she said,
her eyes welling with tears. ''I had hoped that we could keep this
marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to
participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with
one staff member.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Vanity Fair magazine reported there was a romantic link
between the mayor and his communications director, Cristyne
Lategano. Giuliani and Lategano denied the report, and it was never
confirmed. Lategano has since left City Hall and gotten married.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a reporter asked Giuliani why he had stopped
wearing his wedding ring. He responded, ''I respectfully suggest
that that's none of your business,'' emphasizing the last four
words.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, newspaper photographs have shown Giuliani about town
with a 45-year-old divorced woman, Judith Nathan. The New York Post
called her the mayor's ''mystery brunch pal.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Wednesday he had ''tremendous respect'' for
Hanover, whom he called ''a wonderful woman (and) wonderful
mother.'' He went on to describe Nathan as ''a very, very kind
person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She's been a very good friend to me,'' Giuliani said. ''I rely
on her and she's helped me a great deal. And I'm going to need her
more now than maybe I did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said his disclosure of the separation has nothing to do
with politics and he does not expect his announcement to harm him
in his Senate race against Clinton. When asked her reaction to the
mayor's announcement, Clinton replied, ''I don't have anything to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really care about politics right now,'' Giuliani said.
''I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love and what can
be done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''It will all work itself out some way politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani revealed a side that he has never shown before publicly
-- and that contrasted sharply to the upbeat manner in which he
announced that he had cancer. Looking wan and weighing each word
with caution, Giuliani spoke of the pain his troubled marriage has
created and in part, blamed the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm motivated by all the tremendous invasion of privacy that's
taken place,'' he said. ''My family's, Judith Nathan's family. This
is something that had developed over some period of time and it is
something between Donna and me, not anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican political consultant Jay Severin said the mayor's
announcement doesn't automatically translate into a political loss,
but it can only help Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, we have a president serving out his second term who
was literally caught with his pants down in the Oval Office, so the
mayor's announcement needn't be a disqualifying event,'' Severin
said. ''But politics is a zero-sum game. Nothing bad happens to one

<HEADLINE> Pacers 97, 76ers 89  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Reggie Miller was too much for the taunters,
Travis Best was too quick for Allen Iverson and Sam Perkins was too
cool in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers moved within one victory of sweeping the
Philadelphia 76ers out of the playoffs for the second straight
season, controlling the game down the stretch Wednesday night for a
97-89 victory and a 3-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored 29 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter, to
silence a sellout crowd that taunted him with derisive chants -- and
worse -- all night. After Miller iced the victory on a breakaway
dunk with 22 seconds left, fans tossed debris on the court,
including a full can of beer that missed Sixers forward George
Lynch by inches.
</P>
<P>
   Miller closed the game by dribbling out the final seconds,
bouncing the ball between his legs while staring down a group of
fans sitting across from the Philadelphia bench who had been
yapping at him all night.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he and the Pacers had shut up everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana scored 32 of the game's final 48 points, with Best and
Perkins contributing several key shots. Best repeatedly used his
speed to get to the basket and score while guarded by Iverson, and
Perkins hit a running hook shot and two 3-pointers in the final 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Put together, it allowed the Pacers to overcome a sub-par effort
from Jalen Rose, who finished with 12 points after scoring 40 and
30 in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Best had 19 points, while Perkins and Dale Davis added 10
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson had 29 points to lead the 76ers, who will try to avoid
the sweep Saturday in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Miller gave Indiana the lead for good on a 3-pointer with 8:59
left, although the 76ers stayed within reach until the final
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Two foul shots by Iverson with 3:20 left made it 87-85 before
Perkins hit his running hook shot with 2:46 left. A 24-second
violation on the Sixers was followed by a foul shot by Best, and a
driving layup by Iverson made it 90-87 with 1:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins got the lead back to six by answering with a 3-pointer,
and Best gave Indiana another six-point lead on a driving layup
past Iverson with 1:11 left.
</P>
<P>
   A turnover by Iverson on Philadelphia's next possession ended
the Sixers' chances. Beer cups -- and that one full can -- began
flying out of the stands shortly thereafter. Philadelphia coach
Larry Brown admonished the crowd over the public address system and
play was delayed as ball boys cleaned the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers took their first lead of the entire series 2{ minutes
into the first quarter as Iverson scored on a driving layup to make
it 6-5. With Aaron McKie hitting four of five shots and Tyrone Hill
grabbing seven rebounds, Philadelphia led for most of the quarter
and was up 23-22 heading into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown unveiled a slight change as Toni Kukoc and Lynch were on
the floor together early in the second quarter, but it didn't do
much to increase Kukoc's production as he managed only four
first-half points in 15 minutes. He did not score in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson had 19 points and McKie had 13 at the half, while Best
scored 10 points in the second quarter to keep things close as the
Pacers trailed only 47-46 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers center Rik Smits went to the bench with his fifth foul
midway through the third, and the 76ers' big men then started to
score down low. Hill, Theo Ratliff and Matt Geiger combined for 18
points in the quarter as Philadelphia extended its lead to 70-65
entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ollie, subbing for McKie, scored the first basket of the
final quarter to give Philadelphia its largest lead of the night,
73-65, but the Pacers scored the next 11 points -- six on 3-pointers
by Miller -- to go ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Starting in place of Eric Snow, who is out for the series
with a chip fracture in his ankle, McKie had 20 points and three
assists. ... Pacers forward Austin Croshere tested his sore right
foot and lasted less than two minutes, allowing Chris Mullin to get
his first playing time of the series. Mullin scored on an
uncontested layup 10 seconds after checking in.

<HEADLINE> Johnston Says He Plans on Retiring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston said
in a television interview Wednesday that he expects to retire this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, who was playing in the Byron Nelson Pro-Am golf
tournament in Irving, told KETK in Tyler he will likely retire
because of a neck injury that has plagued him for the last three
years. Johnston had surgery for a bulging disc in 1997. He played
one game in 1999 before reinjuring his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had an agreement with my doctor when we had the surgery done
in 1997, and because of the injury last year, it looks like I'm
going to be forced to retire,'' Johnston told the station. ''I'm
just trying to figure out what path to go through with the rest of
my life and what career opportunities there are.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, a favorite of the fans who screamed his nickname
''Moose'' whenever he made a play, had never missed a game, playing
in 149 straight for the Cowboys until the neck injury in 1997. He
had 753 yards rushing and 2,227 yards receiving in 11 seasons with
Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 5, White Sox 3, 6 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Brian Daubach doubled to score Boston's first run
and added a two-run homer Wednesday night to lead the Red Sox to a
5-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox, a game called after six
innings because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez (3-2) pitched five scoreless innings, allowing
three hits and two walks while striking out four in a steady rain
that grew heavier around the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Eldred (2-2) gave up five runs, four earned, on six hits and
a walk, striking out three in 4 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garces got the final out in the sixth and earned his first
save when the game was called after a 1 hour, 48-minute rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach doubled with two outs in the first inning, then scored
on Nomar Garciaparra's double. In the third, Trot Nixon hit a
two-out double and Daubach followed with his sixth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek doubled to lead off the fifth, took third on
Wilton Veras' single and scored when first baseman Paul Konerko
waved at a grounder for an error. Veras scored on Nixon's sacrifice
fly to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martinez was pitching well, lowering his ERA from 6.49
to 5.45, Tim Wakefield came out to start the sixth and immediately
got into trouble. Jose Valentin singled and, after Frank Thomas hit
into a fielder's choice, Magglio Ordonez hit his sixth homer to
make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko singled and was erased on Chris Singleton's fielder's
choice. Singleton stole second without drawing a throw, then scored
on Carlos Lee's single to make it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Boston threatened in the sixth when Carl Everett walked and
stole second base. After Mike Stanley walked, catcher Josh Paul
tried to pick Everett off the bag and threw the ball into center
field for an error, allowing the runners to move up.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Wilton Veras hit a bouncer down the third-base
line that hit Everett for an out. Boston manager Jimy Williams came
out to argue Everett was in foul territory, and thus safe, but the
umpires were unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman walked, but pinch-hitter Jeff Frye hit an
inning-ending groundout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game started after a 14-minute rain delay. ... Thomas'
fourth-inning single moved him into a tie with Ozzie Guillen for
fifth place on the White Sox' career list at 1,608. ... Martinez
had never before faced the White Sox. ... The White Sox were at
full strength for the first time since seven were suspended for a
total of 28 games for an April 22 brawl against the Detroit Tigers.
They were 4-7 during the span. ... The Red Sox had six errors in
their previous three games after only 14 in their first 26 games.
... Nixon nailed Paul at the plate after he tagged from third on
Jose Valentin's fly out. ... Garciaparra went hitless in
consecutive games Monday and Tuesday for only the third time in his
career.

<HEADLINE> Peru Limits Hikers on Inca Trail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru announced plans Wednesday to limit the
growing number of hikers on the famed Inca Trail to the Machu
Picchu ruins to 500 a day in an effort to preserve the route.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-mile-long path is dotted with the remnants of Inca
culture as it winds through the jungle-cloaked Andes to Machu
Picchu, situated atop a craggy peak about 310 miles southeast of
the capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Trains and buses have long carried tourists to the site, but the
Inca Trail has becoming increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
   A recent U.N. report urged Peru to stem hiker traffic as the
number of trekkers ballooned 11-fold, from 6,000 in 1984 to 66,000
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 500-person limit has not been broken. The highest
number of travelers on the trail in one day came last year when 494
made the trek, according to Miguel Castaneda, the National Cultural
Institute's director of maintenance and preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan drew criticism from Timothy Currie, manager of Lima's
South America Explorers, a nonprofit foundation that promotes
conservation on the trail. He called the plan a ''token gesture''
that didn't go far enough in protecting Peru's cultural wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The decree, published Tuesday in the government gazette, is
scheduled to go into effect within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Government-endorsed plans to develop the ruins and build a cable
car to the site have faced stiff international opposition from
scientists and conservationists who say overdevelopment of the 15th
Century ruins could destroy its serene, isolated quality.

<HEADLINE> Kukoc No Factor for 76ers  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers couldn't beat Indiana
without Toni Kukoc. They can't beat the Pacers with him either.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc, acquired from the Chicago Bulls in a three-way deal in
February, was thought to be the missing ingredient in the Sixers'
offense. Philadelphia, desperately seeking another scorer to
complement Allen Iverson, dealt the promising Larry Hughes to get
Kukoc.
</P>
<P>
   In three games against Indiana, Kukoc has 20 points as the
Pacers have taken a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern
Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 swingman scored four points in Game 3 Wednesday
night as the Pacers beat Philadelphia 97-89. He took just six shots
in 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not working right know and I don't know what the reason
is,'' Kukoc said.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana swept the Sixers in the conference semifinals last
season, but Kukoc's acquisition had many believing Philadelphia
would at least challenge the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kukoc has failed to establish himself offensively in the
series and has been a liability on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc scored both his baskets in the first half Wednesday night.
He played 11 minutes in the second half, but was not on the floor
for the final six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I keep telling him just make the plays, just play
basketball,'' Sixers coach Larry Brown said. ''I really don't know
what the problem is. I don't feel he is out there trying to do
things he's capable of doing. He's standing out by the 3-point line
too much. I don't know what to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Kukoc couldn't even get his teammates to pass him the
ball. On three occasions, a wide open Kukoc stood near the wing,
waving frantically -- and hopelessly -- for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way we're playing right now,'' said Kukoc, who
admitted he was disappointed he didn't get the ball. ''Maybe if I
was here a whole season, we'd be used to each other more and they'd
look to me more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc, who averaged 14 points with the Sixers in two games
against Indiana in the regular season, scored eight points in each
of the first two games, most of which came after the outcome had
been decided.
</P>
<P>
   He said Indiana's defense hasn't factored in his struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say they are playing unbelievable defense that I can't
do stuff,'' he said. ''Things just aren't going my way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers are 24-14 since Kukoc arrived but he has started only
eight games behind George Lynch, a stronger defensive presence.

<HEADLINE> Twins 10, Indians 9  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Midre Cummings' two-out, two-run homer in the
ninth inning capped the biggest comeback in Minnesota's 40-year
history, giving the Twins a 10-9 victory over the Cleveland Indians
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota trailed 8-1 in the seventh inning and 9-7 in the
ninth. On Tuesday night, the Twins rallied from a five-run deficit
to beat Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings' homer off Steve Karsay (0-2) capped a three-run
ninth-inning rally and made a winner of Eddie Guardado (3-1), who
gave up David Justice's solo homer in the top of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lawton hit a one-out double in the bottom half and scored
on Ron Coomer's single. After Butch Huskey flied out to right for
the second out, Cummings sent a 2-0 pitch the opposite way, 361
feet over the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings' first homer of the season also denied Charles Nagy of
his first victory since April 11. Nagy gave up five runs and seven
hits in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota pulled to 8-7 and had the tying run in scoring
position in the eighth when Cristian Guzman stole second and took
third as Sandy Alomar's throw bounced into center as for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman stopped at third, but tried to score when center fielder
Jolbert Cabrera held onto the ball in shallow center. Cabrera
nailed Guzman at the plate for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   The teams both batted around in a wild seventh inning that
featured 10 runs, 12 hits and eight pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome's ninth homer gave the Indians a 1-0 lead in the
second, and he added a double in a three-run fifth. His homer was
the Indians' only hit off Sean Bergman until the fifth, when they
got five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Thome and Richie Sexson hit back-to-back doubles to start the
inning. Sexson advanced to third on a passed ball by Marcus Jensen
and scored on Travis Fryman's groundout for a 3-1 lead, and Enrique
Wilson added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman led off the seventh with his fifth homer for a 5-1 lead
and Bergman surrendered infield hits to Cabrera, Roberto Alomar and
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera scored on Wilson's hopper that first baseman Coomer
fielded cleanly but inexplicably held onto as he faked a throw
home. Coomer double-pumped to first as Wilson raced past the bag.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Bergman, who gave up eight runs and 10 hits in 6
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez capped the four-run inning with a two-run single
off Hector Carrasco for a seemingly safe 8-1 lead over the Twins,
who overcame a 5-0 deficit for a 6-5 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy wasn't the same after the long rest and surrendered four
straight hits, ending his outing. Jensen's two-run homer made it
8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's groundout off Tom Martin scored another run, and Lawton
added an RBI single, making it 8-5 and bringing in Sean DePaula,
who allowed a double steal with an amazingly slow windup to Coomer.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer's groundout then scored Denny Hocking from third.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shuey, the Indians' fifth pitcher of the inning, gave up a
run-scoring single to pinch-hitter Cummings that made it 8-7 before
Jensen's inning-ending flyout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hitters are batting .358 against Bergman this season. ...
The Cuban college team that lost one of its infielders to a
defection during its U.S. visit was honored before the game.
Members of Equipo Caribe and host St. Thomas University each
received an autographed baseball from former Twins and Cuban
natives Tony Oliva and Julio Becquer.
