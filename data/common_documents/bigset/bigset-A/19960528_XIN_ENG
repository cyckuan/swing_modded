<HEADLINE> Chechnya War Likely to End on June 1, Spokesman Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
spokesman, Sergei Medvedev, said here today that the Chechnya war
is likely to end on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results of the ongoing talks between Russian
leadership headed by Yeltsin and Chechen separatist delegation led
by rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, Medvedev said the two sides
may sing a document ending the 17-month-long war.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear as yet whether it will be a joint
statement or something else, according to Medvedev, who is taking
part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
While ending the talks, which started in the Kremlin earlier
today immediately after the Chechen rebels' arrival, the two sides
will probably sign an agreement to halt all hostilities in
Chechnya, or the war in the Russian local republic, sources with
the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
Major issues in the talks may include those of the withdrawal
of federal troops from Chechnya and the breakaway republic's
status.
</P>
<P>
Present in the talks are also Russian Prime Minister Viktor
chernomyrdin, Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov, Moscow-backed
Chechen leader Doku Zavgayev, presidential aides Dmitry Ryurikov
and Yuri Baturin, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and Minister
of Nationalities Vyacheslav Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen separatist delegation includes "field commander"
Akhmed Zakayev, Yandarbiyev's aides, Movlen Salamov, Hussein
Bibulatov and Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov, and his "deputy foreign
minister" Yaragi Abdulayev.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Write Inscriptions for Children's Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li Peng have written inscriptions to mark the 50th
anniversary of the "Chinese Children's News".
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin Wrote "Love Children, and Run the Newspaper to
Train Successors", while Li Peng wrote " Love Children, Understand
Children and Serve Children".
</P>
<P>
The "Chinese Children's News" was launched by the underground
organization of the Chinese Communist Party in 1946 in harsh
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper overcame its initial difficulties, educated large
numbers of children and made positive contributions to the
founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The paper has long stuck to the policy of speaking on behalf of
children and in children's language, and letting children speak
their minds.

<P>
HARBIN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Two lecturing groups of Young
Volunteers have both ended national tours of China today.
</P>
<P>
They sang their last note advocating the vogue of the day -
helping those in need - in Harbin, capital city of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province, and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee and Communist Youth League
of China (CYLC) Central Committee, the tour aimed at encouraging
more people to acknowledge the importance of such virtues as
helping each other and making contributions to society.
</P>
<P>
Li Xueqian, director of the publicity department of CYLC
Central Committee, said that at least ten million Chinese young
people have participated in the Youth Volunteer Action, which was
originally launched in 1993. They formed millions of groups to
provide voluntary and free service for families and individuals in
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
"One Help One" campaign, namely one volunteer or one volunteer
team providing service for one individual or one family, has been
very popular in the country, with the number of partners topping
600,000 so far, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Comprising of 11 members, the lecturing team gave their debut
talk at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on May 6, and then
divided into two groups which, to date, have given 30 lectures in
10 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.

Sathirathai announced his resignation here today.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the airport upon his return from an

Before he was made finance minister last July, Surakiat was
dean of a law faculty of a prestigious university and law advisor
to Banharn Silpa-archa.

financial problems, such as rising inflation rate, fall of the
Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index and high current account
deficit.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Firms Urged to Brace for Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of Industry
and Commerce Obert Mpofu today said small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMES) should gear themselves for increased competition following the
passing of the competition bill by parliament early this month.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a two-day workshop on organising for effective
manufacturing, Mpofu urged the SMES to improve the quality of their
products so as to survive the threats caused by the opening up of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
''I should remind you that monopolies are a thing of the past
following the passing in parliament of the competition bill,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
''You, therefore, should look at ways of improving the quality of
your products if you are to survive the stiff competition coming from
within the region and from the far east,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the SMES to especially improve the quality of packaging
of their products which, he said, often resulted in negative consumer
attitudes towards local products.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government recognised the importance of the
small-scale sector, adding that the sector contributed about 25
percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
Studies conducted in 1993 revealed that some 90,000 small and
medium-sized enterprises existed in Zimbabwe. enditem

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Ruling Party Blamed for "Artificial Majority" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Two South Korean opposition parties
criticized today the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) for winning a
majority in the new National Assembly by inducing opposition and
independent lawmakers-elect to join the NKP.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP)
led by Kim Dae-jung and the conservative opposition United Liberal
Democrats (ULD) headed by Kim Jong-pil organized a joint outdoor
rally here today.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties urged the NKP to hold a parliamentary
hearing on corrupted election campaigns and revise election-
related laws to guarantee fair election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The two Kims claimed in their speeches that the NKP's
"artificial" creation of majority in parliament is an act to
ignore the people's choice and destroy opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the 15th National Assembly, which opens
early next month, will be managed by dialogues and negotiations
only if the ruling party and the government show a faithful
attitude to accept demands of the opposition camp.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam won 139
seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the NKP later secured 150 seats by admitting 11
opposition and independent lawmakers-elect.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties adopted a resolution at the rally,
calling on the government and the ruling party to apologize for
"total corruption in election campaigns" and stop biased
investigation into opposition's lawmakers-elect.
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that some 70,000 people participated in the
rally at Boramae Park, but the NCNP put the number at 150,000.
</P>
<P>
The NKP responded to the rally today with an appeal to the
opposition parties for cooperation for management of "normal
politics" in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"Now the opposition parties held the outdoor rally as they
liked it, we hope that they will cooperate with us to recover
normal politics," NKP Spokesman Kim Chul said in a statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's private airline operators
who are asking for a big fare hike are urged to pay more
attention to security, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The airline operators have submitted to the Ministry of
Aviation a proposal for an air fare increase between 200 and 300
percent on the current high inflationary trend and develuation of
the nation's currency, which the Airline Operators of Nigeria,
the national association, claims has caused the cost of operators
to rise astronomically.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that maintenance costs of aircraft are in
foreign currency while earnings are in local currency, the
ministry's Director-General Samu'ila Makama has called on private
airline operators to use inexpensive internationally accepted
equipment to conduct body checks and search hand luggages of
passengers before boarding.
</P>
<P>
To keep abreast with technological developments and related
changes in the industry, the official said that Nigeria must be
prepared to learn, adopt and implement new ways of management
control in such areas as telecommunications, maintenance of
equipment and traffic control. enditem

<HEADLINE> Britain Takes Measures to Combat Road Rage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government has come up
with a range of measures aimed at fighting road rage, which has
increased in Britain as car ownership has risen and the country's
roads have become ever more crowed.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times reported today that the new edition of the
learner-driver's guide, the Highway Code, due out in July, will
include advice on how to avoid verbal clashes, which are
increasingly escalating into violence and death.
</P>
<P>
The new Highway Code will give a number of suggestions to
defuse or avoid road rage.
</P>
<P>
It says that motorists should acknowledge a driving error that
annoys another motorist, avoid eye contact with other drivers to
defuse situations, relax after a stressed day with a walk before
driving, avoid tailgating, speeding or running red lights and
never leave the car if threatened.
</P>
<P>
A public campaign, including television advertisements, posters
and leaflets emphasising the need to stay calm if provoked, is
under discussion at the Home Office and the Department of
Transport, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Just five years ago, British police dismissed road rage as an
entirely American phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
But the number of violent incidents which took place in Britain
in recent months has increased the pressure for action. Last
week, a 21-year-old man was stabbed to death by another driver
after an altercation at traffic lights.

MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin hails
a ceasefire agreement terminating all hostilities in Chechnya
signed here this evening.
</P>
<P>
"We have solved the main question of peace in Chechnya. This is
a historic day and a historic moment," Yeltsin told reporters
after almost three-hour-talks with Chechen separatist delegation
headed by rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said that both sides agreed to release all
hostages and prisoners of war within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin ad Yandarbiyev in the presence of the Russian
President and a representative of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The document was also signed by five representatives from each
side, sources in the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
It has been unclear whether the sides discussed Chechnya's
status and how the sides will deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev, who took over power in the Chechen separatist camp
after Dzhokhar Dudayev's death, arrived in Moscow earlier this
afternoon and started talks with Russian leaders immediately.
</P>

Present in the talks were Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin,
Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov, Moscow-backed Chechen

<HEADLINE> Children's March Planned to Highlight Their Plight in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 organizations
are joining the Children's Defense Fund in sponsoring the Stand
for Children rally on May 25 at the Lincoln Memorial here.
</P>
<P>
"We want this day to be for children what the 1963 march did
for civil rights and what Earth Day did for the environment,
because it is time," Marian Wright Edelman, president and founder
of the fund, was quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics gathered by the fund, every 32 seconds
a child is born into poverty in the States; every 15 minutes a
baby dies and gunfire claims a youngster's life every two hours.
</P>
<P>
The rally will feature a day of activities for children and
families, including music and dance, reading circles, sing-alongs
and exhibits.
</P>
<P>
A highlight will be a children's march to the memorial,
orchestrated to encourage a deeper public commitment to protecting
the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, school organizations, churches, synagogues,
scouting groups and other community groups are reportedly being
urged to get their members out.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Conference of Mayors has endorsed Stand for Children
and earlier this month the mayors from more than five dozen cities
said they had issued or plan to issue proclamations declaring
Saturday as Stand for Children Day.
</P>
<P>
The defense fund's 1996 yearbook paints a sad portrait of life
as a child in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the yearbook, every day in the United States:
</P>
<P>
-- 2,660 children are born into poverty; 27 die from it;
</P>
<P>
-- 8,493 children are reported abused or neglected; three die;
</P>
<P>
-- 15 children are killed by firearms;
</P>
<P>
-- 2,833 children quit school.
</P>
<P>
Among developed countries, America loses the most children to
gunfire, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the rally will be people who are making a
difference in children's lives. Participants will be encouraged to
do simple things for children, such as reading or walking them to
school. They will also be urged to keep children's issues on the
front burner after they go back home.

<HEADLINE> UK Tory Government Blamed for Beef Crisis: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tory hopes that beef war
with the European Union would boost the popularity of the
splitting party are dashed by a special poll for the Observer
weekly.
</P>
<P>
The ICM poll finds that by a margin of three to one, voters
blame the Conservative government rather than the EU for the
current beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
And most people think that John Major's policy of
non-cooperation with the EU is "no more than a cynical ploy" to
win voters in the run-up to the next general election.
</P>
<P>
Between early May and last week, those questioned blaming the
farming community for the beef crisis rose five percentage points
22 percent, while those blaming the government rose from 45
percent to a 51 percent majority.
</P>
<P>
The embattled Major could get a bit relief as 61 percent hold
that the EU was wrong and ban British beef exports and the prime
minister was right to retaliate by attempting to block EU
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Even so, 53 percent still maintains that the government's
actions against the EU are no more than a cynical ploy to win
voters.
</P>
<P>
Further evidence that the beef war has done little to boost
Tory popularity comes from the answers to the wider question:
which party has the best policy on Europe?
</P>
<P>
The poll finds that Labour enjoys support of 24 percent, the
Conservatives 23 percent and Liberal Democrats 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 52 percent want Britain to stay in the
EU, while 42 percent call for withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The poll was based on the interviews of a random sample of 532
adults last friday throughout Britain and all interviews were
conducted by telephone.
</P>
<P>
The poll has been thought a grave disappointment to Tory
strategists because they had hoped the government's policy of
non-cooperation with the EU would help to reverse the depressed
party's fortune.

<HEADLINE> Security Warnings Upgraded for French, Americans in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phnom Penh, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States and France
have upgraded security warnings given to their citizens now living
or traveling in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the "Cambodia Daily" today, the French
and U.S. embassies announced the new consular warnings last Friday
in light of a recent upsurge in crime against foreigners in this
capital city.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 foreigners, mostly expatriate residents, have been
robbed at gunpoint by bandits in the past week in a series of
increasingly violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
Among lastest incidents, an Australian man was robbed and
assaulted last Saturday, and a Canadian was fired upon but
unharmed late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh restaurants and nightspots catering to foreigners
have reported a significant downturn in business since the
beginning of the month, when the number of robberies began to soar.
</P>
<P>
"For the past three days, we have been telling people to avoid
taking motorcycle taxis at night," said a French embassy
spokesman, who stressed that no mandatory security measures were
being considered.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. embassy stated in its guidelines that it
"advises its personnel to avoid traveling alone or in remote areas
of the city, especially after dark."
</P>
<P>
The embassy also encourages U.S. citizens "to take considerable
caution" while traveling by road outside of urban areas, or after
dark in areas such as the northwest of Phnom Penh.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Britain signed an
agreement here Sunday under which London will grant Jordan 285,000
pounds (427,500 U.S. dollars) in technical aid to help the kingdom
improve its water resources.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which was signed by Jordanian Minister of Planning
Rima Khalaf and British Ambassador to Jordan Peter Hinchcliffe,
falls within the framework of the Ground Water Assessment Project
which will take two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to introduce new techniques to Jordan,
which will help provide accurate information on the environmental
conditions affecting the Aquifer basin.
</P>
<P>
The aid is being offered as part of the British government's
financial support for this project under the Overseas Development
Administration's Technical Cooperation program, said the
English-language daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The British ambassador was quoted by Jordan News Agency,
Petra, as saying after the signing of the deal that the project is
part of a 4-million-pound (about 6 million dollars) grant pledged
by Britain to Jordan over four years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, Britain will provide 1-million-pound
(about 1.5 million dollars) to finance a project undertaken by the
Jordanian Ministry of Social Development to boost the performance
and efficiency of its employees.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Holds 10th Trial of Two Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Seoul District Court
opened today the 10th trial session on mutiny and treason charges
involving former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun, Roh and Chun's 11 fellow
generals and colonels.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, defense lawyers questioned the 11 defendants
on their roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979, and in
the bloody crackdown of the civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in
Kwangju, capital of South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
The defendants who were queried included Yoo Hak-seong, former
deputy defense minister for logistics, Hwang Young-si, former
first army corps commander, and Lee Hak-bong, Hur Sam-soo and Hur
Hwa-pyong, the so-called "gang of three from the Defense Security
Command."
</P>
<P>
Defendants Yoo and Hwang insisted that they had mobilized
troops in self-defense against attempted preemptive strike by
loyal generals in December 1979.
</P>
<P>
Lee and the two Hurs claimed that it was necessary to detain
then Army Chief of Staff Chung Seung-hwa to investigate his
involvement in the assassination of President Park Chung-hee at
that time.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers' cross-questioning on former presidents Chun and Roh
was finished in the previous trial session.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers, including Chun
and Roh, have been indicted for mutiny and treason for their roles
in the 1979 military revolt and the 1980 military crackdown of the
Kwangju civil uprising.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-hwan, who loomed large as the army strongman after the
1979 military revolt, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled
the nation until February 1988.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by Roh Tae-woo, who stepped down in February
1993.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the mutiny and treason charges, the two
ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also been
indicted for graft charges as they received huge bribes from
businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh have already stood trial three times each on the
graft charges separately.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reiterates Commitment to Gulf Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff General John Shalikashvili today reiterated the
United States' commitment to the security and stability of the
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a brief press conference at the Kuwaiti
International Airport before leaving for Saudi Arabia, the
chairman said the United States will continue its commitment in
the Gulf "to ensure that no one in this region threatens or
intimidates any of our allies."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on whether the agreement between Iraq
and the U.N. to allow Baghdad to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of
oil every six months to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people
means the first step to lift the U.N. sanctions on the country, he
said that this is "in no way lessens the requirements on the part
of Iraq to fulfill all relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations clamped comprehensive sanctions on Iraq,
including a ban on its oil exports, as punishment for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili arrived here Sunday to inspect the American
forces stationed in the Gulf. He held talks with Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and met Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that he left Kuwait with a reassurance that "our
relationship is on a very sound footing and that we will continue
to work together" on various matters concerned. Kuwait is his
first stop on a Middle East tour which will also take him to Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the United States are linked by a defense agreement
signed in 1992, a year after U.S.-led forces liberated Kuwait from
seven months of Iraqi occupation.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Processing-on-Commission Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The processing-on-commission trade
between South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) increased by 9.7 percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The increase, according to the International Trade and Industry
Ministry here today, was over the same period of last year. And
the volume of the January-March trade was 6.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The so-called processing-on-commission trade means that the
South Korean raw materials are shipped to the DPRK for processing.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume nose-dived 60.8 percent in January from a year
earlier, but bounced back to 1.18 million dollars in February, and
then jumped to 4.59 million dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total volume of the inter-Korean commodity
exchanges approved in the first three months of the year totaled
50.8 million dollars, down 41.2 percent from the same period of
last year, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the inter-Korean processing-on-commission trade
registered 26 million dollars, up 56.9 percent over the previous
year, while the total volume of commodity exchanges stood at 310
million dollars on a approval basis, up 35 percent from 1994.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's GDP Growth Bigger Than Projected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross domestic product
(GDP) growth rate for the year's first quarter was bigger than the
previously projected 7.3 percent, the Bank of Korea said today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said, the GDP amounted to 80 billion U.S. dollars in
the three-month period, up 7.9 percent from the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the higher-than-projected growth to brisk
exports, bustling construction activities and robust private
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports in the first three months of the year
amounted to 31.83 billion dollars, up 21.5 percent from the same
period of last year, while imports stood at 35.62 billion dollars,
up 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector grew 9.3 percent in the period, thanks
to public works projects which resulted in a 17.2-percent growth
in government investment from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Heavy industries grew 10.8 percent, buoyed by increasing
exports, but light industries suffered a 2-percent decline,
widening the growth gap between the two sectors.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications industry enjoyed a whopping 20.9-percent
expansion on the strength of the ever-expanding cellular phone,
electronic paging (beeper) and international telephone services
networks, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's GDP is expected to grow 7.2 percent this year,
compared with the 9-percent growth last year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Has Made World Safer Place, Says Nzo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has made the
world a safer place to live by being part of a global impetus to
eliminate weapons of mass destruction, Foreign Affairs Minister
Alfred Nzo said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an African National Congress media summit at
Midrand north of Johannesburg, Nzo said: ''We should be proud of
the role we have played in these efforts.''
</P>
<P>
In April this year, South Africa signed a treaty declaring
itself a nuclear-free zone.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Nzo stressed that Africa was well on its way
to becoming a nuclear-free continent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government was deciding on how to make South
Africa a safer place for foreign diplomats, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the incident last week when Lebanon's
Ambassador to South Africa Charbel Stephan was attacked by
robbers who broke into his Houghton home and embassy in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
If the government did not take any steps to protect foreign
diplomats in South Africa, there would be a crisis in the
international relations because of criminal activities, he added.

</P>
<P>
The project, to be co-financed with other donor agencies, seeks

<HEADLINE> COSATU to Discuss Privatisation With Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Congress of South African
Trade Unions (COSATU) was prepared to meet President Nelson
Mandela for talks on the privatisation of state assets, COSATU
Secretary General Sam Shilowa said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a press conference here, Shilowa
reiterated that COSATU's stance against privatisation was well
known as was the position of the African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
He said there was no negotiation between the ANC and the
COSATU on anti- and pro-privatisation lines because ''those
positions are well known''.
</P>
<P>
''The way forward now is that the president has said he wants
to meet us on the issue. We say we are available,'' said Shilowa.
</P>
<P>
On his return to the country from his three-day state visit to
Germany last Friday, Mandela said privatisation was the
fundamental policy of the ANC and would be implemented as a
government policy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to COSATU's resistance to the privatisation, Mandela
said: ''We have to discuss it and bring our allies on board. I
don't believe that this will be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
However, a COSATU national executive meeting last friday had
noted that the body set up between labour and government had not
met since the National Framework Agreement (NFA) on the
restructuring of state assets was signed last year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had agreed ''not to allow the reactionary forces
to push us into a slanging match with the president or the ANC
since this will only justify their wish for a split in the
alliance''.
</P>
<P>
Instead, COSATU would focus on the NFA implementation as well
as meeting with the ANC to clarify these matters, added Shilowa.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Bank Governer Urges For Globalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has to choose
between becoming part of the global financial system or remaining
isolated, depending on its own scarce resources for financial
development, South African Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a retirement funds' conference in
Cape Town, Stals said in the former situation, economic
development would on average be at a higher level, but "we shall
have to learn manage greater volatility".
</P>
<P>
In the latter, the path might be on a more stable and perhaps
an even easier route, but economic growth and development would
be more depressed.
</P>
<P>
Stals said he had no doubt the first route was preferable and it
was thus important to prepare the way for all exchange controls to be
removed by developing the total market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Once all markets perform with equal effectiveness in a
relatively free environment, exchange controls will in any case no
longer be necessary," said the governor.
</P>
<P>
However, Stals warned that the level of private savings in
South Africa was perilously low, saying most South Africans saved
very little outside of contractual savings made through
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that private households in total saved only
about one percent of Gross Domestic Product last year.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian President Calls For Consolidation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada today called on the Ethiopian people, governmental and
non- governmental organizations to join hands in consolidating
the prevalent peace, ensuring the promotion of democracy and
bringing about sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation on the occassion of the fifth
anniversary of its liberation from the former Mengistu regime,
President Negasso said it is imperative that the people of
Ethiopia act in unison to successfully implement the peace,
democracy and development program of the government, which is
targeted at causing a rapid and overall development of the
country and the prosperity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The president indicated that the task of implementing the
ideals of peace and democracy should be carried out by all
ethiopians irrespective of creed, sex, nationality, and political
outlook, because, he said, the agenda is not a section of the
society or a political party but of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said the democratic gains achieved so far and the
fruitful development efforts being undertaken are indicative of
the fact that the country has, in the past five years, entered
into the actual process of building a democratic system.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, Ethiopia has a long way to go before it
builds the capacity of providing a durable solution to the long
standing problems of its people.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a difficult task to be accomplished in the
years ahead, a task that includes the ardous effort of making the
prevalent peace more sustainable, putting the already won
democracy on a wider and more solid popular foundation and
speeding up the economic development aimed at alleviating
poverty.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ethiopian people to remain vigilant against the
enemies of the democratic process and get determined to build a
strong democratic system on the basis of a wide and direct
popular participation.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the continuation of development efforts
being carried out to bring about a meaningful change in the life
of the Ethiopian people. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Turkey,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia today called for more international
contributions to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement made here by Turkish Foreign Minister Emre
Gonensay and his Croatian and Bosnian counterparts Mate Granic and
Yadranko Prlic after a tripartite meeting said all participants
have agreed that the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina "represented
the foundation of lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that Bosnia-Herzegovina should be
maintained as a "multicultural and multiethnic state of its
constituent nations and as a pluralistic democratic society."
</P>
<P>
The statement urged both Croatia and Bosnia "to continue
vigorously the Federation-building process at all levels" and
urged the settlement of remaining problems before the next session
of the Federal Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"There are still problems regarding the implementation of the
Dayton peace accord," Bosnian Foreign Minister Prlic said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the three countries pointed out the
importance of the holding of free and fair elections in
Bosnia-Herzegovina within the framework of the peace agreement
signed in Paris in late December last year.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Gonensay confirmed Turkey's support
for Bosnia and Croatia to be involved in Euro-Atlantic integration
and the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite meeting is also a preparatory step for the
presidential meeting among the three countries before the Bosnian
national elections in September.

Relations Council was the proper forum to discuss the problems
facing teachers in South Africa, President Nelson Mandela said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing teachers, parents and students at the Princeton
High School in Mitchells Plain south of Cape Town, Mandela said
he would respond to the memorandum handed to Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki during the teachers' march on parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
On May 24, about 20000 mainly white and coloured
placard-bearing teachers from the Western Cape Province marched
on parliament protesting against government's redeployment plans.
</P>
<P>
The president said he fully supported the South African
Democratic Teachers' Union's decision on the best way to achieve
equity and destroy the apartheid legacy in education.
</P>
<P>
On the redeployment, Mandela said the number of teachers did
not have to be reduced, the important thing was that they had to
be distributed equitably throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
However, teachers' fears about redepolyment were
understandable since this could be traumatic for them, said the
president, adding this was why the redundancy option was
available for practical reasons.
</P>
<P>
Not a single teacher would be "thrown on the street" as long
as he remained president of the country, Mandela pledged.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President on Government Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir
delivered an address today at the National Assembly on his
government policy on economy and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the continuity of the policy of economic
liberation and the government's plan to conduct extensive dialogue
and contacts with international and regional financial
organizations.
</P>
<P>
President Bashir stressed the importance of self-reliance,
saying that his government would make efforts to support the poor
families and would maintain its efforts in developing Sudan's
economy.
</P>
<P>
On dialogue and contacts with the Sudanese opposition, Bashir
said that the dialogue will be kept up with all groups and
personalities, adding that the government will not isolate anyone
and that the door will be wide open to all, with the ultimate
target of achieving national unity.
</P>
<P>
As for the government policy toward peace, Bashir said that
efforts will be focused on internal peace and the implementation
of a peace charter. He called upon rebel leader John Garang to
join in the peace moves.
</P>
<P>
Southern rebels, most of them Christians and adherents of
tribal religions, are seeking autonomy from the Arab-dominated
north led by Sudan's Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million people have died and hundreds of thousands
have fled their homes in Sudan's 13-year-old civil war and in
famines aggravated by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Bashir asserted that Sudan's foreign policy would uphold good
neighborly relations with all countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
He hailed Arab countries' support for Sudan concerning
U.N. Security Council resolution 1054, which calls for diplomatic
sanctions against Sudan for its failure to turn over three
suspects involved in an assassination attempt on Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia last year.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that dialogue with western countries,
particularly the United States, would be maintained in a bid to
reach a solution to their differences with Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Trouble Maker Rejected Bail </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho High Court today
rejected bail for a man who had allegedly forced his way into
Radio Lesotho studios earlier this year and announced the
government had been dissolved, the South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
On February 29, former national security service member
Matsoso Bolofo allegedly forced his way into a Radio Lesotho
studio in Maseru and broadcast a message that the government had
been toppled and parts of the Lesotho constitution suspended.
</P>
<P>
Bolofo and his alleged co-plotters were arrested by Lesotho
defence force officers within minutes.
</P>
<P>
Court Justice Kelello Guni dismissed Bolofo's bail
application, saying the seriousness of high treason made it
unrealistic to expect the accused would not abscond and seek
political asylum in a neighbouring country.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho is a small land-locked country within South Africa.

<HEADLINE> UK Troops Likely to Stay in Bosnia for Another 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government is secretly
examining plans to commit up to some 15,000 British troops in
Bosnia for another two years when the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) pulls out of Bosnia at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
It is no longer a question of whether British troops will stay
on, but how many, and under what political mandate, according to
the Independent newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Some British officers serving in Bosnia have been informed that
their units may spend up to 24 months in Bosnia, whereas U.S.
troops will leave at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has already made it clear that there is no
possibility of their troops remaining in Bosnia after the
year-long IFOR mission expires.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo was also reported as
reaffirming Britain's stand recently that it will withdraw their
troops from Bosnia along with U.S. troops at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government is more likely retreating from
its hard stance and will agree to shoulder the main responsibility
of peacekeeping in Bosnia in the post-IFOR period.
</P>
<P>
According to defense sources, the plan being considered will
see British troops supplying the core manpower for the first NATO
operation in Europe to use American equipment, but American troops
will not be involved in the new operation.
</P>
<P>
There is still doubt over which countries will supply their
troops in the new peacekeeping operation and who should pay the
bills, the report said. Some Scandinavian countries have privately
indicated that they are unlikely to send their troops for a
long-period presence in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Chechnya Pledge to Observe Cease-fire Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev assured each other
that federal troops and Chechen rebels will comply with the
cease-fire agreement signed in the Kremlin this evening after
two-hour talks.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony, Yeltsin kept on urging the Russian
negotiators to sign the document without delay, while exchanging
remarks with Yandarbiyev, who came to Moscow this afternoon for
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We will immediately inform (Defense Minister Pavel) Grachev
and our military about the signing of the document," Yeltsin told
Yandarbiyv, who inquired if the Russian troops would observe the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We have a single chain of command. And will the Chechen side
implement the agreement?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"We have even more of that," the Chechen separatist leader said
jokingly, noting that there was a unity of power in the Chechen
separatist camp and that his order to end hostilities would also
be followed.
</P>
<P>
Meeting reporters after the signing ceremony, Yeltsin said, "We
have solved the main question of peace in Chechnya. This is a
historic day and a historic moment."
</P>
<P>
The agreement terminating all hostilities in Chechnya starting
June 1 was signed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
and Yandarbiyev in the presence of the Russian president and a
representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The document was also signed by five representatives from each
side.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to release all the hostages and
prisoners of war within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results of the talks, Yeltsin's spokesman
Sergei Medvedev quoted the president as saying, "If the main
issue, a ceasefire, is solved, all the remaining issues may be
solved one by one."
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, neither of the sides
raised the question of Chechnya's legal status, which has been the
key cause of the 17-month-long war between Moscow and Chechnya.
Chechen separatists have tried to make their republic independent
from Russia, while Moscow has insisted that Chechnya is part of
the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said the two sides were guided in their talks by a
common desire to put an end to fighting and bloodshed in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Not all of the issues were settled, this is why some members
of Yandarbiyev's delegation will stay in Moscow to work out
measures to implement the agreement reached," He added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the two sides will continue negotiations, but
without Yeltsin's participation. Chernomyrdin is expected to take
part in the talks "as the need arises," sources in the Kremlin
said.
</P>
<P>
Further talks will focused on measures to implement the
ceasefire agreement. The venue and exact time of Tuesday's round
was expected to be decided tonight.
</P>
<P>
On March 31, Yeltsin outlined a program for the settlement of
the Chechen crisis. It provided for a stop to all military
operations at midnight on March 31, gradual withdrawal of federal
troops from Chechnya's calm areas and preparation for free
democratic elections for the Chechen parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Chechnya's status is to be established in
the course of a "practical and constructive dialogue between the
federal bodies and representatives of the people of the Chechen
republic."
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev became Chechen separatist leader on April 23,
following Dzhokhar Dudayev's death. On May 23, the OSCE mission in
Chechnya said in Vienna that a meeting between Yeltsin and
Yandarbiyev was expected in Moscow soon.

<HEADLINE> EU Farm Product Prices Rise in Late 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The EU's average monthly index of
producer prices of agricultural products rose by 3.4 percent in
the fourth quarter of 1995, compared with the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The price rise was almost equal to the inflation rate and so
the real price index was little changed (-0.2 percent), said a
report released today by the Luxembourg-based Eurostat, EU's
(European Union) statistical department.
</P>
<P>
Real producer prices for crop products in the EU as a whole
continued to increase, compared with the corresponding period of
1994.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rise mainly to price increases for
olives and olive oil (25.2 percent), wine must and wine (12.7
percent), fruit (10.5 percent), and flowers and plants (7.1
percent).
</P>
<P>
The price index for root crops declined by 14.2 percent while
that for potatoes, exceptionally high in 1994, returned to more
usual levels in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The price index for cereals and rice was relatively stable (0.8
percent).
</P>
<P>
In contrast to crop products, real producer prices for animals
and animal products declined 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Declines were recorded for most groups of animals and animal
products, notably cattle excluding calves (9.5 percent), calves
(9.1 percent), poultry (6.6 percent), sheep and lambs (4.3
percent), and milk (1.9 percent).
</P>
<P>
The real price index for pigs, which had declined steeply in
1993 and 1994, rose in the fourth quarter of 1995 (4.0 percent),
continuing the increase throughout 1995.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the pig price index, relative to the index base
(100 in 1990), was still very low (77.3) in the fourth quarter of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The real price index for eggs rose by 8.2 percent.

WASHINGTON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned homes
in U.S. rose by 0.5 percent in April, the third consecutive

The U.S. National Association of Realtors said today that sales

<HEADLINE> China's Biggest Detergent Company Listed in Shanghai Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- One of China's largest detergent
producers, the Huoli 28 Group, launched its initial public
offering (IPO) on the Shanghai Securities Exchange today.
</P>
<P>
Taking a lion's share of China's lucrative detergents market,
the company, based in Central China's Hubei Province, has an
annual production capacity of 110,000 tons of detergents.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its widely known brand, Huoli 28, for detergent
products, the company's business also covers cosmetics and pure
water.
</P>
<P>
With 60 percent of its equities held by the state, the
company will remain a formidable challenger to the emerging
dominance of foreign companies in China's detergent market.
</P>
<P>
However, the country has seen some domestic detergent plants
emergering with such big world names as Procter and Gamble,
Germany's Fa and Lever over past few years.
</P>
<P>
Huoli 28 is the ninth listed company to be listed from Hubei
Province.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Company to Expand in Libya Despite U.S. Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian oil and gas company is
set to increase its presence in Libya despite the threat of
U.S. Cuban-style embargo legislation against companies doing
business in the African country.
</P>
<P>
PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd., a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific
Ltd., announced Monday that it has signed an exploration and
production agreement with Libya's National Oil Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, PanCanadian will spend a minimum of 17
million U.S. dollars over the next five years to explore a
5,000-square-kilometer tract in Libya's Sirte basin.
</P>
<P>
The Calgary-based company is also committed to drill three
wells and complete 1,000 kilometers of seismic lines. The first
well will be sunk either next year or in 1998, today's Financial
Post newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian company decision to expand in Libya represents a
defiance to the U.S. Congress' proposed bills that seek to impose
Cuba-style penalties on foreign companies doing business in the
African nation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bills, one from the Senate and another from the House
of Representatives, are designed to punish Libya and Iran for
"supporting terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Companies doing business in Libya would be barred from doing
business in the United States, according to the House version of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
PanCanadian exports significant amount of oil and gas to the
United States from Western Canada.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the company said Monday that it is monitoring
the progress of the bill through the U.S. legislature and is
"certainly aware of the bill."
</P>
<P>
"If and when it gets passed into law, we will examine it at
that time... But we are in full compliance with the laws of every
country we operate within," he was quoted as saying by the
newspaper.

YANTAI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Haiyang County, the last county on
China's Jiaodong Peninsular in Shandong Province, was "promoted"
today by being given city status.
</P>
<P>
Three vigorous cities, Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai, which used
to have some 20 county-level cities, counties and districts under
their jurisdiction, were scattered across the peninsular.
</P>
<P>
However the rapid urbanization process as a result of booming
economic development, led to the counties gradually being
"swallowed" by a few central cities, with the rest have upgraded
to cities.

In 1995, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Haiyang County
reached 3.8 billion yuan, which is an unimaginable figure for
counties in the central and western parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Center to Help Jobless Women in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Beijing set up its first service
center today to help 50,000 out-of-work women find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of workers in Beijing have become jobless,
with many of them "driven" out of the large and medium-sized state
enterprises. There they used to have an "iron rice bowl" (living
on salaries provided by government). But now staffing levels are
being reduced to cater for market competition.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of March this year Beijing had
108,000 such jobless people in total, half of them women,
placing pressure on society, enterprises, and families.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the jobless women are middle-aged people,
physical laborers, or women with low education backgrounds.
Officials admit that those women will have difficulty finding new
employment.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has decided to step in by issuing a
document to expand the service for women's re-employment and
guarantee the interests of female workers.
</P>
<P>
Authorities told Xinhua that the center will research the
psychology of female job-seekers, provide information on
employment and training for jobless women, and help them go
through relevant employment formalities.
</P>
<P>
According to them, a special program, jointly scheduled by the
center and the Beijing Municipal People's Broadcast Station, will
offer consultancy services for the jobless.

JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's General Security Service
has decided to tighten security around Prime Minister Shimon Peres
and Minister of Public Security Moshe Shahal, reported Israel
Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as a new spate of intelligence warnings about
plans to harm them.
</P>
<P>
Among those reportedly plotting to attack Shahal are followers
of jailed activists of Yemenite Jews.
</P>
<P>
As election campaigns are coming to an end before Wednesday's
elections, Peres has come under more intense attacks. In Tel Aviv
area, new campaign posters were put up today reading "It is
forbidden to vote for Peres," "It is forbidden to allow Arab
voters to win" and "Peres wants to rid the Middle East of Jews."
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party sharply criticized the posters and called on
Likud to act against all racist propaganda. But Likud
disassociated itself of the poster campaign as well as those put
up earlier saying "Netanyahu is good for the Jews."

the French Open tennis tournament here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Capriati, who burst out of the screen six years ago as the

Beijing player, who came from nowhere and made her debut at the
tourney.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Chinese, who only participated her second Grand
Slam tournament, should have finished match earlier when she led
6-3, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
But the reigning Olympic champion stormed back until a
forehand error in the vital twelfth game, which would have put the
second-set into a tie-break.
</P>
<P>
Currently ranked 71st, the Chinese player broke into the
world's top 100 after reaching the Pattaya final last year and in
1995 improved 253 places in the rankings.

Capriati staged her comeback to tennis at Essen earlier this
year after quitting the game after the 1993 U.S. Open.

ATHENS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A Greek coast guard patrol boat and a
Turkish patrol boat collided in the eastern Aegean this morning,
causing serious damages to the Greek boat.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's merchant marine ministry sources, the
incident occurred when a Turkish patrol boat violated Greek
territorial waters near the Islet of Imia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish vessels, the same sources said, after ignoring
repeated calls from a Greek coast guard patrol boat, rammed the
Greek vessel and sped toward international waters.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas described the incident as
"another provocation" by Turkey, adding that Athens was already
taking all the necessary diplomatic steps.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility of Greece's withdraw of
its diplomatic officials from talks with a Turkish delegation in
Geneva to prepare the groundwork for a meeting between the foreign
ministers of the two countries on the sidelines of a Nato meeting
in Berlin next month.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Greece was considering withdrawing its representatives
from the Geneva talks, Reppas repled: "the government is
considering everything".

determined "not to allow anyone to dispute Greece's territorial
integrity and sovereign rights".

XIGAZE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Religious believers and laymen in
the Tibet Autonomous Region have today hailed the golden board
presented by President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
In Jiang's Handwriting, the golden board unveiled today in the
Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery was inscribed with words of "Safeguard the
Country and Benefit the People".
</P>
<P>
Tibetans expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the care for
Tibetan Buddhism from the central government and the Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very happy today, I thank the president from the bottom
of my heart," six-year-old 11th Panchen Lama said, uttering the
words on the board repeatedly in both Chinese and Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
"This is a day of auspiciousness and jubilation, and I'm rather
happy to attend such a grand ceremony in my lifetime," 74-year-old
monk Puncog said excitedly. He has been staying at the lamasery
since he was nine.
</P>
<P>
"I whole-heartedly thank the president for his special care for
Tibetan Buddhism," Puncog said.
</P>
<P>
Sarkang Gajim Cering, vice-director of the Democratic Management
Committee of the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, is a well-respected monk
who is versed in Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 550 years, successive Panchen Lamas, with their
patriotic activities, gained support from the vast religious
believers and nonbelievers and the central government, he said.
</P>
<P>
In its history, the lamasery had received four boards from
ancient emperors of China, but it is the first time that a top
leader of Chinese Communist Party has presented the historic
golden board to the religious circles after the founding of new
China.
</P>
<P>
"The inscription of the board demands that we continue to
uphold the banner of patriotism, firmly safeguard the unity of the
motherland and solidarity of different ethnic groups, defend state
sovereignty and the authority of the central government, and
protect the interest of the country and the people," Sarkang Gajim
Cering said.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Monks, Laymen Hail Golden Board Inscribed by Jiang Zemin (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The golden board also fully confirms and greatly encourages
the patriotic tradition in our Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery," he
said. "We lamas should love the motherland first and then go in
for religious activities which we believe in."
</P>
<P>
He vowed that all the lamasery's 800 lamas will live up to the
expectations of the president, and staunchly oppose the Dalai
clique's evil activities designed to damage the unity of the
motherland and ethnic solidarity in the name of religion.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary Tibetan people also found it a grand day today, many
of them walked around the lamasery reciting Buddhist scriptures
and made sincere kowtows.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lamasery's lamas, more than 200 Tibetan
people gathered at the courtyard of the lamasery to attend the
board-unveiling ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"A lot more people aspired to attend the ceremony, but the
place is limited," Baiba, mayor of Xigaze City, said.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama has long been engaged in splitting activities
abroad, and in particular he announced a fake reincarnated child
(of the deceased 10th Panchen Lama) last year to overly disrupt
the search for the reincarnation," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Tibetan people made clear Dalai Lama's
purpose to bring calamity to Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism, and
people give more support to the 11th Panchen Lama, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the board-unveiling ceremony, people sang and
danced hand in hand in the courtyard, around which golden roofs of
the lamasery glimmered in the sunshine.

<HEADLINE> Investment Reaches $2.5 Billion in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Investment Office
announced here today that total investment to the tune
of about 2.5 billion Dollars has been approved by the office
since its establishment nearly four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came from Tadese Haile, General Manager of
the Investment Office of Ethiopia when he interviewed with local
press in connection of the 5th anniversary celebration of
the demise of former Mengistu regime.
</P>
<P>
Tadese said that from July, 1992 to January 9, 1996,
2,351 investors with a total capital of about 2.5 billion
Dollars have been certificated to invest in Ethiopia. Of these,
21 projects with a capital of 220 million Dollars constitute
foreign investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that out of the total 2.5 billion Dollars investment,
32 percent is under implementation and operation phase.
</P>
<P>
The major areas that investors chose to invest are, by
magnitude of capital, industry 40 percent, agriculture 15
percent, construction 12 percent and real estate 9.7 percent, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
He said that investors preferred to invest in these sectors
simply because of the pent-up demand for goods and services in
these sectors that were created during the 17 years of the era of
planning economy, when there was little or no private investment
activity.
</P>
<P>
The existing open market economic policy has created an
enabling environment and opened a window of opportunity for
participating in these sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that in order to attract more investment, the
investment office has recently prepared a revised draft
investment code which has been approved by the Council of
Ministers and is awaiting ratification by the parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Panchen Erdini Lozang
Chhoegyad first suggested and encouraged the fifth Dalai Lama to
send a representative to build contacts with the central
government and submit to the authority of the Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Then, the fifth Panchen Lama Erdini Lozang Yeshe was officially
granted the title of Panchen Erdini by the central government, a
move established the political-religious status of the living
buddha of Panchen Lama system.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, bringing tributes, the sixth Panchen Erdini Paldan
Yeshe came to Beijing, and strengthened the close ties between
Tibet and the central government.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the seventh Panchen Erdini Tanpi Nyima
and the eighth Panchen Erdini Tanpi Wangchhug, the Tibetan people
safeguarded the integrity of the Chinese motherland by resisting
foreign invasions.
</P>
<P>
The two Panchen Lamas also advocated and implemented the "29
Article Statutes" set by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The ninth Panchen Erdini Chhoekyi Nyima also led the Tibetan
people to resist British invasions and engage in activities
of publicity against Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
All previous Panchen Lamas have made positive contributions in
consolidating and strengthening the central government's rule over
Tibet, safeguarding the integrity of the motherland's territorial
integrity as well as national unity, and safeguarding the
fundamental interests of the religious believers.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Attract Regional Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government stands
firm on its position to liberalize the establishments of regional
headquarters (RHQS) here and put the Philippines at par with other
countries in the fight for investments.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalino Navarro said today, "we
have to come up with an incentive package to compensate for our
loss in other areas."
</P>
<P>
he said that the additional incentives pushed by the government
are meant to facilitate the entry and exit of RHQS operations.
</P>
<P>
Navarro's pronouncements came after the Department of Finance
expressed its strong opposition to the granting of additional
incentives and called for limiting whatever perks to RHQS to only
five years due to revenue considerations.
</P>
<P>
Under his proposal, RHQS are allowed to do business here with a
10 percent corporate income tax instead of the normal 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Navarro also wants to maintain the existing incentives to RHQS
for tax and duty-free importation of training materials, housing
and personal effects.

<TEXT>
<P>
The 10th Panchen Lama Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain was a great
patriot, famous statesman, faithful friend of the Chinese
Communist Party and an outstanding leader of the Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Before he passed away, the great master often said that his
true wish was to achieve the unity of the motherland and the
unity among different ethnic groups, bring happiness to the
people, promote the progress of Tibet, and build a prosperous
Buddhism as well as a peaceful world.
</P>
<P>
He vowed several times that he would work unremittingly and, if
he cannot fulfill all these goals this life, he will do it in his
next life, the lama once said.
</P>
<P>
He usually taught believers of the Zhaxi Lhunbo lamasery to
love the country and religion, study and practice Buddhism
meticulously, and make unremitting efforts to spread and promote
Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the believers to adhere to the stand of
patriotism, unity and progress, and to firmly oppose separatism
and perverse acts.
</P>
<P>
In this way the Panchen Lama made meritorious contributions to
safeguard national unification and unity among different ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
The Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, the seat of all Panchen Lamas, has a
long tradition of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Historically speaking, lamas and living Buddhas of the lamasery
have made notable contributions in consolidating the relations
between the central government and Tibet, respecting the ultimate
authority of the central government, resisting the invasions of
the Gurkha army and the British imperialists, and safeguarding the
integrity of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
monks have continued to hold the banner of patriotism. Even when a
riot took place in Lhasa, monks in the lamasery resolutely
safeguarded the unity of the motherland and opposed the
separatism, by following Panchen Lama's instructions.
</P>
<P>
In the course of searching for and confirming of the soul boy
of the 10th Panchen Lama, lamas and living Buddhas of the lamasery
contributed their part to completing the work smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Vajpayee Forced to Resign (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- In view of the fact that the odds
are against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies in the
parliament, the 13-day-old BJP government headed by A.B. Vajpayee
announced its resignation on the floor of the Lok Sabha (lower
house) here this evening without waiting for a vote on the
confidence motion tabled by him Monday.
</P>
<P>
The BJP emerged the single largest party in the 11th Lok Sabha
general elections held from April 27 to May 7, winning 160 seats
out of 543 elective seats in the House while the former ruling
Congress Party headed by P.V. Narasimha Rao and the United Front
consisting of 13 regional parties got 136 and 112 seats
respectively. None of the parties could have a working or simple
majority in the hung parliament.
</P>
<P>
The BJP government was set up on May 16 and was asked by Indian
President S.D. Sharma to prove its majority in the parliament
before May 31.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, the BJP and its allies tried their best
to woo regional and smaller parties as well as independents to no
avail. Vajpayee's efforts to set aside controversial issues to
achieve consensus with other parties were also fruitless.
</P>
<P>
The United Front (third front) and the Congress time and again
made it clear that they would vote out the "communal" BJP
government at the earliest.

<P>
MACAO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A dozen experts from south China's
Guangdong Province and Macao jointly started a program today to
probe for ways of economic development in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the Hong Kong and Macao Economic Studies Society of
Guangdong Province and the Macao Economics Science Society, both
non-governmental organizations, started to consult local
organizations of industry and commerce, academic societies,
grassroots organs and government departments of Macao from today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhou Weiping, vice-president of the Guangdong society
and head of the Guangdong team, said that they aim to make some
proposals for decision-making reference for the Macao Government
and certain departments in China after their investigations.
</P>
<P>
"We will conduct a wide range of studies on the economic
development choices of Macao," said Zhou. "We hope our efforts
will be a help for top decision-makers and assist the stable
transition and economic prosperity of Macao before 1999."
</P>
<P>
Their studies will mainly be on the soft investment environment
of Macao, with such topics as the role of Macao in linking China's
mainland and the European Union, the role of Macao across the
Taiwan Straits following the opening of quasi-direct air flights
across the straits, Macao's economic and trade relations with
China's mainland cities following the opening of air routes and
the relations between Macao and Zhuhai, and further with the Pearl
River Delta, Hong Kong and Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that they will complete the investigations
in June and make the final report by the end of the year.

<P>
Four years ago, the BJP had only four parliamentary seats and
was a regional party. The party has expanded very fast over the
past few years under the banner against corruption and for
"Hinduism". Over 70 percent of the Indian people are Hindu. The
BJP regarded the Congress government as the "most corrupted
government in Indian history".
</P>
<P>
With the exception of four years, the Congress has ruled the
country since independence in 1947, and the people wanted a change
of government.
</P>
<P>
The United Front and the Congress regarded the Hindu
nationalist BJP government as dangerous because of its
divide-and-rule policy. The feeling of insecurity prevailed among
minorities. They said the BJP government intended to impose a "one
language-one culture-one religion uniformity" throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The United Front and the Congress in the past two weeks made
great efforts to consolidate themselves and work out common
strategies to pull down the Vajpayee "communal" government and
form a "secular" government headed by Karnataka Chief Minister and
leader of the United Front Deve Gowda, with the support of the
Congress from the outside.
</P>
<P>
Congress senior leader Sharad Pawar said here this evening that
 Vajpayee should have had the courage to face parliament and take
the confidence vote. "I am happy he has resigned. Now it is our
collective responsibility to provide a stable government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, people here still doubt whether the United Front and the
Congress with divergent views and ideologies could provide a
stable government. Some reports said that mid-term poll is
expected at any time.

TOKYO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a 40-day high of
108.60 yen in Tokyo today under the continuing influence at
subsided expectations of higher Japanese interest rates.

<P>
The dollar went above the 108 yen line for the first time since

108.17-20 yen at 9 a.m. It was changed hands between 107.90 yen
and 108.60 yen during the day session.
</P>

Meanwhile, the dollar's strength against the yen caused market
players to buy shares on the stock market, prompting stock prices
to bounce back strongly.

<HEADLINE> Mandela on Former President Botha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- People should not
underestimate the good that former state President P. W. Botha
has done for a new South Africa, President Nelson Mandela has
said.
</P>
<P>
A local daily "the Citizen" today quoted Mandela as saying in
an interview with Radio Good Hope in Cape Town on Monday that Mr.
Botha has been very cooperative in "helping to solve problems".
</P>
<P>
P. W. Botha was state president of South Africa from 1984 to
1989.
</P>
<P>
On his relationship with Botha, which included a historic
meeting in July 1989 when Mandela was still a political prisoner,
Mandela said a joint statement had been released whereby both
pledged to promote peace and unity in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
When right-wing violence threatened the stability of the
country, Mandela traveled to Botha's home in George of Western
Cape to remind the former president of that pact. He also held
discussions with Botha when former Defense Minister Magnus Malan
was arrested last year.
</P>
<P>
Botha's cooperation was particularly helpful during the
right-wing pre-election bombings, said Mandesa.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed that Botha has been "very good
quietly" and has done much good for the country in the democratic
transformation.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Sunken Ship's Captain Attempts Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Captain Jumanne Rume who
commanded the tragedy-hit ship, attempted to commit suicide
Monday by jumping from the eighth floor of Bugando hospital where
he is admitted, the local paper "the Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police officials and Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC)
sources were quoted as saying that the captain has been placed
under arrest following the attempt. He is now under detention in
a special ward at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The suicide attempt is being explained that it arises from
suspicions that the captain was not on duty when the vessel
capsized.
</P>
<P>
Certain sources said Capt. Rume was probably out of the ship's
control room when it capsized.
</P>
<P>
The captain may have found it difficult to face the public if
the charges were to be corroborated, that gross negligence on his
part led to the loss of more than 500 lives.
</P>
<P>
The ship, which sank 30 meters deep had 25 crew men when it
went down. About half of them died.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzania government has directed the TRC to
suspend seven senior officials of the marine division based in
Mwanza pending investigations of the Bukoba accident.

ADDIS ABABA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's import and export
trade has registered a sharp increase over the period of the
previous regime, Minister of Trade and Industry Kassahun Ayele
has said.
</P>
<P>
The import trade was 999,000 birr (399,600 U.S. Dollars)
during the previous government but it has now jumped to 5.2
billion Birr (821.5 million Dollars) while the export which
was 239,200 Dollars has now grown to 3.1 billion Birr (489.7
million), Ayele disclosed.

the minister said taking full advantage of the new market
oriented policy, the number of private investors engaged in
import-export trade have risen from 3,000 to 21,000.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the industrial sector, the minister said the
government has subsidized with 108 million dollars public
enterprises, which stoped functioning or operated below capacity
for the shortage of raw materials and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
He said these factories have now increased their utilization
of production capacity to 75 percent because of the government help.
</P>

Due to a free commodity exchange prevailing in the country the
rate of inflation has been brought down from 20 percent in 1992
to below 10 percent at present, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Industrial Production Records High Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's industrial production
increased 11.9 percent last year, the highest since the 13.2
percent recorded in 1988, according to figures released by the
National Statistical Office today.
</P>
<P>
Heavy industry posted an overall 15.8-percent rise, with
semiconductors growing 48.1 percent, office equipment 39.4
percent, machinery 17.4 percent and automobiles 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Light industry, however, only managed to increase 0.9 percent,
lower than the 3.1 percent registered in 1994. A sharp decline in
leather, textile and footwear exports were blamed for the
lackluster increase in production.
</P>
<P>
As a result, light industrial output, expressed as a percentage
of the manufacturing sector's gross production, fell from 34.1
percent in 1990 to 23.9 last year, continuing the trend of an
ever-widening gap in growth between heavy and light industries.
</P>
<P>
Light industry factory shipments increased a meager 0.4-percent
due to a 6.8-percent fall in exports, while heavy industry posted
a wholesome overall growth of 12.6 percent on the strength of a
28.4-percent rise in exports and a 19.7-percent increase in
domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing production capacity increased 9.3 percent thanks
to a 23.3-percent rise in capital investments in 1994, and
factories also operated at an average 82.5 percent of capacity
last year.
</P>
<P>
After industrial production increased nearly 12 percent last
year, inventory also jumped 14.9 percent, the highest since the
19.1 percent recorded in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Be Creative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong said today that Singaporeans must be creative in
order to cope with future challenges.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a Creative Arts Seminar, Lee said,
"our standards of living are higher than many developed countries.
Yet we lack the strength of resilience of developed countries like
the United States, Japan, and Germany."
</P>
<P>
He said creativity cannot be confined to a small elite group of
Singaporeans, such as a few policy-makers, academics, and top
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
In today's rapidly changing world, the whole work force needs
problem- solving skills, so that every worker can continuously add
value through his efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To cope with national challenges, individual Singaporeans must
understand what is at stake and respond intelligently," he urged,
adding, "they cannot just follow their leaders without thinking or
understanding."
</P>
<P>
In order to foster creativity, Lee said that in addition to
innate talent, which sets a natural limit to how creative one can
be, the social environment should encourage and reward innovation,
while a sound education system should be there to stretch the
students' creative potential.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets European Parliament Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen this afternoon welcomed a delegation from the
European Parliament in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's mission is to discuss relations with China and
is headed by Stefano Deluca. The two sides exchanged opinions on
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to the European guests, Qian said that
Sino-European relations date back to ancient times and the two
sides enjoy different traditional cultures.
</P>
<P>
Under the new situation, both sides believe that it is
necessary to enhance mutual understanding and bilateral relations
through exchange visits and other contact, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China adopts an independent foreign policy
of peace while dealing with relations with countries all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that after the Cold War, the two military
blocs and the two super powers no longer exist, and China holds
that the world should be a multipolar and diverse one, and
regional economic cooperation should be furthered.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Qian noted that all the countries in the world
share common points, while they are facing different problems and
have different characteristics.
</P>
<P>
As to most developing countries, he noted, the priority is
their people's rights to subsistence and development.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon economic and trade relations, Qian said that
except Hong Kong, the European Union (EU) is China's third largest
trade partner in the world, second to Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
There is great potential for economic and trade cooperation
between China and the EU, said Qian, hoping for a strengthening of
Sino-EU economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Deluca said that the European Parliament attaches importance to
its relations with China, advocating more exchanges and
cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member delegation arrived in China on Sunday at the
invitation of the China-European Parliament Friendship Group.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Facing Challenge in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Next Monday will be the school
opening day for the 40,000 elementary and secondary schools in the
Philippines, but the shortage of teachers and classrooms is posing
a serious problem in the new semester.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, President Fidel Ramos has put it on the
top agenda of today's weekly cabinet meeting in Malacanang.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the president approved the release of some
1.96 billion pesos (75 million US dollars) by The Philippine
Department of Education, Culture and Sports' (DECS) reserve funds,
for the hiring of new public school teachers and the building of
additional classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 865 million pesos (33 million US dollars) will
be used for the hiring of new teachers while the remaining 1.1
billion pesos (42 million US dollars) will be spent on school
buildings and classrooms.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from DECS, about 17 million students in
the elementary and secondary levels nationwide are expected to
troop to the country's 40,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
This represents an overall increase of more than 900,000
students compared with last school year due to the policy of
lowering grade one entry age from seven to six.
</P>
<P>
Given the projected enrollment, some 9,800 additional teachers
will be needed in the elementary schools, but the DECS can only
provide 5,274 teachers, according to Education Secretary Ricardo
Gloria.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the problem, the DECS has decided to require
principals and head teachers to teach at least two teaching loads,
recall all teachers who are engaged in non-teaching duties, and
organize multi-grade classes in small remote schools.
</P>

"Through these measures, we hope to reduce the shortage of
teachers to a certain degree," Gloria said.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary, the situation in the high schools
is also serious with a shortage of 4,566 teachers for the new
semester because the 1996 budget can only support 4,873 teachers
of the total requirement of 9,439 teachers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the supply of textbooks also remains a problem as
more than 22 million textbooks for the new semester (from June to
December) will not come to schools before September.

<HEADLINE> Golden Board Presented by President Jiang Zemin Unveiled in Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held in the Zhaxi
Lhunbo Lamasery in Xigaze today to unveil a golden inscribed board
with words "Safeguard the Country and Benefit the People",
presented by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The board was unveiled by Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and
Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Raidi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Tibet Regional People's Congress, said that when
the 11th Panchen Lama was enthroned on December 8, 1995, President
Jiang Zemin wrote the inscription of "Safeguard the Country and
Benefit the People" for the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, the seat of the
Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The inscription serves as a high assessment of all
previous Panchen Lamas and the glorious patriotic tradition of the
Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery. It has also charted the orientation of
advance for the 11th Panchen Lama, the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery,
patriotic figures from the Tibetan Buddhism community and all
religious believers."
</P>
<P>
The inscription draws on the true meaning of Buddhism, praises
religious believers of various ethnic groups for their patriotic
tradition of safeguarding national unity and wishing their
motherland prosperity and the people in peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also reflects the supreme authority of China's central
government to administer Tibet, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, under the new historical conditions, the
inscription provides rich ideological contents and profound
political significance which are compatible with socialist
society," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "Safeguard the Country and Benefit the
People" means that religious believers and non-believers should
become united under the banner of patriotism and socialism and
unswervingly safeguard China's unity and national unity among the
people of various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
It requires patriotic figures from the religious community and
religious believers to sincerely support the leadership of the
CPC, and safeguard China's state sovereignty and the authority of
the central authorities.

<HEADLINE> US Wastes Shipments to Developing Countries Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States' shipments of
harmful waste to developing countries is a case of shifting their
troubles onto others.
</P>
<P>
Exporting harmful waste is a violation of human rights and
international conventions, said a signed article in today's
Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basel Convention signed in 1990, developed
countries are barred from exporting dangerous waste to developing
countries for final treatment.
</P>
<P>
The convention, after being revised by more than 100 countries
and regions in 1995, forbids developed countries to transfer
pollution by pouring and piling harmful waste in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The article said the United States, as a member of
international community, should abide by international practice
and social moral principles by putting an end to exporting waste.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the United States has clamored to protect
human rights and given prominence to "environmental diplomacy."
"What the United States says, however, does not accord with its
deeds," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The largest garbage producer in the world, the United States is
also the number one garbage exporter on the earth. It exported
nearly 10 million tons of waste to developing countries in Asia,
Africa, Europe and Latin America in 1995, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years China has discovered hundreds of tons
of foreign waste exported to Beijing, Shanghai, and east China
port city Qingdao and Hainan Province in south China. And all the
garbage originated from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Containers intercepted at the Qingdao Customs contained dirty
plastic bags, sewage, pieces of waste fabric, used disposable
syringes, discarded pill bottles, worn rubber gloves, and
unidentified white powder.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Customs has intercepted 20 containers containing
hazardous solid waste, and has ordered the US companies that
shipped the waste to China to return it to its place of origin.

It also stresses the need to guide religion to adapt to
socialist society, and safeguard the interests of the country and
of the people.
</P>
<P>
"China will by no means tolerate any splittist activities by
the Dalai group in exile under the cover of religion and with the
backing of foreign hostile forces, which are intended to oppose
the Party leadership, endanger national sovereignty, and negate
the supreme authority of the central authorities over Tibet," he
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
He called on all patriotic Tibetan Buddhists to take a firm and
clear-cut stand over matters of principle and to fight resolutely
against the splittist activities of the Dalai group.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the autonomous region will implement the
party's religious policy in an all-round and correct way,
strengthen the management of religious affairs according to law,
guide religion to adapt to the socialist society, and unite all
Tibetan people to achieve the common objective of building the
modernized socialist nation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, only by upholding the dignity of the laws, defending
public interests and unity among the people of various ethnic
groups, and safeguarding the country's unity, can all religious
believers and temples be good to the country and the people, be
good to national development and social progress, and be also good
to their own benefits and progress, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Cering, chairman of the Democratic Management
Committee of the Zhaxi Lhunbo lamasery, expressed sincere thanks
to President Jiang Zemin on behalf of the committee and lamas and
living buddhas of the lamasery.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that in accordance with President Jiang's inscription,
his lamasery will make its due contributions to the unity of the
motherland, the unity among the people of various ethnic groups,
carrying forward the Tibetan Buddhism's tradition of loving the
motherland and the religion, and building the new Tibet that will
still be more united and prosperous.
</P>
<P>
The golden board, three meters long and 1.3 meters wide, is to
be hung above the gate of the lamasery's main hall.
</P>
<P>
Today's ceremony was attended by 1,000 Buddhist believers and
nonbelievers.

<HEADLINE> HK Announces Estimates of US Special 301 Action Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government today
announced its broad estimates of the potential adverse impact of
US Special 301 Action on Hong Kong's economy, urging the United
States and China to find a satisfactory solution to the IPR
dispute through dialogue and discussion.
</P>
<P>
On May 15, the US government published a three billion US
dollars preliminary retaliation list targeting Chinese exports to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
In responses, the Chinese government announced a list of
counter-retaliatory measures, to be implemented at the same time
as the US retaliation.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Hong Kong government said that if both sides
carried out their sanction threat, approximately 5.3 percent, or
13.4 billion HK dollars, of Hong Kong's re-export trade involving
China and the United States could be lost.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 11,500 jobs in Hong Kong could also be lost
and GDP growth could be reduced by about 0.4 percentage point
in the year of incidence.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are therefore passing our assessment to the
Chinese and US governments, together with a request that they take
into account Hong Kong's interests in any decisions they may
take."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the assessment has not taken into
account Hong Kong people's investments in China because the Hong
Kong Government has no accurate information on them.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, given the substantial Hong Kong investment in
the manufacturing industry in Southern China, there is reason to
believe that the negative impact on Hong Kong would be greater
than currently assessed.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Major Viewpoints of Peres and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 3.9 million Israeli voters are
expected to cast their ballots Wednesday to elect, directly for
the first time, the prime minister, in addition to the 120-seat
Knesset (parliament). The elections, regarded as the most fateful
in the 48 years history of the Jewish state, will set the course
of the country and the current Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following are the major viewpoints expressed in the election
campaigns by the only two candidates for the premiership: Shimon
Peres, the incumbent prime minister from the Labor party, and his
challenger Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud bloc:
</P>
<P>
Shimon Peres:
</P>
<P>
-- Pledges to achieve a comprehensive peace in the Middle East
in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
-- Favors the land-for-peace principle, but says the Israeli
side will take a tough stance in peace negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
-- Opposes expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
__ Shows no opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian
state, but pledges he will never divide Jerusalem, while agreeing
to bargain with the Palestinians over the holy city's final status.
</P>
<P>
-- Sees Islamic fundamentalism led by Iran as the most
dangerous enemy to the Jewish state in a post-cold war era.
</P>
<P>
-- Believes that peacemaking will bring economic prosperity to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu:
</P>
<P>
-- Voices willingness to continue Arab-Israeli peace process
but rejects the principle of land-for-peace, refuses to cede more
land to the Palestinians and rules out the return of the Golan
Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
-- Strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
-- Only agrees to grant the Palestinians limited autonomy with
the Palestinians controlling every aspect of their lives except
for foreign policy and security.
</P>
<P>
-- Says he will give Israeli troops the freedom to enter
Palestinian-controlled areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
pursuit of suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
-- Promises to expand the Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza and considers building new ones.
</P>
<P>
-- Holds that Jerusalem will remain Israel's united and eternal
capital and its status is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
-- Says that the peace factor in boosting Israel's economic
development is exaggerated by Peres.
</P>
<P>
The two differ little on other issues like the economy -- with
both promising privatization of state-owned companies. Both
advocate strong ties with the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- This capital of Hainan Province in
South China, has become a favored place for overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The city approved 69 overseas-funded enterprises in the first
four months of this year, involving a total contractual investment
of 237.95 million US dollars. The actual investment already used
was 98.976 million US dollars, an increase of 23.8 percent over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
An official of the city's economic co-operation bureau said
that most of the projects are connected with industry and
suburban agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Companies from Hong Kong and Taiwan maintain the lead in
such investment.
</P>
<P>
At present, Haikou has 5,400 overseas-funded enterprises. Their
gross output value in the first four months of this year amounted
to 149.74 million yuan, sales income climbed to 140.21 million
yuan, and exports were valued at 13.15 million US dollars, up 53
percent, 48 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively, over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the good result to the city's daily
improving investment conditions, better services and healthy
profits earned by overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Syria Shows Caution About Israeli Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian capital of Damascus, is
in an atmosphere of caution in anticipation of the outcome of the
Israeli general election on Wednesday in which the prime minister
will be directly elected for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has been holding start-and-stop peace peace talks
with Israel since 1991, gives considerable attention to this
election as its results will affect the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syrian newspapers today accused the Israeli society of being
racist and of not accepting the idea of peace, saying that both
the Labor Party and the Likud bloc adhere to aggression and
expansionism, and that the differences between their positions on
key political issues have vanished.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara Monday attacked Likud
leader Benjamin Netanyahu for intransigence on the Syrian Golan
Heights and other occupied Arab territories, describing the recent
statements made by the Likud leader in this connection as a
declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
"The one who claims there is a possibility to achieve security
and peace, together with keeping the Golan Heights and other
occupied Arab territories, is a warmonger," said al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
"Adopting this policy would certainly destroy the chances of
peace in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
This was the first Syrian official comment on the Israeli
general election.
</P>
<P>
Political observers hold that the Arab states which have
established peace with Israel hope that Shimon Peres, the
incumbent prime minister, will win the upcoming election, and that
the U.S. government bets on Peres' stay in power so that the
peace process, especially on the Syrian-Israeli track, can resume.
</P>
<P>
Syria thinks that its differences with the Labor government on
the fate of the strategically important Golan Heights remains
unsettled, yet political observers are of the opinion that the
Labor party is more capable of making concessions than the Likud
bloc.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that the Likud's winning of the election
would be a blow to the peace process and to the endeavors made by
the United States to complete this process, they added.
</P>
<P>
Most Arab states think that the stay of Peres in power means
that the peace process will go ahead, whereas the Likud leader's
victory means that the peace process will recede.
</P>
<P>
Syria thinks that peace would never be established in the
Middle East unless Israel gives up its hostility and hatred toward
the Arabs.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior executive of the Danfoss
Group, a Denmark-based transnational corporation engaged in
high-tech product manufacturing, said he is confident about
investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Ole Steel Andersen, vice-president of the corporation, said
this after inspecting the Wuqing Development Zone in this major
industrial base in north China. Danfoss has set up a branch
factory there.
</P>
<P>
"China will see rapid development in the next five to ten
years, and we will develop together with it by setting up
factories in the country," said Andersen, adding that his company
will build a comprehensive system in China covering technical
development, manufacturing and after-sale service in the coming
few years.
</P>
<P>
The Danfoss Group began its co-operation with China by setting
up offices in Beijing and Shanghai at the beginning of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Then in 1995 it spent 22.5 million US dollars building a solely
foreign-funded enterprise in Tianjin to manufacture thermostats
and turbine compressors. Andersen noted that the factory is the
largest in Asia so far set up by the company.
</P>
<P>
Founded in the 1940s, the company now has branches and agents in
more than 100 countries and regions worldwide. Its annual sales
volume is some two billion US dollars.

NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Atal Behari Vajpayee resigned
today as Indian prime minister with the shortest tenure so far.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, veteran leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
was sworn in as India's tenth prime minister on May 16, heading a
BJP-Shiv sena coalition with a strength of just 194 seats, far
short of the 269-seat simple majority.
</P>
<P>
During the past 13 days, the Vajpayee government tried its best
to seek support from some regional parties but failed.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee announced the resignation of his government on the
floor of the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) at the end of
two-day heated debate on a confidence motion moved by him Monday.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his replying address, Vajpayee said since he did not
have the majority he was going to the presidential residence to
give his resignation to the president.
</P>
<P>
Speaker P.A. Sangma immediately adjourned the House, saying
that the confidence motion had now become infructuous with the
prime minister announcing his resignation on the floor of the

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
political advisor Ahmed al-Tibi has expressed objection to Israeli
Prime Minister's Shimon Peres' recent statement that Jerusalem
would remain Israel's united capital.
</P>
<P>
Tibi, in an interview with the Cairo-based Sawt al-Arab (Voice
of Arabs) Radio broadcast today, said Jerusalem is part of the
Palestinian territory and the issue of Jerusalem is due to be
discussed in the Palestinian-Israeli talks for a final settlement,
which opened on May 5 and are expected to resume after the Israeli
general elections scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Peres, in his TV debate Sunday night with his right-wing
challenger Benjamin Netanyahu in the elections, pledged that he
would never divide Jerusalem though he said that he would achieve
a comprehensive Middle East peace in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want to establish an independent Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Israelis will go to the polls to elect a
120-member Knesset (Parliament) and a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Tibi said in the interview that among the Palestinians living
in Israel, 44,000 are eligible for voting in the elections,
considered to be very crucial to the future of Middle East peace.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Visits Chechnya, Announces Military Pull-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Part of the Russian troops in
Chechnya will pull out of that breakaway republic, President Boris
Yeltsin said today shortly after arriving in Chechen capital
Grozny, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to complete a withdrawal of formations and
units of the Moscow, Leningrad, Privolzhye and Ural military
regions to their permanent bases by September 1, 1996," Yeltsin
told a public meeting in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president arrived in the Chechen capital one day
after reaching an agreement with Chechen rebel leaders on a
ceasefire and exchange of hostages and prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Yeltsin visited the Russian military base in
Mozdok, from where he flew to Grozny and stopped at the Chechen
village of Pravoberezhnoye near Grozny.
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.
</P>
<P>
It is Yeltsin's first visit to breakaway Chechnya since war
broke out in December 1994, when Moscow sent troops to the
Caucasian republic to crush a three-year-old secessionist movement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached in Moscow on Monday, Russia and
Chechnya will end fighting from midnight Friday and to free
prisoners within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
But the agreement did not touch the core issue of Chechyna's
political status. Russia has repeatedly rejected Chechen demand
for independence.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the talks between a Russian delegation headed by
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the Chechen separatist team
led by rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev are still continuing.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is expected to make a major speech on Chechnya's future
when he visits the 205th motorized rifle brigade on the outskirts
of Grozny.

GUANGZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Replicas of a 2,000-year-old
ancient gold seal are to be issued in this capital city of south
China's Guangdong Province to mark the 2210th anniversary of the
city's founding.
</P>
<P>
The seal was made in the West Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- 24 A.D.)
for a king of the Nanyue kingdom in what is now Guangdong and
Guangxi provinces. Made of pure gold and with a dragon-shape knob,
it is said to be the earliest and largest royal seal ever found in
the world.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2210 replicas of the 22k gold seal will be made,
each weighing 55 grams. The reproduction process will be
supervised by a local museum where the original seal is kept.
</P>
<P>
A source with the municipal government here said that the first
200 replicas had been completed, and the government had given
permission to the city to sell seals to some celebrities in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
All the funds collected through the sales of the replicas will
be used for the anniversary celebration, as well as local public
welfare.

<HEADLINE> Radio, TV Stations for All Major Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Major ethnic groups in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have radio and
television programs in their own languages, according to a local
senior official in charge of the broadcast sector.
</P>
<P>
Bawudun Kadir, deputy director of the Radio and Television
Department of the autonomous region, said that all major ethnic
groups with a population above 100,000 have local radio and
television stations broadcasting programs in their own languages.
</P>
<P>
"The Xinjiang People's Radio broadcasts in five languages,
namely, Uygur, Chinese, Kazak, Mongolian, and Kirgiz, while the
Xinjiang TV has programs in Uygur, Chinese, and Kazak," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kadir, Xinjiang now has 26 TV stations, 348 relay
stations, 971 satellite ground stations, and 451 cable television
centers, while small broadcast stations have been set up in most
counties and villages.
</P>
<P>
"There are a total of 97 sets of radio and TV programs with 584
hours of broadcast time every day, covering more than 70 percent
of the population," he added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the central government has invested heavily in
Xinjiang's broadcast industry, he said, building a 5,000-sq-m
broadcast control center and a 20,000-sq-m TV drama production and
translation center.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region's TV programs have achieved
round-the-clock broadcast via satellite, while satellite
transmission of its radio programs is still in the experimental
stage, he added.

<P>
He said that during the past decade, a total of 55.6 million
yuan (6.7 US dollars) has been spent to raise the broadcast
coverage in border areas.
</P>
<P>
"Now the radio coverage in border areas has grown from 34
percent in 1982 to 80 percent, and the TV coverage from 54 percent
in 1985 to 70 percent," he said, adding that in all these
areas programs in Chinese and in other ethnic languages are
broadcast on different channels.
</P>
<P>
He said that ethnic groups in Xinjiang also have been allowed
to set up a number of TV drama translation units, which form a
translation network across the autonomous region, as well as audio
and video publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1995, they had translated more than 2,000 movies
and TV dramas into Uygur and Kazak, and produced over 1.4 million
cassette tapes in ethnic languages like Uygur, Kazak, Mongolian,
and Kirgiz," he said.
</P>
<P>
To promote the development of local broadcast sector, he said,
the autonomous region has trained a large number of officials,
reporters, editors, and technicians from various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"Over 60 percent of our employees, as well as 59 percent of
technicians with senior professional titles, come from ethnic
groups," he noted. "And some 70 percent of programs in Uygur,
Kazak, and Mongolian are purely our own production instead of
translation."

HONG KONG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong
Kong's flag carrier, announced today that it will terminate
on-line services to Stockholm starting from July 1, 1996.
</P>

The termination of the service is based on purely commercial
reasons, due to limited demand and costs, said a spokeswoman for
Cathay.
</P>
<P>
Christina Siaw, manager of European Routes, said: "There is
only a limited demand for this service and in today's highly
competitive market it does not make commercial sense to continue
with the route. We have therefore decided to reallocate resources
to serve greater demand for other European routes."
</P>
<P>
She added that all other European routes will continue to
perform to expectations and Cathay will continue to offer
comprehensive services on other European destinations.
</P>

Presently Cathay Pacific has flights to 46 destinations in 27
countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> APEC Sets New Concept of Development Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) adopted a new concept of development
cooperation, which focuses on the sharing of resources instead of
transfer of financial resources.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing after the four-day second APEC senior
officials' meeting (SOM) in Cebu, Philippine Foreign Affairs
Undersecretary Federico Macaranas, this year's SOM chair, said
development cooperation in APEC veers away from the traditional
donor-donee relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said development cooperation means partners group together,
undertake a project and get equal benefits.
</P>
<P>
As to the danger of one country being reduced to the role of
supplier of labor, Macaranas said since the cooperation involves
more than two participants in which transparency is vital, the
danger of getting the shorter end of the bargain is reduced.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the 1996 Manila Action Plan for APEC
(MAPA'96), which will be finalized during the leaders' meeting in
Subic this November, is expected to make development cooperation
more meaningful to the inhabitants of the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Writes Song for Three Gorges Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Even the Chinese premier had a
poetic mood for the world's largest dam.
</P>
<P>
The "Song of Yangtze," a musical work written by Li Peng a year
ago to praise the Three Gorges Dam Project, debuted early this
month at a concert in Beijing and stunned the audience, according
to Musical Life newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In his lyrics, the premier praised the beautiful scenery of the
Three Gorges, as well as the long-awaited, world-class dam being
built there that is expected to "benefit thousands of generations."
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the ten-sentence work was given to Nu Yuan, one of the
country's most renowned composers who then transposed it to music.
</P>
<P>
"The poem has a profound meaning, and it is a real musical work
itself," Nu Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
The paper carried the full context of the work, that begins,
"Beneath the towering Kunlun Mountains, the endless Yangtze flows
to the east. Gazing at the vast fields and rivers of Sichuan, we
find outstanding people everywhere just like stars twinkling in
the space."
</P>
<P>
Yang Hongji, who led the chorus, said that Li's words are
sensitive and truthful. "I was filled with passion whenever I sang
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam project is aimed at harnessing and
developing the Yangtze River, creating technology for flood
prevention, generating electricity and boosting river shipping.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 1,983 meter long, 185 meter high dam
was started at the end of 1994, and the first system of generating
units is expected to turn out power in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese leaders have written poems to laud the dam, among
the most famous was a piece written 30 years ago by the late
Chairman Mao Zedong, who said the future dam will "cut off clouds
and rainfalls in the Wushan valley (The Three Gorges)".

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Downtown Factories to Be Moved for City Expansion (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the readjustment program, Shanghai has encouraged the
development of new industries which are technology-intensive and
will show good economic returns and have a promising future.
</P>
<P>
Six backbone industries such as automobiles and
telecommunications will turn out 60 percent of the city's total
industrial output value by the year 2010 instead of 45 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The relocation program will leave more land for trade and
commerce, real estate, finance and communications. When the
program is completed, the city proper will occupy 70 sq. km of
land with 30 sq. km being devoted to business and commerce, said
Le Yanming, an official from the municipal planning commission.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, service trades will make up 60 to 65 percent of
the total output value by the year 2010 instead of the 40.1
percent in 1995, said Wang Sanqian, another official from the
commission.
</P>
<P>
The relocation program is now under way in Shanghai with 110
factories being moved to the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
As the 15-year program involves many aspects of life, municipal
government departments are busy drafting plans and preferential
policy measures to guide the relocating, said an official from the
municipal economic commission.
</P>
<P>
As the massive relocation program is going on, it has
attracted the attention of overseas investors. A number of
overseas businessmen have already participated in the program by
way of developing real estate projects, storage facilities, and
trade and commerce services as well as the construction of new
factory sites. A Japanese enterprise has recently poured in 40
million US dollars to start a wool textile plant with a Shanghai
firm.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai must conform with the strategic requirements of the
country, said Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai, adding it must
develop new city functions and operate as an international
business center.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Downtown Factories to Be Moved for City Expansion (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 28 (Xinhua)-- Shanghai Continental Pharmaceutical
Plant, China's oldest western medicine producer, has agreed to
move from bustling downtown Shanghai to the city's outskirts to
make room for a de luxe apartment and office building.
</P>
<P>
The 89-year-old factory was originally located on Huaihai Road
on a little more than one hectare of land. Now, it's new workshops
occupy a land of 7.7 hectares, which is ten kilometers away from
the city proper.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the relocation, the plant's output value is
expected to reach 250 million yuan, and see a profit of 31
million yuan, a marked rise over last year.
</P>
<P>
"The move has provided the factory with greater room for
development and it has given way to Shanghai's urban expansion,"
said Xu Guiqing, deputy director of the pharmaceutical plant.
</P>
<P>
The company is not the only one to be moved from downtown
Shanghai. With an ambitious plan to build China's largest
industrial city into an international, economic, financial and
trade center, Shanghai plans to relocate its more than 3,000
industrial factories in the city proper in the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, one third of the factories will be moved
to its outskirts or neighboring provinces by the year 2010, and
another one third will be encouraged to undertake service trades,
and the rest will remain as urban industries.
</P>
<P>
For more than a century, industrial enterprises have been
critical to Shanghai's prosperity and China's economic
development. In view of Shanghai's decision to turn it into an
international economic, financial and trade center, the Chinese
government puts high hopes on the city, hoping it will contribute
more to China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Relocating the factories would provide an excellent chance for
the city in this regard, said Chen Ying, an official from Shanghai
Economic Commission, who is responsible for the relocation program.
</P>
<P>
Fierce market competition has compelled Shanghai's industrial
enterprises to reorganize themselves and reconsider their size,
structure and technological renovation so that they can remain
ever successful, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli Election Campaign Ends with No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The three-month Israeli election
campaign grounded to a halt today, but pollsters saw no clear
winner between incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres and his
challenger Binjamin Netanyahu one day ahead of Wednesday's
elections.
</P>
<P>
The televised political commercials for the candidates and
parties ended Monday night, and the emphasis was shifted on the
last day to getting voters to vote. Polls published today show
that the gap between Peres and Netanyahu has narrowed to only 3
percent which is seen a virtual tie because it is smaller than the
4 percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
A poll released by Geocartographia head Avi Degani showed that
Peres was ahead of Netanyahu, the opposition Likud party's leader,
by 50.5 percent to 47.5 percent. A Hanoch and Rafi Smith poll had
similar findings of 50 percent to 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
The polls were conducted on Sunday before and after Peres and
Netanyhau held a much-watched half-hour televised face-to-face
debate, deemed as the climax of the relatively dull and drowsy
election campaign between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
Peres, leader of the ruling Labor party, exchanged fires with
his hardline rival in the debate on key issues, including
Jerusalem, terrorism, peace and security. Both tried their best to
woo the floating voters, remaining at relatively high of over 6
percent, who may decide the outcome of the tight race.
</P>
<P>
Peres, one of the chief architects of the ongoing Israeli-Arab
peace process, focused on conveying a message of hope and
strength, while Netanyahu stressed the fear of terrorism and his
new policy to seek security through peace.
</P>
<P>
While both Labor and Likud camps claimed their victory, many
voters may be left unimpressed by the debate which produced no
surprise. It seemed that Netanyahu, the 46-year-old ambitious
challenger, scored more points than Peres as it provided him a
chance to demonstrate his leadership and ability.
</P>
<P>
Peres had been holding a slim five-point lead over Netanyahu
before the debate. In early February, Peres decided to advance the
elections from October to May after polls showed he was leading by
over 15 percentage points over Netanyahu since the assassination
of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a radical Jew in last
November.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who enjoys broad support among the country's over
one million Orthodox Jews, had witnessed the erosion of his
support as he was blamed for mounting a hatred campaign that led
to Rabin's killing. But he managed to bridge the gap after
anti-peace Islamic terrorist suicide bombers killed 58 people from
February 25 to March 4.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps overshadowed by Rabin's killing and the terrorist
attacks, this year's election campaign has been relatively
low-profile with the rival sides focusing mainly on issuing
election stickers, putting up street posters and broadcasting TV
commercials. The Labor and Likud parties even agreed last week to
cancel the last day mass rallies for financial and security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, over 3.9 million Israeli voters will cast their
ballots to elect, directly for the first time, the prime minister
in addition to the 120-seat Knesset, or Parliament. The polls,
regarded as the most fateful in the 48-year history of the Jewish
state, will set the course of the country and the current Middle
East peace process for years to come.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Capital Clouded in Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's capital Ulan Bator
today is blanketed with thick smoke from forest fires which have
been raging across the country for five weeks, causing 24
casualties and making thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
Clouds of smoke from a forest blaze about 100 kilometers north
of Ulan Bator began to surround the capital Monday evening. At
present, there is no sign that the smoke would recede.
</P>
<P>
According to a special state committee, by local time 07:00
a.m. Tuesday, there were still 42 large fires raging in Mongolia,
and the total number of forest and grassland fires which spread
across the country in the past five months have increased to 345.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the fires in the northern Selenge
province and the central Tov province were the worst.
</P>
<P>
They added that concerned departments are considering new
measures to deal with the fires.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of firefighters have been struggling to put out the
roaring fires which have destroyed more than 80,000 square
kilometers of forests and pastureland, but are unsuccessful due to
poor equipment.
</P>
<P>
Damage caused by the fires was estimated at 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars, a heavy blow to the Mongolian economy.

<HEADLINE> Expanded Folklore Culture Park to be Reopened in Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A 70-year-old folklore culture park
in this Hubei Province capital has been modernized and is now the
largest entertainment and shopping center in central China.
</P>
<P>
The Minzhong Amusement Park, featuring traditional Chinese
entertainment programs, had been one of the three symbols of
Wuhan, since it opened in 1919. Other noted attractions are the
renowned Huanghe (yellow crane) Pavilion and Guiyuan Temple.
</P>
<P>
Renovations were made possible by a 38 million US dollar
investment from Singapore, and local funding, sources said. The
park has been expanded to 40,000 square meters, and now can
accommodate a flow of one million tourists daily.
</P>
<P>
The new property offers more diversified programs, ranging from
traditional Chinese stage operas to modern electrical amusements,
film shows, disco, and shopping.

<HEADLINE> Bonded Zones Best Channels for Entering China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Bonded zones have proved to be the
most convenient channels of access for foreign firms to China
since it adjusted its foreign trade regulations and tariff rates
on April 1.
</P>
<P>
"Preferential policies in the bonded zones have remained as
before," said Wang Haiping, a senior official with the Bonded Zone
in north China's Tianjin Port.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the adjustment has given prominence to the bonded
zones' advantages, especially in the fields of the service trades
and export and import handling."
</P>
<P>
Foreign entrepreneurs are attracted by the bonded zones, where
they can set up financial arms, and their trade affiliates can
offer various trade services.
</P>
<P>
Their production costs will be low there, as imported building
materials, equipment, fuels, office facilities, as well as most
products processed there will continue to be exempted from tariffs.
</P>
<P>
For enterprises in export-oriented processing, income tax is
waived for the first three years after their inauguration, over
the next two years the income tax is reduced, and, starting in the
sixth year, they need to pay only a 15-percent income tax.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of locating in the zones is that enterprises
can open hard currency accounts to directly calculate business in
foreign exchange. Outside the bonded zones, official approval is a
must before they can use foreign exchange in foreign trade
transactions.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s China has established 13 bonded zones,
all in coastal cities -- from Dalian, a port city in northeast
China, to Haikou, capital of south China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Special policies meted out by the central government have given
the bonded zones a high degree of freedom in the flow of
commodities, personnel, currencies and trade in a bid to attract
as much foreign investment as possible.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Offices Provide Diverse Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Attorney's offices in central China's
Hubei Province are providing new services such as real estate
development and financial advising, securities information and
accessibility to tax agents.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen law offices in Hubei now provide legal services in
securities, according to an official of the Provincial Department
of Justice. The change was authorized by the Chinese Ministry of
Justice and the Chinese Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
Hubei currently has 285 law offices employing a total of 2,222
lawyers, the official said. Additionally, there are 226 state-run
offices, 56 partnerships, three cooperatives and one private
office, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers serve as legal advisers for 10,735 enterprises and
institutions throughout Hubei, he said, adding they handle a total
of 80,000 cases a year.
</P>
<P>
"All lawyer offices also provide free services to the
handicapped and those in financial difficulty," he said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Ban Free Using of Foreign Characters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou will clean up its
commercial market by banning business people from freely using
foreign characters as company names and trademarks, it was learned
here today.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the local Party committee and the
government said that some of the companies have been using foreign
characters in an "insignificant way," and this "cultural
colonialism" cannot be tolerated any more.
</P>
<P>
"Companies will not be allowed to register at administrative
departments if they use (unsuitable) names with the color of
colonial culture, and that might harm the national interests and
dignity," according to information in the circular.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is the capital city of the economically prosperous
Guangdong, a southern Chinese province which is adjacent to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese companies must stop using insignificant foreign
characters, or foreign places, persons, well-known brands, as
their names, it specified.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign invested companies can continue to use their
foreign names if they do not violate the above rules, according to
the circular.
</P>
<P>
Entertainment places, bookstores, publishing houses also have
been asked to obey the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the extensive overuse of old Chinese characters also
will be banned.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, the Chinese mainland has gradually simplified the
structure of its thousand-years-old writing system, but these old
characters are still officially being used in Hong Kong, Taiwan
and by most overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Since China's reform, many Chinese business people preferred to
adopt foreign names for their companies in an effort to attract
clients.
</P>
<P>
However, sources with the government said that the city is
still encouraging the citizens to further study English and learn
from foreign expertise.

"More enterprises, especially those in trade, services and
export-oriented processing, are expected to turn to invest in
China when they become more familiar with the bonded zones," said
Yoshihiro Okoshi, general manager of SR-Utoc International
Transportation Logistics (Tianjin) Inc. of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hao Yongkuan, general manager of the Victon Industrial &AMP; Trade
Co. Ltd, said, "All the bonded zones are located in regions with
convenient transportation and prosperous economies."
</P>
<P>
"Excellent locations, along with outstanding services, have
made those regions ideal channels through which to conduct foreign
trade in China," he said. "This deserves more attention from
foreign firms who are interested in China's huge market."
</P>
<P>
Victon, processing export products, has developed into one of
the top 500 overseas-funded firms in China since it launched its
foreign trade business five years ago in the Tianjin bonded zone.
</P>
<P>
Early this month Victon moved its headquarters to the zone.
</P>
<P>
The bonded zone in Qingdao, a port city in east China's
Shandong Province, mustered 56 million US dollars in foreign
investment in the first quarter of this year. In Tianjin the
bonded zone received 120 million US dollars in foreign investment
over the first four months of this year, up 73 percent from the
same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
More impressive than these figures is that such big names as
JVC, Pioneer, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo from Japan, Caltex and
Honeywell and Hewlett-Packard from the United States, and
Mercedes-Benz from Germany have jumped on the bandwagon of
investing in the bonded zones.
</P>
<P>
These zones are expected to play a more important role in
integrating China's economy into that of the rest of the world as
China opens up further in trade, commerce and finance, local
experts pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Build More Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Regional
government plans to build seven county-level cities over the next
decade, according to a leading official.
</P>
<P>
Xu Mingyang, vice-chairman of the autonomous regional
government, said that the new cities will be in the prefectures of
Nagqu, Qamdo, Gyangze and Yadong.
</P>
<P>
He said that the regional government will promulgate a decision

and towns.
</P>
<P>
He said that long-term construction plans for most county towns
and cities have already been drawn up.
</P>
<P>
For example, this regional capital will be enlarged to 75 sq km
by the year 2015 from 50 sq km at present, according to an
official of the Lhasa Urban Construction Bureau.

office, will be built into a city of gardens. Zedang Township, the
seat of the Shannan Prefectural Commissioner's office, will focus
on building the western section along the Yalong River, where
houses in Tibetan style will be built.
</P>
<P>
Xigaze City will concentrate on protecting historical sites and
cultural relics. Nagqu Town, a transportation hub in northern
Tibet, will try to expand its grassland-oriented tourism industry
and handicrafts.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Makes Efforts to Curb Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan Province
is sparing no effort to curb soil erosion to keep the Yangtze
River clean and the local grain output stable.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years the local government has invested
some 200 million yuan to combat soil erosion in areas totalling
18,800 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Serious soil erosion has impaired agricultural development in
the province, a major grain producer with ten percent of the
country's population. Located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River, the province's soil erosion has also undermined the
ecological environment of the river and the safety of the Three
Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989 the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the Commission
for the Water and Soil Conservation of the Yangtze River have
listed the middle and lower reaches of Jialing River, the lower
reaches of the Jinsha River and the Three Gorges Project area in
the province as the key regions for water and soil conservation.
</P>
<P>
Through comprehensive harnessing measures, such as transforming
hillside fields into terraced fields, building water-control
projects and afforestation, the soil erosion has been effectively
curbed in these key regions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the same period the forest coverage
rate has risen to 41 percent from 24 percent, while that the area
of barren hills has dropped to three percent from 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the grain output has increased by 19 percent and the
per capita net annual income of farmers has increased by some 180
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project area, for example, through water and
soil conservation measures, has witnessed a grain output rise of
35 million kg and an income increase of 100 million yuan. Thus,
six more people can survive per square kilometer because of the
grain increase and 23 more people can survive because of the
income increase.
</P>
<P>
A local official admitted that the province has still a long
and hard way to go to curb soil erosion. Statistics show that
Sichuan now has 230,000 square kilometers of soil-eroded area, or
more than 40 percent of the total, and the acreage and the amount
of eroded soil both account for 70 percent of the total on the
upper reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The province has set the target of improving 17,500 more square
kilometers of soil-eroded area in the coming five years.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Foot' Mountain Opens to International Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Shennongjia Mountain, the range in
central China's Hubei Province known for its mysterious 'Big Foot'
man, opened to international tourists Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Shennongjia International Tourism Festival will introduce
foreign visitors to the area's wide-ranging habitats of more than
500 kinds of animals, 190 kinds of birds, 35 kinds of fish, 1,400
kinds of butterflies, and 2,419 kinds of plants.
</P>
<P>
The biggest secret of the mountain, however, is the legend of
"Big Foot." Though many witnesses claim to have seen it, all
scientific surveys have failed to produce any hard evidence of its
existence.
</P>
<P>
Also living on the mountain under government protection are
some 40 species of rare animals, including South China tiger and
golden monkey, and 34 types of rare plants, such as China dove
tree.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Shennongjia International Azalea Fair will run
concurrently with the festival. Shennongjia is home to more than
20 kinds of azalea, one of the three most popular flowers in China.
</P>
<P>
The mountain has catered to domestic tourists for several
years, during a time when roads, telecommunications, hotels and
other facilities saw major improvements.

<HEADLINE> Pudong New Area Stops Leasing Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area in this,
China's biggest city, has decided to stop leasing stretches of
land and approving sites for constructing commercial buildings in
principle this year.
</P>
<P>
A meeting on Pudong's land planning said that the land used for
housing this year will mainly go to the transformation of old
urban districts, and the construction of municipal works, subway
stations, the Pudong international airport and apartments
specially for people who have housing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang Dejin, Pudong has approved 115.49 square
kilometers of land for construction purposes over the past six
years.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the land was used according to plan, but there are
still 36.87-square-kilometer of land remaining idle due to
unsettlement of projects and funds," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Local government already had retrieved 323 hectares of the idle
land according to the state law and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Yang disclosed that the zone will build a real estate market to
manage land and house property.

<HEADLINE> Meteorological Departments Successful in Aiding Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Meteorological departments
throughout the country have been successful in helping poor areas
in their efforts to achieve prosperity since 1993, according to a
recent national conference.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years the departments have launched 926
projects to assist 722 underdeveloped counties in achieving
prosperity, according to the national conference on aiding poor
areas sponsored by the State Meteorological Administration in
Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The departments have spread the use of 405 agricultural
techniques in the counties, increasing production value by 1.7
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The counties lie in mountainous areas with harsh natural
conditions in Hubei, Anhui, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Guizhou and
Shanxi provinces, as well as the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, they focus on providing meteorological services to
farmers in a bid to help them reduce the adverse effect of
disasters to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988 the meteorological departments in Hubei, Henan and
Anhui provinces have been helping farmers upgrade tea plantations,
breed edible fungi, plant trees and increase grain production.
</P>
<P>
As a result, farmers have achieved an extra production value of
48 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The departments in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have introduced
satellite remote sensing to monitor natural disasters and forest
fires.

<HEADLINE> Some 1,000 Journalists Swarm to Israel For Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- With election day fast
approaching, some 1,000 journalists from around the world are
expected to flood into Israel to cover Wednesday's elections, an
event widely regarded as vital for the precarious Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The newcomers will reinforce the nearly 400-strong foreign
reporters stationed in the country. Scores of TV screws will use
the Jerusalem Capital Studios (JCS) building in Jerusalem, as well
as its new Tel Aviv facility, which has been tailored to
accommodate them. The Labor Party is evacuating two stories of the
Tel Aviv building, which until now served as its campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The foreign crews will use filming and editing services and
equipment provided by JCS both on election night and during the
following days. JCS news director Hanani Rapoport said JCS has
expanded its technical infrastructure to accommodate the crews,
many of which have never been to Israel before.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that more than 700 broadcasts will go out live
from different stations over a three-day period," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have ordered an additional network from the Israel
Communications Company of 40 fiber-optic cables for the occasion,
instead of the usual eight, to connect the studios to live
broadcast spots."
</P>
<P>
JCS has also set up 10 additional editing rooms to supplement
five existing ones, two-multi-camera studios, and camera
locations strategically placed on the buildings' rooftops.
</P>
<P>
Many countries including Russia and Spain, are sending print
and electronic journalists from several different regions. Dutch
TV is expected to broadcast live for four hours continually,
while a Japanese TV station has already booked two hours of live
broadcasting time from JCS.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian TV, which is based in East Jerusalem, will
also broadcast live, while other Gulf states will use news
agency representatives.
</P>
<P>
The Government Press Office has extended working hours for
issuing press cards for foreign journalists and offering other
services.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Dr.
Salmin Amour has denied allegations that his government is
abusing human rights by harassing people from Pemba Island,
a report from Zanzibar said today.
</P>
<P>
President Amour said this in Zanzibar on Monday when speaking
to journalists from Tanzania mainland at the end of their six-
day fact finding mission on human rights abuse allegations in
Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
He also denied reports that after the Zanzibar elections
results were announced, prisons in the isles have been receiving
many inmates.
</P>
<P>
Amour said, in fact Zanzibar has the lowest number of inmates
in its prisons compared to many countries in Africa. Zanzibar's
four prisons have a total of 92 inmates and remandees, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, he said his government has been saddened by decisions
by various donor countries which froze their aid to Zanzibar on
allegations of human rights abuse.
</P>
<P>
Amour also expressed concern over donor countries which, he
said, have been interfering with Zanzibar's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was also attended by Minister for
Information, Culture, Tourism and Youth Issa Mohamed Issa.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 journalists from Tanzania mainland were invited by
President Amour to witness what is termed as "human rights abuse
in zanzibar."

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Has Record Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Savings deposits in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, a major industrial base, had surged to
20.3 billion yuan by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Savings deposits in the northeast China province have expanded
continuously, rising above 10 billion yuan at the end of February
1994.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangdong Province, east China's Shandong and
Jiangsu provinces, and north China's Hebei Province have each seen
their savings deposits break the 20-billion-yuan mark, financial
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions in Liaoning were holding 28.55 billion
yuan in deposits, of which 70.2 percent is in the form of savings
deposits from rural and urban residents, by May this year, said Li
Shaozhou, head of the Liaoning Branch of the People's Bank of
China, the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Savings deposits across the country topped 800 billion yuan
early this year.
</P>
<P>
Steadily increasing incomes have fueled the growth in savings
deposits, experts explained. The average per capita income of
urban residents in 1995, adjusted for inflation, rose by about four
percent, and that for rural residents by five percent, according to
the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
People treat savings deposits as the top investment choice these
days, and they have more confidence in the government's efforts to
curb inflation, they added.

<HEADLINE> Temple in Memory of Ancient Heroine Rebuilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A temple in memory of Hua Mulan,
a national heroine who lived during the Sui Dynasty (581-618), has
been rebuilt in her birthplace Dazhouzhuang Village, Yinglang
Township, Yucheng County, in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, in the late period of the Sui
Dynasty Hua's father was conscripted. Considering that her father
was old and weak and her brother was too young, Hua Mulan decided
to disguise herself as a man to join the army in place of her
father.
</P>
<P>
She fought bravely for 12 years and was commended time and
again for her exploits in battle, but nobody realized that she was
a girl.
</P>
<P>
When the war ended the emperor decided to appoint Hua a
minister. But she declined the offer, became demobilized and
returned to her hometown in women's clothing.
</P>
<P>
Since then stories of the deeds of Hua Mulan have become
popular all over China, and even today the role of Hua Mulan is a
common one in various kinds of Chinese operas.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) granted the title
"Loyal and Brave General" to Hua and had a temple in her memory
built in Dazhouzhuang Village.
</P>
<P>
The temple was expanded during the Song (906-1279), Yuan
(1271-1368), Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911). It
covered 26 ha and had some 100 halls before it was destroyed in
fighting in 1943.
</P>
<P>
The Yucheng County government spent 1.6 million yuan rebuilding
the 500 sq m temple.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Geng Hongda is just half the boy
he used to be after a marathon diet in which he shed 70 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Geng, 17, became the biggest boy one year ago in China's
biggest city, Shanghai, tipping the scales at 153 kg.
</P>
<P>
 When Geng was born in the city's Pudong area he weighed 5.5
kg. Soon after the age of five years he could eat one jin (500
grammes) of noodles and eight eggs at one meal.
</P>
<P>
A year ago his weight rocketed to 153 kg and his waist to 143
cm, making it extremely difficult for him to sit still or bend to
tie his own shoe laces.
</P>
<P>
When he slept his mega-loud snoring could be heard across the
street, his father said.
</P>
<P>
In the summer months the boy had to pour cold water on himself
several times a day because of excessive sweating. He was so sad
that he often wept.
</P>
<P>
In despair he quit the school and visited one doctor after
another for treatment, but always in vain.
</P>
<P>
In January 1995 he was introduced to Doctor Jiao Donghai, a
famous slimming expert, who gave Geng special treatment by
combining traditional Chinese and western medicinal methods.
</P>
<P>
After 16 months treatment, the boy has resumed his
schoolclasses and his waist has shrunk to a respectable 82
cm.

<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers in Beijing
enterprises funded with overseas investment must be recruited only
through government approved employment agencies, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fines will be levied against employers or employees who
violate new municipal regulations passed on May 14 to take effect
on June 15.
</P>
<P>
The regulations are intended to end the chaotic human-resources
market in the capital, which now hosts more than 5,000 foreign
funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people who want to work in such companies -- even if
the work is called training, exchange, or business co-operation -
- should first be Beijing residents and must hold employee cards
or representative cards issued by the Beijing Industry and
Commerce Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Employment agencies that match foreign-invested employers and
Chinese workers must sign labour contracts that comply with the
Labour Law, and the agencies must also pay the social insurance
benefits for the employees.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises that violate the regulations will be subject to
fines of 10,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. For individual offenders, the
fine may amount to 5,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Employment agencies will also be fined if they do not provide
employee cards or representative cards to employees, or if they
fail to get approval from the local labour bureau and personnel
bureau for each job fair or talent market they arrange. For severe
violations, their operating certificates will be at risk.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's first production center of
cyclopron-prepared nuclear medicine started production in this,
the country's largest financial and commercial city.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Kexing Pharmaceutical Company, jointly sponsored
by the China Xinxing Corporation and Shanghai Nuclear Institute of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, plans to produce some types of
nutro-deficient radioactive pharmaceuticals and
medium-and-long-lived nuclides as its first group of products.
</P>
<P>
With 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars)-worth of
assets, the company has the country's first nuclear medicine
factory building, which can meet both the state standard of
radioactivity proof and the international Good Medicine Production
(GMP) standards.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the nuclear medicine has proved effective
in the treatment of tumors, and cardio- and cerebral-vascular
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The pathological changes in some parts of the human body can be
discovered at least three months earlier through nuclear
diagnosis, which is more sensitive than ultrasonic scanners,
cerebral testing (CT) and nuclear and magnetic resonance (NMR)
machines.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear medicine is said to have a effectivity rate of 80
percent and a cure rate of 50 percent for osteocarcinoma, and
cervical and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Nuclear Institute have finished studies on
20 kinds of nuclides and 30 kinds of radio-active
pharmaceuticals. And by producing 3,000 Curies of radioactive
pharmaceuticals through cyclopron each year, the company can
provide early diagnosis for over 1.8 million patients.

This is the second Israeli trade mission established in the
Gulf region. Last Monday, Israel sent an official, Oded Benhaim,
to head a trade mission in Oman.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Israel and the two Gulf Arab countries have
been improved. Israel Prime Minister Shimon Peres visited Oman and
Qatar in April.
</P>
<P>
Peres was the second Israel Government head who visited the
Sultanate. Former Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin visited Oman in

</P>
<P>
Oman and Qatar are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC), which also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries announced in September 1994 that they had
lifted the indirect boycott of Western and other companies doing
business with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Gulf said that the opening of the Israeli
trade missions in Oman and Qatar will finally lead to the full
normalization of relations between Israel and the GCC countries
within the framework of the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Imposes Wage Freeze on Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has imposed
a wage freeze on all government-funded institutions this year
because of financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
Secretary to the cabinet Aldridge Adamson said in a circular
published here today that workers in the government-funded
institutions would not have a wage increase this year because
there is no provision in the budget.
</P>
<P>
"It should be carefully explained in no uncertain terms that
there will be no salary and wage increments during 1996 due to
serious financial and budgetary constraints," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
"In cases where unionized employees have already commenced
negotiations with the respective managements, these can be
allowed to continue with the understanding they would be
implemented during the 1997 financial year," it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the wage freeze has sparked a strike at Copperbelt
University where about 480 workers downed tools and gave the
government a seven days ultimatum to rescind the decision.

<HEADLINE> Fortify Coast to Hold Rising Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists predict that sea
levels will rise dramatically along China's coast, and urge the
government to strengthen coastal fortifications, reported today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Sea levels will rise between 15 to 75 centimeters during the
21st century, said Du Bilan, a research fellow with the State
Oceanic Administration, wholed a team of scientific investigators
studying sea levels in the past several moths.
</P>
<P>
Existing dykes and dams should be reinforced and built up, and
new bulwarks must be built along areas likely to be threatened by
the rising sea level, according to the group.
</P>
<P>
The warming comes a result of a five-year research project on
the influence of climatic changes on coastal sea levels.
</P>
<P>
Du said that rising sea levels would cause flooding and
increase the hazard of storm surges, the salinization of farm land
and erosion of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
Over the past century, the sea level worldwide rose an average
1.5 mm per year, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
But, Du's group, the Integrated Panel on Climatic Change,
estimated that the world's seas and oceans will swell 66
centimeters by 2100.
</P>
<P>
Du's group has processed data provided by 35 tide gauging
stations located along china's coastline, and taken advantage of
advanced Geographic Information System (GIS) survey techniques.
</P>
<P>
Du's project also surveyed three coastal areas believed to be
particularly threatened by surging seas, including the Pearl River
Delta in South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
If the area's current tidal defences remain unchanged, economic
losses in the Pearl River Delta caused by the sea level would be
likely reach 13.6 billion yuan (about 1.63 billion US dollars),
based on 1990 economic realities.

SHANGHAI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- An ocean-going towing salvage
fleet in Shanghai has been a leader in international salvage
operations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the fleet belonging to the Shanghai Salvage Co.
has completed 35 missions, thus becoming one of the most
successful commercial international salvage operations.
</P>
<P>
One of the company's salvage tugs sailed for four days before
rescuing a 75,000-ton Hong Kong bulk carrier, which in 1994 had
caught fire and was adrift at sea.
</P>
<P>
In August 1995, the towing fleet rescued a 60,000-ton Norwegian
bulk carrier, which ran into a mechanical problem and drifted to
the Pacific east near Guam.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Qaidam Basin in the Heyday of Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The national campaign to accelerate
economic development in central and western parts of China heralds
the spring of Qaidam Basin, a place known as a "treasure bowl" in
northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
One of the four largest inland basins in China, Qaidam covers
360,000 sq. km, an area equivalent to the size of Britain. It is
rich in 39 kinds of mineral resources with potential value topping
15 trillion yuan. It ranks first in China in the reserve of salt,
potassium, magnesium, lithium, asbestos and limestone.
</P>
<P>
The basin is striving to develop into China's most promising
oil and gas producer, an important base for salt chemicals and
petrochemicals as well as a regional granary in the coming five
years, said Wang Hanmin, vice-governor of Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, recently
approved the establishment of a potash fertilizer plant with an
annual production capacity of 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Other key projects to be built in the near future at the basin
include a factory which turns out 300,000 tons of synthetic
ammonia and 520,000 tons of urea a year, an oil refinery, and a
cement plant with an annual capacity of 320,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Completion on expansion projects in the latter half of this
year for an asbestos mine and a magnesium plant will turn Qaidam
into the country's largest asbestos and metallic magnesium
production base.
</P>
<P>
To form a convenient transportation link with other parts of
China, the central government has built a Qinghai-Tibet highway
and the first phase of the Qinghai-Tibet railway line.
</P>
<P>
A 103-km gas pipeline, which connects the Nanyishan oil and gas
field with the new oil town of Huatugou at the foot of the Kunlun
Mountains, in the western part of the Qaidam Basin, went into
operation early this month.
</P>
<P>
The construction boom has brought the number of industrial
firms in the basin to 120, which yielded a combined annual output
value of 1.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will invest 6.7 billion yuan in fixed
assets centering around development of Qaidam Basin this year,
setting a historical record, the vice-governor said.
</P>
<P>
in addition to government funding, investments from overseas
and other parts of China will be secured to enhance the local
natural resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the Qinghai potash fertilizer project was a
typical example of multi-lateral cooperation. The expansion
project will cost 4.6 billion yuan, a pooled investment involving
Israel and Guangdong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong and Henan provinces.
</P>
<P>
During the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the
Ministry of Power Industry will speed up power construction at the
upper reach of the Yellow River in an attempt to provide more
electricity to Qaidam. Meanwhile, a hydroelectric power station
with an installed capacity of 20,000 kilowatts is expected to
start operation at Golmud this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts predicted that by the year 2010, a number of
new towns and economic zones for processing salt chemicals, rare
metals and animal by-products will emerge in Golmud, Dulan, and
Ulan counties.

NANNING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Border trade in Pingxiang on the
Sino-Vietnamese border continues its growth momentum, with trade
transactions amounting to 350 million yuan (42.1686 million US
dollars) in the first four months of this year, an impressive rise
of 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the annual border trade transactions in

ranking it second in the region.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate the booming cross-border business, the
Pingxiang City Government has introduced a series of preferential
policies in recent years, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 million yuan has been fueled by the city into the
construction of several border trade points and a border economic
cooperation zone, which have both been beneficial to the border
trade development.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Ban Free Using of Foreign Characters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou will clean up its
commercial market by banning business people from freely using
foreign characters as company names and trademarks, it was learned
here today.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the local Party committee and the
government said that some of the companies have been using foreign
characters in an "insignificant way," and this "cultural
colonialism" cannot be tolerated any more.
</P>
<P>
"Companies will not be allowed to register at administrative
departments if they use (unsuitable) names with the color of
colonial culture, and that might harm the national interests and
dignity," according to information in the circular.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou is the capital city of the economically prosperous
Guangdong, a southern Chinese province which is adjacent to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese companies must stop using insignificant foreign
characters, or foreign places, persons, well-known brands, as
their names, it specified.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign invested companies can continue to use their
foreign names if they do not violate the above rules, according to
the circular.
</P>
<P>
Entertainment places, bookstores, publishing houses also have
been asked to obey the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the extensive overuse of old Chinese characters also
will be banned.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, the Chinese mainland has gradually simplified the
structure of its thousand-years-old writing system, but these old
characters are still officially being used in Hong Kong, Taiwan
and by most overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Since China's reform, many Chinese business people preferred to
adopt foreign names for their companies in an effort to attract
clients.
</P>
<P>
However, sources with the government said that the city is
still encouraging the citizens to further study English and learn
from foreign expertise.

<HEADLINE> Reform Urged in Mobile Telecom Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications experts
have called for a structural reform in the fledgling mobile
telecom industry, aiming at stopping the domination of foreign
walkie-talkies on the Chinese market as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Among all the 126 mobile telecommunications plants of China,
only four or five plants have an annual production capacity of
40,000 to 50,000 cellular handsets. They generate a combined
output value of 2.5 billion US dollars, of which 99 per cent are
turned out by assembling imported components, according to
People's Posts and Telecommunications Daily.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 per cent of mobile telecommunications products
sold in China are imported from the United States, Japan, Sweden,
Finland and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Limited research and development and old-fashioned production
structures have greatly obstructed scientific achievements from
being transformed into products, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that a large-scale production should be
established to replace the decentralized management, and
international technical cooperation should be further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
And the country's investment in mobile telecommunications
research should be increased, and the government should form an
"investment mechanism" together with local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, at least 5 per cent of the sales of enterprises
should be used in research and development, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the country should also require foreign
mobile telecom companies to allocate 15 to 20 per cent of their
sales in China to sponsor the country's technical development.
</P>
<P>
They also want to encourage domestic mobile telecom enterprises
to launch structural readjustment in accordance with market
demands.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Young Farmers Set Up Law Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Five young farmers in east China's
Zhejiang Province have set up a law firm, the first of its kind in
Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The Tashi Law Firm, which was opened one year ago by five young
farmers from the Tashi Township in Longyou County, now provides
legal service for farmers in all 35 villages of the township.
</P>
<P>
Chen Derong, one of the founders and now head of the firm,
said, "If our fellow farmers have any request, our lawyers can get
to the spot within one hour."
</P>
<P>
Before the firm was established, he said, local farmers had to
walk several hours through the mountainous paths in west Zhejiang
to seek the help of lawyers in the county town when there were
legal disputes.
</P>
<P>
Chen and several other young men studied law in their spare
time for more than three years and received advanced degrees. They
were then granted permission to open the firm by local judicial
and administrative departments.
</P>
<P>
"We have solved a large number of legal and civil disputes, and
helped the villagers avoid economic losses in many cases," Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
The "farmer lawyers" have successfully stopped fights with
weapons, pacified legacy division quarrels, and helped old people
gain financial support from their undutiful children, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the firm handled 27 cases of civil disputes, for which
a service fee of only a few dozen yuan was charged. Service for
extremely poor farmers was free, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Since this law firm opened, we have been much less disturbed
at night by quarrels and able to sleep well," said Hu Xiuquan,
party secretary of the Tashi Township.

life will remain unchanged after 1997.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a recent interview with Jim Laurie,
senior correspondent of ABC News of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that, according to the existing law in Hong Kong,
foreigners, including Americans, no matter how long they have
stayed in Hong Kong, can neither become permanent residents nor
have the right of abode.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, after 1997 Americans and other foreigners, if
they have lived in Hong Kong continuously for more than seven
years and take Hong Kong as their permanent residence, will be
qualified to become permanent Hong Kong residents and have the
right of abode.
</P>
<P>
They will also have the right to continuously work and live in
Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the composition of the first Legislative Council of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Lu Ping said the first
Legislative Council of the HK SAR will be chosen by election in
mid-1998 in accordance with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
According to the stipulations of the Basic Law, he said, all
members of the Legislative Council of the HK SAR will be chosen
through general elections, but the pace of democracy should be
accelerated in an orderly and gradual way.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that the assertion that China is afraid of
implementing democracy in Hong Kong is a completely
misunderstanding and it is unfair too.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the future destiny of political parties in
Hong Kong, like the Democratic Party, Lu said that after 1997, so
long as political parties in Hong Kong abide by local laws, they
will continue to exist and be involved in elections.
</P>
<P>
All in all, Lu said, whatever they do should be in accordance
with the laws of the HK SAR.
</P>
<P>
On the preliminary legislative council of the HK SAR, Lu said
that the decision has been made by the Preparatory Committee of
the HK SAR to establish the preliminary legislative council.
</P>
<P>
"We had to take this measure in order to solve the problem of
legal vacuum after 1997 because the British side sabotaged the
`through-train' arrangement for the present Legislative Council
members," he said.
</P>
<P>
While mentioning the issue of the HK dollar being pegged to the
US dollar, Lu said that before 1997 "we are not in favor of
changing the present situation. But after 1997 this issue will be
decided by the government of the Hong Kong SAR and the Hong Kong
monetary authority".
</P>
<P>
During the nearly hour-long interview, Lu also answered other
questions raised by the US correspondent.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang Develops More Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
province, a major grain producer in the country, has newly
developed 1.4 million ha of farmland in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
This has helped increase the annual grain output of the
province by some four billion kg.
</P>
<P>
According to the local agricultural department, the province
has great potential for grain output increase, with 1.6 million ha
of waste land suitable for cultivation and 5.6 million ha of
medium- and low-yielding arable land.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s the local government has spared no efforts
to transform this waste land to help grain production.
</P>
<P>
A series of preferential policies and measures covering funds
and land use have been worked out to arouse the enthusiasm of the
farmers to develop the land.
</P>
<P>
It also encourages foreigners, companies and urban residents to
invest in the development projects.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone 1,600 farm households and ten companies or
government units in Suihua City went to other counties to develop
more than 24,000 ha of waste and low-yielding land.
</P>
<P>
The local government also pays close attention to the spreading
of advanced agricultural know-how in the process of land
development.

<HEADLINE> New Thai Cabinet Lineup Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The new cabinet reshuffle list of
Thailand was announced mid-day today following the approval by
King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan, who is leader of the Nam
Thai Party, will concurrently hold the foreign minister's
portfolio to replace Kasem S. Kasemsri, whose resignation took
effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kasem had been under pressure from his own Nam Thai Party
members for being foreign minister but not a member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The five Palang Dharma (Virtue Force) Party (PDP) cabinet
members, led by Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the PDP
Thaksin Shinawatra, who resigned last Friday, have all returned to
the cabinet, as the PDP sees that the newly appointed Therd Thai
faction ministers are acceptable to it.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle, the second since Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa took office last July, has involved 12 cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
Bodi Chunnananda, an ex-Budget Bureau chief, has become Finance
Minister, to replace Surakiat Sathirathai, who announced his
resignation on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Surakiat, who used to be dean of a university law faculty and
law advisor to Banharn, had been deemed unsuitable for the post
for lack of related knowledge and experience. He was blamed for
most economic blunders during the last 10 months, such as high
inflation rate, high current account deficit and Stock Exchange of
Thailand index falls.
</P>
<P>
Of the five Therd Thai faction ministers and deputy ministers
of Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party who resigned last
Thursday, Deputy Interior Minister Suchart Tancharoen and Deputy
Finance Minister Newin Chidchob, the two most controversial among
the five, have been removed from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused the two of being involved in a number of
land ownership and loan scandals during the no-confidence debate
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Interior Minister Suchart has been replaced by former
deputy Industry Minister Anusorn Wongwan, who is a member of the
Therd Thai faction; and Deputy Finance Minister Newin Chidchob's
post has been taken by Sermsak Karoon, a Chart Thai Party MP for
eastern Rayong province.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Major Sentenced Over Somalia Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian major today was jailed
for three months and dismissed from the army for his part in a
torture scandal during a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Major Tony Seward was sentenced after being found guilty of
allowing soldiers under his command to torture and kill a
16-year-old Somalian, Shidane Arone, during the mission in the
African country in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In a 1994 court martial, Seward was only reprimanded for his
role in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa martial appeals court reviewed the ruling of the
court martial and changed it to a dismissal from the army plus
three months in jail, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Seward's lawyer said that the sacked major will appeal.
</P>
<P>
The new sentence marks the first time a Canadian officer has
been convicted over the scandal in which three Somalian civilians
died allegedly at the hands of members of the Canadian Airborne
Regiment, who were deployed to help restore peace in the civil
war-plagued country.
</P>
<P>
Major Seward allegedly told his soldiers not to hesitate to use
force on intruders trying to enter their camp at Belet Huen in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien later disbanded the military group
in an attempt to restore the reputation of the Canadian
peacekeepers.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia had
invited neutral Afghan groups to political talks in a bid to
strengthen its political position, local press reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Afghan Islamic Press as saying that Nabi
Muhammadi, leader of the Afghan Islamic Revolutionary Movement,
Yunus Khalis, head of the Hezb-i-Islami (Khalis Group), and Sayed
Gailani, Chairman of Inqilab-i-Islami, might soon travel to
Kandahar, Taliban's headquarters in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned three Afghan parties had got involved in
few factional fighting and kept a relatively neutral position in
the war-torn country, said observers.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, which vows to topple the Afghan government led by
President Burhanuddin Rabbani, has been trying to seize Kabul
since last October.
</P>
<P>
Now, Taliban seemed to be trying to line up some Afghan
factions on its side to counter the pressure from the recent
alignment between Afghan government and Rabbani's old foe
Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group).
</P>
<P>
However, the Hekmatyar side made it clear Monday that its
recent accord with Rabbani is not directed against any specific
party or group.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will prove to be a base for the solution of the
Afghan crisis," said a Hezb statement issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement also asked Taliban to give up fighting and to
follow the path of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Poll Campaign in Bangladesh in High Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi political parties are
going all out to campaign for the June 12 general election, which
is widely believed to take place as scheduled despite
controversies over the sacking of top army officers by President
Abdur Rahman Biswas.
</P>
<P>
Biswas, who has the Defense Ministry under his charge, sacked
Chief of Army Staff A.S.M. Nasim on May 20 for disobeying an order
to fire two other senior officers.
</P>
<P>
This prompted a quasi-mutiny by troops loyal to Nasim in
northern districts of Bogra and Mymensingh, which soon calmed down
after Nasim and some other senior officers were put under military
custody.
</P>
<P>
The developments caught the Bangladeshis by surprise and
sparked national debates over the legality of the president's
action.
</P>
<P>
The Awami (People's) League (AL), the former largest opposition
party in the country, reacted with furious attacks on Biswas,
charging him with holding the defense portfolio to assist a
"conspiracy" of the ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
to foil the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The BNP retaliated by accusing the AL of creating anarchy in
the army in its attempt to grab power "through the back door."
</P>
<P>
Official reports said the president's action was based on ample
evidence of a coup attempt to topple the caretaker government,
including 17 cassettes of taped conversation between the fired
officers and leaders of an unnamed political party.
</P>
<P>
But instead of buying the official story, many Bangladeshis,
including legal experts, are questioning the legality of the
president's power to remove the top-ranking army officers.
</P>
<P>
Amid the rumbling rows of pros and cons, chief adviser to the
caretaker government Habibur Rahman warned against any attempt to
destabilize the situation to foil the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
"It's my fervent request to all -- don't try to foil the good
job we have started," he urged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the election tempo is gaining momentum across
Bangladesh with hectic campaigns by rival political parties,
including the AL and the BNP.
</P>
<P>
The candidates and their workers and supporters have been
conducting door-to-door canvassing and holding rallies and
processions to impress voters.
</P>
<P>
The BNP said that out of the 119 political parties contesting
the elections, only one of them -- referring to the AL but withnot
naming it -- opposes the president's action, noting that even the
allies of the said party did not raise any objections.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the AL's central election steering committee
Sunday directed its workers to respond to the incidents in the
army in "a cool manner."
</P>
<P>
"The recent development in the army was a delicate, sensitive
and highly important matter which should be dealt with
non-partisan attitude on the basis of justice as well as in a calm
and cool manner," the AL polls body reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi Election Commission (EC) Sunday released the
final list of a total of 2,570 candidates, including 37 women, in
the race for the coming polls.
</P>
<P>
The EC said 25,950 polling stations with 114,747 booths have
been prepared for some 56.789 million voters in the country to
exercise their franchise.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the caretaker government, a special TV
election program of four major parties -- the BNP, the AL, the
Jatiya (National) Party (JP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami -- started
Sunday with the recording of the JP program.
</P>
<P>
According to the Society for Environment and Human Development,
55 percent of the voters recently surveyed in Dhaka said they
believed the elections would be free and fair, while 64.2 percent
said they would pay more attention to the individual candidate
than to the party.

<HEADLINE> Albania's Ruling Party Claims Election Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
today claimed a clear victory in Sunday's elections for his
Democratic Party, but all opposition parties accused the Democrats
of rigging the vote and called for a mass demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Berisha told reporters that his party had won more than 65
percent of the vote in Sunday's first round of the country's third
multiparty parliamentary elections since 1991.
</P>
<P>
But the Central Electoral Commission, set up to organize the
poll, said at 1930 GMT today that it was unable to post early
results because less than half of the ballot papers had come in
from the country's 4,703 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Berisha attributed the unconfirmed victory to a right campaign
platform, Western support and Albanian citizens' "improving ability
to use freedom."
</P>
<P>
All nine opposition groups, including the biggest Socialist
Party, have withdrawn half way through the polls because of
alleged manipulation by the ruling Democrats of the balloting.
</P>
<P>
Six of them -- the Democratic Alliance, the Agrarian Party, the
Social Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, Union for Human
Rights and Union of National Unity -- called on their supporters
to take to the streets in the capital city at noon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We decided that tomorrow at 12 noon in Skanderbeg Square, all
the parties call on their disillusioned electors ... to come
together and demonstrate for ... clean and fair elections," said
Chairman of the Democratic Alliance Neritan Ceka, speaking on
behalf of the six opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Ceka also said the six parties would not accept the election
results and demanded another vote.
</P>
<P>
But the Interior Ministry said force would possibly be used to
disperse the protest which it called illegal. It said any rally
needs approval three days in advance according to law.
</P>
<P>
Tension has begun to build and Italy, the current holder of the
rotating European Union presidency, today urged all sides to
exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
The Berisha-claimed victory, if true, will give the Democrats
more seats in the 140-member one-chamber parliament, the People's
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
By getting 62.2 percent of the ballots in the 1992 general
elections, the Democrats controlled 92 seats in the assembly,
while the defeated Socialist Party with 25.6 percent of the vote
held 38 seats.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, 115 seats are being contested in
single-member constituencies and runoffs will be held on June 2 in
places where no one gets half the valid votes. The other 25 seats
will be allocated by proportional representation to the top 12
parties after the first round.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
left for Morocco today on his first official trip abroad since he
took office on May 5.
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour stay in Morocco's capital Rabat, Aznar said
he hoped to reassure Moroccan authorities that his government will
continue the policy of its Socialist predecessor to develop
friendly relations with its North African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he chose Rabat for his first official visit
abroad, Aznar said "the Mediterranean policy, toward Maghreb and
Morocco in particular, are a priority for the Spanish government."
</P>
<P>
Echoing the prime minister's remarks, foreign minister Abel Matutes,
who is accompanying him on the trip, said that Spain placed great
importance on its relations with Morocco, especially in trade,
investment and fishing.
</P>
<P>
The visit would serve to convey the message that Morocco's
stability and prosperity are "essential" for Spain's own stability
and prosperity, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aznar will return home Tuesday after talks with King Hassan II
and Prime Minister Abdellatif Filali.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Opposition Demands Rejection of Helms-Burton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Spanish
Socialist Labor Party (PSOE) urged the ruling consevative People's
Party today to reject the Helms-Burton law enacted by the
U.S. government to tighten its long-standing embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The law was passed by the U.S. Congress on March 6 in
retaliation for Cuba's downing of two small U.S. planes piloted by
Cuban exiles on February 24. The law penalizes foreign companies
which do business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The PSOE said the government, which has suspended official aid
to Cuba, was replacing Spain's traditional policy of cooperation
with the island-state with support for the sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
The government should stop doing so since Helms-Burton clearly
harms the interest of third countries and constitutes "intolerable
interference" in their sovereignty, the party spokesman Joaquin
Almunia said.
</P>
<P>
The Young Socialists of Spain today also issued a statement
insisting that official and humanitarian aid to Havana should be
resumed and that the Helms-Burton law should be rejected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the General Workers' Union said in a communique that
the government's decision to suspend official aid to Cuba was
"precipitate" and had put Spanish foreign policy in the hands of
third parties.

<P>
BUCHAREST, May 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Daewoo Heavy
Industries Co. signed today a 53 million U.S. dollar deal with the
Mangalia shipyard in eastern Romania to become the majority
stockholder of the company.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean company obtained 51 percent of the shares in a
new joint venture, which boasts a registered capital of 104
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture plans to build six ships per year,
compared with hardly one ship by the state-run Mangalia shipyard
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo would help Mangalia command first-class shipbuilding
technology in the world, a representative from the Daewoo company
said after the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Ion Iliescu, who also attended the signing
ceremony, said his country needs more foreign investment to speed
up the reform of its industrial system.
</P>
<P>
With another investment of 150 million dollars in an auto plant
in the southern city of Craiova in 1994, Daewoo is already the top
foreign investor in Romania.
</P>
<P>
The auto plant, which started production earlier this year,
will export Daewoo cars mainly to the European market.

<P>
LISBON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- It is the common will of the
Portuguese president, government and army to maintain friendly
cooperation with China on the Macao question, Portuguese President
Jorge Sampaio said here today.
</P>
<P>
During talks with visiting Chinese general Yu Yongbo, Sampaio

</P>
<P>
He believed that the bilateral ties could be furthered in
the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will have to import more
than 12 million tons of grain this year due to a fall in domestic
production caused by drought, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Three million hectares of land remain uncultivated because of
drought, said Eduardo Leyson Castro, president of the National
Association of Irrigation Users.
</P>
<P>
In Sinaloa, the biggest grain-growing state in the northwest of

than in previous years, said Leyson.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cesar Gonzalez Quiroga, president of the National
Confederation of Livestock Farmers, said the country's livestock

further 30,000 cattle have died so far this year, with 700,000
others auctioned off.
</P>

Gonzalez said 5,000 forest fires were reported during the first
five months of this year, damaging 450,000 hectares of forests.

CARACAS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 800,000 public employees

Payments had begun in several government agencies but those who

<HEADLINE> 189-Year-Old Stage in Beijing Renovated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A theater stage where the real live
history of China was acted out has been renovated.
</P>
<P>
The 189-year-old stage in Beijing's Huguang Hall was built
during the Qing Dynasty as a showpiece opera hall.
</P>
<P>
 In 1912 Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who led the Chinese people in
overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, used the stage as he presided over
a meeting during which the Chinese Kuomintang was founded. He
carried out revolutionary activities five times in the hall.
</P>
<P>
Now the hall has reopened to the public following two years of
renovation.
</P>
<P>
The stage now has become the Beijing Opera Museum, displaying
opera-related cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The hall was built in 1807 in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The
stage in the hall is considered valuable to the study of the
history of Chinese operas and ancient architectural art.
</P>
<P>
In 1849, Zeng Guofan, a key member of the cabinet of the Qing
Dynasty, financed the renovation of the hall and held a ceremony
to mark his 60th birthday there.
</P>
<P>
In early 1994 the Beijing Tianqiao Investment and Development
Company and the Cultural Relics Bureau of Xuanwu District decided
to spend eight million yuan renovating the stage as the first
phase of renovating Huguang Hall.
</P>
<P>
Wu Gaoshan, general manager of the company, said that his
company and the bureau will spend a total of 18 million yuan
renovating the hall in two phases.
</P>
<P>
The second phase is scheduled for completion toward the end of
this year, he added.

<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's grain production for the

The bureau conducted a survey in 11 provinces, which are the
country's major producing areas for summer grain and said that
only Shandong Province is likely to produce less grain than last
year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that the growing area of China's summer crops
increased by 700,000 hectares over last year, a rise of two
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the decision by the central government to raise the
purchase prices of grain also aroused farmers' enthusiasm on farm
work, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the cheerful forecast is that China has also
taken effective measures to combat drought, greatly reducing the
harm of droughts causeed to crops, the bureau noted.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also said that China's rape seeds output will go
down this year because of overcast and low temperatures in March,
the key period of time for the crop to grow.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Control Over Urban Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has issued a
circular calling for improved urban planning to control the use of
land in major cities and restrict the size of urban population.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, the population of big cities and the
amount of land used for construction should not exceed limits
specified by government-approved plans for year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In principle, cities with a population of more than 1 million
are not allowed to expand any further.
</P>
<P>
The circular also suggested that existing land be better
utilized to avoid encroaching on farm land.
</P>
<P>
The move follows concern about loss of valuable land resources
and damage to the environment as a result of reckless urban
expansion and lax law enforcement, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has called on local governments to strictly
abide by the Urban Planning Act promulgated in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged that governments at all levels safeguard the
integrity of urban planning, and give full play to urban planning
departments in managing land resources.
</P>
<P>
Power over city planning must be under direct control of
municipal governments and should not be delegated, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Construction must conform to overall development plans,
concerning the sites, land use and construction plan.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Urban Planning Act, cities with a
population of more than half a million should have their
development plans approved by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Plans of other cities can be approved by lower level
governments, after being checked by the Ministry of Construction,
the State Planning Commission and the State Land Administration.
</P>
<P>
Plans of townships should be approved by the local
construction, planning and land administration departments, the
circular said.
</P>
<P>
If their urban plans fail to meet the government's
requirements, the cities must amend them.
</P>
<P>
Use of land fro construction and residence is restricted until
new city blueprints are approved.
</P>
<P>
The State Council circular also asked that law supervision
efforts be reviewed annually and that violations of the law be
dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
Diversified development zones and buildings set up without
approval must be demolished, the document said.

PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- France praised a peace deal reached
between Moscow and Chechen rebels earlier today, describing it as a
major step toward a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the Moscow agreement which may be a major step
toward a political settlement," a French Foreign Ministry
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue which resumed at the highest level must go on,
and military operations must stop as soon as possible so that the
suffering of the population may come to an end," he said.

Under an accord reached in Moscow between Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, military
activities are to stop in Chechnya beginning June 1.

The deal, awaited since Yeltsin sent troops to Chechnya in
December 1994 to subdue the republic's bid for independence, comes
in time before the presidential elections on June 16.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian PM Dismissed for Economic Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
today signed a presidential decree to dismiss Prime Minister
Evgeni Marchuk from his post, blaming him for the country's
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The president said Marchuk should mainly be held responsible
for the country's chaotic economy, the Ukrainian National
Information Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk had failed to ensure a stable and efficient cabinet and
instead paid too much attention to polishing his own political
image, the president charged.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told an emergency cabinet meeting that inefficiency and
bureaucracy have led the country's economic reforms to a stalemate
and caused a severe liquidation problem.
</P>
<P>
Overdue wages, pensions, scholarships and social welfare
benefits have amounted to 65.6 trillion Ukrainian rubles (352
million U.S. dollars), the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said the lack of vision on the part of the government
has made it difficult to push forward the reform toward a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
All those present at the emergency meeting agreed to the
president's decision to fire Marchuk who was away on an inspection
tour of Yalta.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk started to serve as acting prime minister in February
1995 and was appointed by Kuchma as prime minister in June that
year. He was the fifth prime minister of the country since it
declared independence in August 1991.

MADRID, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Spanish President Jose Maria Aznar
left for Morocco today on his first official trip abroad since he
took office on May 5.
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour stay in Morocco's capital Rabat, Aznar said
he hoped to reassure Moroccan authorities that his government will
continue the policy of its Socialist predecessor to develop
friendly relations with its North African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he chose Rabat for his first official visit
abroad, Aznar said "the Mediterranean policy, toward Maghreb and
Morocco in particular, are a priority for the Spanish government."
</P>
<P>
Echoing the president's remarks, foreign minister Abel Matutes,
who is accompanying him on the trip, said that Spain placed great
importance on its relations with Morocco, especially in trade,
investment and fishing.
</P>
<P>
The visit would serve to convey the message that Morocco's
stability and prosperity are "essential" for Spain's own stability
and prosperity, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president will return home Tuesday after talks with King
Hassan II and Prime Minister Abdellatif Filali.

MEXICO CITY, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and Central America need
to improve the quality of education so that their economies can be
invigorated, said Carlos Pallan Figueroa, secretary executive of
the National Association of Universities and Institutions of
Higher Learning here today.
</P>
<P>
On improving the quality of education they can also elevate the
levels of well-being, combat poverty and fortify democracy and
justice, said the executive during two days of meetings between
Mexican and Central American university presidents.
</P>
<P>
In the meetings, arising from the Tuxtla Gutierrez II summit
which took place in San Jose, Costa Rica in February, agreements
of cooperation to fortify political ties, economic relations and
relations of affection and friendship will be established among
the peoples of the region.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the meetings is to propitiate closer relations
between the directors of the Mexican and Central American
institutions and to analyze issues relevant to the development of
higher education.

<HEADLINE> Howard Government Enjoys Lead Over Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Government enjoyed
a comfortable lead in popularity over the opposition Labor Party,
the latest public opinion poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The results of the Newspoll released today showed that the
Liberal-National Coalition Government retained the support rate of
55 percent among voters as in one month ago, while Labor was
supported by 36 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard was still preferred by 54 percent of
voters as the better candidate for the job over Opposition leader
Kim Beazley.
</P>
<P>
Beazley was considered to make a better Prime Minister by only
20 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition Government has won political points by passing a
nation-wide gun law and streamlining the size of the government.
</P>
<P>
It has also touched the core of micro-economic reform by
tabling an industrial relations bill to deregulate the labor
market.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition Government announced that it would take all
necessary measures to materialize an eight-billion Australian
dollar (6.32-billion US dollar) expenditure cut in the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
Howard hinted that the Coalition would break its promises made
during the election campaign and look at every government program
for possible cut except defense.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Coalition Government might eat its
words and put the razor on environment, education and medical
service programs.
</P>
<P>
However, it is yet to be seen how the industrial relations
reform and budget cut will affect voters' opinion on the Coalition
Government.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition Government is striving to tackle as many
contentious issues as possible before the "Howard honeymoon" ends.
For example, the Coalition will put a bill through the Parliament
to sell one-third of the government-owned Telstra
telecommunication company, though the bill is likely to be sunk by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition Government will face a test of its popularity in
the next two weeks when a Cabinet committee review and pass budget
cut plans for various government departments.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the contraction of
the economy in 1995, total investment in Uruguay reached a record
high in 14 years, the latest figures released by the Central Bank
show.
</P>
<P>
Total investment that year accounted for 16 percent of the GDP,
a figure nearly three percentage points above the average for the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bank, however, the increase in
investment in 1995 sharply slowed down compared with the previous
two years.
</P>
<P>
Investment rose by only 1.7 percent that year, much lower than
the 10.7 percent for 1994 and 14.2 percent for 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank said, investment in the private sector
jumped by 3.5 percent last year but fell by 28 percent in the
public sector.

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Voice Recorder Indicates Cabin Fire Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The cockpit voice recorder
recovered from the wreckage of ValuJet Flight 592 indicated that
there was a fire in the passenger cabin before the plane
nose-dived into the Florida Everglades on May 11, a senior safety
official said today.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the cockpit door opened, but there were verbal
indications from the cockpit that there was a fire in the
passenger cabin," said Robert Francis, vice chairman of the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
</P>
<P>
"There was also an indication from the cabin that there were
problems obtaining oxygen. Now that is the limit of what we have
at the moment," Francis told a news briefing in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Francis also said that while the tape itself is in good
condition, the information on the tape is very difficult to
decipher. "We just made a very initial look at it by the technical
experts of the NTSB."
</P>
<P>
The cockpit voice recorder was found Sunday, 15 days after the
DC-9 crashed into the swamp, roughly 11 minutes after taking off
from the Miami International Airport on a flight to Atlanta. All
110 people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the plane took off, the crew reported to the ground
air-traffic controllers that there was smoke in the cockpit and
cabin.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found Sunday the aluminum frame of a passenger
seat that was partially melted and heavily damaged by fire,
indicating that flames had reached into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that investigators have focused on the
possibility that the fire was caused by oxygen canisters in the
plane's front cargo hold underneath the cabin.
</P>
<P>
The plane was carrying 119 oxygen canisters to the airline's
headquarters in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Violations by RUF Rebels in Sierra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Information and Broadcasting
Minister George Banda Thomas disclosed Monday that the Sierra
Leone authorities have ''singled out''three major ceasefire
violations by th Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in the south of
the country in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The minister documented the violations as occurring in Sahn
Malen in Bo district, Sumbuya in Pujehun district and Mattru Jong
in Bonthe district.
</P>
<P>
He did not give dates but journalists reached in Bo in the
south said the violations took place in the past three weeks
resulting in the deaths of over 100 civilians.
</P>
<P>
He told pressmen the Sierra Leonean government delegation at
the peace talks in Yamasoukro have been mandated to bring the
violations to the notice of the RUF and to urge them to take
every step to ensure that the ceasefire is observed.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured pressmen that ''within 24 hours or 48
hours, the final draft of the peace agreement will be ready.''
</P>
<P>
He said that contrary to speculations, the final draft is
''unlikely to contain any requirement for an interim government
or any power sharing arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
''But nothing stops the two delegations from considering the
setting up of a broad-based advisory group,'' Banda Thomas added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the press ''to share the cautious optimism of
government with regards to the peace process '' and ''to refrain
from doing anything that may breed speculations.'' enditem

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslims Ban Access to Mass Graves of Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Muslims have prevented
Serb representatives to reach the site of mass graves of Serbs in
the Muslim-controlled western towns of Sanski Most and Petrovac, a
Serb official said today.
</P>
<P>
Nedeljko Savic, chairman of the Exchanges Commission of the
First Krajina Corps of the Serb Army, said in the Serb city of
Banja Luka that the exhumation of the graves should have begun on
May 23 to be ended by June 26, but the ban to the access has made
the exhumation difficult, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Serbs exhumated two mass graves in the central
Bosnian town of Mrkonic Grad, digging up 181 Serb bodies, most of
them civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-Croat side admitted that there existed 47 mass
graves in western Bosnia and 94 mass graves in the whole country,
said Savic.
</P>
<P>
But he estimated that much more mass graves were existing
because some of the areas had not yet been either accessible or
explored.
</P>
<P>
International factors had been insufficiently engaged in
extending assistance concerning the exhumation of these mass
graves, he complained.
</P>
<P>
Without their participation it was impossible to determine even
an approximate number of Serbs being killed or missing in Bosnia,
Savic said.
</P>
<P>
He said that only the most responsible international mediators,
such as High Representative Carl Bildt, could force the Muslims to
apply the part of the Dayton agreement relating to the release of
imprisoned Serbs and the finding out of the fate of the missing
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Savic said a preliminary estimate showed that 1,300 Serb
soldiers and 800 civilians were missing during the civil war but
the figures could be higher.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a peace Implementation Force (IFOR) spokesman said
today in Sarajevo that a group of Serbs in the northwestern
Bosnian town of Prijedor stoned a bus-load of Muslim women trying
to enter the Serb town Sunday, injuring two Muslim women slightly.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs also attacked an IFOR patrol and an observation post,
forcing the IFOR soldiers to withdraw to prevent further
confrontation, spokesman Maj. Herve Gourmelon said.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR has lodged a protest to the Serb officials in Prijedor
over the incident, he added.

<HEADLINE> Barge Ruptures, Spills Oil in Houston Ship Channel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It was just going down the channel and it buckled," the
Associated Press quoted Coast Guard Lt. Emile Benard as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two of the barge's 12 compartments ruptured and other tanks
might be damaged, Benard said. The two tanks held about 5,000
barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
Winds were pushing the spill inland, away from environmentally
sensitive Atkinson Island.
</P>
<P>
Cleanup crews rushed oil skimmer boats into place on Galveston
Bay today to contain the five-mile slick.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all traffic into and out of the ship channel was halted
to give way to the cleanup, which also affected Memorial Day
recreational boating in the popular Clear Lake area, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The damaged barge is owned by Houston-based Buffalo Marine
Service Inc. Two months ago, another barge of the company buckled
and spilled more than 5,000 barrels of fuel oil into Galveston
Bay.
